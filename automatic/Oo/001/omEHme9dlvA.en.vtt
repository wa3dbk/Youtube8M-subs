00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.490
 Hi everyone, I'm like the singers in this video. demonstrate how it is 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.520
 simple in don't have to pay per click 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.100
 or these schemes that allow you to earn a few cents with the 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.389
 own blog and site 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.209
 because cats and now will have to show them 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.329
 really 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.189
 simple but allows you to earn very interesting figures that you can 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.589
 arrive up to 3000 euros per month 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.899
 to do this 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.319
 we need 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:32.870
 d below in a fairly visited blog porn movie 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.460
 therefore prohibited 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 I mean from the indexes 1000 visits up 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.570
 + visit we have highest straguadagno 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.520
 consider who is the winner of tivoli 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.580
 from the cin 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.750
 q from 5 to 10 cents 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.350
 then entering an average of 7 cents 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.300
 why visits open new photos if instead of 70 euros 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.340
 let's see the German altar task and this technique 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.730
 pre start to earn in this there 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.430
 ok here we are 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.250
 could not acquire the bb and or directly with a soft air because 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.050
 this time some problems anyway 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.020
 I hope that the quality will be enough to understand how to implement this 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.810
 technique 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.890
 then first we have to distract ourselves to a site that offers 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.700
 a pay per click is a site that allows us to spy on advertising 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.530
 padania 10 above 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.869
 I'm not going to say any interest in not advertising but how many why and 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.330
 all it takes is a very simple and celina on gugol to find swimming pools 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.330
 of these services 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.920
 then - any writing 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.970
 via one of these services I recommend that you first check that 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 page really the gains that has not been broken. 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.410
 we must center to write code that allows for 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.020
 since you are twitter an apology a click and unauthorized in the wet 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.910
 to do this 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.119
 we can write meridian wells in php 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.119
 I'm here with the jet file ready 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:22.069
 I don't show you the code for obvious reasons so much to write very simple 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.659
 I will explain to you what your code will do 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.659
 and by studying a little bit you can make it for you too 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.430
 this written here in this little code 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.579
 the elf in such a way that 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.069
 lara generates a number 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.690
 a random number dancing 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.419
 from 1 to 10 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:45.189
 this number former superior monks programs chosen in my case 7 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:47.579
 the user 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.969
 is redirected 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.719
 allen then 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.869
 some bread 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.969
 that is, it's like if you click on the banner 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:57.990
 in this way 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.339
 the system that 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.909
 and will pay us 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.149
 dinner bye bye click 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.379
 will think that the user rents first 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.630
 pressed on advertising and here my money seems to me to be credited 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.370
 sea ​​effect not from 5 to 10 cents per click 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.990
 this code here we can certainly not in what becomes our worst 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.560
 because otherwise when a user 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.660
 is chosen as a victim 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.570
 via nassa technique instead of visualizing sinusitis vera bisoli theater 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.429
 advertising and we don't want this 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:39.209
 how to do then to remedy this simple problem of mass media 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.789
 winfrey ma 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.899
 polyphemus is a line of code 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:49.409
 thanks to which age a bench can be created within a few words 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.729
 word page 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.139
 play3eye - recall of a pixel for a pixel no one will see anything 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.859
 but actually inside this 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.459
 pixel by pixel 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.369
 it will be 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:02.699
 olympian who was addressed 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:03.749
 to the page 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.109
 php where there is this script that allows you to 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:09.149
 &amp; hearts 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.220
 to gain 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.479
 that is 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.639
 other problem 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.259
 pay per click boot systems 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.909
 they could come ask him for a link from the name and we don't think about 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.599
 a page maybe external maybe not so cold ones gain .php or something 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.409
 similar 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.279
 to overcome this problem not 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:36.050
 there is nothing simpler 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.800
 burn a system a system 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.250
 that inail link of origin 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.879
 how many steps I take a search on 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:44.940
 on bubolar 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.980
 hey of these services there are dozens of them if you know how to program - you can 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.980
 do you also in php in 10 minutes 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.909
 at this point we will go into non-fur 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:58.969
 the iframe 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.169
 and on a visit indeed 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.400
 for all tickets they will exceed the numbers chosen by us 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.719
 the 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.719
 in what year as if they cut you on advertising 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.800
 so we don't realize that we love 1000 visits 1000 visits 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.939
 if all picasso advertising would be 70 euros 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.830
 now we have them click I don't know 50% is already too much 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.089
 let's take it 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.740
 30% 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.340
 those 300 visits 312 b2 multiplied by an average of 7 cents are at 21 euros 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.340
 daily 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.240
 if you own 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.150
 of the sites that can be much of scatigna 1 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.220
 clear around 4500 daily visits 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.900
 you could do 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.819
 approximately 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.830
 1500 2000 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.889
 so let's do 2000 perfect cents and I'm not sure if you read us 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.419
 140 euros 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.419
 we multiply 140 euros for a month 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.550
 4,200 euros a month which are not few 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.830
 I am in all this of course 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:21.400
 It can not be done 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.219
 yes, it can be done 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.469
 villas and systems engineers 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.280
 he discovers me systems of favorites that discover this trick 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.430
 they will throw me out of the connected system with the relative deletion of the 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.309
 bill 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:41.559
 d consumption with the Latin erasing of all zeroes, cumulative mechanics 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:45.189
 for shopping not there 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:48.220
 make you discover we have never liked them 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.780
 could you encrypt the iframe or anyway task on the floor in any way 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.069
 techniques that 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:57.069
 obviously in this video I will not be able to illustrate 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:03.210
 be very careful what you do for who it is 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.210
 technical expenses cannot be implemented as you can see if they find me I can 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.210
 unsubscribe 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.210
 the count elia gerardi. the profit 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:17.219
 and that therefore istanbul the choice 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:20.510
 in which what you do I do not consider myself responsible 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.740
 in whatever one may be 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.389
 to conclude 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.729
 I send you bread block the stdout merchants 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:30.820
 thank you all for watching
