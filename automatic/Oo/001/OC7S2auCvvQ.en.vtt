00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.189
 [Music] 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.000
 [Applause] 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.679

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.860
 a person also introduces you to 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.290
 my pressure gun made from 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.020
 a vehicular instinct 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.590
 so this is our weapon already finished 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.440
 we used the 26 cm fire extinguisher 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.330
 in length by seven in diameter 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.940
 here we see at the bottom doing 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.630
 a drill and insert here a 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.590
 valve used in the camera 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.520
 motorcycle to reinforce we use 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.400
 here glue is porks through the inside 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.550
 said she has this black tube in the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:04.990
 It was a bank about 25 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:09.520
 centimeters on the outside and it was 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.530
 made a pouch for coplac aluminum 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.530
 50cm long 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:47.680
 the tube was made of wood and 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:55.360
 of the box to do the reinforcement is done 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:57.670
 from simple 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.670
 the project is placed that from the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 ipvc folks take it out just embedded 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:19.530
 in the project was made from 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:19.530
 use the attached photos 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.950
 we made the mold from a 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:31.980
 key philips and the idea we have a stranger 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.410
 the mold was made into a plasterboard 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.319
 We clean it, we screw it here, we trim it. 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.709
 the edges so that this project can 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.290
 be inserted into the aluminum tube 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.790
 the tube that will show you how it is 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.180
 made the charge for you now 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.060
 How do I charge hands? 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.610
 project from the moment of retention 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.700
 Here already retreated aluminum tube 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.650
 is connected to the second black turn of 20 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.910
 centimeters 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.500
 simply we will introduce here 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:20.350
 on the bottom of the tube 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:27.690
 in this way it is almost ready 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.690
 to carry out about eight shots 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:48.690
 is fully recovering from the 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.039
 own 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.900
 charging is done from the 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.590
 connecting the aluminum tube with a tube 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.590
 of 20 centimeters 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.810
 Ok, here we go with our room. 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.099
 pressure form 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.639
 we will load a project inserted in the 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.639
 back part 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:38.330
 custom braked 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:39.830
 unless triggers a locked performed 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.200
 next says to the goal now is 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.620
 hitting aluminum can is full of 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.730
 Water 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:50.780
 Let's go and get caught. 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:55.700
 Let's make a project inserted in the 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:06:05.950
 fitting the tube 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:05.950
 now 5 4 3 2 1 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:30.490
 the projectile passed through the mother very 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:31.810
 powerful managed to cross can 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.090
 easily 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.710
 my goal now is to break that 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.800
 bottle of beer to see if we 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.800
 can 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:57.630
 locking 5 4 3 2 1 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.080
 a lock fired perfect
