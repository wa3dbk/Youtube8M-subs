now<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.379> may<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> fanciest

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
now this may not be the fanciest

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.189 
now this may not be the fanciest
technique<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:18.029> what<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> will<00:00:18.480> say<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.109> that

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
technique but what I will say is that

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
technique but what I will say is that
this<00:00:19.619> specific<00:00:19.800> point<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.029> carry<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
this specific point is going to carry a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.640 
this specific point is going to carry a
great<00:00:21.510> influence<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.350> trying<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
great influence for what we're trying to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.279 
great influence for what we're trying to
look<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:22.859> now<00:00:23.670> working<00:00:24.210> with<00:00:24.240> clients<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
look for now working with clients and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.929 
look for now working with clients and
athletes<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.039> general<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.490> found<00:00:26.760> a

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
athletes in general I found a

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.970 
athletes in general I found a
commonality<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.750> because<00:00:28.199> they<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.769> not

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
commonality that because they are not

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.769 
commonality that because they are not
capable<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.670> operating<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.359> their<00:00:30.480> first

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
functional hip extension going from here

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
functional hip extension going from here
to<00:00:33.149> here<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:34.230> they<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.500> some<00:00:34.680> kind<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to here because they have some kind of a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
to here because they have some kind of a
hip<00:00:35.190> flexor<00:00:35.550> restriction<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.270> their<00:00:36.630> body

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
hip flexor restriction that their body

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.049 
hip flexor restriction that their body
bypasses<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.680> first<00:00:38.129> function<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.820> going

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
bypasses that first function of going

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.540 
bypasses that first function of going
here<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.809> moves<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.500> directly<00:00:41.430> in

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
here and then moves on and directly in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.900 
here and then moves on and directly in
the<00:00:41.640> hyperextension<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:44.070> result<00:00:44.670> what

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the hyperextension and as a result what

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.279 
the hyperextension and as a result what
the<00:00:45.000> body<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.450> does<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:45.989> we're<00:00:46.140> in

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the body then does because we're in

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.380 
the body then does because we're in
hyperextension<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.640> begin<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> create

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
hyperextension it could begin to create

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.680 
hyperextension it could begin to create
this<00:00:49.170> whole<00:00:49.610> lateral<00:00:50.610> movement<00:00:51.270> pattern

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
this whole lateral movement pattern

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.810 
this whole lateral movement pattern
whenever<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.530> person<00:00:52.800> begins<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.370> move

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
whenever a person begins to move

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.580 
whenever a person begins to move
so<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.660> always<00:00:54.750> think<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> rule<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> thumb

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so just always think as a rule of thumb

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.049 
so just always think as a rule of thumb
for<00:00:56.039> most<00:00:56.489> people<00:00:56.760> who<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:56.910> in

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
for most people who are in

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.939 
for most people who are in
hyperextension<00:00:57.960> they're<00:00:58.410> typically<00:00:58.770> going

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
hyperextension they're typically going

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.279 
hyperextension they're typically going
to<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.190> lot<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> lateral<00:00:59.969> movement<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.719> as

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
to have a lot of lateral movement and as

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.660 
to have a lot of lateral movement and as
another<00:01:01.620> rule<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.980> thumb<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.399> want<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
another rule of thumb what I want you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
another rule of thumb what I want you
guys<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.840> efficient

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
guys to think about that that efficient

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.859 
guys to think about that that efficient
biomechanics<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.850> when<00:01:06.840> I'm

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
biomechanics are going to be when I'm

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.359 
biomechanics are going to be when I'm
moving<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> let's<00:01:08.310> say

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
moving here and I'm going to let's say

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.280 
moving here and I'm going to let's say
if<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> run<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.750> my<00:01:09.960> legs

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
if I was going to run that my legs

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.649 
if I was going to run that my legs
should<00:01:10.710> move<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> sagittal<00:01:11.549> plane<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.570> if

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
should move in the sagittal plane so if

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.800 
should move in the sagittal plane so if
you<00:01:12.750> guys<00:01:12.869> were<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.290> me<00:01:13.439> run<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.979> walk

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
you guys were to see me run or walk

that lateral flexion and there's going

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.350 
that lateral flexion and there's going
to<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.340> specific<00:01:41.880> point<00:01:42.060> where<00:01:42.270> they're

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to be one specific point where they're

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.730 
to be one specific point where they're
going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> lot<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> carrying<00:01:43.619> the

through their gait cycle whenever
they're<00:01:46.860> running<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.729> specific<00:01:48.149> point

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
they're running and that specific point

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
they're running and that specific point
is<00:01:48.479> that'll<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.750> about<00:01:48.930> right<00:01:49.259> here<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.710> about

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
is that'll be about right here at about

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.999 
is that'll be about right here at about
45<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.030> 45<00:01:51.780> degree<00:01:52.140> angle<00:01:52.380> off<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.799> thigh

45 to 45 degree angle off of the thigh

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.740 
45 to 45 degree angle off of the thigh
we're<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.759> looking<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
we're going to be looking at what the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.469 
we're going to be looking at what the
greater<00:01:55.320> trochanter<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> femur<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
greater trochanter of the femur and that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
greater trochanter of the femur and that
specific<00:01:58.079> point<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.189> takes<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.490> great

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
specific point is one that takes a great

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.130 
specific point is one that takes a great
deal

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
deal

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.660 
deal
attention<00:02:00.470> when<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.620> person<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.070> walking<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
attention when a person is walking and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.090 
attention when a person is walking and
I've<00:02:02.150> worked<00:02:02.360> this<00:02:02.720> with<00:02:02.960> many<00:02:03.170> people<00:02:03.560> as<00:02:03.740> I

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
I've worked this with many people as I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.219 
I've worked this with many people as I
assess<00:02:04.729> their<00:02:04.880> gait<00:02:05.090> cycle<00:02:05.270> where<00:02:05.870> I<00:02:05.900> can<00:02:06.110> see

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
assess their gait cycle where I can see

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.529 
assess their gait cycle where I can see
a<00:02:06.260> great<00:02:06.500> transfer<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.220> energy<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.940> person

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
a great transfer of energy as a person

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.180 
a great transfer of energy as a person
begins<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.959> land<00:02:09.200> or<00:02:09.470> even<00:02:09.679> as<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.800> person

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
begins to land or even as a person

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.980 
begins to land or even as a person
begins<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.550> run<00:02:10.759> although<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.660> great

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
begins to run although this is a great

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.540 
begins to run although this is a great
transfer<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.770> tension<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.370> goes

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
transfer of tension that goes

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.670 
transfer of tension that goes
specifically<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.390> spot<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.290> we're<00:02:15.560> going

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
specifically to this spot so we're going

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.500 
specifically to this spot so we're going
to<00:02:15.740> try<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:15.950> do<00:02:16.100> right<00:02:16.280> now<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.700> get<00:02:17.180> into<00:02:17.390> this

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
to try and do right now is get into this

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.050 
to try and do right now is get into this
area<00:02:17.750> zero<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.650> spot<00:02:18.980> release<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.910> so

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
area zero in on that spot release it so

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.610 
area zero in on that spot release it so
that<00:02:20.209> way<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.390> deficiency<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.350> then<00:02:21.500> be

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
that way that deficiency can then be

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.380 
that way that deficiency can then be
released<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.370> then<00:02:22.520> hopefully<00:02:23.090> we'll<00:02:23.209> be<00:02:23.330> able

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
released so then hopefully we'll be able

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.120 
released so then hopefully we'll be able
to<00:02:23.510> get<00:02:23.660> better<00:02:23.810> gluteal<00:02:24.350> activation<00:02:24.950> and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
to get better gluteal activation and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.220 
to get better gluteal activation and
just<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.370> general<00:02:25.640> better<00:02:26.270> my<00:02:26.450> biomechanics

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
just a general better my biomechanics

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.870 
just a general better my biomechanics

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
through the body now keep in mind this

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.810 
with the tensor fasciae latae release
either<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.920> tensor<00:02:58.190> fasciae<00:02:58.430> latae<00:02:58.550> is

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
either the tensor fasciae latae is

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.860 
either the tensor fasciae latae is
actually<00:02:59.030> going<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.209> be<00:02:59.300> all<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.600> way<00:02:59.630> up<00:02:59.720> here

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
actually going to be all the way up here

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.080 
actually going to be all the way up here
so<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.769> guys<00:03:00.920> will<00:03:01.070> see<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.550> don't<00:03:01.940> want

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
so you guys will see that I don't want

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.520 
so you guys will see that I don't want
the<00:03:02.150> TfL<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.930> be<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.140> one<00:03:03.260> getting<00:03:03.500> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
the TfL to be the one getting the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.410 
the TfL to be the one getting the
pressure<00:03:04.130> here<00:03:04.400> we're<00:03:04.820> going<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.000> drop<00:03:05.209> this

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
pressure here we're going to drop this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.350 
pressure here we're going to drop this
down<00:03:05.690> maybe<00:03:06.410> about<00:03:06.769> a<00:03:07.040> half<00:03:07.310> foot<00:03:07.820> half<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.269> a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
down maybe about a half foot half of a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.150 
down maybe about a half foot half of a
foot<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:08.780> we're<00:03:09.260> going<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.410> look<00:03:09.590> right<00:03:09.920> at

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
foot and we're going to look right at

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.110 
foot and we're going to look right at
that<00:03:10.280> point<00:03:10.340> you're<00:03:10.640> going<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.820> make<00:03:10.910> me<00:03:10.970> feel

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
that point you're going to make me feel

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.880 
that point you're going to make me feel
like<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.269> bone<00:03:11.570> on<00:03:11.720> your<00:03:11.840> thigh<00:03:12.019> like<00:03:12.709> we're

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
like a bone on your thigh like we're

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.190 
like a bone on your thigh like we're
just<00:03:12.950> right<00:03:13.250> up<00:03:13.340> there<00:03:13.489> at<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.390> at<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.900> upper

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
just right up there at that at the upper

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.870 
just right up there at that at the upper
region<00:03:15.530> that's<00:03:15.890> going<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.130> be<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.280> greater

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
region that's going to be the greater

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.190 
region that's going to be the greater
trochanter<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.600> femur<00:03:17.660> you're<00:03:18.019> going<00:03:18.140> to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
trochanter of the femur you're going to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.500 
trochanter of the femur you're going to
get<00:03:18.320> slightly<00:03:19.130> below<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.790> specific<00:03:20.329> point

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
get slightly below that specific point

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.390 
get slightly below that specific point
and<00:03:20.810> that's<00:03:21.380> where<00:03:21.560> you're<00:03:21.650> going<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.130> apply

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
and that's where you're going to apply

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.340 
and that's where you're going to apply
the<00:03:22.459> pressure<00:03:22.820> as<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.180> guys<00:03:23.840> will<00:03:23.989> notice<00:03:24.140> I'm

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
the pressure as you guys will notice I'm

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.870 
the pressure as you guys will notice I'm
actually<00:03:24.500> using<00:03:24.829> a<00:03:25.070> tennis<00:03:25.430> ball<00:03:25.610> right<00:03:25.850> now

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
actually using a tennis ball right now

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.449 
actually using a tennis ball right now
for<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:26.750> specifically<00:03:27.290> because<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.950> don't

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
for this specifically because I don't

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.710 
for this specifically because I don't
want<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.850> guys<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.060> go<00:03:29.329> straight<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.690> a

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
want you guys to go straight to a

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.390 
want you guys to go straight to a
lacrosse<00:03:30.049> ball<00:03:30.410> in<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:30.620> circumstance<00:03:31.160> the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
lacrosse ball in this circumstance the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.310 
lacrosse ball in this circumstance the
reason<00:03:31.940> is<00:03:32.090> because<00:03:32.329> this<00:03:32.540> area<00:03:32.870> tends<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.200> be

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
reason is because this area tends to be

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.530 
reason is because this area tends to be
very<00:03:33.560> tender<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.130> most<00:03:34.760> people<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.239> minute<00:03:35.390> I

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
very tender and most people the minute I

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.030 
very tender and most people the minute I
even<00:03:35.750> just<00:03:35.870> apply<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.200> slight<00:03:36.560> bit<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.799> pressure

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
even just apply a slight bit of pressure

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.460 
even just apply a slight bit of pressure
they<00:03:37.579> almost<00:03:37.850> start<00:03:38.030> screaming<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:38.570> on<00:03:39.049> your

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
they almost start screaming so on your

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.900 
they almost start screaming so on your
end<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:40.130> think<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.400> when<00:03:40.549> you're<00:03:40.670> applying

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
end just think that when you're applying

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.340 
end just think that when you're applying
pressure<00:03:41.209> on<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.600> it's<00:03:41.900> going<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.049> be<00:03:42.170> very

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
pressure on this it's going to be very

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.319 
pressure on this it's going to be very
tender<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.890> may<00:03:43.100> be<00:03:43.160> smart<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.940> start<00:03:44.180> off

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
tender and it may be smart to start off

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.509 
tender and it may be smart to start off
with<00:03:44.690> something<00:03:44.870> softer<00:03:45.380> we'll<00:03:46.100> switch<00:03:46.280> sides

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
with something softer we'll switch sides

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.580 
with something softer we'll switch sides
again<00:03:50.320> 45<00:03:51.320> degree<00:03:51.560> angle<00:03:51.890> off<00:03:52.070> of<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.610> thigh<00:03:52.790> I

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
again 45 degree angle off of the thigh I

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.110 
again 45 degree angle off of the thigh I
lay<00:03:54.590> my<00:03:54.799> body<00:03:55.040> flat<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.670> floor<00:03:55.940> as<00:03:56.090> you

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
lay my body flat to the floor as you

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.580 
lay my body flat to the floor as you
guys<00:03:56.329> can<00:03:56.450> see<00:03:56.510> right<00:03:56.780> now<00:03:56.810> that's<00:03:57.380> going<00:03:57.530> to

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
guys can see right now that's going to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.930 
guys can see right now that's going to
allow<00:03:57.739> me<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.950> suspend<00:03:58.280> my<00:03:58.430> leg<00:03:58.640> off<00:03:58.820> the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
allow me to suspend my leg off the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.979 
allow me to suspend my leg off the
ground<00:03:59.859> and<00:04:00.859> I<00:04:01.459> keep<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:01.790> pressure<00:04:02.060> at<00:04:02.450> about

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
ground and I keep that pressure at about

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.190 
ground and I keep that pressure at about
that<00:04:03.200> region<00:04:04.570> now<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.630> can<00:04:05.870> move<00:04:05.989> it<00:04:06.140> around

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
that region now you can move it around

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.810 
that region now you can move it around
slightly<00:04:06.890> I<00:04:06.920> wouldn't<00:04:07.280> move<00:04:07.340> in<00:04:07.519> more<00:04:07.700> than

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
slightly I wouldn't move in more than

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.540 
slightly I wouldn't move in more than
half<00:04:07.880> inch

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
half inch

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.610 
half inch
increments<00:04:09.060> as<00:04:09.270> I'm<00:04:09.600> here<00:04:12.200> I'll<00:04:13.200> move<00:04:13.440> it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
increments as I'm here I'll move it

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.560 
increments as I'm here I'll move it
slightly<00:04:13.860> back<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.280> forth<00:04:14.730> giving<00:04:15.330> that

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
slightly back and forth giving that

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.699 
slightly back and forth giving that
cross<00:04:15.840> friction<00:04:16.110> on<00:04:16.410> there<00:04:18.290> now<00:04:19.290> just<00:04:19.320> take

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
cross friction on there now just take

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.440 
cross friction on there now just take
that<00:04:19.830> this<00:04:20.010> region<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.519> going<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.760> have<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.910> lot

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
that this region is going to have a lot

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.270 
that this region is going to have a lot
of<00:04:21.480> neurological<00:04:22.170> load<00:04:22.350> when<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.830> train<00:04:23.130> my

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
of neurological load when I train my

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.400 
of neurological load when I train my
clients<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:23.850> train<00:04:24.090> my<00:04:24.240> athletes<00:04:24.690> anytime

clients and I train my athletes anytime

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.190 
clients and I train my athletes anytime
I<00:04:25.560> get<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:25.860> there<00:04:26.070> I'd<00:04:26.430> say<00:04:26.700> maybe

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
I get in there I'd say maybe

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.120 
I get in there I'd say maybe
three-quarters<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.410> time<00:04:28.620> I'll<00:04:28.920> have<00:04:29.070> a

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
three-quarters of the time I'll have a

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.370 
three-quarters of the time I'll have a
person<00:04:29.700> sit<00:04:30.480> there<00:04:30.660> though<00:04:30.780> obviously<00:04:31.260> it'll

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
person sit there though obviously it'll

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.750 
person sit there though obviously it'll
be<00:04:31.500> very<00:04:31.680> uncomfortable<00:04:31.980> but<00:04:32.400> then<00:04:32.520> I'll<00:04:32.610> see

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
be very uncomfortable but then I'll see

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.270 
be very uncomfortable but then I'll see
the<00:04:32.850> muscles<00:04:33.240> start<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:33.990> do<00:04:34.200> this<00:04:34.410> which<00:04:34.980> to<00:04:35.160> me

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
the muscles start to do this which to me

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.560 
the muscles start to do this which to me
is<00:04:35.430> communicating<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.090> there's<00:04:36.270> some<00:04:36.390> kind

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
is communicating that there's some kind

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.600 
is communicating that there's some kind
of<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:36.720> neurological<00:04:37.350> dependency<00:04:37.920> found
