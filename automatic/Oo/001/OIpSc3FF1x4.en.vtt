you know Robin that soup really is very

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.350 
you know Robin that soup really is very
salty<00:00:59.090> and<00:00:59.480> salt<00:01:00.350> or<00:01:00.680> sodium<00:01:00.980> is<00:01:01.550> one<00:01:02.120> thing

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
salty and salt or sodium is one thing

out for every day exactly and this is

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.040 
out for every day exactly and this is
why<00:01:06.979> I<00:01:07.010> created<00:01:07.310> an<00:01:07.580> entire<00:01:07.940> chapter<00:01:08.360> of<00:01:08.750> soups
