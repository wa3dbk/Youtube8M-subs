00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.859
 good afternoon friends with you andrew 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:13.950
 continue to repair it 1 cycle all 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:19.190
 inputs 500a and you see mean 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.190
 already disassembled 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:27.590
 handbrake or parking brake 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 call it what you want, so I took it apart 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.340
 laid out in the order in which I will 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.719
 collect here the adjusting bolt 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.100
 adjusting bolt that adjusts 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:45.230
 Kolodochka snuggling means this one himself 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.230
 caliper I completely disassembled it 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.440
 quite a lot of it was dirt on 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.449
 fastened adjusting bolt stuck 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.129
 rusted and I pulled it of course with 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.780
 by the pond 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:06.150
 then we will install this zhinka 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:13.590
 plate which will be spring loaded 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:17.759
 pads here pads means next we 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.509
 insert and into these holes and here in these 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.259
 holes zabem set stud 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:35.030
 canary and the safety control these confrontations 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:38.150
 nuts are not nuts law will ring 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:45.350
 so here are the pads I put these 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.350
 see the catalog number on these pads 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.390
 what will you play will be approximately in such 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.890
 I recommend the sequences also 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.280
 make grease all these details except 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.349
 Of course , the mask will be 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:13.810
 move because as soon as I do with 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:16.260
 boil and rust immediately brake 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.459
 stop working 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.209
 Of course, you can do without him, but 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.910
 since the quad was going over 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.500
 would make everything ok well that's expensive 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.560
 Friend the manual handbrake 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.930
 practically assembled 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.530
 only this 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:44.950
 rings set no problem 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.530
 still I subtract the boat inserted maybe 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.470
 The only nuance that you have when installing 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.709
 the springs that's under the pads I'm here 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.510
 did not show try carefully 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.930
 see when you disassemble to 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.930
 do not confuse 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:07.769
 edges of this spring should be here 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.769
 in these places clogged up up 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:16.989
 set the studs set the studs and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:24.549
 now put them rings for contour 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:29.760
 lest they bolt out 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:34.269
 adjusting and all neatly 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.739
 smeared now everything turned out then we will 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:42.549
 work all the best for new meetings 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.669
 with you was andrew watch my channel and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:49.739
 you will know about cf moto quad 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.739
 pure then almost everything
