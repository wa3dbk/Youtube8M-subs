00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
I'm not going to do it right now because

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.499 
I'm not going to do it right now because
I<00:01:45.360> already<00:01:45.689> did<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.320> save<00:01:46.890> some<00:01:47.070> time<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:48.390> you

that your computer lags the most is not
when<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.520> import<00:02:06.439> at<00:02:07.439> first<00:02:07.770> or<00:02:08.039> when<00:02:08.429> you

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
when you import at first or when you

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.619 
when you import at first or when you
render<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.060> actually<00:02:09.360> when<00:02:09.479> it's

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
render it's actually when it's

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.839 
render it's actually when it's
generating<00:02:10.259> thumbnails<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
generating thumbnails so you're going to

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.059 
generating thumbnails so you're going to
see<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.180> when<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.420> import<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> video

see that when you import a video

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.399 
see that when you import a video
it's<00:02:14.849> going<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.480> import<00:02:15.719> her<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.019> after<00:02:16.290> it's

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
it's going to import her but after it's

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's going to import her but after it's
going<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.620> create<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:16.950> thumbnails<00:02:17.370> where<00:02:17.939> the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
after that is Shana I just add a bit

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.370 
after that is Shana I just add a bit
more<00:04:51.030> professional<00:04:51.240> list<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:51.930> make<00:04:52.260> your

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
video look better you just got to go to

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.850

here

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
here

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.610 
here
it's<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.580> before<00:04:56.940> last<00:04:57.180> kind<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.930> square<00:04:58.350> and

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
it's the before last kind of square and

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.660 
it's the before last kind of square and
you<00:04:58.950> want<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.160> choose<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.340> transition

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
you want to choose a transition

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.760 
you want to choose a transition
basically<00:05:00.360> what<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.480> transition<00:05:01.140> does<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.560> as

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
basically what a transition does is as

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.490 
basically what a transition does is as
it<00:05:02.580> says<00:05:02.880> it's<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.450> transition<00:05:03.990> between<00:05:04.140> both

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
it says it's a transition between both

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.440 
it says it's a transition between both
Clips<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:04.980> that<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.280> doesn't<00:05:05.580> like<00:05:05.730> it's<00:05:06.240> not

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
Clips so that it doesn't like it's not

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.080 
Clips so that it doesn't like it's not
rough<00:05:07.080> it's<00:05:07.440> not<00:05:07.650> like<00:05:07.890> hard<00:05:08.550> on<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:08.970> eyes

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
rough it's not like hard on the eyes

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.060 
rough it's not like hard on the eyes
when<00:05:09.390> you<00:05:09.480> watch<00:05:09.630> it<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:10.080> I'm<00:05:10.680> just<00:05:10.740> going<00:05:10.980> to

select I don't know fight no cross the
cell<00:05:14.070> which<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.430> simplest<00:05:14.910> one<00:05:15.180> I'm<00:05:15.750> just

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
cell which is the simplest one I'm just

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.480 
cell which is the simplest one I'm just
going<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.080> insert<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.560> between<00:05:16.740> both<00:05:17.130> clips

I'm just going to play it and you see

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.210 
I'm just going to play it and you see

it's smooth so if you want to change the

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.030 
it's smooth so if you want to change the
length<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:25.260> transition<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:25.950> have

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
length of the of the transition you have

those<00:06:12.750> who<00:06:12.810> don't<00:06:13.370> really<00:06:14.370> know<00:06:14.490> this<00:06:14.820> kind<00:06:15.000> of

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
those who don't really know this kind of

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.510 
those who don't really know this kind of
program<00:06:15.510> basically<00:06:16.080> your<00:06:16.680> project<00:06:17.160> is<00:06:17.310> not

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
program basically your project is not

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.700 
program basically your project is not
done<00:06:17.880> right<00:06:18.090> here<00:06:18.270> basically<00:06:18.600> you<00:06:19.020> just<00:06:19.380> put

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
done right here basically you just put

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.950 
done right here basically you just put
different<00:06:20.040> things<00:06:20.370> together<00:06:21.030> but<00:06:21.810> now<00:06:21.900> you

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
different things together but now you

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.570 
different things together but now you
have<00:06:22.140> to<00:06:22.260> export<00:06:22.620> it<00:06:22.770> but<00:06:22.950> basically

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
have to export it but basically

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.760 
have to export it but basically
exporting<00:06:24.300> does<00:06:24.510> is<00:06:24.720> that<00:06:24.900> it<00:06:25.110> puts<00:06:25.290> all<00:06:25.530> these

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
exporting does is that it puts all these

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.460 
exporting does is that it puts all these
three<00:06:26.130> things<00:06:26.400> together<00:06:26.660> the<00:06:27.660> title<00:06:28.200> the

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
three things together the title the

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.250 
three things together the title the
transition<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.300> the<00:06:30.300> club<00:06:30.570> it<00:06:30.750> all<00:06:30.900> puts<00:06:31.140> them

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
transition and the club it all puts them

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.159 
transition and the club it all puts them
together<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.800> form<00:06:32.040> one<00:06:32.460> video<00:06:33.169> basically

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
together to form one video basically

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.250 
together to form one video basically
it's<00:06:34.320> really<00:06:34.410> simply<00:06:34.860> going<00:06:35.070> to<00:06:35.190> share<00:06:35.460> an

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
it's really simply going to share an

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.570 
it's really simply going to share an
export<00:06:37.260> movie

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
export movie

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.189 
export movie
do<00:06:37.729> not<00:06:37.939> export<00:06:38.419> using<00:06:38.569> Quicktime<00:06:38.780> it's

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
do not export using Quicktime it's

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.689 
do not export using Quicktime it's
really<00:06:39.409> more<00:06:39.560> complicated<00:06:39.740> just<00:06:40.370> go<00:06:40.490> with<00:06:40.580> it

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
really more complicated just go with it

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.059 
really more complicated just go with it
go<00:06:41.090> the<00:06:41.270> easy<00:06:41.479> way<00:06:41.689> here<00:06:42.439> you<00:06:42.560> decide<00:06:42.889> where

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
go the easy way here you decide where

I said about everything that is really
basic<00:07:07.550> about<00:07:07.789> the<00:07:07.969> program<00:07:08.360> if<00:07:08.539> you<00:07:09.050> want<00:07:09.229> to
