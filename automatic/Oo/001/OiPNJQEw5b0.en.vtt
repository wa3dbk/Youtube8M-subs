00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.529
 present a short video that will talk 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.200
 to order his team on dofus so everything 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.029
 first you will create a number of 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.789
 characters that please you so it can be 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.609
 in two beats baudime this from 2 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.320
 years old 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.050
 so I created some simple sheet 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.110
 roddick will break punk to piaget rapsi 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 cause so quickly the tooth we have 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.379
 three pillars so support these are the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 facts only to the screaming and the enemies 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.080
 of which class lépine matter after I have a 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.350
 rocks to global psychosis and a rattle my 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.570
 friend was doing so so I too I 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.190
 two other characters so a gap and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.159
 1 minute rohff waiting for me 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.780
 gutters 154 and the nude trophe and 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:09.260
 level 130 or 127 and more so they 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:14.159
 will allow me later to make me 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.470
 for example to afrik ghost so here 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.050
 here 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.360
 after so for when do you start 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.740
 you will create your team so a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
 number of characters and you 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.910
 have immediately gone people and at 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.230
 hungry sunflowers that are a bit more 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.590
 up there which I think to make an ellipse 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.890
 so you can see what that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.430
 given 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.670
 here it is here is that here is the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.310
 little wild sunflower and so with the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.290
 little war chief a lot of that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.880
 okay so that's it's the first 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.530
 thing that you will do when you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.880
 will come with me team so I'm going 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.290
 not do it because I'm all alone 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.150
 and i have a little laziness of rome all 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.310
 my other characters so here after so 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.340
 from level 10 have donated 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.229
 alternation day up to level 20 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.210
 this is what is pretty fast what 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.190
 is rather fast and rather easy to 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.600
 do it so you can very well 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.090
 continue to level 30 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:18.030
 So that's it after you can very 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.580
 well the sunflower dungeon which co2 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.050
 jean-deschamps forgiveness which in 75 to 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.780
 strubbe and it's boring instruments and 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.820
 it's neutral 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.860
 so here's a lot of cxp so you can 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.989
 see the xp up there is not bad at all 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.750
 so I will not show it to you then 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.300
 so after starting from level 30 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.519
 you will start the dojo so 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.920
 that's it for how xp so 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.209
 now i will explain to you 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.739
 how to mount his characters 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.250
 so how do I ride them months and after 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.250
 it's up to you to decide 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:01.700
 so that will be for my fact so 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.040
 did me the 4 rises crowd wisdom 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.060
 agree with a firewood that will go 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.850
 allow europe it's a very small 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.810
 little more so here it is the stuff has 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:17.730
 kept up to the level up to 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.350
 level as soon as you can already changed 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.720
 with the six-bed alliances but the 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.000
 after Cape dupré speak and all the tralala 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.400
 so that will be in a next video 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.130
 so here's the 35 year old level I'm off 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.650
 not already level 35 do not worry 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.080
 so here is of course the little dofus 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.170
 boat that puts well 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.150
 afterwards with regards to spells every 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.810
 fire luc spells - the lights I mounted 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.970
 after that is all that is mature art I 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.260
 mounts them as you go so people 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.560
 I did not get level 5 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.270
 then another level one and after I 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.380
 several climbs level saint jean done 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.060
 all at the same time like that it's 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.330
 progressive so here after we shout 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.220
 we sacrifice is mounted too fast so 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.250
 here it is full vita so there is no 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.430
 a lot of wisdom and that allows by 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.810
 example of managing the food dungeon 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.959
 quietly because to yes seen that 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.819
 I have some kind of important kama 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.739
 which I can use I was able to buy 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.570
 an emerald dofus and saw him as I am 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.130
 pretty high level gp buy another 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.550
 stuff so that will be for the next 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.240
 time 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.169
 so Ihi crowd vitae for the boom I 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.770
 mounted no spell except attraction because 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.840
 that actually up to level 17 I went up 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.729
 no spell because I was waiting 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.610
 daring punishment dissolution that go 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.270
 really saw a lot for the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.940
 food dungeon 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.669
 so now we're going to go to 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.919
 hurdles during the xelor that I rode crowd 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.410
 that's going to stay crowds that that so 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.849
 of course a fire bock for the anc and gyan 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.849
 is still there small panel 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.410
 the shop not our adventurers in 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.120
 waiting for the lens also the email and 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.520
 the breakdown after this peak and rolls tralala 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.750
 so now 11 at the world ball at 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.940
 values ​​that I mounted crowd wisdom 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.970
 with arnaud fuschia watts 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.729
 of course he is so force always there 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.810
 Adventurer panels and the little pot 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.310
 earth to be able to rock I am +15 or 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.900
 ball it roxx enormously I was coming back to 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.759
 almost thanks to both countries a denial of 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.490
 170 by all that is rather 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.070
 considerable so now we're going 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.699
 pass to the enemy you spoke to there are 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.370
 ten seconds so the nests that orients 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.990
