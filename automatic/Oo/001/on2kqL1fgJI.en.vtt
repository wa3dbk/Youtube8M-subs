introducing Wireless you can introduce

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
introducing Wireless you can introduce
problems<00:00:45.480> unless<00:00:45.810> you<00:00:45.990> have<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.380> most

point<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.860> do<00:01:02.040> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
point don't do that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.890 
point don't do that
they<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:02.970> don't<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.240> that<00:01:03.510> technology

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
they just don't have that technology

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.260 
they just don't have that technology
they<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> threshold<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.090> soon<00:01:06.210> as

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
they have a threshold and as soon as

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
they have a threshold and as soon as
they<00:01:06.390> find<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.720> channel<00:01:06.960> that's<00:01:07.170> above<00:01:07.410> it<00:01:07.560> they

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
they find a channel that's above it they

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740 
they find a channel that's above it they
lock<00:01:08.190> in<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.820> necessarily<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> best<00:01:09.480> one

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
lock in not necessarily the best one

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.120 
lock in not necessarily the best one
just<00:01:10.350> something<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.620> crosses<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just something that crosses the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
just something that crosses the
threshold<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.660> key

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
threshold I know that's a very key

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.630 
threshold I know that's a very key
feature<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> becomes<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.130> big<00:01:14.280> problem

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
feature because it becomes a big problem

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
feature because it becomes a big problem
when<00:01:14.730> you're<00:01:14.850> trying<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> perform<00:01:15.480> at<00:01:15.630> your
