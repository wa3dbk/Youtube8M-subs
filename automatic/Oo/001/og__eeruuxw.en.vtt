00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:02.650
 Hi everyone 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.170
 after letting you see how good Badesi is 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.380
 you insist on saying everything about our paper world that therefore comics 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.719
 magazines and newspapers anything else 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.980
 and today instead I wanted to let you take a look at how well you behave 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.849
 also for what concerns the music 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.960
 who is passionate about music with me surely alone will have appreciated 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.060
 lots of applications that came out but 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.970
 obviously also causes the screen to be a little small 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.669
 we never wanted to 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.940
 happy souls don't even know a little. iasma it that much 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.760
 obviously on this big screen things change in all its 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.519
 apps definitely books and we'll think 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.190
 no name is heard 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.190
 the future will also come out 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.880
 if not professional it does not sum 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.310
 also very powerful 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.660
 fabio volo let you give if for example 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.940
 taste 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.920
 for piano 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.280
 it will never be like a number though 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 I think it can make us have fun 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.240
 even though we are an asd team 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 musulmanesimo this function 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 for 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.660
 Share 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.060
 here we have the octaves can be moved 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060
 you're welcome 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.790
 therefore they can be added almost interfree 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.790
 all the stairs 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.850
 for example 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.990
 however, we could also play this function 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.099
 ater fi 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.969
 % 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.039
 but as you see I am very beautiful 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:41.459
 there are those who, like me, are composing something 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.629
 it never gets bouble 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.919
 it would suit us 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:50.390
 ibiza pc with fantasy is Saturday night - via is traveling 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.769
 egg donation where we are away with a poma of mantua 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.309

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.759
 on the notes and a piano even if fake what we have in mind 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.359
 Imagine how many other applications of synthesis sequencers applications 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.220
 for DJs and so on 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.520
 the future will come out and I must say in short how you see publishing also for music 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.420
 from club translation inserted 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.439
 In my opinion we will see some injuries 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.959
 drawings are at least at this time blocked by this nude cabbage 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.699

 this song 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.069
 to the 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.689

 at most
