00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello continue the selection 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:22.560
 today I wanted to tell you in an environment 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:26.310
 Kraft firms 1300 watts without a vf in general 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:36.690
 such a milling machine 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:39.440
 at 1300 watts as if I were not a carpenter 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.940
 and carpenter 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 for work for me it's above the roof and how 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.969
 never full power 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.800
 It enjoys something scary if 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.110
 Of course the service on the table and there 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 something may be missing mill 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.449
 then how not to question but is there not holding 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.420
 hands 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.670
 for me it's cool well, as if I'm not saying 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.159
 that there is a specialist thousand this is something their 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.030
 This is specifically doing she bought 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:19.490
 specifically under the door and how would people put 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.490
 old boxes buy new doors 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.790
 this cutter to customize 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.170
 under the new canvas 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.170
 old boxes remain 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 so on a frieze adjustment of turns 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:48.340
 power button so power button 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:52.289
 double is obtained if this button here 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.079
 the little one doesn't click on this 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:59.380
 protection system but it does not lock 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.110
 works and does not fix as it were 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:09.459
 reinsurance so as not to press no 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:21.370
 turn on the handle of the bed randomly 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:23.130
 moves on 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.340
 I don't know for the first time 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:32.220
 I probably work for a week , I don't work much 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.220
 and many but she still fell off 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.210
 Of course, a powerful tool for not 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.210
 hindered the playground 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.790
 Especially such they tell nothing for 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.890
 this money I think is a good cutter or 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.510
 I never let me down and I have it already 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:13.250
 year number four or five 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:15.770
 constantly normal worked lace I would 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.690
 did not say that he is soft as it were not 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:25.130
 tough well in any case does not break 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:29.440
 the price was for those times 320 hryvnia 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:33.590
 seems to be buying a set + still fred was 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.050
 which I absolutely do not use in 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.550
 mostly bought other cuts for 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.390
 tie-in locks and pick boxes or 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.459
 cutting the door itself 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:50.150
 canvas to reduce the canvas 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:58.640
 use plaster held two 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:02.180
 clamps note put the cutter is not so 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.290
 that's how it stands here with a roller and 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:12.160
 I let the roller ask for what I understand. 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.450
 the amount of wood the excess door was still 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.700
 limiter but i don't use it 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.700
 so somewhere lying around I don't even know where 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.090
 that's all you need and the frieze craft 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:38.030
 thereâ€™s nothing more to say 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.030
 how much is your vision tool 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.220
 if they are sold on the market then 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:50.930
 you can even look good 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.930
 tool all all bye
