00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.029
 experiment 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.029
 because it shines 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.100
 The materials we use will be 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.019
 flourishes inah 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.000
 water here nothing 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.690
 chlorophyll 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.450
 ultraviolet lamp or in its 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.810
 defect you can also use light 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.810
 black 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.620
 three beakers 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.899
 process 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.550
 pour the chlorophyll the water that swims and 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.420
 the fluorescein in each of the vessels 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 of precipitates 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.220
 at this point you will have to observe if 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.430
 there is some change with the light of 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.430
 ambient 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.050
 but not 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.140
 taking into account that you are in a place 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.580
 dark placed ray lamp 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.450
 ultraviolet behind the samples that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.450
 watch what happens 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 observations 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.560
 with this experiment we could give 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.920
 account that substances in the environment 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.180
 normal or with white light did not suffer 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.540
 no change 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.410
 more however when we bring them closer 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.320
 ultraviolet lamp these are 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.310
 they became brighter as if they had 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.310
 own 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.390
 for the case of the uac and nothing happened 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.960
 be colorless to take a very blue color 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 sparkly 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.240
 with fluorescein things happened 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.550
 similar only that the green that already 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.550
 existed became more intense 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.970
 in theory chlorophyll along with the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.090
 ultraviolet rays had to have taken 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.780
 red color but in your experiment there 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.780
 it happened like this 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.780
 and you wonder why this happens 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.690
 chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.240
 light in the photosynthetic process of 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.880
 plants or algae 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.250
 The energy that absorbs from light is 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.230
 transferred as excitation energy and 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.230
 is trapped by the reaction center 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.140
 in an excited state the excess of 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.120
 energy must be transferred to return to 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.120
 fundamental state of minimum energy 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.019
 for this to happen a part of said 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.650
 energy is used for chemical work 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.360
 another part dissipates as heat and another 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.730
 little is emitted as light energy 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.130
 during the des excitation is released 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.720
 Luminous energy as a visible photon is 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.720
 say the fluorescence 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.220
 the fluorescence of chlorophyll is 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.099
 turns red because in the process of 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.930
 excitation the photons are absorbed in 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.500
 the red region of the spectrum of 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.500
 chlorophyll 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.620
 in the effect of our chlorophyll al 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.540
 to be under ultraviolet light is 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.959
 I could see a slight red reflection 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.000
 However, it did not issue as it was already committed 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.319
 that as shown in the photograph is not 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.319
 no brightness is observed 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.200
 this we coined to the fact of having 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.450
 been mixing with some other 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.830
 substance that reduced the effect and 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.830
 efficacy of chlorophyll 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.939
 now fluorescein is a 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.639
 substance that have properties 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.739
 dyes and fluorescent when 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.469
 found in acid solutions of a ph 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.230
 less than 7 its color turns green and 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.209
 highly fluorescent thanks to its 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.099
 double in the conjugates is capable of 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.290
 capture a high energy photon and 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.290
 return it as a low energy photon 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.080
 the radiation is quantum gives this 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.240
 means that for a frequency of 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.040
 radiation there can only be a value of 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.010
 quantum energy in the photons of 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.930
 radiation obviously that means that 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.450
 energy levels can only have 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.820
 listed securities and the transition between 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.400
 these quantum states 2 implies the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.770
 absorption and emission of photons 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.930
 an electron in an excited state is 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.639
 stimulated by an incident photon to 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.370
 that a transition is made to the level 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.259
 lower producing a second photon 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.460
 with the same energy and wavelength 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.460
 that the incident photon 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.240
 as I said the photon that will be emitted 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.210
 will have the same energy in the cry of 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.430
 wave that the incident however this 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.530
 it does not happen with fluorescein happens that 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.970
 the excited electrons decrease their 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.550
 energy before making a transition 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.860
 descending so the second photon 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.900
 which will be issued will have a lower 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.260
 energy that the incident and a length 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.380
 longer wave and this process is the 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.170
 that we know as fluorescence 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.200
 the tonic water is the carbon soda to 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.150
 all starting with quinine the drink 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.970
 takes the name of the medical aspects 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.950
 of this bitter flavoring that is a 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.840
 alkaloid that this idea cuts to the tree 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:40.190
 of the corner and has properties 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.190
 analgesic and antimalarial antibiotics 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.660
 this drink shines under the light 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.210
 ultraviolet or black light due to the 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.379
 natural fluorescence sulfate kina 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.379
 present in it 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.840
 In general, substances such as water 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.810
 Fluorescent machine absorb the energy 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.480
 in the form of electromagnetic radiation 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:04.720
 in short wave as gamma radiation 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.480
 x ray uv sees blue light 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.670
 etcetera and then it emits again to 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.490
 a longer wavelength per 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.600
 example within the visible spectrum the 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.310
 most notable symbols of the 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.200
 fluorescence occur when I speak is 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.750
 absorbed is within the range 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.090
 ultraviolet spectrum and invisible to the 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.880
 human eye and those emitted is found 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.490
 in the region visible in this way we 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.240
 we realize that substances are made 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.240
 more shiny 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.819
 the mechanism of fluorescence implies 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.919
 three sequential steps called 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:44.210
 respectively absorption dissipation not 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.210
 radiated and emission 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.820
 in conclusion the quantum atomic model 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.350
 propose that electrons are arranged 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.470
 in orbitals around the nucleus 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.630
 atomic the electrons that way 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.520
 possesses a characteristic energy that 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.880
 increases if further away they are in 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.110
 the nucleus going from one orbit to another 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.910
 of less energy 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.430
 there is a difference that results in a 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:13.580
 photon of light is to say a certain 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.979
 amount of energy converted into light 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.800
 if the atom receives a certain amount 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:20.840
 of energy the electron jumps to a 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.300
 superior orbit when the energy 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.879
 received by the atom is much the 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.300
 electron can escape from its binding to 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:31.550
 core if that received energy is light it 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.580
 will observe an absorption of light by 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.189
 of the atom these interactions between the 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.699
 matter and energy are studied by 

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:42.590
 the quantum mechanics area of ​​physics 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:45.879
 developed during the first 30 

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.879
 years of the 20th century
