00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:06.529
 refused and I got there on Friday if I wanted to show a horse in the 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.019
 colors with makers 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.819
 ms i am using 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.649
 different types of market house 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:15.999
 like to see a flat i am using 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.710
 the buyer price 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 that tastes good 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.239
 and various kopic makers 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.619
 well the biggest difference between market price 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 first place 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.239
 that you see here at the cockpit this has the brush point 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.360
 on the other hand I think it has acceptable makers 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.700
 and small art 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.400
 and that is always a difference 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.750
 further yes it is no difference in the case as you can see in it 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.750
 ups makers look very much like work cox 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.460
 and the eu 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.010
 better for the rest, they are all alcohol makers and they can just as well 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.830
 used together and with each other 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 park itself is very useful r 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.420
 that became today because I often have it, I will often map it later 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.220
 have purchased 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.729
 and that saves a lot of money if you compare with the header x 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.380
 the tax where Christmas did I have her converted about 2 euros two euros 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.960
 bought fifty 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740
 trapeze header above 60 euros 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.840
 well that difference will be very fragile 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.890
 for years 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 I give the question what is that in the vvd with 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.369
 the damage fell and I will try 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.000
 to see that work 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.430
 well i always start figuring out 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.820
 from the cler 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.240
 I want to use I use these a3 colors ahead 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.510
 yes, by the way, I have a fact enexis on a piece of paper or this course nicely with 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.590
 fit together 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.500
 8 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.650
 this was a disappointment together this time it is still possible 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.990
 who I think is already past and beautiful with classical fits and that fits anyway 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.850
 all just very beautiful 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.289
 at the color of the card i want to go to 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.429
 well I 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.479
 monuc upside down coloring so i hope i've got you but the 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.720
 cameras matters 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.289
 the other side of the workplace 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.889
 I always start with darkest color arm on this side you see the color numbers 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.579
 from the word pig I have come up myself but by September 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.059
 sticker placed and 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.559
 with the actual color that is in it because it can just as it deviate 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:35.569
 from the top 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.419
 and there 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.139
 pro makers just have a very black dope 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.309
 I have just seen a dark-colored quarter find it difficult to show 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.899
 in paris the Spaniards didn't see that 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.439
 which sees colors 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.799
 and basically nothing all lying in March if you have there that is just it 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.919
 easiest to be able to see at the top 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.379
 well i start with the dark rose color 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.869
 and I am going to start creating the trijntje where I will continue 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:08.159
 tilt the stadium a bit 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.219
 there are none 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.219
 with the side a bit on 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:18.769
 will do something for that reason 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
 no matter how you move, it must also be colored 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.449
 the approach i the middle color 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.010
 and then go to make shadow area switch that bigger and I will go again too 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.939
 already for the darkest places 3 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.889
 this not quite a grand 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.939
 what if you do then you have the chance that no problem then I had it 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:40.989
 about 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.989
 and where else you pieces and that would of course be a shame 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:49.379
 but I am going to change the tension altena different color because it is then beautiful 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.679
 being made 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.939
 in this way 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.560
 well then i grab 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.729
 the lightest color and there I go 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.829
 the more about a colorful the jury I go a few times 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.769
 but if it is not that the range becomes the municipality 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.569
 and you do not really have very clear line I always use ready or me 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.789
 always there for a few hours 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.789
 that thinks it's just the nicest 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.989
 except for animals than there I actually have been working in stripes for ages 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:25.929
 and because you then have more results that the ecb has 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.039
 it shows that year 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.110
 trade in as a tan 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.050
 with a stadium 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.530
 his daughter, the apple shape, of course I grabbed another three tens, now three 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.639
 tens of brabant 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.639
 I'm starting again 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.199
 with the 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.650
 to twitter 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.650
 van der kamp where I am the darkest brother 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.889
 I heard one of the cats that we don't know 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.259
 who likes a trillion so I go so fat that they finish the movie 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.169
 everdingen that is 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.629
 then I have got to know 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.580
 I had to test for a moment 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.480
 and since I work on both sides, I can completely cut off 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.700
 again used paper says Ronald a piece of paper next to it 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.900
 this is is the dark curls 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.889
 he is still struggling to see a screen 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.910
 I also drive here 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.260
 Already a little bit well if I did not finish the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.990
 a hundred free because the 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.120
 Gaddafi has left 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.249
 seedorf 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.249
 mpe 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.860
 in the current market and then but my confidence in it is not fair if 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.509
 child to continue 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.509
 because I and one more mouse click later 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:10.309
 and then complain and finish with the lightest color 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.279
 and now to do dots 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:23.919
 so he 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.919
 never again say the train has booked properly 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.620
 after i nice and important 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.270
 sloppy retie not at all as dark as the 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.059
 the next color there already got several times with a marker 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.300
 traditionally colored section 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.599
 and then a bit automatically dark because she absorbs more here 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.039
 extend it one more time 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.869
 have you colored cards too 

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:12.259
 with the state that officials and 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:14.809
 so slightly tilted 

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:18.879
 well i hope you first liked the look more i'm going to ticket myself 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.389
 finally you can show on molblog 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:22.229
 until next time
