there watching right now know about that

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.300 
there watching right now know about that
one<00:04:16.919> hadith<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.669> clearly<00:04:18.239> shows<00:04:18.660> us

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.370 

it<00:04:21.940> was<00:04:22.120> about<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.419> prostitute<00:04:22.930> who<00:04:23.350> was

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
it was about the prostitute who was

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.100 
it was about the prostitute who was
forgiven<00:04:23.770> by<00:04:24.280> Allah<00:04:24.639> SWA<00:04:24.910> know<00:04:24.970> Allah<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.690> why

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
forgiven by Allah SWA know Allah and why

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.800 
forgiven by Allah SWA know Allah and why
is<00:04:26.500> because<00:04:26.800> she<00:04:27.040> was<00:04:27.190> passing<00:04:28.060> by<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.510> dog

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
is because she was passing by to a dog

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.260 
is because she was passing by to a dog
and<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.110> think<00:04:29.410> he<00:04:30.040> was<00:04:30.160> next<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.520> will<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:30.910> she

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
and I think he was next to will and she

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.080 
and I think he was next to will and she
saw<00:04:31.450> how<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.780> dog<00:04:32.050> was<00:04:32.620> about<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.610> die<00:04:33.760> about

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
saw how the dog was about to die about

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.480 
saw how the dog was about to die about
it<00:04:34.270> because<00:04:34.540> of<00:04:34.630> her<00:04:34.810> thirst<00:04:35.169> and<00:04:35.470> then<00:04:36.250> she

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
it because of her thirst and then she

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.430 
it because of her thirst and then she
took<00:04:36.669> her<00:04:36.730> shoe<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.450> she<00:04:37.660> took<00:04:37.870> water<00:04:38.139> out<00:04:38.410> of

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
took her shoe and she took water out of

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.409 
took her shoe and she took water out of
that<00:04:38.680> well<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.220> gave<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.000> doctor<00:04:40.300> and

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
that well and gave it to the doctor and

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.960 
that well and gave it to the doctor and
