00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.910
 nights in this video today here I'm going to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.110
 do the front that is the suit of the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 pet but to me cat does not feel like it 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 to come with me to record a video on 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.630
 where will I be putting during the video 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.199
 so videos of your photos and so on 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.199
 that you see 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.920
 good in first question how is it called 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.980
 my cat is called mini and we put that 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.350
 name because when we adopted it was the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.190
 smallest of all was newborn 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.110
 but between his brother was very very 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.680
 little girl and now it is not that it is very 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.920
 great for me it has a medium size 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.089
 type of pet and breed 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.699
 it's a cat I think the breed is normal 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:04.360
 European or something like that is a normal cat not 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.460
 has a special breed 8 years ago already 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.430
 that I have my cat that a lot in the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.380
 half of my life how to get that your 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.299
 pet I had a kitten very 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.509
 little new friend who was called 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:20.110
 marta and did not last in my house nor a month 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.770
 because I had a boxer that is already very 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.429
 old and this time already like crazy was 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.560
 crazy and killed her in her when she died this 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:34.470
 kitten in the dog also died 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.470
 We decided to adopt another one and went to a 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.150
 and none of you was a cat that ends 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.400
 that they had found a veterinarian 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.140
 of the kennel had found this 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.200
 herd of kittens that were born in 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.960
 the street and I took one 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.390
 how old are you since you have the same 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.659
 years that I have been there for eight years now and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.869
 it is denoted that it is already old because 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.610
 in play before attending jumping and now 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.360
 it is all day its bad 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.739
 fun features good my cat 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.420
 has a mole a mole in the eye and that 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.160
 I love and then I like it 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.870
 has a pink nose that there are many 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.629
 cats of these colors that has the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.840
 black nose immigration and pink and that 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:25.170
 I love it and its characteristics 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.450
 personality my cat is arisca not him 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.780
 like when someone new comes who does not 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.569
 knows going out alone is like more with 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.069
 what is my family my brother of my 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:41.010
 father and does not like to be caught or anything 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.560
 Call your ball but it is very fixed 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.150
 because she is like she is a 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.760
 member of the family before when 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.650
 we eat them but do not eat 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.980
 before but less are we all 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.960
 sitting down eating come to moyano for 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.560
 to feed him 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.560
 after 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.590
 I consider that pija 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.150
 it has to be what she says if she does not 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.560
 talk like the count is asking like 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.560
 a corpse after 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.670
 things more because when I go out to the garden 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.110
 to record a video to anything is 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.200
 think I'm going to play with her and 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.620
 start your circle trees still gives you 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.299
 for pp and when I go to my house and 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.750
 see that I'm not playing with them 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:33.190
 starts bad already in a way by calling it 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.340
 but a super weird meow 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.710
 what does your relationship mean to go with your 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.600
 pet 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.970
 for me the truth that means a lot 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.580
 because as I say, half of my 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.590
 life with her and 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.500
 I love them a lot and she 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.400
 my whole family is with me in the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.400
 that were united 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.940
 and always with her hide and seek that 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.640
 he loves it and you will say with a cat 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.120
 hidden since I'm going to tell her she 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.950
 hide around my house and when you're with 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.140
 life begins to call me but uses a 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.600
 bathroom a different meow 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.570
 from firm around here the ones that you have 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.340
 cats do not give those monkeys how they change 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.829
 because I notice it in plan when you want 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.930
 Wedding food in a way when you want 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.459
 already playing another when it's sad and 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.620
 That's when you've been with you for so many years 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.230
 cat you already know him and good friends 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.270
 economists very down no longer anymore and when I 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.390
 I am approaching me where you are left 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.890
 running and hiding somewhere else like this 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.530
 all the time and is that she likes 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.300
 play hide and seek what I'm going to do 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.280
 and so he's saying that for me 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.670
 It means a lot because I want it 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.220
 montonazo and for me it's like it's a 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:49.910
 sister is part of me practically 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:52.100
 I remember with your pet so I remember 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.950
 when the girl who would have like a month 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.170
 or so it disappeared gave more than a day 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.810
 where he appeared to imagine an attitude 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.750
 small that I was all day with 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.880
 she and suddenly disappears and I with the 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.060
 work that my old cat was 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.340
 small I gave it to the call to a dog 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.130
 imagined I crying looking look 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:18.040
 everywhere desperate but then 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.040
 the next day my mother made prawns 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.560
 as it left my room product to 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.970
 except I am missing and it is that we 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.009
 we realized that under my mattress 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.319
 my bed before had a hollow 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.599
 work below I heard there was like 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.360
 a snack and she was emitted inside 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:40.210
 one was this mattress as essential 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.990
 below that is like a cave and there 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.490
 he is asleep but there is a whole day in 24 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.280
 hours 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.430
 and also 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.580
 I remember a winter two years ago that 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.639
 it got bad and it took like three days in 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.639
 my room asleep without eating I did not want 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.740
 eating I did not want to go out and pee and I 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.940
 I was super man he said he's going to die 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.010
 then we went to the vet and always 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.500
 biographies because I had a problem of 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:15.550
 kidney and they did things but at last it's 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.830
 well and nothing happens to him 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.870
 tell me the only thing about my pets 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.090
 if you like animals what kind of 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.510
 you have pets if you like cats more 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.000
 the dogs if we would also know 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.940
 your pets as to differentiate 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.710
 meows or barking when 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.580
 is hungry with sanabria or when 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:39.130
 they sleep and I hope there is a fan 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.460

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.830
