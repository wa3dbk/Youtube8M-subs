00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.010 
style more what I think I would use a
lot<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.460> I<00:02:00.000> don't<00:02:00.180> even<00:02:00.299> know<00:02:00.509> why<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> haven't

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
lot and I don't even know why I haven't

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
lot and I don't even know why I haven't
picked<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.189> don't<00:02:02.460> know<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.939> feel<00:02:03.210> like

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
picked it up I I don't know I feel like

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.480 
picked it up I I don't know I feel like
when<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.350> started<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:05.070> getting<00:02:05.189> into

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
when I started really getting into

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
when I started really getting into
watching<00:02:05.790> YouTube<00:02:06.210> videos<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.540> then<00:02:07.320> making

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
watching YouTube videos and then making

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.889 
watching YouTube videos and then making
videos<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.569> don't

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
videos that I don't

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.809 
videos that I don't
kind<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.289> has<00:02:10.500> been<00:02:10.799> so<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.519> haven't

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
kind of like has been so I just haven't

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.569 
kind of like has been so I just haven't
done<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:13.220> keep<00:02:14.220> looking<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.489> the

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
done it but then I keep looking at the

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.280 
done it but then I keep looking at the
colors<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.360> liked<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.689> so<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:15.989> think

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
colors and I really liked it so I think

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.780 
colors and I really liked it so I think
eventually<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.680> will<00:02:16.799> but<00:02:17.519> i<00:02:17.549> also<00:02:17.700> think

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
eventually I will but i also think

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.970 
eventually I will but i also think
really<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.870> same<00:02:19.049> price<00:02:19.230> as<00:02:19.470> naked<00:02:19.650> too

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
really it's the same price as naked too

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.619 
really it's the same price as naked too
you<00:02:20.489> couldn't<00:02:20.760> drop<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.060> price<00:02:21.269> just<00:02:21.299> a

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
you couldn't drop the price just a

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.449 
you couldn't drop the price just a
little<00:02:21.870> bit<00:02:22.019> because<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.920> has<00:02:23.069> been<00:02:23.310> in

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
little bit because it is the has been in

relevant to the topic because i think
it's<00:04:28.490> goofy<00:04:28.789> to<00:04:28.940> send<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.150> video<00:04:29.300> response<00:04:29.539> that

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
it's goofy to send a video response that

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.659 
it's goofy to send a video response that
has<00:04:30.199> nothing<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.560> do<00:04:30.740> with<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.099> actual<00:04:31.250> video

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
has nothing to do with the actual video
