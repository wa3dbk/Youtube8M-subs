00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.830 

always<00:02:42.460> remember<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.819> taper<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.450> little<00:02:43.630> bit

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
always remember to taper it a little bit

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.540 
always remember to taper it a little bit
so<00:02:44.050> make<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.290> thicker<00:02:44.560> on<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.830> outside<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
make thinner and inside and that'll draw

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.170 
make thinner and inside and that'll draw
the<00:02:47.260> eye<00:02:47.350> up<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.860> out<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.760> can<00:02:48.910> see<00:02:49.060> even

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
the eye up and out like you can see even

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.760 
the eye up and out like you can see even
though<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.390> have<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.600> smoky<00:02:50.020> makeup<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.560> side

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
though I have a smoky makeup on the side

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.230 
though I have a smoky makeup on the side
it<00:02:50.890> actually<00:02:51.250> looks<00:02:51.370> bigger<00:02:51.640> than<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.030> one

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
it actually looks bigger than this one

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.760 
it actually looks bigger than this one
because<00:02:52.300> I've<00:02:52.510> kind<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.810> picked<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.260> up<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.650> up

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
because I've kind of picked it up and up

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.730 
because I've kind of picked it up and up
and<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.450> corner<00:02:55.780> I'm<00:02:55.930> not<00:02:56.230> gonna<00:02:56.470> do<00:02:56.709> a

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
and in the corner I'm not gonna do a

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.040 
and in the corner I'm not gonna do a
wing<00:02:57.160> I'm<00:02:57.490> just<00:02:57.730> going<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:57.940> kind<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.300> lift<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.959> a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
wing I'm just going to kind of lift it a

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:09.150 
wing I'm just going to kind of lift it a
little<00:02:59.080> bit

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.730 

so<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:10.030> ends<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.690> kind<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.930> pointing<00:03:11.380> up<00:03:11.530> but

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
so it ends just kind of pointing up but

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.890 
so it ends just kind of pointing up but
it's<00:03:11.860> not<00:03:12.100> like<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.550> traditional<00:03:13.390> wing<00:03:13.570> while

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
it's not like a traditional wing while

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.420 
it's not like a traditional wing while
