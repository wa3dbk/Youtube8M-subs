 then we will arrive if we go fishing 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.240
 so I'm fishing off saturday gordon hinkle very hard climatic to 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.639
 competitions and bourbon includes 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.510
 frankly very hard to resist better than others 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.560
 so here I am on a post actually black 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 we had to take the boat 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.480
 to actually get started we have a power to file in favor of 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.159
 we are in this small central bank 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.179
 behind 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.780
 and much more impressive branches to go do a 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.210
 little tour to see a little bit how it's going 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.730
 and this border a good little way 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 for paul gaustad lucas to dump is increased ski sites around 7 o'clock 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.320
 stargate takes too much of growth 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.540
 here it's a little over 6% I know I'm proud of it actually this list 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.460
 its dimensions the road 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.700
 you pack the road to make a big shot 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.160
 a big hole this contest could go down a lot the branches sotra 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 the first followed but the review of the wba where I am posted 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.230
 behind the priest in a tented camp on the edge 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.230
 so I put my canes which is about the same thing 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.440
 except the last bite of drying in fact the return 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.290
 it's a little bit 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.570
 beautiful there is still 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.400
 it's the same in his branches elsewhere 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 dwight howard rotondo 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.220
 it's still beautiful 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.460
 say that women street to fish away to create from the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.260
 back in orange the lift to go to the meeting says we have a little more 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.030
 easy to see hoarau 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 finally the budget cuts 7 million euros 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.170
 from here and there there is almost bottom meters 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.520
 he says on his blog here 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.670
 because I'm looking for a buyer 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 for the rest he followed with justice just above the group 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.719
 google is organized a day I played on hard 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.630
 the width I believe in the length 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.280
 place the three rods almost in the same place but except with a little 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.560
 near 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 shift guilmette 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.669
 succeeded can finally of loire 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.899
 unfortunately I have already had the opportunity to judge from this several 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:15.969
 time 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.920
 we learn that a lot of weight of his group and percent 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.379
 to make great key moments 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.909
 paramount on something else I have not found consensus yet I 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.500
 advises a lot of goals a lot of fishermen - industry become curate 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.499
 ludwig paischer la loire 0-1 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.309
 one of the clubs 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.999
 closer to home and the camp and the boat 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.899
