 matter that I wanted to deal with you and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.720
 The main thing about this video is I started to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.539
 edit some gta videos some 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.030
 people praised others for criticizing 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.219

 Galley right way that was formerly 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.379
 videos without editing or as 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 I'm currently bringing it up as a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.449
 continue here with videos on the channel 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.460
 personal beauty is the following other people 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.680
 subject actually this blog will be well 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.019
 Hurry then or two 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.799
 basically is about the series 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.979
 of the channel 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.409
 currently we have fixed in the channel 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.720
 we started with the sims four we have 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.640
 dragon ball z who we have enough 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.630
 thing they do there we will explore 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.049
 this game until the stalk that was most 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.900
 roraima with 2 is and one more that is the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.659
 sanset overdrive as you can see 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.030
 each day and interweave these series or 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.520
 it has the hours of 9 am 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.720
 I usually loose or the sims 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.970
 Dragon Ball Z 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.740
 Then one day, yes, yes, it will. 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.210
 have some enjoyment and so on 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.270
 okay and if forza 17 and overdrive 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.579
 It's the same thing, one day you have strength. 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.200
 another day has 17 overdrive this does not 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.680
 was well established because I was 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 bringing is two two series of force ne 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.020
 one with the fast and furious forces that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.119
 It was really cool but the end came. 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.520
 unfortunately you do not have to do the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.680
 We continue with rural force 12 that 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 You can explore a lot in the galley. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.710
 This game is awesome and there's a lot 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.509
 to explore 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.580
 so I 'm inserting these two 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.770
 series in the morning is 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.200
 according to 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.600
 9 hours ago by sims and dragon ball z 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.730
 every day until some comes to an end 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.650
 but when some comes to the end comes back 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.170
 here to talk with you to know 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.310
 What do you want me to put in place? 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.340
 and generally 10 and 6 11 hours 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.270
 I put the forza or sam-7 overdrive 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.900
 beauty in the middle of emerging has 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.120
 basically gta5 also at 5:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.520
 hours of up to 5 which is fixed right 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.590
 usually 8 we have fifa or 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.860
 people have some kind or sometimes not 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.840
 has nothing ta and the half past three is a 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.940
 schedule that I was waiting for fixed 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.250
 for minecraft though guys 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.750
 many people ask me if it's over but 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.980
 It's hardcore or year I 'll bring 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.740
 theoretically it was to bring a day 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.900
 Not a day though, but people sometimes 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.090
 My day is half-full and minecraft 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.280
 ends up being the last video I record 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.130
 so sometimes I bring it sometimes it's not 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.380
 but theoretically to come all is by 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.500
 less one day yes one day no sometimes me 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.850

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.220
 stay calm 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.830

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.260
