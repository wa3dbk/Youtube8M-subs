00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.670
 for the channel today I am going to talk to you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.760
 I will continue talking about the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.240
 feeding the canaries and we have 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.410
 with us today the cucumber that is for 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.489
 canaries especially in moulting 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.980
 is very important is paramount for the 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.680
 moulting is very good it is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.450
 a lot of liquid content and it's very good 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.410
 for the skin and for the creation of 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.380
 new pens so I use it 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.379
 practically for the mute alone so 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.710
 it is not easy to put the canaries there 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.039
 to cut it into slices and put it on 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.039
 cage 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.260
 I already have the cucumber cut in here 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.300
 I'm going to talk a bit about the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.330
 cucumber and on the change of the canaries 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.369
 ok and I like I told you at the beginning 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.479
 video used the cucumber only at the time 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:15.620
 while they are playing canaries and os 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.580
 I'm going to say more or less about when she moves 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:23.360
 the channels change in general when 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.040
 begins the time of heat between the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.460
 Summer time is when they move more or 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.380
 less June July September October by 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.380
 that's how those months change 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.420
 the young canaries that's why they also 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.310
 I'm going to give it now young rams 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:47.190
 two months after birth, too 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.790
 experience a small move that 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 so that the feathers take strength for the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.800
 year that comes in, I'm going to give it to you 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.990
 I'm going to give it to the young because the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.620
 parents are not moving yet so 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 let's put it in 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.400
 the tree to deras and I'll show you how 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.860
 we eat it 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.260
 Well I told you earlier that I know 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.020
 I say put on fat slices in the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.890
 slits 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.290
 and well I put it to a few already 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.990
 others I'm going to put on I'm going to try 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.940
 for the first time to get a dive in 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.360
 more or less large pieces and 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.030
 vizcacheras to see if they eat it well 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.030
 so let's do let's do 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.030
 chunks 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.790
 So that's how it would be worth what we do 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.079
 is to put what more 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.079
 I do not listen to hot hours 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.380
 the table that was clean 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.350
 I did not clean myself now before 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.080
 do this 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.800
 always hygiene with those with the food of 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.800
 the channels 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.560
 well I think this will suffice so if 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.160
 we are going to put it in the cages, and 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.130
 let's see how he eats it 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.100
 a trick that I give you is what I think about you 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.170
 with the ass that we took with the part 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.600
 back that we took not 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.940
 put it to the canaries we cover it like this 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.350
 we put it in the fridge is also worth 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:37.370
 say as always that if you take it out and what 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.940
 you have the fridge the cucumber take it out 15 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.390
 minutes or 20 minutes before putting it on 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.290
 ok so it's not too cold to the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.959
 time to eat it 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.030
 well let's save this and if 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.180
 We now put in the refrigerator to know what 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.180
 such 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.090
 good as you can see they are already 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.580
 approaching him they are pecking 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.160
 and the truth is new offspring not yet 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.349
 know what cucumber and once 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.180
 eat it, eat it, eat it 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.000
 all every day that you do them 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.970
 It is worth remembering that the rule of 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.459
 vegetables and fruits do not put it on 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.130
 more than 3 days a week followed 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.910
 with two days a week of fruits or 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.220
 vegetables are ready and perfect 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.910
 and he good 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.850
 give like it's worth to share the video 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.200

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.570
