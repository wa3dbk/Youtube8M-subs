00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.200
 and what do we have from youtube and good what 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.850
 promised is debt here I bring this 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.030
 small cliche 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.370
 how to hide in infection here 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.779
 Prometheus is going to be the click to activate 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:33.750
 in my vision promise to look is the glitch 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:35.610
 get into the corner that is there 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.270
 then because now they are done 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.360
 you gave an account and I'm 20 and so 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.040
 I could not do it then do not look here 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.440
 he was promised that he's in there 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.660
 this 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.970
 if we go is the cliché hide there 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.970
 in that wall 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.710
 in infection, they do not give you here 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.400
 tell them why I'm seeing it and because 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.430
 is that he is my partner but good 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.700
 trick is to throw yourself there and 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.720
 they fall but you see this is not like this is 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.810
 explain how it is done 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.890
 good here and now it's my turn I 'm going to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 do the first thing that I'm going to do 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.350
 teaching is the difference between being 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.870
 stopped and be crouched if you were 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.630
 find in the shadow you see I'm 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.430
 stopped the one that I'm crouched so look 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.000
 what we are going to do is try to 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.110
 suspend us a little bit in the air 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.300
 how do you do that when you jump you have to 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.700
 crouch in the air then now what 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.880
 let's do look they have to jump 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.280
 back towards that part of there what 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.560
 they have to do is take charge and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.840
 duck just when they get there they 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.670
 will charge and crouch undeserved in 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.610
 Mind you , the cliché came out here 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.690
 this movie topic because they see that I'm 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.350
 I'm in there if they go a lot 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.350
 center 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.520
 they die then nothing else can be 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.220
 stay there in the corner today I 'm going to 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.810
 teach as they crouch they crouch 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.940
 crouching down as well as when they crouch 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.630
 they realize realize my spartan as 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.630
 in the air like that like bouncing like 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.360
 that makes a kind of bounce in the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.060
 what they have to do is you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.360
 with the button that they crouch with 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.459
 agazapan this they have it they jump and they 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.920
 they then crouch all they have to 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.780
 do then come here jump and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.300
 here they see for example it did not come out to me because 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.819
 do not name that I did not crouch in the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.030
 moment that I was tense here if I already 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.660
 it came out and you can see I got myself 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.680
 going over there crouching then good 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.739
