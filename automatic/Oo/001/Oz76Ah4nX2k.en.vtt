you know so the whole 3.2 i don't even

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
you know so the whole 3.2 i don't even
know<00:01:38.340> why<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.670> bother<00:01:39.150> putting<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.750> camera

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
know why they bother putting in camera

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.069 
know why they bother putting in camera
in<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.740> nothing<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
in there because it's nothing to

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
in there because it's nothing to
comparable<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.490> today<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.939> far

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
comparable to what we have today as far

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.010 
comparable to what we have today as far
as<00:01:45.210> digital<00:01:45.780> cameras<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.670> i<00:01:47.780> think<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.899> you're

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
as digital cameras but i think if you're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.929 
as digital cameras but i think if you're
gonna<00:01:49.110> send<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.649> emails<00:01:49.799> say<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.790> my

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
gonna send some emails say this is my

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
audio in everything going on so this is

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.600 
audio in everything going on so this is
this<00:04:02.670> for<00:04:02.910> precise<00:04:03.630> audio<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.500> recording<00:04:05.459> or
