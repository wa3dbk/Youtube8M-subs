 Revised as feeling that it is not the first time in Minamura 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.630

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:58.230
 Now I asked you to exchange it 34 times, but I would like to do something like exchange 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.950
 I did not think 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.060

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:12.380
 Ask to translate tomorrow from the fact's coming to Disney's grandfather in Japan language 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.619

 Is that so? This is also I'd that was now telling me the Tteyuu what? We root 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:46.010
 How many sheets are written before the actual work is completed 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:51.750

 I would like to write carefully and stick to myself as much as possible . 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:42.900
 It is said whether it can be written well in one's own form for the rest of the period from when she got ok 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.900

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.890
 That's really the way to say that love is overflowing 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:27.619
 I think it's amazing 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:27.619
 I is amazing it 's such or is transferred successfully to when writing a flip book 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.889
 I chose it and saw what money was 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:39.509
 8 I was the first to see me 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:42.000
 It is still around August last August 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:45.320
 It was in the state of storyboard, but 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.320
 That doesn't move 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:55.430
 Guy of the feeling I had to show to your parishioner at that that stage 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:06:00.040
 This is thought Naa can not be me this I think Naa's a good experience to other people 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:08.330
 Normally when I work doing this you'll thing that does not touch the eye 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:10.770
 But this there is it was a guy of this kind of feeling in something which looks like it 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:18.650
 When you try to complete 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:18.650
 Tehe' dog moving another move another Yara reform to such taking Na soooo 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:28.180

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:41.600
 Do you understand that I think this is a sunset or another scene 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:47.660
 You can see the feeling of rubber like this you like to take a picture or sound 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:51.550
 This is usually of anime Tteyuu 6 has become a medium is something this light I can not see the road 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.070
 You can not express the land absolutely 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.740
 Disney's unique 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.190
 It's a child of technology 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:03.220
