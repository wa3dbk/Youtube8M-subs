00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that orientation right here is a flat

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.150 
that orientation right here is a flat
side<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.750> goes<00:00:30.900> towards<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:34.070> just<00:00:35.070> kind

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
side that goes towards that I just kind

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.620 
side that goes towards that I just kind
of<00:00:35.280> put<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.640> side<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:36.210> only<00:00:36.420> gonna

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of put that to the side I'm only gonna

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.479 
of put that to the side I'm only gonna
do<00:00:36.750> these<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> time<00:00:37.469> only<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
do these one at a time only because I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.250 
do these one at a time only because I
want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.420> sure<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.750> reference<00:00:39.960> off

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
want to make sure I can reference off

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.100 
want to make sure I can reference off
something<00:00:40.559> else<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> fuel

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
something else but this is a fuel

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.110 
something else but this is a fuel
injector<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:44.940> you've

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
injector right here you can see you've

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.830 
injector right here you can see you've
got<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.360> over<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:47.300> right<00:00:48.300> here

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
got it over in right here right here

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.740 
got it over in right here right here
right<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> flat<00:00:51.510> washer

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
right here and there was a flat washer

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.869 
right here and there was a flat washer
or<00:00:52.140> ring<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.890> actually<00:00:53.160> sits<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> bottom

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
or ring it actually sits on the bottom

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
or ring it actually sits on the bottom
of<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.469> I'm<00:00:55.469> pretty<00:00:55.860> sure

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
of this right here I'm pretty sure

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.799 
of this right here I'm pretty sure
that's<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.520> orientation<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> goes<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.660> cuz

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that's the orientation that goes so cuz

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.060 
that's the orientation that goes so cuz
there's<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> lessee<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.530> notch<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.949> can

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
there's a lessee a little notch you can

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.720 
there's a lessee a little notch you can
see<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.520> here<00:01:00.829> try<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.100> right<00:01:02.250> there<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
see right here try to see right there it

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.310 
see right here try to see right there it
makes<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> turn<00:01:03.090> something<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:06.200> see<00:01:07.200> right

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
makes you turn something on see right

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.690 
makes you turn something on see right
there<00:01:07.470> little<00:01:07.619> notch<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.040> believe<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> sits

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
there little notch and I believe it sits

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.719 
there little notch and I believe it sits
like<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> flat<00:01:11.280> side<00:01:13.729> flat

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
like this that so the flat side flat

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.499 
like this that so the flat side flat
side<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.479> right<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.240> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
side is actually right here so and that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.980 
side is actually right here so and that
actually<00:01:18.960> sits<00:01:19.880> BAM<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
actually sits BAM like that with the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
actually sits BAM like that with the
fuel<00:01:22.200> injector<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.100> connector<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.060> on

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
fuel injector you know connector out on

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
fuel injector you know connector out on
this<00:01:24.420> side<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:25.350> thing<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.740> want<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
this side one thing I do want to I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
this side one thing I do want to I
recommend<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> actually

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
recommend is that this is actually

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.010 
recommend is that this is actually
number<00:01:28.200> eight<00:01:28.860> socket<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.329> have

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
number eight socket right here I have

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200 
number eight socket right here I have
what<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> am<00:01:31.740> doing<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.759> these<00:01:32.939> things<00:01:33.030> out

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
what I am doing to get these things out

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
what I am doing to get these things out
because<00:01:33.329> actually<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:34.110> o-rings<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.710> really

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
because actually these o-rings it really

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.700 
because actually these o-rings it really
tight<00:01:35.250> around<00:01:35.700> here

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
tight around here

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.109 
tight around here
it's<00:01:37.710> unbolting<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.460> two<00:01:38.729> bolts<00:01:39.030> right

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it's unbolting these two bolts right

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.200 
it's unbolting these two bolts right
here<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> top<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:41.340> taking<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
here on the top and then taking this

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
here on the top and then taking this
number<00:01:42.450> eight<00:01:42.630> placing<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> over<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
number eight placing it over the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.160 
number eight placing it over the
injector<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.060> they're<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.750> letting

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
injector and they're just letting

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.370 
injector and they're just letting
gravity<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.770> push<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.250> down<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:48.479> actually

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
gravity just push it down and actually

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.069 
gravity just push it down and actually
shove<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> injector<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.759> because<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> try

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
shove the injector up because if you try

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
shove the injector up because if you try
to<00:01:52.140> wrench<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:53.220> your<00:01:53.399> fingers<00:01:53.759> or

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to wrench it up with your fingers or

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.130 
to wrench it up with your fingers or
whatever<00:01:54.299> tool<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.560> could<00:01:55.710> actually<00:01:55.829> damage

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
whatever tool you could actually damage
