00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
the old laminate countertop and then

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.050 
the old laminate countertop and then

replace it with a piece of plywood that
is<00:00:20.300> until<00:00:20.660> inventor<00:00:21.080> arm<00:00:21.350> and<00:00:21.590> Tavi<00:00:21.860> came<00:00:22.220> up

is until inventor arm and Tavi came up
with<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:22.580> system<00:00:22.850> for<00:00:23.450> putting<00:00:23.570> ceramic<00:00:24.260> tile

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470

I<00:00:31.310> always<00:00:31.670> felt<00:00:31.970> guilty<00:00:32.450> about<00:00:32.660> removing<00:00:33.440> an

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
I always felt guilty about removing an

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.250 
I always felt guilty about removing an
existing<00:00:34.640> top<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.150> just<00:00:35.510> throwing<00:00:35.720> it<00:00:35.900> away<00:00:35.990> I

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
existing top and just throwing it away I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.740 
existing top and just throwing it away I
said<00:00:37.070> why<00:00:37.400> not<00:00:37.430> take<00:00:37.940> advantage<00:00:38.060> of<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.600> and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
said why not take advantage of it and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.590 
said why not take advantage of it and
find<00:00:39.260> some<00:00:39.500> way<00:00:39.650> that<00:00:39.680> gets<00:00:40.270> mortar<00:00:41.270> to<00:00:41.390> stick

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
find some way that gets mortar to stick

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.630 
find some way that gets mortar to stick
to<00:00:41.720> it<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.560> you've<00:00:42.710> done<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.340> I've<00:00:43.489> done

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640

that<00:00:43.790> I'd<00:00:44.000> like<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.150> jump<00:00:44.480> right<00:00:44.570> in<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:44.870> see

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
that I'd like to jump right in and see

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.590 
that I'd like to jump right in and see
how<00:00:45.200> this<00:00:45.320> works

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
how this works

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.540 
how this works
Armand<00:00:47.600> starts<00:00:48.079> by<00:00:48.290> applying<00:00:48.649> a<00:00:48.950> specially

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
Armand starts by applying a specially

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.400 
Armand starts by applying a specially
designed<00:00:49.730> adhesive<00:00:50.570> directly<00:00:51.200> to<00:00:51.320> the

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
designed adhesive directly to the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.990 
designed adhesive directly to the
laminate<00:00:51.800> countertop<00:00:54.460> I'm<00:00:55.460> using<00:00:55.640> an<00:00:55.820> eighth

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
laminate countertop I'm using an eighth

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.930 
laminate countertop I'm using an eighth
inch<00:00:56.030> v-notch<00:00:56.809> sawtooth<00:00:57.470> trowel<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:58.160> found

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
inch v-notch sawtooth trowel I found

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.000 
inch v-notch sawtooth trowel I found
that<00:00:59.030> this<00:00:59.180> is<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.420> perfect<00:00:59.809> size<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.739> just

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
that this is the perfect size but just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.950 
that this is the perfect size but just
the<00:01:01.070> right<00:01:01.219> amount<00:01:01.520> of<00:01:01.610> glue<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.630> you<00:01:02.780> don't

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
the right amount of glue that you don't

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.869 
the right amount of glue that you don't
have<00:01:03.140> too<00:01:03.350> much<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.250> have<00:01:04.339> enough<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.640> do<00:01:04.760> the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
have too much you have enough to do the

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.100 
have too much you have enough to do the
job<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.269> that's<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:05.570> much<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.870> you<00:01:05.960> make<00:01:06.080> a

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
job and that's so much that you make a

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.530 
job and that's so much that you make a
mess<00:01:06.350> now<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:07.280> adhesive<00:01:07.670> is<00:01:08.000> not<00:01:08.180> intended

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
mess now this adhesive is not intended

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.350 
mess now this adhesive is not intended
for<00:01:08.659> attaching<00:01:09.080> tiles<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:10.070> instead<00:01:10.520> paper

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
for attaching tiles but instead paper

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.380 
for attaching tiles but instead paper
this<00:01:11.870> is<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.610> fiberglass<00:01:13.610> reinforced<00:01:14.210> paper

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
this is a fiberglass reinforced paper

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.960 
this is a fiberglass reinforced paper
the<00:01:15.170> countertop<00:01:15.770> itself<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:16.369> laminate<00:01:16.790> is

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
the countertop itself the laminate is

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.050 
the countertop itself the laminate is
not<00:01:17.360> friendly<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.990> mortar<00:01:18.290> we<00:01:18.650> know<00:01:18.770> that<00:01:19.060> so

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
not friendly to mortar we know that so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.980 
not friendly to mortar we know that so
the<00:01:21.049> glue<00:01:21.380> sticks<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.670> laminate<00:01:23.090> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
the glue sticks to the laminate the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.680 
the glue sticks to the laminate the
paper<00:01:24.260> sticks<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.040> glue<00:01:25.450> mortar<00:01:26.450> loves

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
paper sticks to the glue mortar loves

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.109 
paper sticks to the glue mortar loves
the<00:01:27.080> paper<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.100> we<00:01:28.250> have<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.430> high<00:01:28.939> level

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
the paper so we have a high level

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.420 
the paper so we have a high level
surface

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.430 

all<00:01:33.430> right<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:33.700> this<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:33.880> down<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.570> how<00:01:35.290> long

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
do you have to wait before you go to the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.580 
do you have to wait before you go to the
next<00:01:36.910> there's<00:01:37.150> no<00:01:37.270> waiting<00:01:37.510> yeah<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.410> can

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
proceed to the next step which is

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.790 
proceed to the next step which is
putting<00:01:40.480> a<00:01:40.600> thin<00:01:40.780> layer<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.050> mortar<00:01:41.260> on<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.650> to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
putting a thin layer of mortar on it to

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.340 
putting a thin layer of mortar on it to
acclimate<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.460> surface<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.180> paper<00:01:43.630> to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
acclimate the surface of the paper to

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.510 
acclimate the surface of the paper to
the<00:01:44.500> product<00:01:44.860> that<00:01:44.920> you're<00:01:45.100> going<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.250> use<00:01:45.400> to

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the product that you're going to use to

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.490 
the product that you're going to use to
install<00:01:45.670> your<00:01:46.000> tile<00:01:46.240> if<00:01:46.660> you're<00:01:46.840> painting<00:01:47.320> a

the idea here is to use a fair amount of

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.460 
the idea here is to use a fair amount of

pressure to force the grout to the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.529 
pressure to force the grout to the
