to push on it and pull the unit out this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890 
to push on it and pull the unit out this
one's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> little<00:01:11.460> trickier<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.479> I've<00:01:12.600> already

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
one's a little trickier and I've already

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.390 
one's a little trickier and I've already
kind<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> prepared<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> by<00:01:13.860> pulling<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.280> out

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
kind of prepared it by pulling it out

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.560 
kind of prepared it by pulling it out
somewhat<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:17.970> you'll<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.420> to

somewhat so in this one you'll have to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
somewhat so in this one you'll have to
use<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.780> screw<00:01:19.080> driver<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> flathead

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.319 
screws out just a moment I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.950> pause<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> camera<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> moment

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
ahead and pause the camera for a moment

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.319 
ahead and pause the camera for a moment
and<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.719> started<00:01:58.850> alright<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.180> is

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and get that started alright so this is

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.100 
and get that started alright so this is
a<00:02:00.469> 5/16<00:02:01.790> head<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:03.030> least<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.360> mine<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:03.990> an

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
a 5/16 head at least on mine I have an

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.969 
a 5/16 head at least on mine I have an
o2<00:02:04.320> Grand<00:02:04.829> Caravan<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.540> 5/16<00:02:07.320> socket<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
o2 Grand Caravan and a 5/16 socket it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.109 
o2 Grand Caravan and a 5/16 socket it
seems<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.520> trick

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
seems to do the trick

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.320 
seems to do the trick
so<00:02:09.840> once<00:02:10.170> you've<00:02:10.319> pulled<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.860> out<00:02:11.330> you'll

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so once you've pulled that out you'll

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.830 
so once you've pulled that out you'll
get<00:02:12.540> your<00:02:12.690> old<00:02:12.900> unit

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
get your old unit

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.640 
get your old unit
you'll<00:02:14.349> get<00:02:14.530> your<00:02:14.709> old<00:02:14.920> unit<00:02:15.280> out<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:17.470> old

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
you'll get your old unit out the old

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
you'll get your old unit out the old
unit<00:02:18.629> has<00:02:19.629> a<00:02:19.660> steel<00:02:20.019> cage<00:02:20.319> around<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.160> guess

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
unit has a steel cage around it I guess

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.460 
unit has a steel cage around it I guess
that's<00:02:22.360> just<00:02:22.450> how<00:02:22.660> they<00:02:22.810> used<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.110> make<00:02:23.290> them

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
that's just how they used to make them

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.809 
that's just how they used to make them
the<00:02:23.650> new<00:02:23.830> one<00:02:23.980> doesn't<00:02:24.190> look<00:02:24.370> anything<00:02:24.640> like

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
the new one doesn't look anything like

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.650 
the new one doesn't look anything like
this<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.959> new<00:02:26.110> one<00:02:26.230> actually<00:02:26.620> looks<00:02:26.800> very

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
this the new one actually looks very

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.240 
this the new one actually looks very
different<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:29.319> apparently<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.950> does<00:02:30.099> the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
different but apparently it does the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.729 
different but apparently it does the
same<00:02:30.400> function<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.080> we'll<00:02:32.080> put<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.349> one<00:02:32.410> back

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
same function so we'll put this one back

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.020 
same function so we'll put this one back
in<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:33.129> way<00:02:33.220> we<00:02:33.400> pulled<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.700> other<00:02:33.819> one<00:02:34.000> out

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.000 
in the way we pulled the other one out
