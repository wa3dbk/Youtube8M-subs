00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 so hello everyone with you the amount is not admin 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.290
 group work of 3 world editor tilt and 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.269
 Today we will talk about how to create 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.599
 the gate and the lever that is to say in the mouth and the lever is 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.670
 it is clear how to create but we will make a lever 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.279
 with which we can open 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.939
 goal 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:27.390
 Well, that is, the gate is not opened lever 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.439
 running for a couple of seconds for example there seconds 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.180
 10 5 and the lever is restored in through 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.790
 this time doctor ok is recovering 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:42.660
 the gate closes everything so well I think 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:48.030
 let's start probably recording goes night 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.730
 start with go but first take into account the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.850
 the lever can be found here are some people here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 constantly confused maybe where to find 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.699
 this lever is it in the panel 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.909
 dungeon decorations here at the very bottom 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.850
 almost at the bottom of the lever respectively 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.409
 put the lever 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:17.610
 put the lever twisted it like it to us 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:23.900
 i need i think sometime so 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.730
 or so well let's do it like this 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.970
 it will be more interesting 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.650
 like this lever and create any gate 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.670
 no matter what the turnover is 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.830
 create now I will only find straight 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.240
 I will give you a straight gate 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.470
 That's the way you back gate, respectively 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.540
 and a combat unit that will open 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:02:02.960
 close the gate itself go to 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:04.710
 Leader Editor Delete New 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.290
 civilization card 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.380
 his actions so doing the trail doing 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.709
 next trigger next trigger 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.080
 make the scenery destructible 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.800
 dying or something like that if anyone 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.800
 Russian trigger 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:30.640
 choose our our lever condition not 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.670
 grit 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.130
 We go looking for action action 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.660
 the scenery here is the parameter type you can 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 choose scenery decorations and open and 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.950
 shut down 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.990
 destroy the gate is it for someone for those 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.200
 Whom whom Russian open our choose 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.200
 goal 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.970
 everything seems to be easy not really 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.580
 especially so easy because if we open 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.310
 now the lever but the lever will break and more 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.440
 he will not recover and the gate will not 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:16.780
 shut down so we make a new trigger 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:19.450
 this trigger we are doing new without an event 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.830
 actions immediately wait for those whom 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.500
 Russian wait five seconds that is you 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:31.950
 wait five seconds 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.950
 make new actions make decoration 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.660
 scenery decoration and open again 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.060
 close destroy the gate choose 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.820
 function close 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:55.880
 choose a gate choose a gate new 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:57.190
 action scenery scenery life in 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.910
 percent like 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:05.270
 the decoration of life in percents seems to be so 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.550
 choose our scenery decoration our 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.670
 choose live percentage accordingly 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.410
 lever meaning this function is one hundred percent 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.810
 this function we need in order to 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:20.150
 our lever was full of pop lives well 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.980
 I do not know whether he will recover 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.940
 he has the same color 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.100
 colorful 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.320
 what purple color are pwim there i don't know 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.860
 the world of color blindness is such a color 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.280
 appears not know but for that 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:40.490
 to appear here in the third 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:46.370
 rangers third here do fucking code 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:49.690
 ran here make select animation 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:54.350
 animation and now I will say what type 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:57.050
 animation for animation animation here 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.690
 animation reproduce destructible 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.740
 the animation is something like this 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.470
 animation for destructible 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.129
 and play the animation for our 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.459
 leverage 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:13.619
 stand as we see the animation stand it he 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:17.839
 included types must be enabled 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:20.369
 animation camp yes ok principle 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.819
 in the second corridor we pass the second 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:25.159
 trigger 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.159
 here, just add trigger number three 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:34.199
 run checking salt add 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.149
 trigger our number three ie this one and 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:42.319
 now you can just match 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:42.319
 check the card all look 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:56.119
 here we are our lever at the lapel click 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:57.979
 the lever opens the gate for 5 seconds 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.729
 passes the lever to stop the gate 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:06.710
 shut down 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:10.240
 as we see success will have to work 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:13.490
 would we do one more thing now 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.319
 that is , something for a similar example here 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.229
 we just open the gate somehow 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:22.039
 strange so here we are doing here 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:22.899
 lever lever and check churo so that you 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.119
 have seen 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:28.610
 his mouth opens strangely so you 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:32.330
 We saw a charge of whether or not lit well, 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:37.909
 here you see the lever off means everything 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:40.119
 gate close open all we have everything 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.119
 works 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:51.470
 in this lesson we end all thanks 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:55.040
 for watching 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:59.310
 come put likes on youtube 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:03.540
 subscribe to our group group 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:08.430
 link to the group will be on u tube under 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:12.030
 The video is also an example of this card. 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:16.250
 which I did will also be under the video in 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:18.660
 group VKontakte like write 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:22.440
 who needs to be taught 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:29.280
 if there is something you still haven't 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:33.440
 you know besides jazz skills with skills I 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.270
 as it is not particularly well, whisking, etc. 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.870
 Well, that is the most difficult thing 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.600
 comparison is closer jazz u can not immediately 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:48.050
 ask no questions 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.050
 Well, what can I say to everyone for now
