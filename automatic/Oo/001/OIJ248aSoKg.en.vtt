00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.880
 I'll start again 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.880
 a video 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.600
 I want to say from the beginning 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:32.230
 That's why I drive a little longer 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.270
 probably more videos from this more blogs 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.800
 and generally more videos from that of 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.260
 I will cut this driveway 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.690
 hope that is not a problem 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.180
 I guess not or I hope 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.150
 Not 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.890
 and we always start directly 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.620
 it rains i apologize for 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.030
 drops on the camera but there I can 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.140
 currently nothing against making up first 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.290
 not if there are a drop on it and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.340
 secondly , in the meantime he just does that 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.910
 I'm on the way to 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.320
 I mean to my father and I would 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 start saying good luck and we start 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.780
 start with all that I tell no 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.520
 i stop you with youtube just because 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.620
 five days no videos we come 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 the weather shit means it means 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.090
 not that I do not make videos 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 have no desire or more on youtube 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.400
 what's wrong with him if such a thing 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.170
 I'm not in the mood for the weather 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.660
 to drive I know mettmann is not 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.759
 I apologize for coming 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.560
 But I submit in the next man 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.810
 I'll bet that for twice as long 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.850
 believe that we are doing well 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.700
 continue with the actual video and 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.310
 Although I thought we were talking 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.229
 Today the most common questions 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.060
 were asked me and the most common 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.770
 Things that I do so on youtube de 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.960
 facebook on in the program twitter 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.970
 snapshot myspace tumblr image and that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.110
 I always get a bunch of news 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.240
 that's basically not bad at all 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.740
 I like to answer news but 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.780
 it is and for the most part the largest 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 part always the same we start with 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.830
 facebook i get determined on the day 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.239
 Five people ask me which scooter 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.030
 you can buy best or am 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.989
 should buy best 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.190
 I have no idea what the movie 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.650
 taste what roll you 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.230
 Of course you could like piaggio and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.610
 mina rally engines 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.200
 keep what of which are strong with 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.269
 motors, of course, something not at all 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.430
 the exact name is one 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.070
 Rally replica is also ok 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.830
 also a relatively good quality of 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.650
 so hello once the 2 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:44.100
 tank is full and now too 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.100
 others are a few miles 10 11 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.520
 And there I was the questions that I ask 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.990
 I got exactly 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.930
 are for the most part really always 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.760
 I can not always keep them the same 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.150
 have no idea what you like 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.950
 i can tell you so naturally aerox 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.350
 that for speed are far mainstream 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.460
 Models are good for keeping up 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.310
 long if you are so neat 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.290
 you can build on that, for example 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.300
 Jammer has many other models 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.070
 Actually, I find a job completely 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.580
 cool scooter is from the airbox unfortunately 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.720
 pushed back a bit 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.540
 I think the teachers are completely in 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.880
 order the three teachers actually 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.430
 a great role of organic power 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:34.000
 just the things with 200 cubic on the 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:37.180
 message that I do not know now how 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.640
 I expect the expression he writes 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.260
 in a hey i'm a big fan im 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.810
 first nice to read something 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.670
 i like to read i have all your videos 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.210
 looked but I have a question 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.970
 ok, unquestionably, what are you driving for? 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.520
 scooter and if anyone has my videos 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.959
 he should have seen it 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.240
 stands under each video at least 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.700
 three times it's been my very first 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.990
 video in the video description means 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.900
 once you show more 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.600
 Sounds there like my scooter 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.700
 is sachs offers rs for it 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.890
 still do not know that bothers me 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.630
 really blatant when people say fit here 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.700
 I look at everything but what a scooter 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.200
 Do you actually drive or others ? 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.780
 ask so what do you actually have 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.230
 made his scooter and I have mine 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.400
 maybe you could take a look 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.600
 there everything is explained in it I will 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.580
 I also believe in the video 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.550
 pack description if i am here 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.889
 but forget in the later videos 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.099
 they will come will follow 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:40.900
 because it has lit it really does not matter now 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:42.999
 Whether that's the way most questions are 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.860
 Of course, it is now also at 800 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.689
 People kropp of you really cool people 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.639
 the write then somehow and 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.249
 I'll say under 800 are 15 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.319
 The writing scooters are gay 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:55.949
 I already have all these 15 people 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.479
 removed from this camera 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.400
 that's one thing to say 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.439
 shit i have no problem with but 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.610
 you should request for a justification as 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.210
 First of all, you should be under each one 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.210
 write video 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.970
 because that's gay 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.980
 There are bigger things to think about 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.780
 can upset 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.000
 i am a calm person i would 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.460
 Do not worry about anything when we are people 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.700
 I'm stupid stupid people I even have 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.370
 Do not drink so many in the comments 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.650
 at first weird but in 4 communitys 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.790
 you have people who are just stupid so 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.440
 I mean that they know that they are stupid 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.770
 but I was completely stupid 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.430
 Mass at honestly just when you are 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:49.920
 tweets there are many bigger tweets 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:52.280
 twitter tweet streamer they have 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.480
 sapporo in it 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.600
 eg gold run has the inside 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.400
 I know how to treat you by yourself 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.250
 even hand greets largest German 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.840
 Commissioner extreme also very often from 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.010
 and in there but you need this city 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.720
 Not at all if you are a reasonable one 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:15.470
 community award for example also has 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.009
 an average of around 12,000 views and 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.689
 Has 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.610
 no subscription trendy summer its 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:23.229
 community is in order and find that 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.339
 I really cool you are a sensible 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.869
 community i probably already have there 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:32.229
 I also have to take a stand today 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:34.180
 even on the subject of cool I know it 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.580
 some 3 j dolls or roller tuning 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.430
 whatsapp groups emerged over the 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.259
 facebook group emerged is like that 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.669
 very cool when people get together 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:47.550
 if you get to know each other, that's just right 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:49.930
 the goal of the facebook group 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.309
 but I want to say it again briefly 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.409
 I am not responsible for any content 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:54.509
 went this whatsapp group made 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:56.800
 become 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.849
 why is that so easy I am 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.110
 not in this group I am not 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.159
 I am not a human being 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.349
 think like 1000 friends on facebook 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:04.680
 I need my 50 with those 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:07.680
 I'm also satisfied then 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.680
 certainly 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:17.979
 So we do exactly why I am the subject 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:19.389
 so that someone can get a picture in 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.330
 the group has posted which 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:25.180
 nothing at all with the roller tuning 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.740
 quite the contrary has to do so 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.629
 not in the opposite white just stops 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.069
 just was not in the group on it 

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:31.539
 That person kicked out about it 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:35.349
 was informed and basically wants 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:36.729
 I say that when that person does that 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:38.500
 has kept right rauszuschmeissen 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:39.550
 then that is likely to be 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.820
 There is no need for one 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:46.670
 justify me and yes 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.270
 that's what I have to say 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:52.370
 exactly 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.370
 I'm Klöckner's driving role
