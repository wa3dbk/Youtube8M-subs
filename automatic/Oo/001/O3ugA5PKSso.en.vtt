update<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.679> my<00:00:13.860> filtration<00:00:14.519> I've<00:00:14.969> got<00:00:15.179> all<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
update on my filtration I've got all the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.349 
update on my filtration I've got all the
matrix<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.789> doubling<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> egg

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359

matrix in the doubling up on the egg
crate<00:00:18.690> really<00:00:19.140> worked<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:20.660> staggered<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.810> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
crate really worked I staggered it this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.029 
crate really worked I staggered it this
way<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.160> front<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.660> side<00:00:25.039> that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
way to the front and to the side that

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.330 
way to the front and to the side that
holes<00:00:26.250> are<00:00:26.640> actually<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.630> quarter<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:29.099> what

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
holes are actually a quarter of what

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.209 
holes are actually a quarter of what
they<00:00:29.369> used<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:30.439> and<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.529> don't<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.890> any

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
they used to be and I don't have any

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.950 
they used to be and I don't have any
pieces<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:33.059> fell<00:00:33.690> through<00:00:34.130> all<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.340> pieces

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
pieces that fell through all the pieces

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.610 
pieces that fell through all the pieces
remained<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.170> top<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> egg<00:00:37.770> crate<00:00:39.469> so<00:00:40.469> I'm

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
remained on top of the egg crate so I'm

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.840 
remained on top of the egg crate so I'm
really<00:00:40.800> excited<00:00:40.980> about<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:43.640> went<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
really excited about that I went out and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.479 
really excited about that I went out and
I<00:00:44.910> bought<00:00:45.059> another<00:00:45.480> four<00:00:45.840> liters<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.590> matrix<00:00:47.160> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I bought another four liters of matrix I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.479 
I bought another four liters of matrix I
just<00:00:48.090> didn't<00:00:48.390> feel<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:50.280> later

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
just didn't feel that the the for later

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.200 
just didn't feel that the the for later
for<00:00:50.660> initial<00:00:51.660> leaders<00:00:52.370> was<00:00:53.370> thick<00:00:53.640> enough<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
for initial leaders was thick enough I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
for initial leaders was thick enough I
didn't<00:00:54.570> think<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> water<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.410> have

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
didn't think that the water would have

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.400 
didn't think that the water would have
enough<00:00:55.800> contact<00:00:56.280> time<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> matrix<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
enough contact time with the matrix so I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
enough contact time with the matrix so I
bought<00:00:58.710> four<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.190> liters<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
bought four more liters now I have a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.039 
bought four more liters now I have a
total<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.780> eight<00:01:01.050> liters<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.800> matrix<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
total of eight liters of matrix and

total of eight liters of matrix and
eight<00:01:04.049> gallons<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.799> bioballs<00:01:06.470> got<00:01:07.470> four

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
eight gallons of bioballs got four

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
eight gallons of bioballs got four
gallons<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.250> bio<00:01:08.400> balls<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.330> compartment

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
there I'm going to mount it up here I'll

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.659 
there I'm going to mount it up here I'll
put<00:02:50.189> a<00:02:50.220> 2x4<00:02:50.459> under<00:02:50.879> this<00:02:51.359> brace<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.519> paint<00:02:53.519> it

days and go ahead and test it out and

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.260 
days and go ahead and test it out and
once<00:05:24.160> all<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.760> know<00:05:24.820> that<00:05:25.060> all<00:05:25.150> the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.710 
and then aquascaping and none of this
will<00:05:41.740> matter<00:05:41.980> if<00:05:42.760> I<00:05:42.970> don't<00:05:43.210> do<00:05:43.600> the

will matter if I don't do the

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.350 
will matter if I don't do the
aquascaping<00:05:44.320> correctly<00:05:44.950> so<00:05:45.880> that's<00:05:46.180> that's

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
aquascaping correctly so that's that's

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.940 
aquascaping correctly so that's that's
the<00:05:46.540> critical<00:05:46.960> that's<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.260> most<00:05:47.440> critical
