so a little update on my last video
concerning<00:00:26.710> mantle<00:00:27.310> AMD<00:00:28.240> still<00:00:28.630> did<00:00:28.869> not

concerning mantle AMD still did not
release<00:00:29.290> their<00:00:29.500> drivers<00:00:29.920> for<00:00:30.100> mantle<00:00:30.520> just

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
release their drivers for mantle just

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.609 
release their drivers for mantle just
yet<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.420> I<00:00:31.480> don't<00:00:31.510> believe<00:00:31.750> they<00:00:32.169> have<00:00:32.380> come

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
yet and I don't believe they have come

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.860 
yet and I don't believe they have come
out<00:00:32.710> with<00:00:32.860> an<00:00:32.950> official<00:00:33.310> statement<00:00:33.580> so<00:00:34.510> we'll

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
out with an official statement so we'll

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.450 
out with an official statement so we'll
just<00:00:34.900> have<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.350> wait<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.530> see<00:00:35.710> until<00:00:36.040> they<00:00:36.309> put

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
just have to wait and see until they put

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.250 
just have to wait and see until they put
out<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.700> drivers<00:00:37.059> I'm<00:00:37.210> expecting<00:00:37.780> them<00:00:37.930> next

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
out the drivers I'm expecting them next

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.200 
out the drivers I'm expecting them next
week<00:00:38.440> maybe<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.800> week<00:00:38.890> after<00:00:39.160> that<00:00:39.370> I<00:00:39.760> don't

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
week maybe the week after that I don't

they will come out soon so I can do some

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.400 
they will come out soon so I can do some
benchmarks<00:00:48.820> for<00:00:48.879> you<00:00:49.059> guys<00:00:49.270> so<00:00:49.870> we<00:00:49.989> talked<00:00:50.230> a

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
benchmarks for you guys so we talked a

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.930 
benchmarks for you guys so we talked a
little<00:00:50.590> bit<00:00:50.770> about<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.129> upcoming<00:00:51.340> weapon

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
little bit about the upcoming weapon

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.729 
little bit about the upcoming weapon
tweaks<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.390> they<00:00:52.660> will<00:00:52.840> be<00:00:52.960> implementing<00:00:53.589> in

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
tweaks that they will be implementing in

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.520 
tweaks that they will be implementing in
febuary<00:00:54.580> we<00:00:55.479> already<00:00:55.809> covered<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.170> DMR's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
didn't experience any kind of a penis so

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.210 
didn't experience any kind of a penis so
I<00:01:03.790> am<00:01:04.089> really<00:01:04.360> glad<00:01:04.600> they<00:01:05.019> got<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.440> right<00:01:05.680> now

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
I am really glad they got that right now

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.460 
I am really glad they got that right now
in<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:06.520> next<00:01:06.729> upcoming<00:01:07.090> patch<00:01:07.659> or<00:01:07.960> patches

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
in the next upcoming patch or patches

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.210 
in the next upcoming patch or patches
don't<00:01:08.680> know<00:01:08.740> if<00:01:08.830> there's<00:01:08.979> going<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.190> be

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
don't know if there's going to be

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.190 
don't know if there's going to be
multiple<00:01:09.670> they<00:01:10.240> will<00:01:10.420> be<00:01:10.540> tweaking<00:01:10.990> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
multiple they will be tweaking the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200 
multiple they will be tweaking the
carbines<00:01:11.770> i<00:01:12.070> hope<00:01:12.310> i<00:01:12.430> pronounced<00:01:12.760> that<00:01:12.880> right

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
carbines i hope i pronounced that right

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.080 
carbines i hope i pronounced that right
i<00:01:13.270> think<00:01:13.540> i<00:01:13.630> did<00:01:13.840> i<00:01:14.049> think<00:01:14.320> i<00:01:14.380> did<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:15.580> shotguns

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
i think i did i think i did the shotguns

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.300 
i think i did i think i did the shotguns
along<00:01:16.479> with<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.780> grenades<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.470> some<00:01:18.190> of<00:01:18.250> the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
along with the grenades and some of the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.670 
along with the grenades and some of the
attachments<00:01:18.580> as<00:01:18.940> well<00:01:19.210> i'll<00:01:20.080> cover<00:01:20.350> those

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
attachments as well i'll cover those

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.620 
attachments as well i'll cover those
that<00:01:21.159> matter<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.790> stand<00:01:22.119> out<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.420> me<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.540> most

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
that matter and stand out to me the most

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.860 
that matter and stand out to me the most
so<00:01:23.140> let's<00:01:23.470> get<00:01:23.770> right<00:01:24.070> into<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:25.510> let's<00:01:25.690> take

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
so let's get right into it so let's take

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.600 
so let's get right into it so let's take
a<00:01:25.930> look<00:01:26.110> at<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> shotguns<00:01:26.890> they<00:01:27.190> are<00:01:27.370> going<00:01:27.550> to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
a look at the shotguns they are going to

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.280 
a look at the shotguns they are going to
increase<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.090> accuracy<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.660> some<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.170> these

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
increase the accuracy of some of these

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.120 
increase the accuracy of some of these
shotguns<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:30.040> 872<00:01:30.640> hog<00:01:30.880> 12g<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:32.200> past<00:01:32.560> 12

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
shotguns the 872 hog 12g this past 12

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.510 
shotguns the 872 hog 12g this past 12
and<00:01:33.610> UTS<00:01:34.060> 15<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.750> be<00:01:34.900> specific<00:01:35.430> they're<00:01:36.430> going

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
and UTS 15 to be specific they're going

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.760 
and UTS 15 to be specific they're going
to<00:01:36.610> increase<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.000> ABS<00:01:37.540> as<00:01:37.810> well<00:01:38.110> as<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.410> onda

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
to increase the ABS as well as the onda

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.280 
to increase the ABS as well as the onda
move<00:01:38.950> accuracy<00:01:39.580> in<00:01:39.790> fact<00:01:40.120> it<00:01:40.570> will<00:01:40.750> be<00:01:40.930> doubled

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
move accuracy in fact it will be doubled

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.690 
move accuracy in fact it will be doubled
so<00:01:41.380> that's<00:01:41.560> pretty<00:01:41.770> interesting<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.460> see<00:01:42.610> how

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
so that's pretty interesting to see how

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.700 
so that's pretty interesting to see how
that's<00:01:42.910> going<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.090> play<00:01:43.150> out<00:01:43.360> they<00:01:44.320> did<00:01:44.560> this

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
that's going to play out they did this

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.050 
that's going to play out they did this
because<00:01:45.010> we<00:01:45.040> don't<00:01:45.280> really<00:01:45.400> have<00:01:45.580> any<00:01:45.700> barrels

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
because we don't really have any barrels

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.610 
because we don't really have any barrels
to<00:01:46.210> choose<00:01:46.480> from<00:01:46.660> that<00:01:46.930> affect<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.290> accuracy

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
to choose from that affect the accuracy

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.220 
to choose from that affect the accuracy
especially<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.790> one<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.180> slug<00:01:49.540> so<00:01:50.110> it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
especially that one of the slug so it

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.050 
especially that one of the slug so it
would<00:01:50.440> make<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.830> slug<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.160> lot<00:01:51.460> more<00:01:51.610> effective

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
would make the slug a lot more effective

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.450 
would make the slug a lot more effective
at<00:01:52.180> medium<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.810> close<00:01:53.050> range<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:53.920> good<00:01:54.280> news

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
at medium to close range so good news

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.040 
at medium to close range so good news
overall<00:01:54.910> for<00:01:55.240> all<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.480> shotties<00:01:55.900> out

overall for all of you shotties out
there<00:01:56.230> I<00:01:56.260> haven't<00:01:56.560> really<00:01:56.740> used<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.010> slugs

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
there I haven't really used the slugs

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.370 
there I haven't really used the slugs
myself<00:01:57.880> just<00:01:58.150> yet<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:58.510> I<00:01:58.690> can't<00:01:58.750> really<00:01:59.170> give

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
myself just yet so I can't really give

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.710 
myself just yet so I can't really give
you<00:01:59.500> my<00:01:59.650> opinion<00:01:59.740> on<00:02:00.160> it<00:02:00.340> but<00:02:01.000> I<00:02:01.300> did<00:02:01.480> notice

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
you my opinion on it but I did notice

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.570 
you my opinion on it but I did notice
the<00:02:01.900> hipfire<00:02:02.170> accuracy<00:02:02.620> on<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:02.980> move<00:02:03.190> could<00:02:03.400> be

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
the hipfire accuracy on a move could be

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.649 
the hipfire accuracy on a move could be
a<00:02:03.610> little<00:02:03.850> bit<00:02:04.030> better<00:02:04.210> on<00:02:04.270> some<00:02:04.540> of<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
a little bit better on some of the

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.820 
a little bit better on some of the
shotguns<00:02:05.080> actually<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.470> lot<00:02:05.620> better

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
shotguns actually a lot better

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.850 
shotguns actually a lot better
especially<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.909> 870<00:02:07.480> so<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.750> fix<00:02:08.019> yeah<00:02:08.500> it

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
especially the 870 so to fix yeah it

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.919 
especially the 870 so to fix yeah it
makes<00:02:09.009> sense<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.399> me<00:02:09.429> now<00:02:09.729> on<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.629> the<00:02:10.659> care

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
makes sense to me now on to the care

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.740 
makes sense to me now on to the care
binds<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.560> cata<00:02:11.860> beans<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.420> carbines<00:02:13.420> of

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
binds the cata beans the carbines of

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.089 
binds the cata beans the carbines of
what<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.200> whatever<00:02:14.470> yeah<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.709> can't<00:02:14.950> pronounce

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
what the whatever yeah I can't pronounce

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.460 
what the whatever yeah I can't pronounce
that<00:02:15.310> word<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:16.150> mtar<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:16.840> going<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.290> have<00:02:17.440> its

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that word the mtar is going to have its

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.850 
that word the mtar is going to have its
long-range<00:02:18.069> damage<00:02:18.580> reduced<00:02:19.140> which<00:02:20.140> which<00:02:20.680> is

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
long-range damage reduced which which is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.229 
long-range damage reduced which which is
actually<00:02:21.040> kind<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.489> surprising<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.090> me<00:02:22.209> I

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
actually kind of surprising to me I

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.720 
actually kind of surprising to me I
really<00:02:22.420> don't<00:02:22.690> think<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.930> Emperor<00:02:23.379> needs<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
really don't think the Emperor needs the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.520 
really don't think the Emperor needs the
damage<00:02:25.120> reduction<00:02:25.360> over<00:02:25.659> distance<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:26.440> we

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
damage reduction over distance if we

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.890 
damage reduction over distance if we
compare<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.129> acw-r<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.090> mtar<00:02:28.569> does<00:02:28.870> a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
compare it to the acw-r the mtar does a

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.800 
compare it to the acw-r the mtar does a
minimum<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.260> 18<00:02:29.739> damage<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.430> acw-r<00:02:31.269> does

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
minimum of 18 damage and the acw-r does

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.290 
minimum of 18 damage and the acw-r does
a<00:02:32.019> minimum<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.889> 15<00:02:33.459> damage

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
a minimum of 15 damage

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.090 
a minimum of 15 damage
and<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.660> mtar<00:02:35.050> also<00:02:35.560> has<00:02:35.710> more<00:02:35.920> range

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
and the mtar also has more range

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.920 
and the mtar also has more range
compared<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.820> acw-r<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.660> would<00:02:37.900> make

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
compared to the acw-r so it would make

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.250 
compared to the acw-r so it would make
sense<00:02:38.220> they<00:02:39.220> would<00:02:39.460> adjust<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.690> make<00:02:40.960> it

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
sense they would adjust that and make it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.800 
sense they would adjust that and make it
make<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.680> par<00:02:41.890> with<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.070> day's<00:02:42.340> ela<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.150> CCW

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
make it on par with the day's ela a CCW

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.370 
make it on par with the day's ela a CCW
ours<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:45.340> we<00:02:45.490> go<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:46.600> order<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.140> make<00:02:47.350> it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
ours there we go in order to make it

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.070 
ours there we go in order to make it
more<00:02:48.130> balanced<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.480> me<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.720> fact<00:02:49.870> that

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
more balanced but to me the fact that

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.990 
more balanced but to me the fact that
the<00:02:50.230> mtar<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.770> already<00:02:51.160> somewhat<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.910> a

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the mtar is already somewhat of a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.670 
the mtar is already somewhat of a
challenging<00:02:52.510> weapon<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.990> use<00:02:53.050> at<00:02:53.260> long<00:02:53.410> range

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
challenging weapon to use at long range

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.900 
challenging weapon to use at long range
because<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.040> its<00:02:54.160> rate<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.340> fire<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.880> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
because of its rate of fire and the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.420 
because of its rate of fire and the
recoil<00:02:55.420> not<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.720> mention<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.140> reload<00:02:56.500> time<00:02:56.530> it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
recoil not to mention the reload time it

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.520 
recoil not to mention the reload time it
already<00:02:57.880> feels<00:02:58.270> pretty<00:02:58.570> balanced<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.170> me<00:02:59.290> so

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
already feels pretty balanced to me so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.530 
already feels pretty balanced to me so
I'm<00:02:59.650> curious<00:02:59.860> what<00:03:00.400> they<00:03:00.640> will<00:03:00.850> do<00:03:01.060> about<00:03:01.210> the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
I'm curious what they will do about the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.920 
I'm curious what they will do about the
damage<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.200> am<00:03:02.770> really<00:03:03.190> glad<00:03:03.580> for<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.150> next<00:03:04.540> fix

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
damage I am really glad for the next fix

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.590 
damage I am really glad for the next fix
they<00:03:05.500> fixed<00:03:05.980> or<00:03:06.160> will<00:03:06.430> fix<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.240> accuracy

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
they fixed or will fix the in accuracy

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.300 
they fixed or will fix the in accuracy
penalty<00:03:08.050> when<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.320> transition<00:03:08.860> from<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.190> hip

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
fire to aiming down sights fire ABS fire

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.000 
fire to aiming down sights fire ABS fire
previously<00:03:12.880> if<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.210> fired<00:03:13.540> before<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.620> ABS

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
previously if you fired before the ABS

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.220 
previously if you fired before the ABS
animation<00:03:15.550> was<00:03:15.670> done<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.540> would<00:03:16.720> keep<00:03:16.960> that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
animation was done you would keep that

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.020 
animation was done you would keep that
in<00:03:17.410> accuracy<00:03:17.800> penalty<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.700> would<00:03:18.850> make<00:03:19.000> it

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
in accuracy penalty and it would make it

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.340 
in accuracy penalty and it would make it
really<00:03:19.510> difficult<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:20.020> hit<00:03:20.110> anything

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
really difficult to hit anything

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.260 
really difficult to hit anything
especially<00:03:20.710> with<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.130> LMGs<00:03:21.550> in<00:03:21.790> close

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
especially with the LMGs in close

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.450 
especially with the LMGs in close
quarter<00:03:22.540> situations<00:03:23.140> so<00:03:23.800> they<00:03:24.250> will<00:03:24.400> be

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
quarter situations so they will be

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.010 
quarter situations so they will be
getting<00:03:24.850> rid<00:03:25.060> of<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.330> which<00:03:25.570> I'm<00:03:25.750> really

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
getting rid of that which I'm really

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.740 
getting rid of that which I'm really
excited<00:03:26.200> about<00:03:26.740> so<00:03:27.250> one<00:03:27.490> now<00:03:27.700> using<00:03:28.150> LMGs<00:03:28.570> in

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
excited about so one now using LMGs in

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.840 
excited about so one now using LMGs in
close<00:03:28.960> quarters<00:03:29.440> will<00:03:29.770> make<00:03:30.010> more<00:03:30.220> sense<00:03:30.280> and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
close quarters will make more sense and

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.270

at what they will be tweakin heah they

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.020 
at what they will be tweakin heah they

along<00:04:07.540> with<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.780> damage<00:04:08.020> to<00:04:08.200> make<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.680> more

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
along with the damage to make it more

been unlocked so if you want something

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.180 
been unlocked so if you want something
that<00:04:13.480> drops<00:04:13.750> people<00:04:14.110> fast<00:04:14.380> in<00:04:14.590> close<00:04:14.770> quarters

that drops people fast in close quarters
the<00:04:15.730> m1911<00:04:16.630> will<00:04:16.930> become<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.709> pistol<00:04:18.130> of

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
the m1911 will become the pistol of

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.130 
the m1911 will become the pistol of
choice<00:04:18.430> if<00:04:18.700> they<00:04:18.760> do<00:04:18.970> things<00:04:19.450> right<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.780> is

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
choice if they do things right that is

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.710 
choice if they do things right that is
and<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:21.130> guess<00:04:21.370> he<00:04:21.489> come<00:04:21.609> back<00:04:21.730> 45<00:04:22.150> will<00:04:22.510> make

and I guess he come back 45 will make

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.060 
and I guess he come back 45 will make
more<00:04:22.900> sense<00:04:22.960> for<00:04:23.260> those<00:04:23.470> of<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:23.710> who<00:04:23.860> like<00:04:24.040> to

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
have little extra ammo in the clip they

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.560 
have little extra ammo in the clip they
will<00:04:26.950> also<00:04:27.130> be<00:04:27.430> increasing<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.000> damage<00:04:28.330> of

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
will also be increasing the damage of
