00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
leave you know kind of figure the tree

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
leave you know kind of figure the tree
out<00:01:05.670> those<00:01:05.940> kinds<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> things<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.410> see

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
out those kinds of things and just see

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
out those kinds of things and just see
how<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> runs<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.220> saw<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.850> TV<00:01:08.940> one<00:01:09.300> time

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
how it runs I saw this on TV one time

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.630 
how it runs I saw this on TV one time
they<00:01:09.630> put<00:01:09.780> water<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.520> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
they put water here and I think it's so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.690 
they put water here and I think it's so
they<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> tire<00:01:12.150> spin<00:01:12.509> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.580

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
I got a little bit of stuff done to it
just<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.829> blower<00:01:20.039> pulley<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> few

just a blower pulley and and a few
things<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.079> that<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.649> runs<00:01:22.829> pretty<00:01:23.070> good

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
things like that but it runs pretty good

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.630

for<00:01:23.960> for<00:01:24.960> all<00:01:25.079> stock<00:01:25.409> mustang<00:01:26.340> I'll<00:01:26.490> put<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
for for all stock mustang I'll put a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.389 
for for all stock mustang I'll put a
tire<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.539> least<00:01:27.570> leaves<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.649> line

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
tire on it so at least leaves the line

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.149 
tire on it so at least leaves the line
pretty<00:01:29.729> good<00:01:30.409> get<00:01:31.409> some<00:01:31.560> traction<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
pretty good get some traction out the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
pretty good get some traction out the
hole<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.579> let<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> weight<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.689> see<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:33.899> she

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
hole so let the weight and see what she

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:49.219 
hole so let the weight and see what she
does<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.670> we<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:45.560> it's<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.679> spinning<00:01:48.170> what<00:01:49.170> do

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
