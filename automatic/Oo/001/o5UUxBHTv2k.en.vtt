itself and get tanky like that's one
really<00:04:12.629> big<00:04:12.750> flaw<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.049> this<00:04:13.349> which<00:04:13.530> means

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
really big flaw to this which means

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.110 
really big flaw to this which means
you're<00:04:13.919> completely<00:04:14.220> vulnerable<00:04:14.459> when<00:04:14.940> you're

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
you're completely vulnerable when you're

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.490 
you're completely vulnerable when you're
in<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.389> golden<00:04:15.690> gun<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.049> got<00:04:16.199> to<00:04:16.320> strike

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
in the golden gun so you got to strike

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.890 
in the golden gun so you got to strike
fast<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.099> strike<00:04:17.489> hard<00:04:17.760> when<00:04:18.389> using<00:04:18.780> it

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
fast and strike hard when using it

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.810 
fast and strike hard when using it
another<00:04:19.410> downfall<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:20.190> class<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.639> the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
another downfall to this class is the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.790 
another downfall to this class is the
grenades<00:04:21.150> again<00:04:21.570> they're<00:04:21.840> more<00:04:22.019> on<00:04:22.650> the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
grenades again they're more on the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.250 
grenades again they're more on the
defensive<00:04:23.250> side<00:04:23.460> with<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:24.120> grenades<00:04:25.110> that

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
defensive side with the grenades that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.750 
defensive side with the grenades that
basically<00:04:25.530> barricade<00:04:26.039> yourself<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.550> and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
basically barricade yourself in and

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.230 
basically barricade yourself in and
kaput

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
kaput

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.550 
kaput
I guess<00:04:27.449> kind<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.810> channel<00:04:28.020> people<00:04:28.380> into

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
I guess kind of channel people into

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.710 
I guess kind of channel people into
where<00:04:28.680> you'd<00:04:28.800> like<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.009> go<00:04:29.330> but<00:04:30.330> for<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.569> most

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
where you'd like to go but for the most

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.240 
where you'd like to go but for the most
part<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.110> incendiary<00:04:31.380> grenade<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.889> not<00:04:32.039> half

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
part the incendiary grenade is not half

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.950 
part the incendiary grenade is not half
bad<00:04:32.280> unfortunately<00:04:33.060> it's<00:04:33.210> not<00:04:33.389> an<00:04:33.509> impact

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
bad unfortunately it's not an impact

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.210 
bad unfortunately it's not an impact
grenade<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.440> when<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.710> lands<00:04:34.889> that<00:04:35.099> would

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
grenade like when it lands that would

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.260 
grenade like when it lands that would
have<00:04:35.310> been<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:35.430> beautiful<00:04:35.819> thing<00:04:36.000> but<00:04:36.180> it

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
have been a beautiful thing but it

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.520 
have been a beautiful thing but it
really<00:04:36.389> has<00:04:36.569> like<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.780> second<00:04:37.199> until<00:04:37.380> it

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
really has like a second until it

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.499 
really has like a second until it
explodes<00:04:37.889> after<00:04:38.099> it's<00:04:38.490> actually<00:04:38.849> impacted<00:04:39.389> a

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
explodes after it's actually impacted a

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.900 
explodes after it's actually impacted a
surface<00:04:40.050> which<00:04:40.770> kind<00:04:41.039> of<00:04:41.130> makes<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.430> sucky<00:04:41.819> but

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
surface which kind of makes it sucky but

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.430 
surface which kind of makes it sucky but
it<00:04:42.030> also<00:04:42.180> allows<00:04:42.539> you<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.780> have<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.050> ability

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
it also allows you to have the ability

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.170 
it also allows you to have the ability
to<00:04:43.470> ricochet<00:04:43.919> things<00:04:44.370> bounce<00:04:44.610> things<00:04:44.880> off<00:04:45.120> of

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
to ricochet things bounce things off of

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.749 
to ricochet things bounce things off of
you<00:04:45.900> know<00:04:46.050> wall<00:04:46.289> frames<00:04:46.650> walls<00:04:47.039> signs<00:04:47.520> or

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
you know wall frames walls signs or

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.580 
you know wall frames walls signs or
anything<00:04:47.789> like<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.630> actually<00:04:48.960> kind<00:04:49.440> of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
anything like that to actually kind of

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.200 
anything like that to actually kind of
sneak<00:04:49.830> it<00:04:49.979> into<00:04:50.130> an<00:04:50.370> area<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:50.759> it<00:04:50.880> does<00:04:51.000> have

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
sneak it into an area so it does have

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.360 
sneak it into an area so it does have
its<00:04:51.360> benefits<00:04:51.419> but<00:04:51.960> again<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.380> grenades<00:04:53.190> are

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
its benefits but again the grenades are

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.100 
its benefits but again the grenades are
not<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.789> greatest<00:04:54.060> for<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:54.479> so<00:04:54.900> with<00:04:55.020> that

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
not the greatest for this so with that

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.689 
not the greatest for this so with that
being<00:04:55.319> said<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.620> still<00:04:55.740> recommend<00:04:56.280> you<00:04:56.490> guys<00:04:56.639> to
