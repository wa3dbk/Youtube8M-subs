00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.670 

so<00:00:00.450> here<00:00:00.630> we<00:00:00.719> are<00:00:00.750> again<00:00:00.960> on<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.350> posterior

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
so here we are again on the posterior

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.249 
so here we are again on the posterior
thigh<00:00:02.429> let's<00:00:02.760> get<00:00:02.850> orientated<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.020> still

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
thigh let's get orientated this is still

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.390 
thigh let's get orientated this is still
the<00:00:04.350> lower<00:00:04.529> extremity<00:00:05.009> as<00:00:05.069> you<00:00:05.130> can<00:00:05.220> see

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
the lower extremity as you can see

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.950 
the lower extremity as you can see
here's<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.730> lumbar<00:00:06.089> vertebra<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.629> sacrum

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
here's the lumbar vertebra is the sacrum

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960 
here's the lumbar vertebra is the sacrum
so<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.170> sides<00:00:07.379> medial<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.490> side<00:00:08.670> this

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
so the sides medial on this side this

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.610 
so the sides medial on this side this
side<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.540> posterior<00:00:10.110> compartment<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
side is the posterior compartment of the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.799 
side is the posterior compartment of the
leg<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.370> we're<00:00:11.639> talking<00:00:11.790> about<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.240> group<00:00:12.630> of

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
leg so we're talking about this group of

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.120 
leg so we're talking about this group of
muscles<00:00:13.200> there's<00:00:13.469> only<00:00:13.620> three<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.009> them

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
muscles there's only three of them

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.919 
muscles there's only three of them
collectively<00:00:14.700> called<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.059> hamstrings<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
collectively called the hamstrings and

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.750 
collectively called the hamstrings and
so<00:00:16.560> as<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:16.980> take<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.130> look<00:00:17.279> at<00:00:17.400> these<00:00:17.490> three

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
so as we take a look at these three

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.010 
so as we take a look at these three
muscles<00:00:18.119> I'm<00:00:18.210> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> pull<00:00:18.539> aside<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
muscles I'm going to pull aside the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.929 
muscles I'm going to pull aside the
gluteus<00:00:19.350> maximus<00:00:19.500> oh<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.400> see<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> origin

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
gluteus maximus oh we can see the origin

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.900 
gluteus maximus oh we can see the origin
a<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:21.150> bit<00:00:21.240> easier<00:00:22.340> where<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
a little bit easier where they all go to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880 
a little bit easier where they all go to
the<00:00:24.180> ischial<00:00:24.660> tuberosities<00:00:25.170> except<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.680> half

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the ischial tuberosities except for half

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.800 
the ischial tuberosities except for half
of<00:00:26.039> one<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.369> muscles<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> can

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
of one of the muscles and so as you can

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.509 
of one of the muscles and so as you can
take<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> look<00:00:28.140> let's<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.500> orientated<00:00:29.039> again

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
take a look let's get orientated again

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.970 
take a look let's get orientated again
lateral<00:00:30.240> side<00:00:30.420> medial<00:00:31.050> side<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.740> let's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
lateral side medial side and so let's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.500 
lateral side medial side and so let's
take<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> look<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> first<00:00:32.730> muscle<00:00:32.969> that's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
take a look at the first muscle that's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.240 
take a look at the first muscle that's
on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> lateral<00:00:34.050> side<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> called<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
on the lateral side this is called the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.610 
on the lateral side this is called the
biceps<00:00:35.820> femoris<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.170> why<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:37.500> get

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
biceps femoris this is why you don't get

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.930 
biceps femoris this is why you don't get
any<00:00:37.800> credit<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.370> say<00:00:38.460> hey<00:00:38.670> there's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
any credit if you just say hey there's

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.430 
any credit if you just say hey there's
the<00:00:39.030> biceps<00:00:39.420> which<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.140> are<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> talking

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the biceps which one are you talking

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.110 
the biceps which one are you talking
about<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> arm<00:00:41.250> biceps<00:00:41.969> brachii

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
about the one in the arm biceps brachii

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
about the one in the arm biceps brachii
or<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> Bisons<00:00:43.020> form<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> leg<00:00:43.890> or

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
or the Bisons form or is in the leg or

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
or the Bisons form or is in the leg or
the<00:00:44.219> thigh<00:00:44.460> as<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.020> there's<00:00:46.350> because

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the thigh as you can see there's because

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.229 
the thigh as you can see there's because
of<00:00:47.039> biceps<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.550> guys<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.850> always<00:00:48.000> still

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
of biceps you guys are always still

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
of biceps you guys are always still
responsible<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.780> both<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> head<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
responsible for both of the head so this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
responsible for both of the head so this
is<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> long<00:00:50.370> head<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.700> biceps<00:00:51.120> from<00:00:51.300> Oris<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
is the long head of biceps from Oris and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
is the long head of biceps from Oris and
if<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.870> pull<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.469> though<00:00:53.010> there<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
if I pull this up though there is the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.520 
if I pull this up though there is the
short<00:00:54.480> head<00:00:54.629> you'll<00:00:54.809> notice<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.320> lift

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
short head you'll notice that if I lift

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
short head you'll notice that if I lift
this<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.980> kind<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.129> makes<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> V<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this up it kind of makes a V here is the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.619 
this up it kind of makes a V here is the
short<00:00:58.020> head<00:00:58.199> biceps<00:00:58.710> femoris<00:00:59.359> resting<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.480> in

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
short head biceps femoris resting and in

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.869 
short head biceps femoris resting and in
turning<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> Linea<00:01:01.350> aspera<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> issue<00:01:02.760> o

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
turning on the Linea aspera so issue o

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.240 
turning on the Linea aspera so issue o
tuberosities<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.860> Linea

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
tuberosities here and then the Linea

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.280 
tuberosities here and then the Linea
aspera<00:01:05.280> off<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.090> short<00:01:06.420> head<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> biceps<00:01:07.080> for

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
aspera off the short head of biceps for

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.890 
aspera off the short head of biceps for
more<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.010> biceps<00:01:08.369> femoris<00:01:08.900> long

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
more so that's the biceps femoris long

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
more so that's the biceps femoris long
and<00:01:10.260> short<00:01:10.650> head<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.490> other<00:01:11.640> two

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and short head and then these other two

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
and short head and then these other two
are<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> next<00:01:12.450> two<00:01:12.720> muscles<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.320> lays<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.710> top

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
are the next two muscles one lays on top

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.160 
are the next two muscles one lays on top
of<00:01:14.010> another<00:01:14.130> these<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> two<00:01:14.790> semis<00:01:15.240> one

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
of another these are the two semis one

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.840 
of another these are the two semis one
called<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> semitendinosus<00:01:16.950> cuz<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
called the semitendinosus cuz on the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
called the semitendinosus cuz on the
cadaver<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.540> turns<00:01:19.049> into<00:01:19.229> half<00:01:19.590> tendon<00:01:20.100> all

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
cadaver it turns into half tendon all

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.429 
cadaver it turns into half tendon all
the<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.729> laying<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.720> top<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> wider

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the way down laying on top of the wider

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.880 
the way down laying on top of the wider
which<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.909> both<00:01:24.509> sides<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.229> would

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
which all this both sides of this would

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
which all this both sides of this would
be<00:01:26.009> considered<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.460> semi<00:01:26.850> member<00:01:27.420> notice<00:01:27.750> if

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
be considered the semi member notice if

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
be considered the semi member notice if
I<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.140> pick<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.340> lift

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
I can pick this up and just kind of lift

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
I can pick this up and just kind of lift
it<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.360> would<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.930> able<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it up like we would be able to do on a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.569 
it up like we would be able to do on a
cadaver<00:01:31.530> you'll<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:31.950> able<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.369> looks

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
cadaver you'll be able to see it looks

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
cadaver you'll be able to see it looks
like<00:01:32.700> half<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.119> membrane<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.200> semi

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
like half of a membrane so we got semi

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160 
like half of a membrane so we got semi
tendinosis<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.310> top<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:35.970> more<00:01:36.299> superficial<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
tendinosis on top or more superficial to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.280 
tendinosis on top or more superficial to
that<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> semi<00:01:37.979> member<00:01:38.850> gnosis<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> my

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
that of the semi member gnosis one of my

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.830 
that of the semi member gnosis one of my
old<00:01:40.439> professors<00:01:40.829> always<00:01:41.009> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.340> seeing<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
old professors always kind of seeing the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.020 
old professors always kind of seeing the
tendonosis<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> membrane<00:01:43.470> gnosis

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
tendonosis on the membrane gnosis

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
tendonosis on the membrane gnosis
tendonosis<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> membrane<00:01:45.600> gnosis<00:01:46.049> just

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
tendonosis on the membrane gnosis just

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.280 
tendonosis on the membrane gnosis just
like<00:01:46.759> Cypress<00:01:47.759> Hills<00:01:47.939> old<00:01:48.240> song<00:01:48.659> would<00:01:49.049> say

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
like Cypress Hills old song would say

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.990 
like Cypress Hills old song would say
insane<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> membrane<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.670> like

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
insane on the membrane just like

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.639 
insane on the membrane just like
tenderness<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.840> top<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.439> member

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
tenderness is on top of the member

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
tenderness is on top of the member
gnosis<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.159> member<00:01:53.579> doses<00:01:53.909> onto<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> tender

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
gnosis not member doses onto the tender

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
gnosis not member doses onto the tender
so<00:01:55.170> tendonosis<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.920> top<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> member<00:01:56.610> doses

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
so tendonosis on top of the member doses

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.440 
so tendonosis on top of the member doses
so<00:01:57.060> semitendinosus<00:01:58.130> semimembranosus<00:01:59.450> biceps

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
