00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
opinion so again it's a plastic base car

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.150 
opinion so again it's a plastic base car

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.259 

and<00:02:45.950> then<00:02:46.459> after<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.820> get<00:02:46.880> done<00:02:47.090> with<00:02:47.150> these

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
and then after I get done with these

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.080 
and then after I get done with these
Ferraris<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:48.290> week<00:02:48.730> because<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.880> probably

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
Ferraris this week because I probably

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
take about a week I probably might

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.320 
take about a week I probably might
switch<00:02:55.100> back<00:02:55.340> up<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.880> Johnny<00:02:56.060> lightning

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
to be main lines and then we'll go

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.790

but<00:03:19.940> individual<00:03:20.420> cars<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:22.010> then<00:03:22.130> hopefully

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
but individual cars and then hopefully

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.300 
but individual cars and then hopefully
the<00:03:23.209> next<00:03:23.329> Boulevard<00:03:23.959> which<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.200> think<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.709> don't

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
the next Boulevard which I think I don't

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.250 
the next Boulevard which I think I don't
think<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.549> latest<00:03:26.209> one<00:03:26.360> was<00:03:26.450> in<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.049> don't

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
think the latest one was in I don't

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.990 
think the latest one was in I don't
think<00:03:27.590> they're<00:03:27.769> actually<00:03:27.920> gonna<00:03:28.280> be<00:03:28.459> doing<00:03:28.489> oh

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
think they're actually gonna be doing oh

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.240 
think they're actually gonna be doing oh
I<00:03:29.600> think<00:03:29.780> they<00:03:29.989> go<00:03:30.140> right<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.560> P<00:03:30.860> for<00:03:31.130> some

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
I think they go right to P for some

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.630 
I think they go right to P for some
reason<00:03:31.579> but<00:03:31.730> not<00:03:32.079> sure<00:03:33.079> about<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.470> just<00:03:34.430> from

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
reason but not sure about that just from

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.800 
reason but not sure about that just from
looking<00:03:35.000> around

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
looking around

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.050 
looking around
looks<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.650> next<00:03:36.860> next<00:03:37.220> case<00:03:37.400> with<00:03:37.609> P

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.710 

and<00:03:44.060> then<00:03:44.360> hopefully<00:03:45.110> some<00:03:45.530> more<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.720> pop
