keep<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.869> ball<00:01:40.049> don't<00:01:40.380> let<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.649> get<00:01:40.770> away

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
keep that ball don't let it get away

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.919 
keep that ball don't let it get away
from<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.219> if<00:01:41.819> a<00:01:41.969> player<00:01:42.179> wants<00:01:42.359> to<00:01:42.509> come<00:01:42.749> in

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
from you if a player wants to come in

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.379 
from you if a player wants to come in
and<00:01:43.139> kick<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.889> away<00:01:44.009> okay<00:01:44.700> let's<00:01:44.909> look<00:01:45.090> at<00:01:45.210> this

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:45.389 
and kick it away okay let's look at this

00:01:45.389 --> 00:02:01.980 
and kick it away okay let's look at this
at<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.719> bit<00:01:45.990> faster<00:01:46.469> pace

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.930 

it's<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.110> few<00:02:03.409> more<00:02:03.619> important<00:02:04.159> tips<00:02:04.400> on<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
it's a few more important tips on the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.300 
it's a few more important tips on the
collapse<00:02:05.299> dive<00:02:05.890> notice<00:02:06.890> when<00:02:07.040> he's<00:02:07.130> going

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
collapse dive notice when he's going

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.949 
collapse dive notice when he's going
down<00:02:07.549> he's<00:02:07.729> bringing<00:02:08.119> up<00:02:08.240> his<00:02:08.390> other<00:02:08.539> knee<00:02:08.780> to

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
down he's bringing up his other knee to

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.130 
down he's bringing up his other knee to
protect<00:02:09.319> himself<00:02:10.420> okay<00:02:11.450> right<00:02:11.810> there<00:02:12.020> he's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
protect himself okay right there he's

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.059 
protect himself okay right there he's
protecting<00:02:12.650> himself

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
protecting himself

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.710 
protecting himself
when<00:02:13.459> he<00:02:13.550> does<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.150> ball<00:02:14.360> here<00:02:14.569> he's

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
when he does have the ball here he's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.290 
when he does have the ball here he's
almost<00:02:14.989> using<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.590> ground<00:02:15.860> as<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.670> third<00:02:17.060> hand

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
almost using the ground as a third hand

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.110 
almost using the ground as a third hand
to<00:02:17.540> keep<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.959> ball<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.350> his<00:02:19.310> grasp<00:02:19.550> okay<00:02:19.940> if

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
to keep the ball in his grasp okay if

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.610 
to keep the ball in his grasp okay if
he's<00:02:20.239> not<00:02:20.420> pushing<00:02:20.660> down<00:02:20.959> with<00:02:20.989> force<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:21.590> can

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
he's not pushing down with force I can

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.110 
he's not pushing down with force I can
come<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:22.340> get<00:02:22.610> rid<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:22.940> ball

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
come in and I can get rid of that ball

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.090 
come in and I can get rid of that ball
but<00:02:23.239> he's<00:02:23.360> pushing<00:02:23.720> down<00:02:23.870> on<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.200> ball<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
but he's pushing down on the ball on the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.710 
but he's pushing down on the ball on the
ground<00:02:25.340> making<00:02:25.700> sure<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.120> he<00:02:26.209> keeps<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.690> in

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
ground making sure that he keeps it in

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:35.580 
ground making sure that he keeps it in
his<00:02:26.870> control

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.890 

you

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.170 

next<00:02:40.709> let's<00:02:40.890> take<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.129> look<00:02:41.400> at<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> extended

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
next let's take a look at the extended

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.930 
next let's take a look at the extended
dive<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.160> you're<00:02:44.160> gonna<00:02:44.250> use<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.580> extended

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
dive so you're gonna use the extended

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.860 
dive so you're gonna use the extended
dive<00:02:45.180> for<00:02:45.480> both<00:02:45.660> low<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.080> high<00:02:46.410> saves

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
dive for both low and high saves

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.970 
dive for both low and high saves
basically<00:02:48.870> when<00:02:49.019> it's<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.470> ground<00:02:49.650> you're

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
basically when it's on the ground you're

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.770 
basically when it's on the ground you're
doing<00:02:50.340> pretty<00:02:50.640> much<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:51.180> collapsed<00:02:51.660> dive

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
doing pretty much a collapsed dive

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.750 
doing pretty much a collapsed dive
you're<00:02:52.019> just<00:02:52.170> pushing<00:02:52.410> off<00:02:52.769> with<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.430> little

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
you're just pushing off with a little

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.430 
you're just pushing off with a little
more<00:02:53.910> explosive<00:02:54.450> power<00:02:54.629> so<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> want<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.260> break

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
more explosive power so I want to break

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.369 
more explosive power so I want to break
that<00:02:55.650> down<00:02:55.830> Jane's<00:02:56.190> gonna<00:02:56.370> demonstrate<00:02:57.379> when

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
that down Jane's gonna demonstrate when

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.100 
that down Jane's gonna demonstrate when
he<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.709> show<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.459> difference<00:02:59.790> between<00:03:00.110> just

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
he is show the difference between just

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.320 
he is show the difference between just
collapsing<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:01.950> really<00:03:02.370> pushing<00:03:02.849> off<00:03:03.030> really

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
collapsing and really pushing off really

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.240 
collapsing and really pushing off really
exploding<00:03:03.959> okay<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.349> collapse<00:03:04.860> for<00:03:05.129> me

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
exploding okay so just collapse for me

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.830 
exploding okay so just collapse for me
here<00:03:05.430> he's<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.180> going<00:03:06.480> down<00:03:06.629> he's<00:03:06.810> just

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
here he's just going down he's just

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.900 
here he's just going down he's just
falling<00:03:07.319> down<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.680> ground<00:03:07.920> okay<00:03:08.610> at<00:03:08.790> this

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
falling down to the ground okay at this

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.280 
falling down to the ground okay at this
point<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.360> he<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.510> balls<00:03:09.870> would<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.080> further

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
point if he the balls would be further

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.890 
point if he the balls would be further
he's<00:03:10.560> really<00:03:10.799> got<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.040> push<00:03:11.220> off<00:03:11.540> okay<00:03:12.540> see<00:03:12.599> how

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
he's really got to push off okay see how

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.670 
he's really got to push off okay see how
he<00:03:12.959> almost<00:03:13.230> throws<00:03:13.709> himself<00:03:13.950> he<00:03:14.340> pushes<00:03:14.790> off

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
he almost throws himself he pushes off

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.809 
he almost throws himself he pushes off
really<00:03:16.680> getting<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:16.980> power<00:03:17.190> let's<00:03:17.489> go<00:03:17.640> one

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
really getting that power let's go one

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.180 
really getting that power let's go one
more<00:03:17.849> time

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
more time

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.650 
more time
okay<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.459> break<00:03:20.819> it<00:03:20.970> down<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.150> want<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> do

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
okay so just break it down I want to do

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.890 
okay so just break it down I want to do
it<00:03:21.750> without<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.650> put<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> ball<00:03:23.160> right<00:03:23.190> here

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
it without just put the ball right here

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.500 
it without just put the ball right here
okay<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.140> show<00:03:25.290> me<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.620> plant<00:03:26.420> notice<00:03:27.420> how

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
okay just show me the plant notice how

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.030 
okay just show me the plant notice how
he's<00:03:27.660> getting<00:03:27.870> real<00:03:28.049> low<00:03:28.230> he's<00:03:28.440> pushing<00:03:28.950> off

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
he's getting real low he's pushing off

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.069 
he's getting real low he's pushing off
let's<00:03:29.250> see<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.489> power<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.910> his<00:03:30.030> stride<00:03:30.299> good

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
let's see the power in his stride good

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.559 
let's see the power in his stride good
okay<00:03:31.530> he's<00:03:31.709> really<00:03:31.829> pushing<00:03:32.280> off<00:03:32.610> we<00:03:33.390> really

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
okay he's really pushing off we really

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.900 
okay he's really pushing off we really
got<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.720> explode<00:03:34.260> get<00:03:34.590> nice<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:34.890> low<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.459> then

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
got to explode get nice and low and then

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.869 
got to explode get nice and low and then
push<00:03:36.269> off<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.410> can<00:03:37.680> use<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:37.980> dive<00:03:38.190> for

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
push off so you can use this dive for

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.369 
push off so you can use this dive for
something<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.450> ground<00:03:39.629> if<00:03:39.989> it's<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
something on the ground if it's on the

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.690 
something on the ground if it's on the
ground<00:03:40.530> you're<00:03:40.739> gonna<00:03:40.829> use<00:03:41.040> your<00:03:41.069> bottom<00:03:41.549> hand

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
ground you're gonna use your bottom hand

gonna<00:04:07.360> give<00:04:07.570> him<00:04:07.750> more<00:04:07.960> momentum<00:04:08.470> if<00:04:08.590> he's

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
gonna give him more momentum if he's

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.500

just jumping with his legs down on the

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.150 
just jumping with his legs down on the
ground<00:04:10.750> it's<00:04:11.200> tough<00:04:11.440> for<00:04:11.560> him<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.740> get<00:04:11.920> height

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
ground it's tough for him to get height

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.620 
ground it's tough for him to get height
so<00:04:12.370> he's<00:04:12.490> really<00:04:12.760> jumpy<00:04:13.090> he's<00:04:13.330> bringing

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
so he's really jumpy he's bringing
