00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
those on highway bridges it was insane I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.170 
those on highway bridges it was insane I
really<00:02:43.800> hope<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.100> sniper<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.670> not<00:02:44.910> that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
really hope that sniper is not that

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.210 
really hope that sniper is not that
powerful<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.020> actual<00:02:46.500> game<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.980> that

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
powerful in the actual game and that

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.500 
powerful in the actual game and that
they<00:02:47.310> don't<00:02:47.520> have<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.700> kind<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.120> scope

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
they don't have that kind of scope

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.150 
they don't have that kind of scope
because<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:49.020> they<00:02:49.140> have<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.860> really

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
because if they have that you really

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.410 
because if they have that you really
could<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.460> sit<00:02:50.640> back<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:50.970> back<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.330> your

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
could just sit back in the back of your

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.960 
could just sit back in the back of your
map<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:52.470> watch<00:02:52.709> people<00:02:52.740> across<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.760> map

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
map and just watch people across the map

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.180 
map and just watch people across the map
and<00:02:54.209> then<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:54.450> snipe<00:02:54.750> them<00:02:54.930> through<00:02:55.350> giant

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
and then just snipe them through giant

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.460 
and then just snipe them through giant
rocks<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.450> bullet<00:02:57.660> penetrated<00:02:58.320> that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
rocks because the bullet penetrated that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.310 
rocks because the bullet penetrated that
solid<00:02:58.860> concrete<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.490> steel<00:02:59.670> frame<00:03:00.060> with<00:03:00.990> and

solid concrete and steel frame with and

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.570 
solid concrete and steel frame with and
still<00:03:01.530> killed<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.860> guy<00:03:01.950> behind<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.459> was

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
still killed the guy behind it it was

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.730 
still killed the guy behind it it was
insane<00:03:03.200> hopefully<00:03:04.200> they<00:03:04.320> don't<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.709> that

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
insane hopefully they don't have that

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.590 
insane hopefully they don't have that
another<00:03:05.459> thing<00:03:05.670> they<00:03:05.760> implemented<00:03:06.090> was<00:03:06.420> like

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
another thing they implemented was like

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.000 
another thing they implemented was like
you<00:03:07.050> brought<00:03:07.230> up<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.500> thing<00:03:07.709> on<00:03:07.830> your<00:03:07.950> wrist

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
you brought up this thing on your wrist

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.830 
you brought up this thing on your wrist
and<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.459> could<00:03:08.670> program<00:03:08.910> where<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.510> little

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
and you could program where this little

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.350 
and you could program where this little
fleet<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.560> these<00:03:11.370> floating<00:03:11.820> helicopter

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
fleet of these floating helicopter

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.490 
fleet of these floating helicopter
things<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.630> forget<00:03:12.870> what<00:03:12.930> they're<00:03:13.050> called<00:03:13.110> and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
things I forget what they're called and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.770 
things I forget what they're called and
they<00:03:14.310> would<00:03:14.459> go<00:03:14.640> out<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:14.880> attack<00:03:15.240> everyone

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
they would go out and attack everyone

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.090 
they would go out and attack everyone
over<00:03:16.080> there<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.350> was<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.800> cool<00:03:16.950> it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
over there that was really cool it

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.470 
over there that was really cool it
helped<00:03:17.250> provide<00:03:17.490> cover<00:03:17.790> hopefully<00:03:18.300> that

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
helped provide cover hopefully that

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.729 
helped provide cover hopefully that
might<00:03:18.720> actually<00:03:18.870> come<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.260> as<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.470> kill<00:03:19.650> streak

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
might actually come in as a kill streak

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.140 
might actually come in as a kill streak
that<00:03:19.980> would<00:03:20.100> be<00:03:20.160> really<00:03:20.310> cool<00:03:20.519> they<00:03:20.940> didn't

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
that would be really cool they didn't

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.490 
that would be really cool they didn't
seem<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.300> overpower<00:03:21.900> because<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> guy<00:03:22.470> was

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
seem that overpower because the guy was

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.830 
seem that overpower because the guy was
still<00:03:22.830> getting<00:03:23.010> shot<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.239> was<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:24.630> epic

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
still getting shot but that was so epic

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.509 
still getting shot but that was so epic
and<00:03:25.230> then<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.530> final<00:03:25.769> thing<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.370> they

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
and then the final thing that they

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.930 
and then the final thing that they
revealed<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.709> f-35s<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:29.040> get<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.340> fly<00:03:29.610> them

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
revealed is f-35s you get to fly them

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.240 
revealed is f-35s you get to fly them
and<00:03:30.150> now<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.290> first<00:03:31.500> part<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:31.980> flying

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
and now it the first part of the flying

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.220 
and now it the first part of the flying
you're<00:03:32.640> kind<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.150> hovering<00:03:33.510> around<00:03:33.720> over

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
you're kind of like hovering around over

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.199 
you're kind of like hovering around over
these<00:03:34.350> cars<00:03:34.650> really<00:03:34.950> slowly<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.700> you're<00:03:36.090> just

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
are coming at the cars because you're

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.820 
are coming at the cars because you're
trying<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.150> protect<00:03:39.480> them<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.750> then<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.560> says

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
trying to protect them and then it says
