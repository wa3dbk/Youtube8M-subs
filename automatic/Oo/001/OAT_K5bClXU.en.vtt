we need we don't need a department of

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.759 
we need we don't need a department of
energy<00:02:36.040> how<00:02:36.400> will<00:02:36.640> we<00:02:36.670> get<00:02:37.030> energy<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:38.319> market

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
energy how will we get energy the market

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.819 
energy how will we get energy the market
the<00:02:39.129> market<00:02:39.280> will<00:02:39.549> do<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:40.439> supplies<00:02:41.439> the<00:02:41.470> man

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
government that's the kind of thing that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.369 
government that's the kind of thing that
encourages<00:02:58.090> what's<00:02:58.629> wrong<00:02:58.810> with<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.109> the

wise elites in Washington will pick the

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.409 
wise elites in Washington will pick the
best<00:03:02.139> investment<00:03:02.799> well<00:03:03.340> might<00:03:03.760> end<00:03:03.970> up<00:03:04.150> that

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
best investment well might end up that

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.069 
best investment well might end up that
the<00:03:04.659> subsidies<00:03:05.109> might<00:03:05.349> go<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:07.079> producing

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
the subsidies might go to producing

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.890 
the subsidies might go to producing
ethanol<00:03:08.230> from<00:03:08.680> corn<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:10.389> might<00:03:10.569> turn<00:03:10.720> out

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
ethanol from corn and it might turn out

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.020 
ethanol from corn and it might turn out
it<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.379> going<00:03:11.680> there<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.370> might<00:03:12.549> turn<00:03:12.760> out<00:03:12.909> it

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
it is going there it might turn out it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.520 
it is going there it might turn out it
wasn't<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.389> best<00:03:13.540> investment<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.290> know

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
wasn't the best investment you know

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.140 
wasn't the best investment you know
maybe<00:03:14.769> it<00:03:14.889> costs<00:03:15.340> too<00:03:15.459> much<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.669> make<00:03:15.970> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
maybe it costs too much to make the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.659 
maybe it costs too much to make the
ethanol<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:17.680> somebody<00:03:17.950> maids<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.250> prophet

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
immediate agenda but in in theory they

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.339 
immediate agenda but in in theory they
are<00:03:33.579> unnecessary<00:03:34.449> and<00:03:34.750> we<00:03:34.959> should<00:03:35.169> think

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
are unnecessary and we should think

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.649 
are unnecessary and we should think
about<00:03:35.530> what<00:03:36.459> kind<00:03:36.639> of<00:03:36.729> a<00:03:36.819> country<00:03:37.150> would<00:03:37.359> have

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
about what kind of a country would have

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.050 
about what kind of a country would have
without<00:03:38.530> these<00:03:38.949> Department<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.669> I<00:03:39.729> think<00:03:39.940> we

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
without these Department and I think we

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.580 
without these Department and I think we
would<00:03:40.180> have<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.359> better<00:03:40.569> country<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.229> all

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
would have a better country and all

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.930 
would have a better country and all
those<00:03:41.769> problems<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.400> they're<00:03:42.519> supposed<00:03:42.849> to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
those problems that they're supposed to
