00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
let's get started first you're going to

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.460 
let's get started first you're going to
need<00:00:14.380> a<00:00:14.590> big<00:00:14.950> bowl<00:00:14.980> of<00:00:15.519> white<00:00:15.910> clay<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.630> you're

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
need a big bowl of white clay and you're

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.760 
need a big bowl of white clay and you're
going<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.740> flatten<00:00:18.280> down<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:18.670> edges<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:22.029> you

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
going to flatten down the edges and you

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.859 
going to flatten down the edges and you
can<00:00:23.770> use<00:00:23.920> water<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:24.490> smooth<00:00:25.000> out<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:25.480> clay<00:00:25.690> if

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
can use water to smooth out the clay if

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.720 
can use water to smooth out the clay if
there<00:00:26.020> are<00:00:26.109> any<00:00:26.230> fingerprints<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.220> then<00:00:27.520> I'm

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
there are any fingerprints and then I'm

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.880 
there are any fingerprints and then I'm
just<00:00:27.970> grabbing<00:00:28.480> onto<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.960> edges<00:00:29.320> of<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.619> clay

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
just grabbing onto the edges of the clay

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.780 
just grabbing onto the edges of the clay
and<00:00:30.130> pulling<00:00:30.640> out<00:00:30.880> to<00:00:31.750> give<00:00:32.259> a<00:00:32.610> sort<00:00:33.610> of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
and pulling out to give a sort of

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.580 
and pulling out to give a sort of
irregular<00:00:34.690> shape<00:00:35.020> to<00:00:35.380> the<00:00:35.500> egg<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:38.170> here<00:00:38.500> I'm

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
irregular shape to the egg and here I'm

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.509 
irregular shape to the egg and here I'm
just<00:00:38.620> flattening<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.340> down

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.700 

then<00:00:47.519> I'm<00:00:47.699> taking<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.180> big<00:00:48.510> ball<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.230> yellow

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
then I'm taking a big ball of yellow

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.830 
then I'm taking a big ball of yellow
clay<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.570> yoke

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
clay and that is going to be of a yoke

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
clay and that is going to be of a yoke
and<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.559> pressing<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.190> onto<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> white

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and I'm pressing that onto the white

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.229 
and I'm pressing that onto the white
part

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.540 

and<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.899> lot<00:01:00.020> of<00:01:00.110> you<00:01:00.200> asked<00:01:00.500> me<00:01:00.559> how<00:01:00.649> I<00:01:00.920> get<00:01:01.190> rid

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
and a lot of you asked me how I get rid

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.100 
and a lot of you asked me how I get rid
of<00:01:01.579> my<00:01:01.790> fingerprints<00:01:02.450> in<00:01:02.570> dust<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.050> that's

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
of my fingerprints in dust and that's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.960 
of my fingerprints in dust and that's
usually<00:01:03.320> how<00:01:03.590> I<00:01:03.620> do<00:01:03.770> it<00:01:04.010> just<00:01:04.190> with<00:01:04.339> water<00:01:04.670> and

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
usually how I do it just with water and

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.230 
usually how I do it just with water and
smoothing<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.690> all<00:01:05.930> over<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.440> fly<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.400> now

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
smoothing it all over the fly and now

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.390 
smoothing it all over the fly and now
we're<00:01:08.390> going<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:08.630> start<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.200> bacon<00:01:09.770> part<00:01:10.130> so

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
we're going to start the bacon part so

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.310 
we're going to start the bacon part so
this<00:01:10.550> is<00:01:10.700> just<00:01:10.940> some<00:01:11.150> translucent<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:11.990> white

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
is also going to be for the other part

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.080 
is also going to be for the other part
of<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.850> bacon<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.860> now<00:01:25.310> I'm<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.729> attaching

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.300 
big blade and cutting off some strips I
made<00:01:45.740> two<00:01:46.009> strips<00:01:46.399> of<00:01:46.550> bacon<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:48.160> here<00:01:49.160> I'm

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
made two strips of bacon and here I'm

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.020 
made two strips of bacon and here I'm
just<00:01:49.520> kind<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.850> waving<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.750> bacon<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.350> bit<00:01:51.619> and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
just kind of waving the bacon a bit and

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.810 
just kind of waving the bacon a bit and
curving<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.149> edges<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:55.070> kind<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.610> looks

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
curving the edges so it kind of looks

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.309 
curving the edges so it kind of looks
cooked<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:56.360> not<00:01:56.570> real<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:56.869> don't<00:01:57.020> know<00:01:57.110> if<00:01:57.200> you
