00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.980
 I bring you a new video of a weapon 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.130
 potent homemade but asked to use it as 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.260
 private good the materials that 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.620
 they will need they are simple they will need 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.670
 a latex glove of this they have 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:28.560
 without using a chip but neon or any 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.560
 have a lighter 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.430
 You will also need a sharp knife 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:44.840
 like this one and three skewer sticks 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:49.650
 Middle field huincha insulation 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.390
 pins of this that nothing depends on 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.370
 the number of pins that have 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.220
 have to be the same as the clubs 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.480
 skewer because they are to make the 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.630
 ammunition 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.520
 they will also need a tube of 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.750
 pen 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.860
 this that in here of the classics 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 and take out the ink 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.430
 and everything that has school ground what 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.440
 more important 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.440
 and good now let's do 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.300
 now we fish our latex glove and 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:38.190
 with the knife we ​​will cut a finger 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.190
 if we take it and cut it carefully 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.150
 well it is now that we turn it 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.150
 A) Yes 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.340
 and we take insulating tape and now we're going to 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.880
 do as a kind of patch so you do not 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.020
 it breaks 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:11.020
 and then we will put in the part 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.150
 top we will put insulating tape 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.250
 so that it stayed like a kosher patch and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.880
 when we throw it does not break 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.960
 from 2000 to tics so let's say that 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.420
 reinforce it 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:34.190
 and we have to put it right because this 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.270
 is the part to resist more ok 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.970
 if we put another layer of winch 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.620
 instant 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:48.610
 thing that does not break so see now what 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:53.610
 we take and turn it over again 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.610
 be accepted normal again 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.340
 okay 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.910
 once we turn over we will look 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.570
 the pen tube that we had 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.570
 emptied 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.819
 Y 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.770
 we'll put the latex finger out there 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.980
 so we will place it 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:38.690
 and we will stick it with a piece of tape 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.970
 insulator so that we stay well pegadito 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.010
 out 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.819
 ok so we hit it right pizza 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.819
 very well 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:01.660
 good and has already been and we put another 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:05.170
 below so that when we find this 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.680
 I was stuck to the tube 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.739
 and there it is 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.810
 well now we will do the ammunition with 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.810
 the sticks of skewers 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.880
 rents ok 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:28.370
 do it with care ok if you can not 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.370
 get out injured with a chip but 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.780
 we will heat the tip of the pin 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.650
 with care yes 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.590
 If you turn it on a lot 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.290
 once it has heated up 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.160
 enough we stick it to the tip of 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:52.990
 our skewer stick 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:55.610
 so with the fingers we press so that it 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.260
 paste more 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.530
 A) Yes 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:05.940
 cooling has already occurred 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:10.560
 and with electrical tape we will reinforce it more 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:14.330
 still so that it does not leave anymore and 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.330
 can close anywhere 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:22.380
 ok that sometimes has done the test well 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.200
 Nomás without an appointment and come out and pancita 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.890
 do not skip them 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.110
 ok we have one now we go for the 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.700
 second 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.180
 do not forget I'm going to do three 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.180
 only 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.830
 and we'll heat the second to hitler 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.020
 and we will put it on the tip of our 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.139
 stick 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.220
 with your fingers we press it so that 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.220
 cooling occurs 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.419
 very well done now we take after this 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.419
 tape 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.550
 what I hope you also what 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.669
 do well enough mind well for 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.220
 that does not leave the stitch but 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:21.600
 heat more and tighten it well with the 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:26.960
 fingers the essential ok 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.960
 now we take the next pin 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.140
 [Music] 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.140
 we're 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:40.580
 on the tip like the old ones 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.290
 and by the fingers we already started it 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.050
 to tight 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:49.790
 after it is no longer so hot and 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.790
 we do it so we do not burn ourselves 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:58.600
 very well it has already been and we left 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.320
 member as always 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.320
 let's say them 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.060
 shooting tests
