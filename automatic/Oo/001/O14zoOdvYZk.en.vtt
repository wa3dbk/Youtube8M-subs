00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.870
 Hi guys, I'm here extremely with 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.000
 today with a towel on her head 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.000
 without makeup the whole mouth dry 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.490
 the revolt had here winter is a horror 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.400
 And of course, with my nose I retreat with this 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.130
 mask to remove cars in the nose but 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.599
 This is what I want to talk to you about. 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.640
 I can even wear this mask. 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.529
 teach how to make this mask at home 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.899
 there are several brands especially 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.770
 several Asian brands that have this 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 Black mask type here is based on 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.670
 coal but it is not so common coal 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.719
 we can not barbecue 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.969
 activated carbon of medicinal 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.520
 they have the ability to absorb 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.890
 skin impurities and closing the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.649
 pores to close the pores also 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.320
 to defoliate the face and serves very well 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.809
 remove that terrible slaves to 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 millions of cars in the nose and always 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.519
 insists on returning 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.710
 so I was determined to find a 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.200
 way to remove the damn carnations 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.110
 who always come back who never finished 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.960
 and this mask was a great 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.299
 discovery and I go I'll divide the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 pass this idea on with you 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.920
 so it's the next to make that mark 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.950
 At home you need four 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.860
 ingredients and the mask when 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.549
 ready, she looks good and sees 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.200
 that not three but is so with this 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.170
 this thing so they think this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.720
 becomes super black and becomes a 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.790
 mask consistency even good medium 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.030
 plastic so the time you take off 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.030
 face is so good to take her whole face 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.860
 But finally the ingredients for this 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.200
 marking first place the activated carbon 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.020
 and cid medicinal use you find in 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.399
 pharmacy is not very difficult to find 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.380
 the things that I have here are all in 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.960
 English two Greek because I live in states 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.740
 together but to this product are easy to 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.510
 find in brazil then it 's the man 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.939
 the avon activated it comes there are people 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.629
 so, and in the case for that mask that 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:20.640
 gives everything I've proposed to two capsules 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.170
 and can use more you want so that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.599
 she gets a little firmer a little 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.420
 more absorbent but two already arrive 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.450
 so lets with that breed black color either 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.459
 to say neither with its powerful then it is 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.469
 that activated carbon 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.959
 another ingredient you will need is 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.939
 relative powder and colorless one sachet 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.909
 this and gelatin 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:45.599
 The other thing you're going to need is cream. 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.849
 or milk other than milk without 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.590
 fat it is important to use another milk 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.530
 because more milk models have more acid 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.030
 in the case here is the heavy ring is 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.840
 type a sour cream only it is more 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.019
 liquid 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.329
 so it can be cream or milk is 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.200
 important to save the athletic because 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.519
 lactic acid helps clean the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.060
 clean the pores and remove the blackheads 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.879
 then to that last important date 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.969
 ingredient is tenacious adhesive glue lap 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:19.709
 school then the action these four 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:21.599
 ingredients being maybe a good car 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.639
 that is harder to find 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.620
 and that it is a bit more expensive but even 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.819
 so it's easy to find 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.370
 so you mix all the 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.519
 ingredients placed for 10 seconds 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.329
 only in the microwave or in the bath 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.870
 Maria 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.750
 Then you stir it well and you'll keep that color. 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.019
 here you rub your nose or 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.060
 area you want to focus on 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.370
 but it can go all over the face is great 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.949
 but it was the last that ever pores and 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.949
 so it leaves more or less for some 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.259
 to 15 thousand euros or until dry with 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:57.449
 she had that you can start to 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:02.970
 remove but damn my cases already 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:04.979
 it is dry and it comes off very easily, what 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.930
 died on the island all red 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.909
 because they are the ones that are already here in time 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.659
 then red and worse than in the 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:14.220
 spirit but if you take them whole 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.169
 see 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.940
 and then you see that you have already taken the 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.109
 companies can see if the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.409
 own mask 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.120
 and that's it so it 's the most you can use 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.250
 always if you need 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.139
 in addition details of the quantities 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.560
 there is a link down here that 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.169
 you can click and have an article with 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.789
 the most detailed step-by-step but it is a 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.800
 super easy recipe you'll be with 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.870
 a mask that is exactly with the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.069
 mask does the same effect the mask 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.930
 from x and dom 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:46.229
 other Asian brands that are well 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.539
 faces and thus difficult access more than 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.870
 perform the same function of representing the 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:54.270
 cars in this way with active charcoal 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.099
 I hope you have liked and sorry for the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.990
 nothing glamorous appearance more clear 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.990
 then make this digital network mask
