little bit i think i'm going to probably
raise<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.690> little<00:01:39.840> bit<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.409> sets<00:01:40.649> up<00:01:40.830> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
raise it up a little bit so it sets up a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.710 
raise it up a little bit so it sets up a
little<00:01:41.190> bit<00:01:41.399> so<00:01:41.700> i<00:01:41.759> got<00:01:41.940> to<00:01:42.000> put<00:01:42.149> some<00:01:42.270> rods<00:01:42.479> in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
little bit so i got to put some rods in

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.960 
little bit so i got to put some rods in
the<00:01:42.810> back<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.130> bottom<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.700> there

the back of it in the bottom of it there

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
the back of it in the bottom of it there
so<00:01:45.210> i'll<00:01:45.299> raise<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
so i'll raise it up a little bit so it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.680 
so i'll raise it up a little bit so it
sets<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:49.580> there<00:01:50.580> we<00:01:50.789> go<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.880> this

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
sets in there but there we go and this
