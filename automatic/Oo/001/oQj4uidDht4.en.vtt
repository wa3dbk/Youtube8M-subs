00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.750
 good afternoon dear channel viewers 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.790
 plants around and today we are with you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.130
 talk about what to do with 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.359
 crocuses if you gave them to them or you 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.340
 bought because they were very 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.800
 beautiful they beautifully bloomed green 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.519
 the foliage was a nice little highlight but 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.990
 happens in the end 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.090
 Crocus is a primrose and naturally 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.579
 he departs quickly enough land 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.309
 bulbs still holds some time 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 green leaves but potted literally 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.280
 after a month or two the foliage is already beginning 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.829
 to breathe 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.070
 and just turn into a dry saloon and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.829
 Still, what to do throw it away 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.440
 option of course throw the simplest 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.829
 but we can prolong their lives 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.420
 the fact is that for the time being bulbs 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.140
 growing it loses of course some strength 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.149
 until the place it blooms but at rest 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.699
 here now the onion is already starting 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.519
 gain some strength and in order to 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.549
 now suspend pro 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.460
 with the growth of the bulb itself and give it a period 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:14.210
 rest simply need to pull them out 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:19.060
 out of the pot and trim dry leaves like 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.060
 it is done it is very simple 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.170
 shark racing bulbs pulled out 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170
 and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.010
 like this 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.200
 the land is cleared here here we even have 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.240
 there is a little onion 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.090
 but we will leave it until the place 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.980
 next season but it's onion on 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.980
 big but cut the leaves 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.060
 we got it 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.460
 leave therefore and I will stack them 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.610
 drying box as you see 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.450
 the bulbs are wet enough but it's not 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.720
 eat well 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.340
 manga to be completely dry 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.340
 during the rest period 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.880
 here we are people yet 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.510
 And I also put the onion cook on 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.510
 drying 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.480
 we have very nicely formed 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.270
 two bulbs are already enough 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.910
 major systems not already next year in 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.390
 mind will give the truth to one only 3 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.120
 . 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.050
 but no less flowering will be 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.140
 I do not separate them from the old adult 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.140
 bulb 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.450
 the same 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.450
 lay out to dry 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.100
 it will be much easier here because 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.450
 actually the land I should have been 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.860
 to be dry just someone did not help and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.860
 watered crocuses 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:26.680
 what kind of onions are already separated well 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.160
 you see the adult bulb old she 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.700
 gave 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.640
 already a lot of babies but on this 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.470
 bulbs i see color so with her about 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:42.010
 I do not want to take pictures of children 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.660
 will have to leave and process 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.660
 pour a little foundation 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.850
 I will sprinkle the basement completely 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.850
 when all the bulbs laid out his hand 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.700
 crocus bulb is considered an adult 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 when already covered 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.950
 Here is such a brown scales 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.590
 pokamist on young bulbs this scales 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.370
 no but they are already separated enough 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.150
 ok so some of them i 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.410
 I separate some I leave 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.120
 old bulbs some things the most 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.960
 most importantly do not forget that 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.680
 a box of these bulbs 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.919
 will definitely need to put in 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.020
 the cool place is dark enough there 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.750
 they calmly parcel and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.900
 will be saved this may be the attic 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.800
 if he's cool enough it can 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.789
 be a cellar under you in the event that he 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.789
 not very raw 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.650
 if it's damp there is better of course 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.520
 the bulbs do not store there is not easy 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.520
 just take a look 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.170
 those onion kids who fall away themselves 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.380
 from an adult bulb it is possible safely too 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.080
 cool drying it means that they already 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.230
 ready to live self 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.600
 life and even if the root 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.490
 very long you can feel free to have it already 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.670
 crop next year 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.950
 the plant will give a new root this 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.220
 enjoy and services 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:31.020
 therefore, less opening was 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.599
 You can easily cut and plots 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.300
 last pot and don't forget that 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.759
 when you put to dry 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.270
 bulbs when are you going to get 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.139
 you definitely don't need them from the pots 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.699
 water 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:50.270
 pot before a few days or 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:53.180
 weeks and I will just be unlucky 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.090
 die nog water hit water a 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.849
 it is generally better to do it when 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.849
 the land is dry 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:07.229
 firstly it is more comfortable and your hands are cleaner 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:09.750
 Well, and secondly all the same under the attention of 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:15.590
 the box will be much less if there 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:18.419
 no water will get from the bulb itself 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.870
 there is no need to completely 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:26.430
 kids separate because on the bulbs we 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.880
 We see the press to treat it I do not want and not 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.969
 I will 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:34.580
 the bulb is pretty amazed i'll fly 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:34.580
 just babes 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.500
 here are the attempts 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.500
 and now 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.710
 i squirting 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:55.229
 from sprayer with base solution 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.780
 these box bulbs after which 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:00.840
 This has dried and put 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.300
 cool place on earth 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.990
 rather it will not be wintering it will be 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.940
 summer and here in the month of November I them 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.780
 already planted land most likely it will be 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.590
 not pots 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.410
 open ground and spring these crocuses 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.460
 will come out and will please the eye already on the ground 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.560
 they have a cat 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.560
 all the best, see the legs
