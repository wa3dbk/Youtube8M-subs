the limes in there and put them to the
side<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:44.350> way<00:02:44.500> you've<00:02:44.680> got<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:45.420> nice<00:02:46.420> little

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690

side that way you've got a nice little
setup<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.050> have<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.320> pay<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> extra<00:02:47.620> money

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
setup you have to pay the extra money

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.790 
setup you have to pay the extra money
for<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.310> setup<00:02:48.700> here<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.510> really<00:02:50.470> you're<00:02:50.770> not

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
for the setup here and really you're not

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.230 
for the setup here and really you're not
gonna<00:02:51.010> go<00:02:51.250> through<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.520> many<00:02:51.790> limes<00:02:52.000> and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
gonna go through that many limes and

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.280 
gonna go through that many limes and
lemons<00:02:52.300> anyway<00:02:54.780> another<00:02:55.780> way<00:02:55.990> of<00:02:56.110> cutting

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
lemons anyway another way of cutting

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.330 
lemons anyway another way of cutting
lime<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.750> can<00:02:58.900> keep<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.350> ends<00:02:59.680> on<00:02:59.770> it<00:02:59.800> this<00:03:00.100> on

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
lime you can keep the ends on it this on

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.270 
lime you can keep the ends on it this on
this<00:03:00.520> cut<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:02.200> makes<00:03:02.440> sure<00:03:02.530> again<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.160> have

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
this cut this makes sure again you have

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.660 
this cut this makes sure again you have
a<00:03:03.310> sharp<00:03:03.670> knife<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.980> instead<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.430> going

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
a sharp knife it instead of going

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.220 
a sharp knife it instead of going
through<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.940> middle<00:03:07.150> like<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.540> did<00:03:07.690> before<00:03:07.780> go

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
through the middle like it did before go

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.930 
through the middle like it did before go
the<00:03:08.380> opposite<00:03:08.800> way<00:03:09.630> like<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.640> then<00:03:14.820> cut<00:03:15.820> it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the opposite way like so and then cut it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.309 
the opposite way like so and then cut it
in<00:03:16.030> half<00:03:16.239> again

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.069 

and<00:03:20.620> once<00:03:21.099> again<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.549> have<00:03:21.579> four<00:03:21.939> pieces<00:03:22.150> this

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
and once again you have four pieces this

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.720 
and once again you have four pieces this
way<00:03:23.319> you're<00:03:23.650> not<00:03:23.680> having<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.129> half<00:03:24.310> circles

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
way you're not having the half circles

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.610 
way you're not having the half circles
but<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.299> still<00:03:25.599> have<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.870> slip<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.319> put

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
but you still have the slip you can put

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.979 
but you still have the slip you can put
on<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.829> glass<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.609> so

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.530 

now<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.049> lemon<00:03:35.349> is<00:03:35.409> the<00:03:35.439> same<00:03:35.709> way<00:03:36.359> you<00:03:37.359> cut<00:03:37.510> it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
now the lemon is the same way you cut it

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.170 
now the lemon is the same way you cut it
actually<00:03:38.640> most<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.819> time<00:03:39.879> you're<00:03:40.120> gonna

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
actually most of the time you're gonna

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.050 
actually most of the time you're gonna
see<00:03:40.299> half<00:03:40.629> circles<00:03:41.049> on<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.819> lemons<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:42.879> lot

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
see half circles on this lemons a lot

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.289 
see half circles on this lemons a lot
easier<00:03:43.359> to<00:03:43.510> cut<00:03:43.689> them<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.549> limes<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:46.120> it's

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
easier to cut them the limes so it's

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.670 
easier to cut them the limes so it's
always<00:03:46.450> best<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.840> do<00:03:47.019> two<00:03:47.109> limes<00:03:47.290> first

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
always best to do two limes first

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.050 
always best to do two limes first
because<00:03:47.859> you<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.129> a<00:03:48.159> sharper<00:03:48.670> knife<00:03:48.700> but

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
because you have a sharper knife but

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.369 
because you have a sharper knife but
that<00:03:49.209> at<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.540> beginning<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:49.959> cutting<00:03:50.319> the

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
that at the beginning of cutting the

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.190 
that at the beginning of cutting the
fruit<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:51.010> have<00:03:51.849> a<00:03:51.879> harder<00:03:52.239> rind<00:03:52.540> on<00:03:52.959> the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
fruit you have a harder rind on the

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.429 
fruit you have a harder rind on the
limes<00:03:53.439> and<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.680> do<00:03:53.799> two<00:03:53.889> lemons<00:03:55.290> once<00:03:56.290> again

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
limes and you do two lemons once again

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.199 
limes and you do two lemons once again
make<00:03:56.739> sure<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:56.980> have<00:03:57.129> that<00:03:57.280> cut<00:03:57.639> in<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
make sure you have that cut in the

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.909 
make sure you have that cut in the
middle<00:03:58.329> like<00:03:58.599> so<00:03:58.629> you're<00:03:59.439> doing<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.769> half

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
middle like so you're doing the half

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:05.699 
middle like so you're doing the half
circles<00:04:00.400> once<00:04:00.730> again<00:04:04.049> as<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.139> can<00:04:05.319> see<00:04:05.439> you

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
circles once again as you can see you

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.050 
circles once again as you can see you
have<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.829> half<00:04:06.069> circle<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.519> can<00:04:06.669> put<00:04:06.819> on<00:04:06.939> the

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
have a half circle you can put on the

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.309 
have a half circle you can put on the
glass<00:04:09.299> also<00:04:10.299> on<00:04:10.659> this<00:04:10.840> one<00:04:11.019> you<00:04:11.079> can<00:04:11.200> do<00:04:11.290> the

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
glass also on this one you can do the

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.770 
glass also on this one you can do the
same<00:04:11.590> thing<00:04:11.829> as<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.040> did<00:04:12.250> with<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.150> wedges

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.370 

like<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:20.209> then<00:04:21.209> once<00:04:21.420> again<00:04:21.720> always<00:04:21.930> make<00:04:22.200> sure

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
like so then once again always make sure

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.110 
like so then once again always make sure
you<00:04:22.500> have<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.830> little<00:04:23.010> slip<00:04:23.400> there<00:04:23.430> do<00:04:24.000> where
