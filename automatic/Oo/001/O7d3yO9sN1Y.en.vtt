really hard as well of course we

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
completed both Vino armor challenges

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.820 
completed both Vino armor challenges
before<00:00:23.160> which<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.210> quite<00:00:24.390> proud<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.870> now

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
before which I'm quite proud of now

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.610 
before which I'm quite proud of now
though<00:00:26.220> we're<00:00:27.000> gonna<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.240> doing<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.720> no<00:00:28.050> chest

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
though we're gonna be doing the no chest

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.940 
though we're gonna be doing the no chest
challenge<00:00:29.100> and<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:31.200> a<00:00:31.230> feeling<00:00:31.440> this<00:00:31.710> can

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
challenge and I have a feeling this can

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.250 
challenge and I have a feeling this can
be<00:00:32.099> quite<00:00:32.369> hard<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:33.030> complete<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> Dyson<00:00:34.020> blitz

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
be quite hard I complete the Dyson blitz

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
be quite hard I complete the Dyson blitz
round<00:00:34.530> games<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.670> wasn't<00:00:35.969> too<00:00:36.239> hard<00:00:36.510> there

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
round games and it wasn't too hard there

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.829 
round games and it wasn't too hard there
because<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.530> kids<00:00:37.769> are<00:00:37.980> quite<00:00:38.129> strong<00:00:38.609> but<00:00:39.570> in

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
because the kids are quite strong but in

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.709 
because the kids are quite strong but in
skywars<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.069> kids<00:00:41.339> aren't<00:00:41.699> that<00:00:41.969> strong<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
skywars the kids aren't that strong and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.799 
skywars the kids aren't that strong and
you<00:00:42.809> can't<00:00:43.019> really<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.739> rely<00:00:44.159> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.339> kit<00:00:44.809> so

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you can't really just rely on the kit so

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.079 
you can't really just rely on the kit so
this<00:00:46.469> might<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.280> hard<00:00:47.519> still<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:47.999> it

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
this might be really hard still when it

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.229 
this might be really hard still when it
comes<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.359> kits<00:00:48.569> I'll<00:00:48.749> be<00:00:48.899> playing<00:00:49.199> I<00:00:49.679> think<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
comes to kits I'll be playing I think I

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.899 
comes to kits I'll be playing I think I
have<00:00:51.479> to<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:51.839> ologist<00:00:52.350> honestly<00:00:52.909> because

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
have to go back ologist honestly because

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.910 
have to go back ologist honestly because
the<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.449> kits<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.929> are<00:00:55.139> worth<00:00:55.409> playing<00:00:55.739> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the two kits that are worth playing I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.360 
the two kits that are worth playing I
think<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.339> armor<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> night<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.260> night<00:00:59.069> will

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
think is armor and night and night will

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.489 
think is armor and night and night will
be<00:00:59.489> probably<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> best<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.049> sadly<00:01:01.319> I

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
be probably the best one but sadly I

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:02.719 
be probably the best one but sadly I
don't<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.769> that<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.339> don't<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
don't have that and I don't have the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.660 
don't have that and I don't have the
armor<00:01:03.030> either<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> can't<00:01:05.010> get<00:01:05.250> any<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.460> those

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
armor either so I can't get any of those

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.150 
armor either so I can't get any of those
good<00:01:05.940> things<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.900> basically<00:01:07.230> just<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
good things so I basically just have to

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.640 
good things so I basically just have to
go<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> ecologist<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.350> iron

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
go with the ecologist here and the iron

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.830 
go with the ecologist here and the iron
axe<00:01:10.830> which<00:01:11.190> is<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.550> decent<00:01:11.940> weapons<00:01:12.390> still<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
axe which is see decent weapons still of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
axe which is see decent weapons still of
course<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.560> can't<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.070> use<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.430> oak<00:01:14.580> route

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
course I can't really use the oak route

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.100 
course I can't really use the oak route
to<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> middle<00:01:15.510> though<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.960> can't

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to go to middle though because I can't

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.410 
to go to middle though because I can't
open<00:01:16.380> any<00:01:16.500> chests<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.580> why<00:01:17.850> should<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
open any chests so why should I go to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.040

like for more challenges let's get in to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.770 
like for more challenges let's get in to
the<00:01:33.300> game

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the game

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.540 
the game
all<00:01:33.930> white<00:01:34.380> guys<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.980> we<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.130> we'll<00:01:35.340> let<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
all white guys here we go we'll let the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.300 
all white guys here we go we'll let the
game<00:01:35.700> begin<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.390> strategy<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.230> think<00:01:37.560> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
game begin so my strategy I think is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.070 
game begin so my strategy I think is
just<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.850> wait<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.360> people<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.690> open<00:01:40.050> their

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
just to wait for people to open their

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.420 
just to wait for people to open their
chests<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.940> go<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.480> kill<00:01:42.690> them<00:01:42.900> that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
chests and then I go and kill them that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.250 
chests and then I go and kill them that

work out now that we have some deer is

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.730 
work out now that we have some deer is
that<00:02:23.430> we<00:02:23.580> go<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:24.030> middle<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.900> kill<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.560> guys

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
that we go to a middle and kill the guys

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.980 
that we go to a middle and kill the guys
with<00:02:26.010> Opie<00:02:26.460> stuff<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.090> then<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:27.570> get<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
possibly be something really good but it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.670 
possibly be something really good but it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
might also be hard to do anyway guys

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.730 
might also be hard to do anyway guys
