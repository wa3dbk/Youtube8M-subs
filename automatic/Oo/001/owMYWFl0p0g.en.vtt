 Today I will tell you awesome 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.760
 the story that happened to me on 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.950
 sampo expanses once gone over 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.259
 With milk, I met a strange kid 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.360
 clearly not from our village given that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.430
 playing the redo I decided to just 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.289
 walk past him and he drew 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.170
 attention to me such a call for 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.279
 action and rp wake-up he called me 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.830
 approached and asked 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.310
 what are you doing here I answered him live 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.109
 close and we started a conversation in 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.180
 during which it turned out that he was not 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.890
 of our state and generally just arrived at 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.350
 part time it's amazing that some 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
 nigga came to work in the village well 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.860
 oh well count let go a couple of flattering 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.290
 phrase about my place of residence 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.050
 says that here is very quiet sweet overall 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.329
 after which I asked what are you my friend 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 live and earn money once came from 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.750
 such further into our wilderness 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.760
 He said that he was trading for food. 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.070
 Mary since I am a countryman is far from 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 youth slang I asked him and Schmal 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.680
 what is it after which it is not so 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.629
 hush hush not so loud, he explained that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.960
 it's kind of a kind of cigar cigar 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.780
 roll- ups and here I brought him one 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.659
 life story after all, I and my wife 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.030
 in their youth they smoked in the hayloft 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.060
 grass but it was not harmful and even 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.619
 somewhere useful their smallness is 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.320
 offered to treat me 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.900
 I think something Kalanda giving pamper ourselves 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.640
 h and i followed him where he 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.829
 said who went there I walked and 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.229
 thought about what I bought 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.759
 a bag of milk and walked home to wife 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.200
 made it toast 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.060
 but then I did not help that this story 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.400
 may drag on for such a long 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.680
 time we went to the store I bought 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.509
 some kind of left pack of cigarettes plus 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.460
 lighter we weren't at all 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.500
 suspicious and then wrapped in 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.970
 some dark alley and there our new 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.649
 an acquaintance began to tell 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.409
 grow up cooking it 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.750
 wonderful means to relax like 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.719
 would have called i took a cigarette screwed in there 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.520
 starbuck sprinkled marijuana to his 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.260
 character at all like the type of man does not think 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.690
 does 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.240
 what is marijuana chu village same her 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.340
 or after which he lit and lit my 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.010
 new black fellow yara glanced over 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.930
 the corner was clearly afraid that someone would notice us 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.190
 I still wondered what he was so secretive 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.350
 but his business 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.600
 I was only a rural gullible 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.370
 the boy who went home with the package 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.920
 milk to his wife and so she 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.380
 Cooked delicious such cookies 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.240
 You know chocolate chip cookies ode 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.820
 I noticed that this herb has them very 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.580
 strange taste for himself and noted that this 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.170
 very haggard thing a chocolate bunny 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.530
 who stood next to me all and 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.070
 kept repeating inhale and exhale 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.390
 inhale and exhale slightly already staggering 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.310
 I am awkward armor 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.570
 buddy how much do I owe you for this 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.310
 lovely after which he answered yes forget it 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.050
 free yum I certainly thanked 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.300
 his but such a wide gesture of kindness 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.790
 seemed to me very suspicious shouting 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.500
 from came to the village to trade a little scarlet 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.690
 Not only is there no customer here 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.120
 will find and for the mile I caught only one 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.800
 so he just give me free he 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.450
 probably hoping that I was the word of mouth 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.130
 I'll start telling all my neighbors 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.660
 that here is some kind of black guy trading 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.840
 here you have the village go find 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.660
 his wily asshole knows a lot about 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.230
 marketing making a couple more delays i 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.760
 unwittingly asked how much it cost here 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.190
 cool at all top waved his hand and said 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.989
 and not expensive only $ 500 for 5 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.670
 gram followed by 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.010
 natural reaction usual 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.810
 idiot i just 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.420
 choked on this cigarette inhaled her 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.519
 and you harked back to real then 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.650
 hurricane asked I almost started to rub 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.630
 some strange things to me and therefore 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.920
 that I didnâ€™t really think that 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.410
 generally happens around as 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.570
 marijuana started acting and everything before 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.820
 my eyes swam hard but I managed 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.370
 only hear one thing is chemistry 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.709
 organic sly for with even trying here 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.450
 me my foolishness to advertise this 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.040
 dude reminded me of one movie family 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.860
 Jones called advise to see 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.709
 cool movie making a couple more puffs 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.870
 I realized that I can not find my way home 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.510
 this village and asked for our new 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.209
 buddy help me in this simple case 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.380
 he agreed a couple of times looked out 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.150
 w angle 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.310
 if nobody sees us as we 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.590
 brothers black white went out on the sidewalk and 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.660
 went to look for the way home, we did not have time 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.060
 walk two meters as we called my 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.250
 wife to be more precise spouse 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.980
 and if more precisely the girl with whom I 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.690
 I live from which I got engaged in general 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.020
 there was no wedding ceremony yet 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.900
 matter this followed a series of question in i 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.930
 was what did i do why so long where 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.880
 milk bought her milk a couple of times wrote out 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.620
 I wrote everything to my friend 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.630
 then again wrote me a total 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.570
 i tried to break through 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.900
 too too not able to 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.230
 do as I had red 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.230
 eyes were not good and slaps in the face 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.710
 I was like a breeze and cool 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.890
 breeze 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.950
 hemp field sense baiting and not important and 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.660
 then I realized that I did not even know my name 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.880
 my friend to introduce him to my 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.530
 wife and there will be and met him 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.270
 called daniel and looking at how 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.420
 This is a family scandal 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.760
 Chan he honestly was shocked but also 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.830
 this managed to giggle and because 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.380
 I knew that ohh dude, how can I not envy you 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.880
 because you are going to grab on now 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.130
 full program 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.470
 I'll go back and wait for now 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.050
 marketing course will run go deal 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.080
 when I spread rumors around the village that 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.520
 some dude ebony sells marijuana 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.470
 if you think he was very lucky 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.600
 because i'm a country boy 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.330
 which does not fumble at all in that 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.950
 it is legal or not however I remember with us 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.770
 there was some talk about 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.750
 the legality of this product but after that 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.090
 how the effect has evaporated marijuana 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.370
 I do not remember this conversation, which means everything 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.290
 worked and stayed in the black dude that 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.870
 i needed to remember for him so it 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.640
 the fact that this grass is not harmful does not carry 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.400
 no chemicals right there my thoughts 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.280
 They were abruptly interrupted by another pair of points on the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.889
 scham from my future wife wife and I was 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.689
 forced to say goodbye building 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.939
 m because she's kind of already in that 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.490
 moment in hysterics ran over the horizon and 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:15.270
 I am satisfied and beaten and followed her 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.779
 The moral of the story is that in the villages live 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:22.120
 naive people and do not smoke kids cry all 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.009
