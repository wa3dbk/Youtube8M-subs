 these are the ingredients we're going to use 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.870
 for our today's revenue 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.480
 first we will turn the oven on 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.739
 average temperature 180 degrees to go 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.020
 heating 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.559
 in a bowl we'll put the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.559
 wheat flour 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.430
 we will place the oregano oregano optional 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.220
 afternoon before the salt 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.220
 mayonnaise now we mix 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.610
 slowly we'll put milk 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.400
 now let's get it right 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.149
 now with the help of the hands we go 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.359
 do so with the mass 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.429
 already the Mexicans drove him to a 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.319
 homogeneous mixture 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.439
 and it was a point that we 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.060
 we want to be letting go of the hands 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.670
 now we'll put in a 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
 smooth surface 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 Let's hear some flour. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.209
 this guy that that we leave 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.979
 reserved with half a glass 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.819
 Now we're going to stay here crying for 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.819
 15 minutes 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.710
 the mass stayed at the point we want 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.710
 now it 's soft 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.440
 now we've lost a way to put 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.560
 a paper drowning in butter 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.220
 let's reserve our pasta is already in the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.260
 point we wanted but it was going to 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.400
 we take a small portion so we can 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.400
 be as much as you want 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.510
 we took a roll that you had a 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.940
 bottle of sanitizer can also use 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.790
 we opened the dough need not be 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.340
 square or rectangular we do not transmit 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.330
 so more or less looks to cover the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.760
 sausage 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.070
