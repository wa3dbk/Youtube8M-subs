Vanderbilt engines and although they may
look<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.599> same<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.769> exception<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.519> the

Vanderbilt<00:00:19.820> there<00:00:20.820> are<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> few<00:00:21.720> differences

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
Vanderbilt there are a few differences

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.689 
Vanderbilt there are a few differences
and<00:00:24.470> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> first<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> ever<00:00:26.460> bought

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and this is the first one I ever bought

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.700 
and this is the first one I ever bought
I<00:00:27.269> see<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:27.960> shadows<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> way<00:00:30.199> but<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.650> is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
I see my shadows in the way but this is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770 
I see my shadows in the way but this is
actually<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> original<00:00:32.399> paint<00:00:33.030> job<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.660> it's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
actually the original paint job and it's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
actually the original paint job and it's
quite<00:00:34.739> nice<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.840> have<00:00:36.840> replaced<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.559> motor

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
quite nice I have replaced the motor

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
quite nice I have replaced the motor
with<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> double<00:00:38.640> reduction<00:00:39.149> motor<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
with a double reduction motor because I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.209 
with a double reduction motor because I
used<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> run<00:00:40.410> over<00:00:41.270> run<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:43.010> line<00:00:44.010> out

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
used to run over run it on line out

switches and single reduction marks

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.950 
switches and single reduction marks
motors<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:49.129> go<00:00:50.129> over<00:00:50.160> those<00:00:50.430> switches

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
motors will not go over those switches

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.819 
motors will not go over those switches
it<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.110> derail<00:00:53.989> will<00:00:54.989> notice<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.590> got<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it will derail will notice it's got a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
it will derail will notice it's got a
cabin<00:00:56.370> slot<00:00:56.640> coupler<00:00:59.030> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.239> roof<00:01:00.480> you'll

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
cabin slot coupler on the roof you'll

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.119 
cabin slot coupler on the roof you'll
see<00:01:01.050> both<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.500> sand<00:01:01.800> domes<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.550> dull<00:01:04.129> second

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
see both the sand domes are dull second

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.410 
see both the sand domes are dull second
one<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.939> same<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:07.590> got<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.280> tab<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> slot

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
one is the same it's got a tab and slot

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.789 
one is the same it's got a tab and slot
coupler<00:01:10.400> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.240> actually

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
coupler this is one that I actually

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.530 
coupler this is one that I actually
repainted<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:15.060> try<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.330> avoid

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
repainted I really try to avoid

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.499 
repainted I really try to avoid
repainting<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> got<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.790> thing<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
repainting but I got this thing and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.060 
repainting but I got this thing and
somebody<00:01:18.780> had<00:01:19.080> done<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> horrible<00:01:19.830> job

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
somebody had done a horrible job

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.330 
somebody had done a horrible job
repainting<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.710> had<00:01:22.710> done<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
repainting it and had done it in the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
repainting it and had done it in the
wrong<00:01:23.520> color<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> did<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> correct<00:01:25.290> color

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
wrong color so I did the correct color

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.149 
wrong color so I did the correct color
to<00:01:25.740> match<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:27.240> also<00:01:27.570> notice<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.259> these<00:01:28.799> two

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
to match you also notice on these two

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.490 
to match you also notice on these two
inside<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.790> stacks<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.540> simply<00:01:30.960> used<00:01:31.170> red

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
inside the stacks I simply used red

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.469 
inside the stacks I simply used red
paper<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.479> simulate<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.020> marks<00:01:36.350> red<00:01:37.350> plastic

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
paper to simulate the marks red plastic

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
paper to simulate the marks red plastic
that<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.990> barely<00:01:40.290> see<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> dark

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that you can barely see here in the dark

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.380 
that you can barely see here in the dark
on<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:42.180> nickel<00:01:42.869> front<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.909> head<00:01:45.149> light

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
on my nickel front and the head light

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
on my nickel front and the head light
shines<00:01:45.810> through<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.649> makes<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> look

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
shines through that and makes it look

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.810 
shines through that and makes it look
like<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> boiler<00:01:47.880> fire<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:49.890> three<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
like a boiler fire and all three of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.590 
like a boiler fire and all three of
these<00:01:50.970> engines<00:01:51.570> are<00:01:52.430> tab<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.640> slot<00:01:53.880> couplers

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
these engines are tab and slot couplers

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.920 
these engines are tab and slot couplers
and<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.950> will<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.270> nickel

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and you will see that on the nickel

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.719 
and you will see that on the nickel
front<00:02:01.820> I've<00:02:02.820> got<00:02:03.450> two<00:02:04.159> chrome<00:02:05.689> sand<00:02:06.689> domes

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
front I've got two chrome sand domes

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.650 
front I've got two chrome sand domes
and<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.959> green<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.940> there's<00:02:11.940> two<00:02:12.300> chrome

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and on this green one there's two chrome

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.729 
and on this green one there's two chrome
sand<00:02:13.140> domes<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.730> green<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.569> was<00:02:16.410> probably

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
sand domes this green one was probably

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.850 
sand domes this green one was probably
made<00:02:17.099> around<00:02:18.019> 1934-35<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:21.230> most<00:02:22.230> likely<00:02:22.470> was

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
made around 1934-35 and most likely was

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.059 
made around 1934-35 and most likely was
a<00:02:22.890> clockwork<00:02:25.519> originally<00:02:27.980> there's<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
a clockwork originally there's a

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.670 
a clockwork originally there's a
possibility<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.959> came<00:02:30.959> out<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.260> factory

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
possibility that came out of the factory

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.720 
possibility that came out of the factory
this<00:02:31.920> way<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.420> switch<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.730> it's

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
this way you can see a switch here it's

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.360 
this way you can see a switch here it's
got<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> switching<00:02:36.810> motor<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.650> forward<00:02:38.129> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
got a switching motor for forward and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.900 
got a switching motor for forward and
reverse<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:40.650> switch<00:02:40.950> comes<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.489> slot

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
reverse and the switch comes to a slot

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.220 
reverse and the switch comes to a slot
in<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.360> roof<00:02:43.280> which<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.760> cool<00:02:45.230> it's

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
in the roof which is really cool it's

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.039 
in the roof which is really cool it's
also<00:02:46.410> got<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:47.099> hole<00:02:47.519> right<00:02:47.849> here<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.870> hole

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
also got a hole right here and the hole

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.130 
also got a hole right here and the hole
was<00:02:49.290> made<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> little<00:02:50.280> switch<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.019> you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
was made for a little switch so if you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.449 
was made for a little switch so if you
were<00:02:52.380> running<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:53.360> clockwork<00:02:54.360> motor<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:56.040> could

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
were running a clockwork motor you could

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.170 
were running a clockwork motor you could
have<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.530> little<00:02:58.530> switch<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.370> factory<00:02:59.970> would

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
have a little switch the factory would

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.770 
have a little switch the factory would
install<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.569> little<00:03:00.900> switch<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:02.420> I'm<00:03:03.420> not<00:03:03.569> sure

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
install a little switch and I'm not sure

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.509 
install a little switch and I'm not sure
if<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.959> reached<00:03:04.230> underneath<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:05.099> really<00:03:05.340> did

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
if you reached underneath you really did

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.900 
if you reached underneath you really did
it<00:03:05.549> from<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.880> outside<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:08.459> would<00:03:08.670> turn

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
it from the outside and it would turn

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.420 
it from the outside and it would turn
the<00:03:09.060> light<00:03:09.329> off<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.200> from<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:11.250> was

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
the light off and on from that was

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.840 
the light off and on from that was
battery-powered<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.250> course<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.639> is

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
battery-powered but of course this is

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.390 
battery-powered but of course this is
all<00:03:15.060> electric<00:03:15.540> now<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.200> there's<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.160> hole

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
all electric now and there's the hole

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.330 
all electric now and there's the hole
for<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:18.060> key<00:03:18.329> to<00:03:18.359> wind<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.959> up<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:23.100> has

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
for the key to wind it up and this has

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.770 
for the key to wind it up and this has
something<00:03:23.579> interesting<00:03:24.269> it's<00:03:24.450> called<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
something interesting it's called a

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.220 
something interesting it's called a
swinging<00:03:25.109> peg<00:03:25.470> coupler<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:26.569> this<00:03:27.569> will<00:03:27.810> only

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
swinging peg coupler and this will only

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.819 
swinging peg coupler and this will only
hook<00:03:28.440> up<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.859> Joya<00:03:29.280> line<00:03:29.750> cars<00:03:30.750> or<00:03:31.200> join<00:03:31.590> line

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
hook up to Joya line cars or join line

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.300 
hook up to Joya line cars or join line
couplers<00:03:35.269> now<00:03:36.269> I'm<00:03:36.389> gonna<00:03:36.569> skip<00:03:37.049> one<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.769> go

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
couplers now I'm gonna skip one and go

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.830 
couplers now I'm gonna skip one and go
over<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.519> my<00:03:38.850> gray<00:03:39.269> one<00:03:39.959> which<00:03:40.760> I'm<00:03:41.760> quite<00:03:42.450> sure

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
over to my gray one which I'm quite sure

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.080 
over to my gray one which I'm quite sure
this<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.230> repaint<00:03:43.769> that's<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.670> too<00:03:44.880> nice

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
this is a repaint that's just too nice

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.240 
this is a repaint that's just too nice
and<00:03:46.639> it's<00:03:48.739> also<00:03:49.739> got<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.280> dull<00:03:50.489> sand<00:03:51.209> domes

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
and it's also got the dull sand domes

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.770 
and it's also got the dull sand domes
but<00:03:53.250> there's<00:03:53.940> no<00:03:54.209> hole<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.470> stack<00:03:56.780> no

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
but there's no hole and the stack no

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.120 
but there's no hole and the stack no
place<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:58.349> put<00:03:58.739> a<00:04:00.920> your<00:04:01.920> red<00:04:02.660> plastic<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:05.010> make

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
place to put a your red plastic to make

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.979 
place to put a your red plastic to make
it<00:04:05.310> look<00:04:05.459> like<00:04:05.609> there's<00:04:05.849> a<00:04:05.910> fire<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.660> there<00:04:06.870> is

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
it look like there's a fire so there is

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.620 
it look like there's a fire so there is
a<00:04:07.019> difference<00:04:07.500> there<00:04:07.769> which<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.970> really<00:04:09.389> didn't

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
a difference there which I really didn't

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.890 
a difference there which I really didn't
notice<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.079> first<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.910> there<00:04:12.060> are<00:04:12.209> some<00:04:12.510> subtle

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
notice it first so there are some subtle

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.470 
notice it first so there are some subtle
differences<00:04:13.109> this<00:04:14.040> has<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.579> cabin<00:04:15.060> slot

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
differences this has a cabin slot

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.029 
differences this has a cabin slot
coupler<00:04:16.430> this<00:04:17.430> one<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.820> an<00:04:18.739> one<00:04:19.739> that<00:04:19.890> most

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
coupler this one is an one that most

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.370 
coupler this one is an one that most
people<00:04:20.190> don't<00:04:20.549> see<00:04:20.849> because<00:04:21.120> it's<00:04:21.479> a<00:04:21.570> wind-up

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
people don't see because it's a wind-up

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.610 
people don't see because it's a wind-up
clockwork<00:04:22.980> as<00:04:23.160> we<00:04:23.340> call<00:04:23.610> them<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.960> also<00:04:25.170> see

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
clockwork as we call them you also see

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.100 
clockwork as we call them you also see
it<00:04:25.710> has<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.920> swing<00:04:26.370> peg<00:04:26.670> coupler<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:29.900> sure<00:04:30.900> as

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
it has a swing peg coupler and sure as

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.870 
it has a swing peg coupler and sure as
dark<00:04:31.440> as<00:04:31.620> this<00:04:31.860> yeah<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.190> can<00:04:32.460> see<00:04:32.640> now

dark as this yeah you can see now

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.020 
dark as this yeah you can see now
there's<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.360> hole<00:04:33.570> for<00:04:33.900> winding<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.440> up<00:04:35.030> and

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
there's the hole for winding it up and

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.250 
there's the hole for winding it up and
there's<00:04:36.540> something<00:04:36.750> very<00:04:37.140> cool<00:04:37.380> about<00:04:37.620> this

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
there's something very cool about this

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:52.520 
there's something very cool about this
this<00:04:40.260> is<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.740> sparker<00:04:50.450> electricity<00:04:51.530> running

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
this is a sparker electricity running

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.690 
this is a sparker electricity running
this<00:04:52.830> thing<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.460> watching<00:04:54.150> those<00:04:54.300> sparks<00:04:55.700> so

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
this thing and watching those sparks so

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.900 
this thing and watching those sparks so
it<00:04:57.600> ain't<00:04:57.840> right

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
it ain't right

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.390 
it ain't right
these<00:04:59.910> are<00:05:00.120> all<00:05:00.210> my<00:05:00.450> vendor<00:05:01.290> built<00:05:01.500> engines

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
these are all my vendor built engines

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.970 
these are all my vendor built engines
I'll<00:05:03.390> lay<00:05:03.630> this<00:05:03.810> one<00:05:04.020> on<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.290> side<00:05:04.530> so<00:05:04.830> you

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
I'll lay this one on the side so you

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.560 
I'll lay this one on the side so you
really<00:05:05.220> get<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.400> good<00:05:05.940> look<00:05:06.090> at<00:05:06.330> it

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
really get a good look at it

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.540 
really get a good look at it
this<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:08.840> whoever<00:05:09.840> painted<00:05:10.230> this<00:05:10.620> repainted

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
this is whoever painted this repainted

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.840 
this is whoever painted this repainted
it<00:05:11.700> used<00:05:12.300> an<00:05:12.780> airbrush<00:05:13.500> they<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:14.070> did<00:05:14.700> an

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
it used an airbrush they just did an

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.230 
it used an airbrush they just did an
extremely<00:05:15.270> good<00:05:15.660> job<00:05:16.490> sharp<00:05:17.490> looking<00:05:17.820> unit

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
extremely good job sharp looking unit

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.470 
extremely good job sharp looking unit
and<00:05:18.660> it's<00:05:18.960> it's<00:05:19.550> if<00:05:20.550> you've<00:05:20.880> got<00:05:21.150> a<00:05:23.480> locomotive

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
and it's it's if you've got a locomotive

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.760 
and it's it's if you've got a locomotive
the<00:05:24.510> scratch<00:05:25.140> step

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
the scratch step

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.430 
the scratch step
I<00:05:25.800> wouldn't<00:05:26.340> recommend<00:05:27.200> repainting<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.290> you

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
I wouldn't recommend repainting and you

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.320 
I wouldn't recommend repainting and you
really<00:05:28.740> do<00:05:28.920> devalue<00:05:29.880> them<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:32.520> course<00:05:32.820> that's

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
really do devalue them of course that's

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.270 
really do devalue them of course that's
why<00:05:33.600> I<00:05:33.630> didn't<00:05:33.930> pay<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.320> much<00:05:34.590> for<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:35.010> one

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
why I didn't pay that much for this one

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.030 
why I didn't pay that much for this one
but<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.820> really<00:05:35.910> like<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.480> way<00:05:36.600> it<00:05:36.720> looks<00:05:37.040> marks

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
but I really like the way it looks marks

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.280 
but I really like the way it looks marks
