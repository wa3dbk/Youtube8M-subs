going on it's like a funhouse mirror
because<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.819> Earth's<00:03:17.000> magnetic<00:03:17.419> field<00:03:17.450> is

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
because the Earth's magnetic field is

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.629 
because the Earth's magnetic field is
pulled<00:03:18.049> out<00:03:18.230> into<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:18.709> long<00:03:18.980> tail<00:03:19.310> and

stretched and twisted and and sheared

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.280 
stretched and twisted and and sheared
and<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.299> does<00:03:23.630> take<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.930> lot<00:03:24.230> of

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
and so it does take a lot of

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.250 
and so it does take a lot of
interpretation<00:03:25.099> to<00:03:25.400> understand<00:03:26.260> roughly
