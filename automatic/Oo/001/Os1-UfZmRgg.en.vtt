rectangular shape needs to be the square

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.779 
rectangular shape needs to be the square
it's<00:00:16.650> really<00:00:16.740> simple<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.100> make<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> square<00:00:17.609> I

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
it's really simple to make the square I

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.189 
it's really simple to make the square I
need<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.240> fold<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> paper<00:00:18.779> over<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
you have this square and that's what you

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.810 
you have this square and that's what you
need<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.570> start<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.460> go

square fold it in half and fold it in

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.709 
square fold it in half and fold it in
half<00:00:41.070> again<00:00:41.600> just<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:44.510> now<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.690> sure

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
half again just like this now make sure

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
half again just like this now make sure
when<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> fold<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.710> fold<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
when you fold it that you fold and you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
when you fold it that you fold and you
make<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> lines<00:00:47.940> really<00:00:48.329> well<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.809> keep

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
make the lines really well and you keep

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.360 
make the lines really well and you keep
the<00:00:49.260> lines<00:00:49.410> really<00:00:49.649> well<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.190> super

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the lines really well because it's super

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.540 
the lines really well because it's super
important<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.030> crucial<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.160> open

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
important and crucial so then you open

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.209 
important and crucial so then you open
it<00:00:53.610> back<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.920> an<00:00:56.100> open

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it back up just like this and on an open

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.020 
it back up just like this and on an open
side<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.059> fold<00:00:57.559> just<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.670> fold

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
side you fold just like this you fold

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.370 
side you fold just like this you fold
this<00:01:00.480> over<00:01:01.399> to<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> center<00:01:05.450> fish<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.020> fold<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
this over to the center fish and fold it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.440 
this over to the center fish and fold it
over<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:09.590> then<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.890> fold<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.490> over<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
over and then we fold this over to the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.380 
over and then we fold this over to the
center

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
center

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.850 
center
and<00:01:14.659> then<00:01:16.120> you<00:01:17.120> open<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.540> like<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:20.860> you

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
and then you open it like this and you

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.080 
and then you open it like this and you
fold<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.960> so<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.080> makes<00:01:24.260> this<00:01:24.790> diamond<00:01:25.790> shape

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.840 

then<00:01:29.470> on<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.619> open<00:01:30.890> part<00:01:31.070> right<00:01:31.369> here<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.790> is

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
then on the open part right here this is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.900 
then on the open part right here this is
this<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.110> point<00:01:33.320> here<00:01:33.619> and<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:34.520> closed

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
this is the point here and is closed

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.359 
this is the point here and is closed
completely<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.690> then<00:01:35.750> here<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.110> open<00:01:36.470> its

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
completely and then here it's open its

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.859 
completely and then here it's open its
open<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.850> insides<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.270> we<00:01:38.360> just<00:01:38.509> fold<00:01:38.780> it

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
open to the insides that we just fold it

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.080 
open to the insides that we just fold it
so<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.590> want<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.800> get<00:01:39.950> there's<00:01:40.640> two<00:01:40.909> pieces

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
so you want to get there's two pieces

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.490 
so you want to get there's two pieces
here<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.509> want<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.690> get<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.900> first<00:01:42.050> piece<00:01:42.290> and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
here you want to get the first piece and

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.999 
here you want to get the first piece and
fold<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.690> top<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.770> triangle

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
fold it so that the top of the triangle

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.270 
fold it so that the top of the triangle
is<00:01:46.280> pointing<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.759> open<00:01:47.060> side<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:48.560> fold

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
is pointing to the open side and fold

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.330 
is pointing to the open side and fold
the<00:01:49.430> other<00:01:49.460> side<00:01:49.880> exactly<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.570> same<00:01:50.750> way

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
the other side exactly the same way

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.710 
the other side exactly the same way
again<00:01:52.340> make<00:01:52.789> sure<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:53.300> you<00:01:53.420> fold<00:01:53.630> your

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
again make sure that you fold your

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.180 
again make sure that you fold your
crease<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.170> really<00:01:54.440> well<00:01:54.590> too<00:01:54.830> super

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
crease is really well too super

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.660 
crease is really well too super
important<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.229> then<00:01:57.229> turn<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.530> over<00:01:57.740> enter

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
important and then turn it over enter

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:10.610 
important and then turn it over enter
the<00:01:58.820> exact<00:01:59.060> same<00:01:59.270> thing

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.980 

then<00:02:11.620> there's<00:02:12.550> this<00:02:12.730> um<00:02:12.970> triangle<00:02:13.720> part<00:02:13.930> on

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
then there's this um triangle part on

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.890 
then there's this um triangle part on
the<00:02:14.080> top<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.320> just<00:02:14.650> want<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.920> fold<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.340> over<00:02:15.900> to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the top you just want to fold it over to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.040 
the top you just want to fold it over to
one<00:02:17.110> side<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:18.100> then<00:02:18.330> fold<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.450> over<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.960> the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
one side and then fold it over to the
