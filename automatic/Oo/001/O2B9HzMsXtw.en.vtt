baseball the ball comes at you curves or

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.330 
baseball the ball comes at you curves or
dips<00:00:35.840> but<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:36.989> cricket<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> actually<00:00:37.770> hits<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
ground before it comes to you so you're

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
ground before it comes to you so you're
looking<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> ball<00:00:41.070> swinging<00:00:41.460> away<00:00:41.820> from

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
accordingly and having the ground that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500 
accordingly and having the ground that
is<00:00:49.320> all<00:00:49.530> away<00:00:49.920> around<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.270> hit<00:00:51.360> in

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
is all away around you you can hit in

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
is all away around you you can hit in
any<00:00:51.629> direction<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.680> will<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> move

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
any direction so you will have to move

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.760 
any direction so you will have to move
your<00:00:53.399> body<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.960> order<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> make<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.379> shot<00:00:55.620> in

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
your body in order to make that shot in

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.819 
your body in order to make that shot in
that<00:00:55.890> direction<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.960> bat<00:00:58.140> like

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that direction so this is the bat like

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.539 
side shiny while the other one can stay
rough<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.389> when<00:03:43.230> he<00:03:43.350> releases<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.130> ball<00:03:44.280> it

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
rough and when he releases the ball it

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.780 
rough and when he releases the ball it
swings<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.620> if<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:46.889> hold<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.190> at<00:03:47.310> an<00:03:47.430> angle

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
swings and if you hold it at an angle

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.849 
swings and if you hold it at an angle
the<00:03:48.060> shiny<00:03:48.299> side<00:03:48.540> will<00:03:48.780> swing<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.350> or<00:03:49.560> swing

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
the shiny side will swing in or swing

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.970 
the shiny side will swing in or swing
out<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:50.880> basically<00:03:51.299> you're<00:03:52.290> looking<00:03:52.620> at<00:03:52.739> two

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
out so basically you're looking at two

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.220 
out so basically you're looking at two
aspects<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.670> bowling<00:03:54.120> as<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.359> batsman<00:03:54.720> you're

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
aspects of bowling as a batsman you're

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.539 
aspects of bowling as a batsman you're
looking<00:03:55.500> at<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.709> ball<00:03:55.889> coming<00:03:56.130> at<00:03:56.340> you

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
looking at the ball coming at you

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.370 
looking at the ball coming at you
swinging<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.269> air<00:03:57.359> away<00:03:57.720> from<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.230> which

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
swinging in the air away from you which

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.620 
swinging in the air away from you which
is<00:03:58.500> called<00:03:58.650> an<00:03:58.799> out<00:03:58.920> swinger<00:03:59.370> or<00:03:59.519> swinging<00:04:00.329> in

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
is called an out swinger or swinging in

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.720 
is called an out swinger or swinging in
called<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.200> swinger<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.769> there<00:04:02.519> are<00:04:02.579> many

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
called in swinger and there are many

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.110 
called in swinger and there are many
variations<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.420> many<00:04:03.600> names<00:04:03.810> but<00:04:05.000> after<00:04:06.000> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
variations in many names but after it

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.750 
variations in many names but after it
bounces<00:04:06.480> if<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.780> bounces<00:04:07.410> on<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.620> seam<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.310> can

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
bounces if it bounces on the seam it can

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.330 
bounces if it bounces on the seam it can
go<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.000> any<00:04:09.120> direction<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:09.920> you're<00:04:10.920> looking<00:04:11.100> at

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
go in any direction so you're looking at

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.400 
go in any direction so you're looking at
so<00:04:11.489> many<00:04:11.519> possibilities<00:04:12.359> and<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.870> have<00:04:13.139> to

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
so many possibilities and you have to

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.750 
so many possibilities and you have to
keep<00:04:13.590> your<00:04:13.799> head<00:04:13.980> straight<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.340> keep<00:04:14.609> your

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
keep your head straight and keep your

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.580 
keep your head straight and keep your
eye<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.000> ball<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.510> it's<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.169> cricket<00:04:16.470> ball

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
eye on the ball so it's a cricket ball

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.120 
eye on the ball so it's a cricket ball
the<00:04:17.130> crease<00:04:17.400> has<00:04:18.239> two<00:04:18.600> ends<00:04:19.169> with<00:04:19.560> stumps<00:04:20.010> on

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
the crease has two ends with stumps on

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.670 
the crease has two ends with stumps on
each<00:04:20.280> side<00:04:20.870> this<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:21.930> what<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.169> stumps<00:04:22.470> looks

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
each side this is what the stumps looks

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.700 
each side this is what the stumps looks
like<00:04:22.919> on<00:04:23.880> top<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.419> stumps<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:25.500> have

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
like on top of the stumps we have

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.060 
like on top of the stumps we have
something<00:04:26.099> called<00:04:26.280> bails

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
something called bails

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.820 
something called bails
there<00:04:28.000> are<00:04:28.150> two<00:04:28.510> bails<00:04:28.840> on<00:04:29.140> each<00:04:29.530> set<00:04:29.800> of

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
there are two bails on each set of

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.280 
there are two bails on each set of
stumps<00:04:30.280> if<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:31.300> ball<00:04:31.480> hits<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.810> stumps<00:04:32.200> and

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
stumps if the ball hits the stumps and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.260 
stumps if the ball hits the stumps and
the<00:04:32.470> bails<00:04:32.740> don't<00:04:33.160> fall<00:04:33.370> off<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.760> is<00:04:34.000> not<00:04:34.120> out

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
the bails don't fall off that is not out

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.200 
the bails don't fall off that is not out
so<00:04:34.930> that's<00:04:35.290> why<00:04:35.470> they're<00:04:35.740> on<00:04:35.770> top<00:04:36.100> there<00:04:36.370> so

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
so that's why they're on top there so

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.690 
so that's why they're on top there so
the<00:04:37.510> idea<00:04:37.900> is<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.470> ball<00:04:38.650> comes<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.310> hits<00:04:39.490> the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
the idea is the ball comes and hits the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.320 
the idea is the ball comes and hits the
stumps<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.270> that's<00:04:41.140> out
