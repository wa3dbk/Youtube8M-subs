2.5 5000 dear side side as you can see
right<00:03:00.730> there<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.390> sensor<00:03:01.870> shoots<00:03:02.170> through

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
right there the sensor shoots through

right there the sensor shoots through
Ross<00:03:04.390> don't<00:03:04.660> know<00:03:04.870> if<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.050> could<00:03:05.170> stretch

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
Ross don't know if you could stretch

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.090 
Ross don't know if you could stretch
other<00:03:05.710> pitch<00:03:06.070> in<00:03:06.280> here<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:08.380> it's<00:03:08.860> not<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
other pitch in here but it's not the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.190 
other pitch in here but it's not the
rotor<00:03:09.490> but<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.210> figure<00:03:10.480> what's<00:03:10.630> called<00:03:10.990> like<00:03:11.170> a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
rotor but I figure what's called like a

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.060 
rotor but I figure what's called like a
toggle<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:12.010> spins<00:03:12.940> inside<00:03:13.180> there<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
toggle that spins inside there that the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.550 
toggle that spins inside there that the
since<00:03:15.070> there<00:03:15.250> are<00:03:15.370> actually<00:03:15.880> goals<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:17.350> right

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
since there are actually goals and right

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.050 
since there are actually goals and right
there<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:17.830> can<00:03:17.980> actually<00:03:18.130> see<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.610> sensor

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
there you can actually see the sensor

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.000 
there you can actually see the sensor
poking<00:03:19.780> through<00:03:20.940> right<00:03:21.940> above<00:03:22.300> that<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.830> looks

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
poking through right above that it looks

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.280 
poking through right above that it looks
like<00:03:24.210> hmm<00:03:25.210> like<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.660> sprocket<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:27.640> that's<00:03:27.790> uh

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
like hmm like a sprocket but that's uh

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.190 
like hmm like a sprocket but that's uh
it<00:03:29.290> spins<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.100> creates<00:03:30.430> some<00:03:30.700> sort<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.200> like

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
it spins and creates some sort of like

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.350 
it spins and creates some sort of like
magnetic<00:03:32.740> reading<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:33.820> when<00:03:34.000> you're<00:03:34.180> wheel

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
magnetic reading so when you're wheel

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.780 
magnetic reading so when you're wheel
spinning<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.380> it's<00:03:35.980> bending<00:03:36.460> from<00:03:36.640> a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
spinning and it's bending from a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.340 
spinning and it's bending from a
different<00:03:37.030> speed<00:03:37.420> from<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.720> other<00:03:37.960> side

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
different speed from the other side

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.450 
different speed from the other side
it'll<00:03:38.920> activate<00:03:39.310> your<00:03:39.700> abs<00:03:40.120> oh<00:03:40.890> yes<00:03:41.890> like<00:03:42.220> so

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
it'll activate your abs oh yes like so

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:54.740 
it'll activate your abs oh yes like so
actually<00:03:44.370> your<00:03:45.370> abs<00:03:45.730> isn't<00:03:46.209> working<00:03:52.230> located

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
actually your abs isn't working located

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.860 
actually your abs isn't working located
right<00:03:55.750> here<00:03:56.880> seen<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:58.000> video<00:03:58.150> where<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> guy<00:03:58.660> had

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
right here seen a video where a guy had

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.050 
right here seen a video where a guy had
took<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.620> whole<00:03:59.830> rotor<00:04:00.070> off<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.610> everything

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
took the whole rotor off and everything

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.140 
took the whole rotor off and everything
but<00:04:01.480> on<00:04:01.840> mine<00:04:02.140> all<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:03.130> had<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.430> do<00:04:03.640> is<00:04:03.880> the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
but on mine all I had to do is the

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.830 
but on mine all I had to do is the
sensors<00:04:04.600> help<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.620> began<00:04:06.280> seeing<00:04:06.840> sensor

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
sensors help in began seeing sensor

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.430 
sensors help in began seeing sensor
slides<00:04:08.110> in<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.410> hole<00:04:09.180> right<00:04:10.180> here<00:04:10.240> and<00:04:10.690> one

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
slides in the hole right here and one

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.990 
slides in the hole right here and one
bolt<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:12.070> then<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.180> wires<00:04:13.420> fed<00:04:13.930> up<00:04:14.170> so<00:04:14.880> all<00:04:15.880> I

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
bolt and then the wires fed up so all I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.590 
bolt and then the wires fed up so all I
did<00:04:16.209> was<00:04:16.359> move<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.560> tire<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.970> Jack<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.420> car

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
did was move the tire and Jack the car

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.230 
did was move the tire and Jack the car
up<00:04:20.820> did<00:04:21.820> check<00:04:22.120> has<00:04:23.550> hooked<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.700> up<00:04:24.760> out<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.030> the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
up did check has hooked it up out of the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.400 
up did check has hooked it up out of the
center<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.680> leads<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.870> sensor<00:04:29.260> was

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
center to the leads and the sensor was

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.740 
center to the leads and the sensor was
don't<00:04:29.710> place

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
don't place

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.270 
don't place
and<00:04:31.760> rotated<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.940> roller<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:34.500> got<00:04:35.250> a

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
and rotated the roller and I got a

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.630 
and rotated the roller and I got a
little<00:04:35.940> bit<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:37.410> different<00:04:37.950> reading<00:04:38.370> where

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
little bit of a different reading where

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.730 
little bit of a different reading where
it<00:04:38.760> went<00:04:38.910> up<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.360> was<00:04:39.420> kind<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.930> constant<00:04:40.560> where

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
it went up it was kind of constant where

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.680 
it went up it was kind of constant where
that<00:04:41.570> 2.54<00:04:42.980> 2.5<00:04:43.980> on<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.600> 20<00:04:46.260> K<00:04:46.470> ohm<00:04:46.710> so<00:04:47.690> what

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
that 2.54 2.5 on the 20 K ohm so what

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.630 
that 2.54 2.5 on the 20 K ohm so what
I'm<00:04:48.750> gonna<00:04:48.900> do<00:04:49.080> now<00:04:49.380> is<00:04:53.030> like<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.060> sensor<00:04:55.640> and

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
I'm gonna do now is like the sensor and

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.950 
I'm gonna do now is like the sensor and
there's<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.060> difference<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:59.660> passenger<00:05:00.660> side

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
there's a difference and passenger side

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:10.400 
there's a difference and passenger side
and<00:05:01.470> driver<00:05:06.830> side<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.910> removed<00:05:09.840> both<00:05:10.080> for

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
and driver side so I removed both for

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.340 
and driver side so I removed both for
the<00:05:10.500> home<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:14.750> replacing<00:05:15.750> them<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.170> right

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
the home and replacing them to the right

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.980 
the home and replacing them to the right
locations<00:05:17.190> but<00:05:18.030> I<00:05:18.090> did<00:05:18.300> was<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.780> was<00:05:19.110> clean<00:05:19.950> out

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
locations but I did was to was clean out

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.680 
locations but I did was to was clean out
around<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:23.550> dirt<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.150> rust<00:05:24.390> on<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.840> sensor

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
around the dirt and rust on the sensor

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.080 
around the dirt and rust on the sensor
so<00:05:27.690> basically<00:05:29.300> it's<00:05:30.300> just<00:05:30.540> one<00:05:30.990> bolt<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.820> so

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
so basically it's just one bolt and so

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:41.210 
so basically it's just one bolt and so
you<00:05:33.840> slide<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.380> sensor<00:05:34.710> back<00:05:35.040> in<00:05:39.680> balls<00:05:40.680> lined

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
you slide the sensor back in balls lined

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:50.070 
you slide the sensor back in balls lined
up<00:05:41.550> right

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.960 

I'm<00:05:51.080> gonna<00:05:51.259> tighten<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:51.860> ball<00:05:52.099> back<00:05:52.460> up<00:05:52.729> and

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
I'm gonna tighten that ball back up and

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.779 
I'm gonna tighten that ball back up and
play<00:05:55.150> all<00:05:56.150> right<00:05:56.949> put<00:05:57.949> it<00:05:57.979> back<00:05:58.340> in<00:05:58.580> place

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
play all right put it back in place

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.920 
play all right put it back in place
there<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.800> it<00:06:01.069> abuse<00:06:01.370> in<00:06:01.610> a<00:06:01.699> socket<00:06:01.969> wrench

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
there and it abuse in a socket wrench

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.459 
there and it abuse in a socket wrench
eight<00:06:03.710> millimeter<00:06:04.400> socket<00:06:05.229> it's<00:06:06.229> a<00:06:06.289> lot

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 
eight millimeter socket it's a lot

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:57.939 
eight millimeter socket it's a lot
quicker<00:06:14.710> this<00:06:15.710> little<00:06:16.280> nipple<00:06:56.680> push<00:06:57.680> back

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949 
quicker this little nipple push back

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.580 
quicker this little nipple push back
through<00:06:58.219> there
