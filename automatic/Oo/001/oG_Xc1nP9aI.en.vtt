yesterday<00:00:49.750> morning<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:50.739> put<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.160> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
yesterday morning and I put it to the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.680 
yesterday morning and I put it to the
test<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.789> noticed<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.180> same<00:00:52.329> thing<00:00:52.570> as

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
test and I noticed the same thing as

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.400 
test and I noticed the same thing as
well<00:00:52.870> I<00:00:53.579> would<00:00:54.579> let<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.820> warm<00:00:55.000> up<00:00:55.260> when<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:56.289> took

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
well I would let it warm up when I took

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.799 
well I would let it warm up when I took
it<00:00:56.590> for<00:00:56.829> a<00:00:56.859> ride<00:00:56.920> even<00:00:57.489> though<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.269> drove<00:00:58.600> like

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
it for a ride even though I drove like

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.020 
it for a ride even though I drove like
15<00:00:59.170> minutes<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.739> needle<00:01:00.039> would<00:01:00.129> stay<00:01:00.370> it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
15 minutes the needle would stay it

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.150 
15 minutes the needle would stay it
starts<00:01:01.329> off<00:01:01.480> at<00:01:01.660> about<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.929> hundred<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.530> it

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
starts off at about a hundred and it

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.590 
starts off at about a hundred and it
would<00:01:03.309> only<00:01:03.399> come<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.699> little<00:01:03.850> bit<00:01:04.090> off<00:01:04.210> at<00:01:04.360> seat

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
would only come a little bit off at seat

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.380 
would only come a little bit off at seat
so<00:01:04.870> maybe<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.170> 120<00:01:05.770> max<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.820> that's<00:01:06.970> even<00:01:07.270> after

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
so maybe a 120 max and that's even after

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.930 
so maybe a 120 max and that's even after
driving<00:01:07.780> for<00:01:07.960> about<00:01:08.230> a<00:01:08.260> half<00:01:08.500> hour<00:01:08.740> okay<00:01:09.670> so<00:01:09.730> if

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
driving for about a half hour okay so if

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.160 
driving for about a half hour okay so if
we<00:01:10.030> back<00:01:10.240> up<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.660> when<00:01:10.780> he<00:01:10.870> was<00:01:11.020> first

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
we back up to when he was first

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.410 
we back up to when he was first
explaining<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.830> symptoms<00:01:12.280> I<00:01:12.520> already<00:01:13.270> came

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
explaining the symptoms I already came

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.420 
explaining the symptoms I already came
to<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.750> conclusion<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.560> those<00:01:15.100> two

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
to the conclusion that those two

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.300 
to the conclusion that those two
symptoms<00:01:15.790> were<00:01:16.360> directly<00:01:16.750> related<00:01:17.380> his<00:01:17.950> poor

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
symptoms were directly related his poor

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.420 
symptoms were directly related his poor
fuel<00:01:18.580> economy<00:01:18.850> was<00:01:19.840> due<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.320> an<00:01:20.890> engine<00:01:21.100> that

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
fuel economy was due to an engine that

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.890 
fuel economy was due to an engine that
wasn't<00:01:21.790> warming<00:01:22.090> up<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.480> operating

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
wasn't warming up to operating

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.200 
wasn't warming up to operating
temperature<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.520> lot<00:01:24.730> of<00:01:24.760> people<00:01:24.910> don't

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
temperature now a lot of people don't

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.910 
temperature now a lot of people don't
understand<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.960> difference<00:01:25.990> between<00:01:26.530> open

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
understand the difference between open

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.250 
understand the difference between open
and<00:01:27.040> closed<00:01:27.220> loop<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:28.510> let<00:01:28.630> me<00:01:28.750> try<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:28.990> explain

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.880 

okay<00:01:32.260> let's<00:01:32.530> cover<00:01:32.740> some<00:01:33.040> basics<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:35.740> is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
okay let's cover some basics what is

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.370 
okay let's cover some basics what is
open<00:01:36.250> loop<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.700> what<00:01:37.030> is<00:01:37.150> closed<00:01:37.450> loop<00:01:37.750> in

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
open loop and what is closed loop in

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.260 
open loop and what is closed loop in
order<00:01:38.710> for<00:01:38.890> me<00:01:38.980> to<00:01:39.100> even<00:01:39.250> start<00:01:39.580> explaining<00:01:40.150> my

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
order for me to even start explaining my

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.450 
order for me to even start explaining my
initial<00:01:40.660> thought<00:01:40.840> process<00:01:41.380> behind<00:01:41.590> how<00:01:42.400> he

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
initial thought process behind how he

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.610 
initial thought process behind how he
came<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:43.000> conclusion<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.410> poor

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
came to the conclusion that the poor

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.490 
came to the conclusion that the poor
fuel<00:01:44.920> mileage<00:01:45.160> was<00:01:45.970> mostly<00:01:46.360> directly<00:01:47.020> related

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
fuel mileage was mostly directly related

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.140 
fuel mileage was mostly directly related
to<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.710> cold<00:01:47.950> engine<00:01:48.160> you<00:01:48.760> got<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.000> have<00:01:49.120> a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
to the cold engine you got to have a

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.540 
to the cold engine you got to have a
basic<00:01:49.600> understanding<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:50.290> open<00:01:51.130> loop<00:01:51.280> and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
basic understanding of open loop and

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.820 
basic understanding of open loop and

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
has a lot to do with catalyst efficiency

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.240 
has a lot to do with catalyst efficiency
but<00:05:31.330> we<00:05:31.420> can<00:05:31.600> cover<00:05:31.780> that<00:05:31.870> more<00:05:32.260> in<00:05:32.500> later

it's just ignoring the o2 sensors just

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.190 
it's just ignoring the o2 sensors just

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
like they don't even exist now you may

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.470 
like they don't even exist now you may
ask<00:05:50.440> well<00:05:50.830> why<00:05:51.460> don't<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.700> vehicle<00:05:52.120> just<00:05:52.150> stay

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
ask well why don't the vehicle just stay

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:41.500 
try to troubleshoot this vehicle and see

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.590 
try to troubleshoot this vehicle and see
why<00:07:41.740> it's<00:07:42.430> not<00:07:42.639> coming<00:07:42.880> up<00:07:43.060> to<00:07:43.120> operating

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.600 
why it's not coming up to operating

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.300 
why it's not coming up to operating
temperature<00:07:43.690> and<00:07:44.440> going<00:07:45.130> in<00:07:45.280> to<00:07:45.490> closed-loop
