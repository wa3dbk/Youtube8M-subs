in<00:00:02.840> this<00:00:03.840> video<00:00:04.049> we're<00:00:04.410> gonna<00:00:04.500> have<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> look<00:00:04.920> at

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
in this video we're gonna have a look at

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.760 
in this video we're gonna have a look at
how<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.460> use<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.240> advanced<00:00:06.600> Canton<00:00:07.109> rinse<00:00:07.410> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
how to use the advanced Canton rinse and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.879 
how to use the advanced Canton rinse and
we<00:00:08.309> will<00:00:08.550> be<00:00:08.790> using<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.510> boy<00:00:09.929> version<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.590> rig

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
we will be using the boy version to rig

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.520 
we will be using the boy version to rig
which<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.550> available<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.570> download<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
which is available for download and the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.310 
which is available for download and the
advanced<00:00:13.830> Kelton<00:00:14.250> Facebook<00:00:14.790> page<00:00:15.170> let's<00:00:16.170> set

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
advanced Kelton Facebook page let's set

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.540 
advanced Kelton Facebook page let's set
up<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.440> bringing<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> character<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
up for bringing in the character and the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.410 
up for bringing in the character and the
way<00:00:17.640> we're<00:00:17.760> gonna<00:00:17.850> do<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.300> by

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
way we're gonna do that is by

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.050 
way we're gonna do that is by
referencing<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.020> character<00:00:19.439> name<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.850> as<00:00:20.850> we

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
referencing the character name and as we

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.310 
referencing the character name and as we
do<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.330> we're<00:00:21.480> gonna<00:00:21.570> make<00:00:21.750> sure<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.930> use<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
do so we're gonna make sure we use the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.810 
do so we're gonna make sure we use the
namespace<00:00:23.220> option<00:00:25.250> then<00:00:26.250> go<00:00:26.369> ahead<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.699> bring

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
namespace option then go ahead and bring

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.130 
namespace option then go ahead and bring
in<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> file

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.709 

so<00:00:31.140> first<00:00:31.590> let's<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
so first let's have a look at the

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.060 
so first let's have a look at the
controllers<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.230> see<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
controllers that we can see in the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.220 
controllers that we can see in the
viewport<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.000> layers<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.719> comes<00:00:36.989> with

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
viewport and the layers that comes with

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.729 
viewport and the layers that comes with
the<00:00:37.320> characters<00:00:37.850> in<00:00:38.850> general<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.500> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the characters in general what we see is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.090 
the characters in general what we see is
light<00:00:41.070> blue<00:00:41.340> curves<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.920> forward<00:00:43.920> kinematics

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
light blue curves the forward kinematics

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.060 
light blue curves the forward kinematics
controls<00:00:44.910> will<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:46.079> red<00:00:46.379> curves<00:00:46.739> being

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
controls will see red curves being

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.130 
controls will see red curves being
English<00:00:47.309> kinematic<00:00:47.969> controls<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.690> dark<00:00:48.930> blue

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

higher<00:01:15.060> level<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.659> controls<00:01:16.049> which<00:01:16.320> means

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
higher level of controls which means

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.830 
higher level of controls which means

and<00:01:45.750> B<00:01:46.049> controls<00:01:47.659> next<00:01:48.659> let's<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> look<00:01:49.200> at

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and B controls next let's have a look at

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
and B controls next let's have a look at
the<00:01:49.619> advanced<00:01:49.979> kellton<00:01:50.310> tools<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.880> comes

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the advanced kellton tools that comes

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.609 
the advanced kellton tools that comes
with<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> rig<00:01:51.450> there's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> series<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> tools

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
with the rig there's a series of tools

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.620 
with the rig there's a series of tools
here<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.009> they're<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.159> Mel<00:01:53.520> scripts<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
here and they're all Mel scripts and a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.850 
here and they're all Mel scripts and a
quickest<00:01:54.899> way<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.049> get<00:01:55.290> these<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
quickest way to get these going and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.899 
quickest way to get these going and
simply<00:01:56.070> by<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> dragon<00:01:56.399> dropping<00:01:56.790> them

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
simply by a dragon dropping them

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.280 
simply by a dragon dropping them
straight<00:01:56.939> into<00:01:57.240> Maya<00:01:57.450> let's<00:01:57.719> start<00:01:57.899> with<00:01:58.079> de
