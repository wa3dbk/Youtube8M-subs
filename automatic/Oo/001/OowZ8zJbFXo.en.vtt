00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
yourself having the trek between the two

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.880 
yourself having the trek between the two
you<00:01:48.180> must<00:01:48.509> make<00:01:48.899> sure<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.409> you're<00:01:49.530> not<00:01:49.560> going

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
you must make sure that you're not going

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.679 
you must make sure that you're not going
to<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.009> spreading<00:01:50.399> yourself<00:01:50.520> too<00:01:50.850> thin<00:01:51.090> right

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
to be spreading yourself too thin right

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.660 
to be spreading yourself too thin right
here<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> knew<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:52.920> had<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.159> few<00:01:53.490> guys<00:01:53.610> but

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
here I knew that we had a few guys but

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.209 
here I knew that we had a few guys but
be<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.689> guy<00:01:54.869> kind<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.320> near<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.159> figured

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
be one guy kind of near a so I figured

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.100 
be one guy kind of near a so I figured
if<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.670> rushed<00:01:56.939> over<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.210> by<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.869> wouldn't

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
if I rushed over here by see it wouldn't

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.230 
if I rushed over here by see it wouldn't
be<00:01:58.290> too<00:01:58.530> bad<00:01:58.560> much<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.670> surprise<00:01:59.729> there

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
be too bad much to my surprise there

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.030

were<00:02:00.329> about<00:02:00.450> three<00:02:00.810> or<00:02:00.840> four<00:02:00.960> enemies<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.860> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
were about three or four enemies on that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.249 
were about three or four enemies on that
see<00:02:02.250> domination<00:02:02.790> flag<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.840> only<00:02:03.960> able

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
see domination flag and I was only able

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.010 
see domination flag and I was only able
to<00:02:04.469> pick<00:02:04.649> off<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.520> poor<00:02:05.850> shooting<00:02:06.149> came

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to pick off one with poor shooting came

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.930 
to pick off one with poor shooting came
up<00:02:07.170> right<00:02:07.350> behind<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:08.729> able<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
up right behind here and I was able to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.880 
up right behind here and I was able to
clean<00:02:09.149> up<00:02:09.239> another<00:02:09.360> kill<00:02:09.810> pistol<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> third

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.490 
clean up another kill pistol the third
guy<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:12.030> way<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.420> secure<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
guy and that way we secure the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.020 
guy and that way we secure the
two<00:02:13.590> flags<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.250> although<00:02:14.490> we<00:02:14.640> lost<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
two flags and although we lost the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.300 
two flags and although we lost the
triple<00:02:15.360> cap<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:15.750> didn't<00:02:16.080> give<00:02:16.290> them<00:02:16.470> C<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.100> B

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
triple cap we didn't give them C and B

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.550 
triple cap we didn't give them C and B
which<00:02:17.970> would<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.240> been<00:02:18.300> bad<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.900> knew<00:02:19.410> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
which would have been bad I knew that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.780 
which would have been bad I knew that
they<00:02:19.620> were<00:02:19.710> going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:19.950> spawning<00:02:20.220> back<00:02:20.490> here

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
they were going to be spawning back here

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.240 
they were going to be spawning back here
so<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.000> tapped<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.630> flag<00:02:21.870> drew<00:02:22.380> them<00:02:22.620> out<00:02:22.800> and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so I tapped the flag drew them out and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.290 
so I tapped the flag drew them out and
although<00:02:23.460> i<00:02:23.490> wasn't<00:02:23.760> able<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.090> get<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
two-piece i was able to get one flag and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.610 
two-piece i was able to get one flag and
