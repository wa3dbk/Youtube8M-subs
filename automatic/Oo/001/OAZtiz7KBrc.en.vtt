00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.340
 for people we are in the first video of 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.810
 tlc we are on the fracture map and already 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.639
 you know I'm going to show all the maps 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.259
 one by one you will have everything uploaded 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.179
 more or less at the same time and nothing is going 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.400
 to start with this that the truth is 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.629
 pretty cool more or less and good 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.430
 you have seen that we have explored 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.200
 here the first thing we can find is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.360
 a tower that is good to camp here 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.820
 from the beginning it's not quite right 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.010
 and nothing the truth is that the map is about 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.150
 snow is living in basically everything 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.460
 same here we can find in a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.710
 flank of the map the area where then it goes to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.570
 be the dynamic element that is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 basically a huge hall worth is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.260
 huge is gigantic do not you put here a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.780
 side with another with the card and it's 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 awesome how big this is 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.989
 we can find more than 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.879
 same we find a rope like that of 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.979
 street that is quite partial is pound 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.659
 and nothing we also have this super super 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.969
 block here that will also serve us 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.339
 then to get on and pretty 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.929
 well and not much else not while going 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.969
 showing what's left on the map because 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.499
 I'm not let's leave that I'm always 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.210
 being pretty early so to speak 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.889
 also I can not be these gameplays 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 if you do not tell me, let my colleague cy 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:04.920
 you have your channel down in the description 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.750
 has left me all these gameplays already 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.000
 that he had access before 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.530
 to this to the prize xbox program and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 such and I could record this before and I would 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.370
 recorded and I pass it so I had nothing 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.290
 a description has passed all of 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.600
 times with all of it has happened to me all 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.860
 the simple and beautiful maps and nothing short 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 more of this map not here is the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.410
 formality of the medium how good the truth 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.170
 it's pretty cool this map good to me 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.880
 the others are missing but that map 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.320
 it does not look great either, the truth is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.840
 like a lot of food has been a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.340
 little bland for me the sound and such and nothing 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 now let's move on to see the mega 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.180
 dynamic element I have never seen anything 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 equally really prepared 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.380
 they are ready and prepared, my mother 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.020
 Care for scared citizens 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.020
