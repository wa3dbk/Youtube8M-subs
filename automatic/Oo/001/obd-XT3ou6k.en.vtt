the games live and there's going to be

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.460 
the games live and there's going to be
like<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.420> did<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.600> cut<00:01:54.780> those<00:01:54.930> tumblers

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
like what did you cut those tumblers

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.469 
like what did you cut those tumblers
like<00:01:55.500> tumbling<00:01:56.070> through<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> empty<00:01:56.850> audience

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
like tumbling through the empty audience

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.600 
like tumbling through the empty audience
and<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.780> halloween<00:01:58.259> halloween<00:01:58.770> dead

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and the halloween halloween dead

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.370 
and the halloween halloween dead
somebody<00:02:00.740> WI<00:02:01.740> gets<00:02:02.130> caught<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.670> middle

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
somebody WI gets caught out in middle

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.780 
somebody WI gets caught out in middle
yeah<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.680> guess<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.009> period<00:02:05.369> n<00:02:05.460> point<00:02:05.700> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
yeah so I guess this period n point is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.150 
yeah so I guess this period n point is
it<00:02:05.939> doesn't<00:02:05.969> deserve<00:02:06.869> any<00:02:07.110> more<00:02:07.259> time<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.129> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it doesn't deserve any more time so I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.999 
it doesn't deserve any more time so I
think<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.270> got<00:02:09.420> some<00:02:09.569> okay<00:02:09.869> players<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.830> got

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
think we got some okay players we got

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.010 
think we got some okay players we got
stork<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:12.150> GG

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
stork for GG

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.630 
stork for GG
see<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.500> go<00:02:13.710> go<00:02:13.950> um<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:15.630> don't<00:02:16.620> know<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.190> think

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
see and go go um I don't know I think

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.430 
see and go go um I don't know I think
Stewart<00:02:18.000> got<00:02:18.180> lucky<00:02:18.510> he<00:02:18.660> got<00:02:18.810> four<00:02:19.080> GG<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
Stewart got lucky he got four GG a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.070 
Stewart got lucky he got four GG a
destination<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.700> I<00:02:20.730> mean<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.240> would<00:02:21.840> say<00:02:22.050> that

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
destination so I mean I would say that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.020 
destination so I mean I would say that
for<00:02:22.470> GG<00:02:22.800> would<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> favorite<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.640> get<00:02:23.790> out<00:02:23.910> of

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
for GG would be a favorite to get out of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.670 
for GG would be a favorite to get out of
this<00:02:24.090> group<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.660> mean<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.930> think<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.500> she's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
this group but I mean I think so she's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.020 
this group but I mean I think so she's
going<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.860> take<00:02:25.980> him<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.160> on<00:02:26.430> destination

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
going to take him down on destination

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.550 
going to take him down on destination
which<00:02:27.300> means<00:02:27.540> i<00:02:27.660> think<00:02:27.840> storch<00:02:28.110> going<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.440> get

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
which means i think storch going to get

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.320 
which means i think storch going to get
out<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.830> group<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.220> really<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:30.120> going

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
out of the group and really it's going

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.360 
out of the group and really it's going
to<00:02:30.390> be<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> TBT<00:02:30.900> battle<00:02:31.380> between<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.950> GG<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
have to go with C I don't you know I

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.070 
have to go with C I don't you know I
think<00:02:38.190> ç<00:02:38.610> he<00:02:38.640> plays<00:02:39.120> pretty<00:02:39.390> well<00:02:39.630> he<00:02:39.870> gets

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
think ç he plays pretty well he gets

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.740 
think ç he plays pretty well he gets
pretty<00:02:40.320> far<00:02:40.560> sure<00:02:41.250> he's<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.550> choker<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.570> mean

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
pretty far sure he's a choker but I mean

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.630 
pretty far sure he's a choker but I mean
it's<00:02:42.930> still<00:02:42.990> only<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.380> round<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.710> 32<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.400> think

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
it's still only the round of 32 I think

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.630 
it's still only the round of 32 I think
he<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.440> yeah<00:02:46.440> i'm<00:02:47.130> gonna<00:02:47.280> go<00:02:47.400> ahead<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
he can do it yeah i'm gonna go ahead and
