I<00:04:12.320> guess<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.620> could<00:04:12.739> say<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:13.000> just<00:04:14.000> different

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
I guess you could say so just different

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.210 
I guess you could say so just different
characters<00:04:14.750> different<00:04:14.930> names<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:15.650> they

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
characters different names but they

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.860 
characters different names but they
pretty<00:04:16.519> much<00:04:16.640> stayed<00:04:16.970> with<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.209> same<00:04:17.359> concept

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
pretty much stayed with the same concept

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.610 
pretty much stayed with the same concept
and<00:04:18.739> make<00:04:19.459> sure<00:04:19.609> he's<00:04:19.789> focused<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.239> there<00:04:20.620> and

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
and make sure he's focused in there and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.290 
and make sure he's focused in there and
all<00:04:21.979> these<00:04:22.130> are<00:04:22.190> very<00:04:22.550> accurate<00:04:22.789> to<00:04:23.090> what<00:04:23.210> they

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
all these are very accurate to what they

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.710 
all these are very accurate to what they
look<00:04:23.479> like

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
look like

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.190 
look like
on<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.560> anime<00:04:25.099> screen<00:04:25.520> as<00:04:25.760> well<00:04:26.000> so

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
on the anime screen as well so

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.430 
on the anime screen as well so
a<00:04:28.060> couple<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.120> comparisons<00:04:29.570> bring<00:04:30.230> them<00:04:30.350> in

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
a couple of comparisons bring them in

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.950 
a couple of comparisons bring them in
here<00:04:31.720> we<00:04:32.720> have<00:04:32.900> world<00:04:33.440> smallest<00:04:33.860> Astro<00:04:34.430> train

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
here we have world smallest Astro train

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.630 
here we have world smallest Astro train
so<00:04:35.960> as<00:04:36.170> you<00:04:36.260> can<00:04:36.320> see<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.740> there's<00:04:37.220> still<00:04:37.490> a

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
so as you can see that there's still a

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.730 
so as you can see that there's still a
lot<00:04:38.030> shorter<00:04:38.270> than<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:39.020> know<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.470> know<00:04:39.530> these

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
lot shorter than you know you know these

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.790 
lot shorter than you know you know these
world<00:04:40.010> smallest<00:04:40.280> figures<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:42.260> we<00:04:42.650> have
