00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.350
 yyuu people it's from artex i hope that 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.430
 you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.869
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.220
 gameplay commented a gameplay not 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.840
 really like the others we find ourselves 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.939
 today on call of duty 4 on pc 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.529
 I have a small fashion server and we are sure 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.239
 noctum as you see it's a 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.430
 server fnai dives or mario against 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.579
 luigi it's quite funny we just 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.360
 the ratio that indicated on the left side 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.470
 you can watch it all along 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.970
 the part anyway you wait 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.620
 not a thing of phew know very well that 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.300
 I am not a player who plays on pc 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.250
 for a very long time it's been pretty much 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.960
 five months down since I have my pc of 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.270
 gamer that I started to play a little 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.440
 on pc even though at the time I was 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.350
 dÃ©brouillais still not bad by 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.670
 his old pc fixed finally brief it's not 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.200
 the subject of the video you will see that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.410
 I'm going to put some little stuff 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.720
 nice but nothing extraordinary any 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.980
 how much I was asked to do 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.590
 from the cot cot and I told myself why 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.850
 no surcotes 4 pc with and its assets 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.770
 in mode is like that it's pretty cool 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.090
 and it's nice to find that 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.009
 game in that aspect because it's 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.329
 true that on consoles 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.820
 when you go on it's at the dock 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.140
 it's guys flying everywhere 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.770
 Guys who are advanced but everything 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.320
 rather boring 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.030
 I hope on the next gen and the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.260
 developers and all will learn more 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.670
 care of the stake because that's it 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.770
 really boring about the current annoyance in 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.299
 any case 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.460
 here I am going to play even 40 to 3 the whole 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.690
 part so maybe that time in 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.330
 time i will switch with the rc sense 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.590
 because I put them in high school too 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.060
 so here it is, you do not expect that 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.120
 I repeat it because we never know but 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.490
 you do not expect something crazy 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.340
 took three small game sequences for 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.869
 to do a little gameplay pretty short I 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.790
 returned some pretty nice stuff I got 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.250
 am also chained not bad but 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.930
 this is the interest that counts I 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 am very amused to do that so here we go 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.470
 so here is the fact of being returned on 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.720
 cats code on Fnac spell gave me 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.040
 want to talk about something 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.500
 you're not supposed to know that leigh 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.510
 sleeping ap rather well market this 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.680
 year is not to have tech who has 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.310
 revamped wanted to revive that the 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.810
 competition 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.420
 eunice is born scared and I think it's 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.640
 really a good idea and that's it 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.870
 rather seen the day only on console 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.550
 is how to say without upsetting people me 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.620
 personally i would have seen disney more 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.450
 ping on pc but it's true that since 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.610
 warteck and all those people there 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.410
 play on consoles they will not go 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.420
 on pc to make livni ping that me 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.370
 seems logical and I find it good that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.630
 for once on console also there is 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.240
 something other than the level decerto 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.760
 competition on call of duty but when 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.680
 you see how it's limited to 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.420
 level of partly private settings 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.230
 on console you do not find that it 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.480
 would be more enjoyable and more has 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 developed on pc to do Islam 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.530
 ping I explain myself on console like 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.700
 I said it's limited at the level of 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.440
 rules in private parties because 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.790
 that you know that when you do 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.790
 the competition on code is done in 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.370
 private party imagine yourself on black 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.620
 two blue ops there would have been no 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.570
 opportunity to make them the snipers to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.130
 because of the rules because of the snipers have 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.140
 themselves because you also need and x 6 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.350
 not hide it on ghost one is not even 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.550
 not sure snipers can be 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.900
 nice to play in the sense that we 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.370
 is not even sure cirad and quick scope 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.260
 and all that from what I had 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.140
 heard it was some cheap 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.850
 that the quizz coop had been put in the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.840
 game like on black ops at the time 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.000
 remember he had made a room 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.920
 updated to remove them and ultimately 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.269
 I had learned the sniper without 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.769
 quick scope start and when they have 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.580
 handed over on black up that's not it had me 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.620
 weird fact 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.850
 and after all when w3 has arrived 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.000
 it was worse because it was enough 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.110
 simple addition of snipers on this game 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.180
 but so here 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.420
 do not you think that listening would 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.820
 much better on pc in the sense that 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.890
 on pc all models everything is 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.790
 alterable 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.080
 look at the server on which I am 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.210
 find we're playing on our shores in value 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.470
 we sure that cat when I scop 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.820
 with the snack you see very well that 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.250
 the bezel is not moving there is no 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.800
 breath to remember or anything imagined on 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.170
 ghost like I say if the snipers 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.700
 could not be used to make 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.160
 from them the snipers imagine you on 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.690
 pc we can not do it right out 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.209
 of the game because obviously it's 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.950
 secure but it handles you imagine them 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.959
 snipers on gosto unusable for 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.450
 to make them the snipers we could 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.740
 fashion and so that's because 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.230
 it can work in such a way 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.400
 that there is no longer the breath to remember from 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.180
 so that the bezel moves more 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.530
 and there the quick scope would be possible and 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.240
 as I say it's not even possible 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.430
 that disney ping be either feasible on 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.210
 ghost that's why I see that 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.370
 people who are in the world of it 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.660
 haiping wait ghost impatiently 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.830
 to see if that's going to be possible and 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.220
 as said warteck of one of these 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.260
 videos 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.340
 sylvie sniping is not possible on 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.540
 ghost they will fall back on the 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.740
 old call of duty and hoist himself up 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.930
 it's the same I think it's really nice 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.430
 because when you see mw2 who 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.530
 frankly cool to the snipe when you 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.680
 see what's 4 it's the same you see 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.240
 of your screen so all these codes 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.310
 there are really cool to play snipe and 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.560
 and it would be nice to see them again 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.479
 competition precisely 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.580
 finally that's another story so 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.740
 yes I was talking about the modes 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.550
 imagine a created mode only 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.229
 for listening for the competition in 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.390
 anyway I do not understand already 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.220
 why there is no disney ping finally 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.080
 I know there is but we do not see it 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.130
 never let it be in lan already there is 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.840
 very little gliding but the pings 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.030
 console is developing 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.470
 I hope for the players who play on 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.479
 owni sniping on consoles that it will be 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.100
 well developed for ghost I hope that 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.380
 you can do it on ghost because 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.780
 it's really nice to watch and it's 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.600
 really good for you and that you have 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.250
 a competition just for you but 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.590
 that's it but I find it weird that he 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.180
 there was no more sniping on pc of 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.400
 less than someone who would have been 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.330
 designated to develop his on pc because 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.580
 that I find that on pc 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.900
 it has a lot of potential even more 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.820
 that on console in the sense that as 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.740
 I said earlier you can fashion and 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.930
 you can create your own mode for 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.210
 be nice with your rules to 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.380
 you 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.880
 you can even invent rules 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.110
 add to the game finally you see what 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.910
 I mean with the modes you can 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.139
 do what you want is 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.750
 frankly cool so tell me what 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.979
 you think about it in the comments 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.360
 I respect a lot the people who make 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.340
 console snaking because that's 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.660
 really not obvious I tried myself 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.280
 not very long and it's really 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.810
 hot so that's it do not hesitate 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.919
 drop a small lake to give your opinion 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.729
 in the comments and I will tell you 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.729
 more everyone salutes
