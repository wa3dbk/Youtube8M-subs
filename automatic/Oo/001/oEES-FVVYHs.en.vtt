able to recover in the position after

able to recover in the position after
the<00:00:34.900> shot<00:00:35.080> is<00:00:35.200> taken<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:36.280> fact<00:00:36.490> that<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.730> roll

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
the shot is taken the fact that the roll

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.280 
the shot is taken the fact that the roll
is<00:00:37.060> actually<00:00:37.360> triangular<00:00:37.750> on<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.930> outside

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
is actually triangular on the outside

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.860 
is actually triangular on the outside
also<00:00:38.980> enlarged<00:00:39.370> is<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.670> face<00:00:39.880> the<00:00:40.480> pad<00:00:40.690> is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
also enlarged is the face the pad is

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.050 
also enlarged is the face the pad is
built<00:00:41.140> on<00:00:41.320> legal<00:00:41.710> dimensions<00:00:42.160> but<00:00:42.700> by<00:00:42.820> having

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
built on legal dimensions but by having

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.280 
built on legal dimensions but by having
a<00:00:43.150> triangular<00:00:43.540> roll<00:00:43.720> in<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.840> outside<00:00:44.170> it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
a triangular roll in the outside it

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.050 
a triangular roll in the outside it
actually<00:00:44.560> widens<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.040> face<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.550> creates<00:00:45.820> a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
actually widens the face and creates a

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.720 
actually widens the face and creates a
larger<00:00:46.420> surface<00:00:47.080> for<00:00:47.380> coverage<00:00:47.650> the<00:00:48.400> goal<00:00:48.580> for

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
larger surface for coverage the goal for

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.070 
larger surface for coverage the goal for
the<00:00:48.820> butterfly<00:00:49.180> goalies<00:00:49.480> to<00:00:49.600> get<00:00:49.720> maximum

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
the butterfly goalies to get maximum

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.110 
the butterfly goalies to get maximum
coverage<00:00:50.200> when<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:50.710> butterfly<00:00:51.040> position<00:00:51.250> in

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
coverage when the butterfly position in

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.280 
coverage when the butterfly position in
this<00:00:52.240> case<00:00:52.420> here<00:00:52.660> you'll<00:00:52.750> notice<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.170> the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
this case here you'll notice that the

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.860 
this case here you'll notice that the
pad<00:00:53.470> is<00:00:53.620> perfect<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.100> see<00:00:54.220> along<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.790> ice<00:00:54.910> which

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
pad is perfect I see along the ice which

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.090 
pad is perfect I see along the ice which
is<00:00:55.900> allows<00:00:56.200> for<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.470> puck<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:56.680> stay<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:56.950> front

enhance the ice see along the ice you'll
