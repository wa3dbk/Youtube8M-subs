00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.019
 to see this here we go a little bit 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.129
 ok let's go around here I have a little 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.129
 of luck 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.500
 here 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.179
 orgasm 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.600
 in the stitching how are you welcome 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.840
 Welcome to this new tutorial of 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.850
 minecraft and today because they saw the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.750
 trolley principle or more control or is 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.100
 a trap that is very easy to do ok 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.640
 in fact it is much easier than 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.770
 earlier of the network this with the pistons 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.170
 for righteous if the lava this is much more 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.960
 easy and as I always say is for the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.910
 people or the victim are those 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.740
 people who are clouds or are 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.870
 beginners and they are just beginning 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.989
 in this minecraft and it's very likely 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.940
 they fall then it is not all very 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.520
 easy and really do that here I go 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.290
 lit up a little ok 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.610
 it's very easy the materials are the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.760
 following stone sand network torch 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.150
 stone 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.220
 tnt and a diamond block can be a 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.320
 gold block of gold coal what do I know 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.700
 but I think the diamond is the block 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.310
 what else will draw the attention of the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.070
 victim true then good I choose 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.820
 this now the amount good the stone 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.850
 it is indeterminate in sand only 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.000
 it's 1 is two garretson torches and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.100
 four of tnt and if you want to do more one 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.410
 biggest exclusion for more tnt but 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.390
 with this is enough then 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.220
 I mean the environment need context 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.930
 it has to be logically a mine but 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.880
 let's assume that tsunami does not ok 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.490
 then here you are going to do the following 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.440
 you're going to break the center block 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.200
 you place the block that you are going to call the 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.079
 attention wait I compose this here 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.880
 okay 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.700
 and we are going to break what is around 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.030
 ok for good because the mechanism is going to 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.769
 to go 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.379
 logically behind the block that goes to 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.270
 get attention then while watching 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.480
 breaking 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:21.110
 I want to give you as a counsel before 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.750
 show it to the victim and that is what 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.110
 it's going to break it has to have the brightness what 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.480
 lowest possible and the sound of the game 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.330
 also as low as possible and if it is zero 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.040
 it is much better and this why then 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.010
 because if you have low brightness it is not going to 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.780
 see almost nothing what is going to be behind and 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.000
 less if there is light out there not from the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.610
 torches and sound so you do not 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.250
 listen then what is the one of the tele you 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.380
 you know active then is that then 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.860
 behind the diamond block will go 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.800
 a torch garretson on a block 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.270
 of sand and again a network torch 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.090
 they are but it is going to deactivate 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.820
 automatically ok it's like a clock or 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.100
 something like a network clock are I think 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.530
 they call him or something like that but the thing is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.500
 that there is once having this we are going to 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.680
 place the tnt up here 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.660
 one here back one here on the left 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.360
 Be careful because if you put it here 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.280
 is going to activate the tnt and there if I wanted 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.890
 the head then one here and one in the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.270
 right ok so that if you want 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.220
 place more in this as I said to the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.640
 principle, you can simply 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.890
 do it like this until home but be careful 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.630
 since if you place it for example here 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.760
 down is going to activate and you already shit all 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.610
 as I say but with this is enough 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.520
 to see if it works ok and more or 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.380
 less there and this would be finished 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.209
 now how is that that exploits how 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.510
 it works and that is when the enemy 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.370
 break this block this torch falls and 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.220
 it does not work therefore it will activate 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.250
 it would only ignite a 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.750
 second and it's enough for 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.870
 learn everything the TNT there is to your 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.459
 around and this would fall and the victim 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.239
 as bashar here it will explode and it will 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.250
 to die 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.410
 now the only thing that would be uncovered 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.860
 all this simply so that it is not 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.640
 Scope of the victim's sight 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.010
 and let's cover this and here and this 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.870
 is good this is all practically 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.410
 everything that needs to be done is very easy 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.060
 with a diamond or iron pick 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.640
 depending on the block as we put on 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.760
 well and another thing and that is that we have to 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.070
 be in normal difficulty because because 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.320
 if we put it in easy the most likely 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.020
 is that one does not die and cake logically 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.140
 It is easy or peaceful from normal 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.340
 plus there if it works then normal and 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.840
 I'm telling you because I 've tried it and 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.370
 I never came out so this is like 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.590
 tenth time I'm trying to record 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.040
 and that was why then the victim was 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.760
 about what is broken is activated and in question 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.390
 of seconds this explodes such that kabul 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.300
 there is ok and well this is the way 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.120
 the way it works and if you do not believe me 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.490
 this of difficult the peaceful thing that not 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.990
 it explodes and does not do anything to you because they will see 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.860
 or gay, look, I'm going to get this out 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.860
 and that 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.870
 and this will place looks pretty me 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.300
 I put in creative creative that got there 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.740
 and it will not kill me even though I'm 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.090
 so I'm a pacific they'll see 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.190
 it does not do anything to me, it does not even take away a 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.510
 heart and good is how it works 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.370
 study and it's a structure that was 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.880
 doing but how it all went wrong 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:36.250
 because it was so difficult, normal and 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.790
 that nothing I hope you liked it 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.430
 it was like that 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:43.830
 Comment subscribe your will 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.830
 remember to advisable to have low brightness 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.039
 what would this be abnormal so that 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.199
 work and the music also the lowest 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.180
 possible ok and if you liked it there's no 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:57.520
 comments include your will and we 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.520
 We see until the next bye
