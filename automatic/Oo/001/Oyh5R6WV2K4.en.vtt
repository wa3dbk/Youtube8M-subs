$100 will depend on configurations and
then<00:03:24.750> you'll<00:03:25.079> be<00:03:25.200> able<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.470> buy<00:03:25.590> add-ons<00:03:26.069> this

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
then you'll be able to buy add-ons this

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.099 
then you'll be able to buy add-ons this
is<00:03:26.669> the<00:03:26.760> remote<00:03:27.000> control<00:03:27.359> for<00:03:27.569> it's<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> pretty

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
is the remote control for it's a pretty

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.479 
is the remote control for it's a pretty
straightforward<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.709> can<00:03:28.799> move<00:03:29.069> it<00:03:29.220> forward

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
straightforward you can move it forward

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.849 
straightforward you can move it forward
left<00:03:29.880> back<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.720> can<00:03:30.900> turn<00:03:31.109> it<00:03:31.290> all<00:03:31.410> around<00:03:31.650> and

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
left back you can turn it all around and

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.470 
left back you can turn it all around and
then<00:03:31.950> angle<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.430> up<00:03:32.579> or<00:03:32.760> down<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.329> want

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
then angle it up or down so if you want

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.729 
then angle it up or down so if you want
to<00:03:33.510> shoot<00:03:33.690> up<00:03:33.810> or<00:03:33.930> down<00:03:34.079> as<00:03:34.319> they're<00:03:34.530> about<00:03:34.620> to

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
to shoot up or down as they're about to

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.409 
to shoot up or down as they're about to
shoot<00:03:35.010> at<00:03:35.099> my<00:03:35.190> camera<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:35.940> angle<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.239> up

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
shoot at my camera you can angle it up

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.089 
shoot at my camera you can angle it up
or<00:03:36.569> down<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.750> hit<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.169> so<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:37.889> the

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
or down to hit it so this is the

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.129 
or down to hit it so this is the
attacknids<00:03:38.459> combat<00:03:39.060> creatures<00:03:39.450> like<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:39.989> say

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
attacknids combat creatures like we say

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.420 
attacknids combat creatures like we say
can't<00:03:40.410> wait<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.650> get<00:03:40.739> our<00:03:40.859> hands<00:03:41.160> on<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.370> and

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
can't wait to get our hands on this and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.460 
can't wait to get our hands on this and
test<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.910> out<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.480> work<00:03:42.660> cited<00:03:43.019> looks<00:03:43.349> like

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
test it out the work cited looks like

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.559 
test it out the work cited looks like
it's<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.859> be<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> very<00:03:44.340> hot<00:03:44.609> toy<00:03:44.849> for

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
it's going to be a very hot toy for

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.960 
it's going to be a very hot toy for
Christmas<00:03:45.780> 2013<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:47.130> know<00:03:47.280> that's<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.579> far<00:03:47.790> way

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
Christmas 2013 I know that's a far way

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.490 
Christmas 2013 I know that's a far way
away<00:03:48.090> right<00:03:48.419> now<00:03:48.660> as<00:03:48.810> we're<00:03:48.959> recording<00:03:49.079> this

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
away right now as we're recording this

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.000 
away right now as we're recording this
but<00:03:50.069> this<00:03:50.190> looks<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.549> great<00:03:50.790> toy
