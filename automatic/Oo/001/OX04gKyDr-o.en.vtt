00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
of the fire Reds I I do like the lay

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660 
of the fire Reds I I do like the lay
nice<00:00:44.630> but<00:00:44.960> it's<00:00:45.230> not<00:00:45.350> like<00:00:45.680> one<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.580> those

colorways of that there are as far as

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.730 
colorways of that there are as far as
like<00:00:56.060> OG<00:00:56.450> models<00:00:56.810> are<00:00:56.930> concerned<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.500> this

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
like OG models are concerned this this

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.140 
like OG models are concerned this this

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
color weight but basically I'll just go

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.090 
color weight but basically I'll just go
through<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:01.820> real<00:01:02.060> quick<00:01:02.530> this<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.860> pair

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100

that<00:01:04.250> I<00:01:04.369> played<00:01:04.610> in<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.299> I<00:01:06.219> actually<00:01:07.219> do

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
that I played in and I actually do

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.069 
that I played in and I actually do
really<00:01:07.820> like<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:08.270> colorway<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.869> I<00:01:08.960> was

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
really like this colorway and I was

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.340 
really like this colorway and I was
really<00:01:09.289> not<00:01:10.130> happy<00:01:10.609> about<00:01:10.640> kind<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.689> ruining

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
really not happy about kind of ruining

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.469 
really not happy about kind of ruining
them<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.039> materials<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:13.789> soft<00:01:14.149> but<00:01:14.329> as

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
them the materials is so soft but as

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.139 
them the materials is so soft but as
soon<00:01:14.630> as<00:01:14.719> they<00:01:14.810> get<00:01:14.929> touched<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:16.340> just<00:01:16.579> man

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
soon as they get touched it just man

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.590 
soon as they get touched it just man

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
you know it's for a good cause I guess

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.080 
you know it's for a good cause I guess
and<00:01:23.649> this<00:01:24.649> colorway<00:01:24.979> actually<00:01:25.460> really<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:25.880> I

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090

wish<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.359> they<00:01:26.509> weren't<00:01:26.659> as<00:01:26.840> yellow<00:01:27.109> as<00:01:27.320> they

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
wish that they weren't as yellow as they

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.109 
wish that they weren't as yellow as they
are<00:01:27.649> but<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.189> know<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:28.999> what<00:01:29.179> it<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.799> in

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
are but you know it is what it is in

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.370 
are but you know it is what it is in
person<00:01:32.119> they<00:01:32.420> look<00:01:32.600> kind<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.840> like<00:01:32.899> a<00:01:33.020> greenish

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
person they look kind of like a greenish

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.870 
person they look kind of like a greenish
yellow<00:01:33.829> whereas<00:01:34.100> these<00:01:34.280> they<00:01:34.490> might<00:01:34.640> just

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
yellow whereas these they might just

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.029 
yellow whereas these they might just
kind<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.090> look<00:01:35.210> like<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.390> regular<00:01:35.600> yellow<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.950> I

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
kind of look like a regular yellow but I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.319 
kind of look like a regular yellow but I
always<00:01:37.280> love<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:37.640> colorway

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
always love this colorway

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.660 
always love this colorway
it's<00:01:38.689> a<00:01:38.749> classic<00:01:39.200> color<00:01:39.380> weight<00:01:39.640> again<00:01:40.640> I

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
it's a classic color weight again I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.099 
it's a classic color weight again I
don't<00:01:40.939> like<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.179> fire<00:01:41.390> red<00:01:41.659> them<00:01:41.780> with<00:01:41.960> the

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
don't like the fire red them with the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.859 
don't like the fire red them with the
red<00:01:42.619> bottom<00:01:42.979> here<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.579> black<00:01:43.869> little

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
red bottom here and the black little

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.830 
red bottom here and the black little
teeth<00:01:45.139> there<00:01:45.579> and<00:01:46.579> then<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:47.299> colorway<00:01:47.719> is

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
teeth there and then this colorway is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.859 
teeth there and then this colorway is
probably<00:01:48.409> one<00:01:48.649> of<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.829> better<00:01:49.090> nan<00:01:50.090> og<00:01:50.630> color

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
probably one of the better nan og color

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.840 
probably one of the better nan og color
reasons<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.409> women's<00:01:51.740> color<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.399> sunset

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
reasons the women's color is the sunset

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.120 
reasons the women's color is the sunset
