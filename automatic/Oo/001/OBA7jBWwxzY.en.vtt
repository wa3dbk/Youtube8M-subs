 leave your content 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.510
 comments so let's get the team out 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.970
 of the italian institute bel robotics 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.010
 created a mechanical tentacle using 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.680
 which can be lifted and held in 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.699
 operation time internal organs 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.370
 the device consists of two adjacent 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.140
 elastomer modules inside each of 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.680
 which are placed three cylindrical 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.960
 cameras 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.000
 pumping chambers with air at a certain 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.430
 order you can bend and stretch 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.930
 modules in any direction so soft 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.820

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.680
 solid researchers placed inside 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.780
 granular outer shell 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.250
 air inflator 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.020
 the granules are pressed 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.059
 and the outer membrane acquires 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.550
 rigidity during testing 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.170
 bend at an angle of up to 250 degrees 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.000
 draw at sixty-two percent 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.229
 from its original length and 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.549
 increased rigidity 60 to 200 percent 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.869
 developers are confident that their devices 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.090
 is the first step to create 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.760
 tool that is able to get 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.350
 to distant parts of the body and safe 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.080
 maintain organs around the site 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.729

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.700
 mimics long-term memory and 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.310
 human brain storage activities 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.170
 information processing is now cells 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.420
 the memory of most electronic devices 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.549
 can contain only one value 0 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.619
 or 1 developed memory allows 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.930
 store in one memory cell big 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.390
 range of numbers if you compare the usual 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.130
 memory cell with a light switch then its 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.380
 you can only turn it on and off 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.060
 our version is similar to dimmer regulator 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.420
 power stated by lead author 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.369
 Husseini research 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.110
 This means that the new memory cell 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.220
 can process information in mode 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.250
 real time 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.690

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.610
 Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.650
 scientists also hope that artificial 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.600
 neural networks based on their invention 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.850
 will have a major impact on development 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.150
 robotics business of robots is much 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.190
 savvy and more independent 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.110
 general electric engineers on 3d 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.390
 printers have created a miniature jet 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.900
 engine makes 30,000 turns in 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.120
 a minute 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.830
 this printing technique suggests 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.080
 layering metal 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.299
 the powder layers are combined when 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.640
 laser assistance the basis of the project lay 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.870
 small engine model 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.790
 used for model airplanes with 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.590
 remote control which 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.840
 adapted taking into account the features of 3d 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.450
 print after that the engine was tested in 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.489
 where tests are usually conducted 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.690
 full-sized jet engines 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.280
 3d printing technology using 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.750
 metal powder allows not 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.400
 only save material and but also 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.930
 create more complex parts with 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.840
 using various materials 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.239
 apply layer after layer american 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.940
 engineers created tablet apps 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.739
 or phone that allows you to manage 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.980
 thousands and even millions of robots leading 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.850
 fingers across the screen 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.450
 scientists from the institute of technology 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.560
 georgia in atlanta have developed an algorithm 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.690
 allowing the robot alone 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.090
 make a decision and left 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.739
 the ability to delegate authority 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.810
 man on the most common planning 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.640
 action to control the robots need 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.500
 tablet with an installed application and 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.959
 a set of spotlights or projectors 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.579
 their beam position can be controlled 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.890
 arbitrarily touching the screen 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.350
 one or more fingers during 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.480
 work robots measure the brightness of the light and 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.390
 collect the data so as 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.190
 their nearest neighbors were heavily lit 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.989
 then the role is rebuilt in this way 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.510
 that each member gets about 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.829
 the same amount of light and starts 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.870
 follow the light spot 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.250
 if she moves the scientist 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.349
 and what will farmers be able to do in the future 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.510
 send similar field robots to 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.069
 crop inspection workers in factories 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.440
 will be able to use them in order 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.480
 carry cargo and quickly redirect 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.760
 their other points where they are urgently needed 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.169
 help 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.540

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.949
 Does Russia have there on military and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.889
 civil aviation 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:52.680
 and from 2004 began to design his 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.500
 jetpack wing jetman apparatus 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.669
 different lack of wing mechanization 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.740
 it is managed by 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.870
 the center of mass shift and the pilot controls 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.789
 flying only by moving your arms and legs 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.130
 head for starting at the right height 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.960
 Russian apparatus need to be raised on the plane 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.539
 or helicopter for landing same 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.729
