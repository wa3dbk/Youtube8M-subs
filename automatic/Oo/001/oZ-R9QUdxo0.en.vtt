right hey everyone welcome back to
another<00:00:09.660> video<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.019> today<00:00:10.290> after<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> new

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
another video and today after you a new

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.759 
another video and today after you a new
slime<00:00:11.910> block<00:00:12.240> creation<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.620> an

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
slime block creation so we have an

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.950 
slime block creation so we have an
upwards<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.370> downwards<00:00:14.429> flying<00:00:15.240> machine<00:00:15.630> so

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
upwards and downwards flying machine so

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.109 
upwards and downwards flying machine so
last<00:00:16.289> time<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.619> made<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.520> upwards<00:00:17.910> flying

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
last time we made this upwards flying

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.790 
last time we made this upwards flying
machine<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> want<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.810> make<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.170> downwards

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
machine and I want to make a downwards

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800 
machine and I want to make a downwards
one<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> same<00:00:21.119> exact<00:00:21.510> way<00:00:21.660> is

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
one but if I use the same exact way is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.349 
one but if I use the same exact way is
this<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.320> sort<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.980> doesn't<00:00:23.160> really<00:00:23.400> work<00:00:23.730> so

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
this it sort of doesn't really work so

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.279 
this it sort of doesn't really work so
how<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.680> works<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.760> simply<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.960> fought

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
how this works so I simply just fought

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.140 
how this works so I simply just fought
about<00:00:28.439> something<00:00:28.980> which<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.670> dumb

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
about something which was really dumb

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.880 
about something which was really dumb
that<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.449> didn't<00:00:30.660> thought<00:00:30.840> about<00:00:31.050> before<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that I didn't thought about before is to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.610 
that I didn't thought about before is to
add<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.450> something<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.630> top<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.930> these<00:00:34.200> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
add on something on top of these and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.590 
add on something on top of these and
something<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> bottom<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.390> make

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
something on the bottom of this to make

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600 
something on the bottom of this to make
this<00:00:36.809> move<00:00:37.079> I'll<00:00:37.290> explain<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> works

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this move I'll explain you how it works

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.990 
this move I'll explain you how it works
but<00:00:39.450> I'll<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.750> demonstrate<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.500> how

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
but I'll just demonstrate to you how

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.180 
but I'll just demonstrate to you how
this<00:00:42.000> machine<00:00:42.510> works<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.500> all<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> do

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
this machine works so all you have to do

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.709 
this machine works so all you have to do
is<00:00:45.090> actually<00:00:45.510> power<00:00:46.350> will<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.340> update<00:00:47.719> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
is actually power will just update this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.569 
is actually power will just update this
block<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.890> i<00:00:50.190> guess<00:00:50.430> i'll<00:00:50.550> just

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
block right here so i guess i'll just

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.209 
block right here so i guess i'll just
use<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.570> let's<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.440> we're<00:00:52.920> gonna<00:00:53.010> update

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
use like let's see we're gonna update

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.330 
use like let's see we're gonna update
this<00:00:53.780> string<00:00:54.780> i<00:00:54.899> guess<00:00:55.110> screw<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.800> evening

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
this string i guess screw this evening

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.729 
this string i guess screw this evening
string<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.809> i<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.710> just

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
string so all i have to do is just

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.580 
string so all i have to do is just
update<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.699> piston<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
update this piston right here and the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.990 
update this piston right here and the
first<00:01:01.859> thing<00:01:02.010> you'll<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> but

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
first thing you'll do is do that but

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.579 
first thing you'll do is do that but
once<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.239> break<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> string<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> sort<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
once you break the string it is sort of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
once you break the string it is sort of
move<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.580> happens<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
move on what happens is because the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
move on what happens is because the
first<00:01:06.869> time<00:01:06.930> i<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.610> updates<00:01:08.970> both

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
first time i do it like it updates both

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.820 
first time i do it like it updates both
of<00:01:09.450> these<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.840> something<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.380> happens<00:01:10.680> but

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of these so something just happens but

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.740 
of these so something just happens but
whatever<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.000> see<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.390> moving

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
whatever so as you can see it's moving

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.960 
whatever so as you can see it's moving
up<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.920> fast<00:01:14.490> pace<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:16.850> going<00:01:17.850> up

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
up a really fast pace and it's going up

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.149 
up a really fast pace and it's going up
so<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.390> automatic<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.439> i<00:01:19.530> said<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.070> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
so it's automatic as i said and all you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.350 
so it's automatic as i said and all you
have<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> stop<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.000> break<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
have to do the stop is break the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
have to do the stop is break the
redstone<00:01:21.750> block<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> restart<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.860> place

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
redstone block and to restart it place

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.039 
redstone block and to restart it place
the<00:01:23.549> redstone<00:01:23.880> block<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> it'll<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.869> start

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the redstone block and it'll just start

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.950 
the redstone block and it'll just start
moving<00:01:25.470> again<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.520> let<00:01:27.150> me<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.689> rid<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
moving again so let me just get rid of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.539 
moving again so let me just get rid of
this<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.920> annoying<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
this because this is really annoying so

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
this because this is really annoying so
that's<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.479> upwards<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's for the upwards one and for the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.410 
that's for the upwards one and for the
downloads<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.640> same<00:01:32.850> exact<00:01:33.150> thing

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
downloads one it's the same exact thing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
downloads one it's the same exact thing
i<00:01:33.659> added<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.860> things<00:01:35.100> under<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
i added for things under here for the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.690 
i added for things under here for the
upwards<00:01:36.210> when<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.360> had<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.540> three<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.020> top<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.670> i

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
upwards when i had it three on top so i

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.880 
upwards when i had it three on top so i
have<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:40.020> update<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.770> right

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
have to do is to update this one right

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.340 
have to do is to update this one right
here<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:41.820> first<00:01:41.880> well<00:01:42.720> i<00:01:42.750> guess<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.140> one

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
here so at first well i guess this one

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.929 
here so at first well i guess this one
just<00:01:43.470> automatically<00:01:44.070> goes<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.640> reason

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
just automatically goes for some reason

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.520 
just automatically goes for some reason
oh<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> doesn't<00:01:46.170> update<00:01:46.259> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
oh it's because it doesn't update this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.350 
oh it's because it doesn't update this
nevermind<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.210> going

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
nevermind so as you can see it's going

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.030 
nevermind so as you can see it's going
down<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.780> pretty<00:01:49.020> fast<00:01:49.079> pace<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.829> i'll<00:01:49.950> have

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
down at a pretty fast pace and i'll have

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.499 
down at a pretty fast pace and i'll have
to<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.460> stand<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.939> top<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
to do is just stand on top of this and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.960 
to do is just stand on top of this and
i'll<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.110> down<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.320> I'll<00:01:52.740> never<00:01:53.280> liked

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
i'll just go down and I'll never liked

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420 
i'll just go down and I'll never liked
through<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> stop<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.590> once<00:01:55.829> again<00:01:56.130> i

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
through and to stop it once again i

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.899 
through and to stop it once again i
think<00:01:57.390> i<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.869> break<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:59.280> dang<00:01:59.880> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
think i have to break this one dang it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
think i have to break this one dang it
okay<00:02:00.390> i<00:02:00.420> failed<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.409> whatever<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.040> get<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
okay i failed but whatever you get to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
okay i failed but whatever you get to
hell<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.820> principle<00:02:03.360> i<00:02:03.420> guess<00:02:03.659> i'm

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
hell you get the principle i guess i'm

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.340 
hell you get the principle i guess i'm
just<00:02:04.380> fix<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.070> there<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> go<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> yeah<00:02:07.079> let's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
just fix this there you go so yeah let's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.800 
just fix this there you go so yeah let's
jump<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> explanation<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.610> these

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
jump to the explanation of these

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.949 
jump to the explanation of these
yeah<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.830> back<00:02:11.180> all<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
yeah you're back all right so for the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.660 
yeah you're back all right so for the
explanation<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.620> these<00:02:13.830> two<00:02:14.040> designs<00:02:14.400> we're

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
explanation of these two designs we're

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.339 
explanation of these two designs we're
just<00:02:14.819> going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> basically<00:02:15.180> demonstrate<00:02:16.110> how

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
just going to basically demonstrate how

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.309 
just going to basically demonstrate how
this<00:02:16.500> works<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.160> for<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> old<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.810> how<00:02:19.140> this

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
this works so for the old so how this

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.559 
this works so for the old so how this
works<00:02:19.590> before<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.030> place<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.510> a

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
works before is that when you place on a

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.570 
works before is that when you place on a
string<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.410> does<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:22.920> activates

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
string here what it does is it activates

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.760 
string here what it does is it activates
a<00:02:23.700> bud<00:02:23.880> switch<00:02:24.030> because<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:25.290> block<00:02:25.739> is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
a bud switch because this block is

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.280 
a bud switch because this block is
obviously<00:02:26.370> powering<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.480> pushes<00:02:27.690> it

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
obviously powering this so it pushes it

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.259 
obviously powering this so it pushes it
down<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:30.080> when<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.200> retracts<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:32.550> once<00:02:33.030> this

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
down and when it retracts so once this

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.910 
down and when it retracts so once this
retract<00:02:33.930> because<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.349> is<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.500> sticky<00:02:34.769> piston

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
retract because this is a sticky piston

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.160 
retract because this is a sticky piston
this<00:02:35.670> will<00:02:35.819> also<00:02:36.000> push<00:02:36.360> out<00:02:36.569> because<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.019> this

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
this will also push out because of this

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.600 
this will also push out because of this
bud<00:02:37.440> switch<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.160> pretty<00:02:38.400> much<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
bud switch so this is pretty much the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.330 
bud switch so this is pretty much the
same<00:02:38.790> thing<00:02:38.849> for<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.590> pushes<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.160> up

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
same thing for this so this pushes it up

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.340 
same thing for this so this pushes it up
because<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.910> bud<00:02:42.060> switch<00:02:42.260> retracted<00:02:43.260> it

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
because of the bud switch retracted it

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.559 
because of the bud switch retracted it
and<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.739> same<00:02:43.920> time<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.519> pushes<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
and at the same time it pushes it so it

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.300 
and at the same time it pushes it so it
moves<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.900> down<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.260> block<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.190> pretty

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
moves it down to block so it's pretty

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.030 
moves it down to block so it's pretty
much<00:02:47.519> go<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.660> one<00:02:48.930> move<00:02:49.200> down<00:02:49.440> two<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.920> this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
much go up one move down two and this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.090 
much go up one move down two and this
one<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.519> go<00:02:51.510> down<00:02:51.720> 1<00:02:51.780> move<00:02:52.350> up<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:52.950> that's

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
one is go down 1 move up to so that's

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.979 
one is go down 1 move up to so that's
why<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.310> moves<00:02:53.640> up<00:02:53.850> one<00:02:53.880> block<00:02:54.330> every<00:02:54.720> single

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
why I moves up one block every single

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.170 
why I moves up one block every single
time<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.769> what<00:02:56.069> we<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> same

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
time so what we have here is the same

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.120 
time so what we have here is the same
exact<00:02:57.510> thing<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.900> here<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.650> except

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
exact thing for here and here except

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.620 
exact thing for here and here except
that<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.310> added<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.940> top<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.360> what<00:03:00.510> this

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
that we added this on top so what this

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.110 
that we added this on top so what this
does<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:01.220> activating<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.340> bud<00:03:02.580> switch<00:03:02.730> cuz

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
does it's activating this bud switch cuz

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.470 
does it's activating this bud switch cuz
to<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.680> can<00:03:04.860> activate<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.760> bud<00:03:06.000> switch<00:03:06.120> by

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
to you can activate a bud switch by

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.039 
to you can activate a bud switch by
redstone<00:03:06.930> or<00:03:07.319> by<00:03:07.709> string<00:03:08.250> by<00:03:08.760> torches<00:03:09.569> by<00:03:09.810> any

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
redstone or by string by torches by any

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.920 
redstone or by string by torches by any
single<00:03:10.319> block<00:03:10.769> place<00:03:11.099> beside<00:03:11.549> this<00:03:11.819> or<00:03:12.060> by<00:03:12.690> any

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
single block place beside this or by any

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.500 
single block place beside this or by any
single<00:03:13.140> block<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.829> moves<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.579> apparent<00:03:15.299> so

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
single block that moves so apparent so

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.620 
single block that moves so apparent so
once<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.079> piston<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:17.340> regular<00:03:18.239> piston

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
once this piston this regular piston

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.020 
once this piston this regular piston
here<00:03:18.959> ooh<00:03:19.079> which<00:03:19.859> has<00:03:19.980> happened<00:03:20.310> there<00:03:20.459> so

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
here ooh which has happened there so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.270 
here ooh which has happened there so
once<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.480> regular<00:03:21.930> Pistons<00:03:22.470> let<00:03:23.040> me<00:03:23.100> just

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
once this regular Pistons let me just

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.420 
once this regular Pistons let me just
fix<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.810> push<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:24.959> up<00:03:25.109> it<00:03:25.560> also<00:03:25.890> activates

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
fix this push this up it also activates

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.759 
fix this push this up it also activates
the<00:03:26.549> bud<00:03:26.760> switch<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.359> that<00:03:28.319> pushes

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the bud switch and that pushes

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.039 
the bud switch and that pushes
everything<00:03:29.069> upwards<00:03:29.970> which<00:03:30.510> moves<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
everything upwards which moves the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.530 
everything upwards which moves the
piston<00:03:31.470> back<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.829> its<00:03:32.040> place<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.390> just

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
piston back to its place and it just

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.849 
piston back to its place and it just
keeps<00:03:33.630> on<00:03:33.780> going<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.230> what<00:03:34.380> happens<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.829> that

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
keeps on going so what happens is that

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.849 
keeps on going so what happens is that
once<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.609> piston<00:03:36.090> pushes<00:03:36.269> up<00:03:36.660> what<00:03:37.530> happens

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
once this piston pushes up what happens

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.890 
once this piston pushes up what happens
is<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.639> redstone<00:03:39.060> block<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.480> slime<00:03:39.690> block

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
is the redstone block in the slime block

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.949 
is the redstone block in the slime block
goes<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.350> this<00:03:40.680> position<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.569> once<00:03:42.569> this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
goes to this position and once this

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.530 
goes to this position and once this
moves<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.950> will<00:03:44.160> push<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.730> piston<00:03:44.880> back<00:03:45.239> up

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
moves it will push the piston back up

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.180 
moves it will push the piston back up
and<00:03:45.780> we'll<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.019> continue<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.530> cycle<00:03:46.739> and

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
and we'll just continue the cycle and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.250 
and we'll just continue the cycle and
for<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.549> thing<00:03:47.910> over<00:03:48.090> here<00:03:48.209> it's<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.049> same

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
for this thing over here it's the same

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.699 
for this thing over here it's the same
exact<00:03:49.739> thing<00:03:50.040> what<00:03:50.670> happens<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.709> this

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
exact thing what happens is that this

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.360 
exact thing what happens is that this
controls<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.910> bud<00:03:54.060> switch<00:03:54.180> over<00:03:54.480> here<00:03:54.720> so

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
controls the bud switch over here so

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.879 
controls the bud switch over here so
once<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.639> gets<00:03:56.989> once<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.109> pushes<00:03:58.530> out<00:03:58.680> it

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
once this gets once this pushes out it

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.569 
once this gets once this pushes out it
does<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.639> when<00:04:00.630> this<00:04:00.810> goes<00:04:01.139> down<00:04:01.170> one<00:04:01.889> it

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
does this and when this goes down one it

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.699 
does this and when this goes down one it
will<00:04:02.910> push<00:04:03.299> this<00:04:03.450> back<00:04:03.690> up<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.410> cycle

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
will push this back up and the cycle

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.710 
will push this back up and the cycle
just<00:04:04.769> keeps<00:04:05.069> going<00:04:05.340> oh<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.420> it's<00:04:06.540> kind<00:04:06.690> of

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
just keeps going oh so it's kind of

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.870 
just keeps going oh so it's kind of
confusing<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.560> understand<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.190> think<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.549> sets

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
confusing to understand I think I sets

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.059 
confusing to understand I think I sets
on<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.030> realm<00:04:09.299> but<00:04:09.450> whatever<00:04:09.930> it's<00:04:10.739> sort<00:04:11.010> of

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
on the realm but whatever it's sort of

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.590 
on the realm but whatever it's sort of
like<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.340> that's<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.700> basics<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.209> how<00:04:12.269> this

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
like that that's the basics of how this

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.310 
like that that's the basics of how this
works<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.799> yeah<00:04:14.600> alright<00:04:15.600> but<00:04:15.780> anyways<00:04:16.079> guys<00:04:16.260> I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
works so yeah alright but anyways guys I

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.960 
works so yeah alright but anyways guys I
really<00:04:16.500> hope<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.919> enjoyed<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.280> video<00:04:17.489> for

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
really hope you enjoyed this video for

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.699 
really hope you enjoyed this video for
the<00:04:18.060> upwards<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.570> downwards<00:04:18.630> flying<00:04:19.320> machine

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
the upwards and downwards flying machine

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.920 
the upwards and downwards flying machine
I'll<00:04:20.310> come<00:04:20.669> up<00:04:20.700> with<00:04:20.849> an<00:04:21.120> elevator<00:04:21.539> design

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
I'll come up with an elevator design

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.390 
I'll come up with an elevator design
sooner<00:04:22.380> or<00:04:22.500> later<00:04:22.620> and

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
sooner or later and

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.420 
sooner or later and
be<00:04:23.729> pretty<00:04:24.060> compact<00:04:24.449> i<00:04:24.780> don't<00:04:25.530> i<00:04:25.830> don't<00:04:26.160> know

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
be pretty compact i don't i don't know

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.510 
be pretty compact i don't i don't know
this<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:26.850> most<00:04:27.330> compact<00:04:27.720> way<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:29.009> design

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
this is the most compact way to design

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.820 
this is the most compact way to design
in<00:04:29.790> upwards<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.540> downwards<00:04:30.600> flying<00:04:31.470> machine

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
in upwards and downwards flying machine

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.740 
in upwards and downwards flying machine
this<00:04:32.100> contains<00:04:32.490> ten<00:04:32.759> blocks<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.270> this<00:04:33.389> 11

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
this contains ten blocks and this 11

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.999 
this contains ten blocks and this 11
blocks<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.139> don't<00:04:34.289> know<00:04:34.380> this<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.860> most

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
blocks I don't know this is the most

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.700 
blocks I don't know this is the most
compact<00:04:35.370> way<00:04:35.759> but<00:04:36.720> I'm<00:04:37.080> going<00:04:37.199> to<00:04:37.259> try<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.500> make

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
compact way but I'm going to try to make

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.129 
compact way but I'm going to try to make
an<00:04:38.039> elevator<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.330> we'll<00:04:39.900> see<00:04:40.050> how

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
an elevator for this and we'll see how

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.990 
an elevator for this and we'll see how
it<00:04:40.169> works<00:04:40.289> so<00:04:40.949> yeah<00:04:41.220> anyways<00:04:41.580> guys<00:04:41.699> I<00:04:41.850> hope<00:04:41.940> you

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
it works so yeah anyways guys I hope you

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.670 
it works so yeah anyways guys I hope you
enjoyed<00:04:42.090> this<00:04:42.360> video<00:04:42.479> once<00:04:42.780> again<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.530> I'll
