 Welcome to good 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.650
 a comment background update 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.230
 you are looking good I am very hoarse and 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.230
 that's worth I want to do it because I do not know 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.380
 I'm watching a gameplay of san andreas 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.410
 of a mini-game server 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.390
 because the truth is very good 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.960
 and I have things saved that are pretty 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.960
 funny 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.330
 they will put croquet as a mini is 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.660
 some cases because it 's pretty good 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.840
 and the truth is quite funny 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.400
 what was basically going on this is a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.400
 update comment 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.430
 I'm going to make a contest of my room 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.589
 and my everything when I have the TV here for 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.339
 I played the Xbox like a week 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.339
 without lighting 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.340
 and now I started good to have this new 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.180
 pc will mean many things many 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.180
 changes in this channel 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.350
 I'm going to do many more things 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.480
 watching san andreas 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.070
 I'm going to do a series of mini-games 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.920
 these are very funny the truth 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.260
 I have tried role play servers are 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.870
 well but I find a bit boring 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.550
 the long I do not know for tastes colors and 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.250
 good here these minigames 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.700
 it's very good so I'll give you things in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.420
 this t4 axis I think that in the end there 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.310
 Well that makes up for it, come on, but 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.680
 far 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.770
 You can also try it out I have 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.020
 also skyrim you are going to see sky link 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.409
 I started 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.479
 because I love that game too and the 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.490
 first and nothing inside everything was taught 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.270
 to the class and everything that I'm basically 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.270
 so you know 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.930
 what are you going to see in the videos 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.220
 and we ask ourselves things that we would like 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.210
 watch 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.210
 one last thing 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.360
 I started to have also going to define is 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.360
 some assembly 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.979
 of sniper that let see the game you go to 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:14.220
 have some montages of the whole game and 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.800
 some like other also 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.930
 and you may need to be competitive one 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.200
 challenge recorded by team speak may 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.840
 also see it 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.870
 and par excellence with four more fish 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.519
 that you're going to see a lot of promoter 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.770
 a lot of tutorials a lot 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.500
 of things because 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.260
 I changed told before the problem did not 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.580
 it is signed tig you have done everything is that the 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.410
 People have asked me how it is done 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.280
 When I recover my voice more 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.890
 and start doing those things 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.990
 but I already say sorry for what you see 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.840
 here this is how you see monstres and the one 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.020
 it falls down because it loses and the one that survives 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.420
 so it wins so it's running out 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.250
 there is little left basically this is what it is 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.130
 that this is all I wanted to say 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.420
 so this has been with nothing 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.740
 San Andreas 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.080
 we see each other 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.180
 When I know that I will upload, I will continue climbing 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.460
 for 5 main that may follow 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.410
 also thinking you're going to see what 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.580
 He also used broken or where I'm going 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.580
 than to record it more but 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.500
 maybe your fan 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.910

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.440
 he arrived like this this Friday night by 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.770
 that I do not have any commented video is 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.990
 so 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.920
