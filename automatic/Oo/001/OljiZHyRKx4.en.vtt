00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.370 
to royal decrees and one starlight road
now<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.270> whole<00:01:15.509> point<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> deck<00:01:16.140> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
now the whole point of the deck is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.899 
now the whole point of the deck is
really<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.860> get<00:01:16.979> out<00:01:17.130> satellite<00:01:17.580> cannon

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
really to get out satellite cannon

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
really to get out satellite cannon
because<00:01:18.299> once<00:01:18.509> he's<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.930> cannot<00:01:19.740> be

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
because once he's out cannot be

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
because once he's out cannot be
destroyed<00:01:20.100> by<00:01:20.250> battle<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.640> level<00:01:20.970> 7<00:01:21.240> or

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
lower monster so really the rest of the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.749 
lower monster so really the rest of the
deck<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.619> just<00:01:28.619> stall<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.960> protection<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
deck is just stall and protection and

cuz<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:52.950> machine<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.729> once<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.720> gets

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
cuz it's not machine so once you gets

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.969 
cuz it's not machine so once you gets
everywhere<00:01:55.290> around<00:01:57.229> they<00:01:58.229> might<00:01:58.469> attack<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979

solidarity<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:55.590> very<00:02:56.590> neat<00:02:56.860> duck<00:02:57.160> um<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:59.580> do<00:03:00.580> use

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
solidarity so very neat duck um I do use

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.060 
solidarity so very neat duck um I do use
the<00:03:01.360> overload<00:03:02.200> region<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:02.980> future<00:03:03.850> fujiyama

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
the overload region and future fujiyama

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.440 
the overload region and future fujiyama
it's<00:03:06.070> like<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.280> miracle<00:03:06.730> fusion<00:03:07.180> for<00:03:08.160> machines

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
it's like a miracle fusion for machines

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.070 
it's like a miracle fusion for machines
so<00:03:10.450> first<00:03:11.050> we<00:03:11.650> use<00:03:11.830> future<00:03:12.250> fusion<00:03:12.630> use<00:03:13.630> all<00:03:13.900> of

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
so first we use future fusion use all of

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.110 
so first we use future fusion use all of
them<00:03:14.230> except<00:03:14.620> for<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.860> cyber<00:03:15.549> satellite

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
them except for the cyber satellite

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.420 
them except for the cyber satellite
cannons<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.769> have<00:03:17.860> all<00:03:18.010> three<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.280> them

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
cannons if you have all three of them

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.670 
cannons if you have all three of them
out<00:03:18.580> just<00:03:18.940> do<00:03:19.180> everything<00:03:19.500> except<00:03:20.500> for<00:03:20.590> the

black eye surgery you can just get them
out<00:03:22.780> whenever<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.440> then<00:03:24.220> that's<00:03:24.430> why<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.700> use<00:03:24.790> a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
out whenever and then that's why I use a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.150 
out whenever and then that's why I use a
dimensional<00:03:25.600> fissure<00:03:25.780> just<00:03:26.590> one<00:03:26.860> in

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
dimensional fissure just one in

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.620 
dimensional fissure just one in
accordance<00:03:27.580> with<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.910> UH<00:03:27.940> solidarity's

because he's an on machine and whenever
I<00:03:33.040> plan<00:03:33.340> I'd<00:03:34.180> rather<00:03:34.450> have<00:03:34.690> him<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:35.049> get

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
I plan I'd rather have him just get

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.750 
I plan I'd rather have him just get
removed<00:03:35.470> from<00:03:35.620> play<00:03:35.769> when<00:03:36.040> he's<00:03:36.160> destroyed<00:03:36.280> so

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
removed from play when he's destroyed so

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.130 
removed from play when he's destroyed so
I<00:03:36.820> can<00:03:37.030> continue<00:03:37.630> using<00:03:38.049> my<00:03:38.320> solidarity's<00:03:38.980> so

and when I was unsure of keeping it in I

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.170 
and when I was unsure of keeping it in I
just<00:04:01.690> put<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.170> side<00:04:02.380> so<00:04:02.920> have<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.549> few<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.850> lot

a<00:04:08.500> limiter<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.630> thought<00:04:10.630> limiter<00:04:11.049> was<00:04:11.230> going<00:04:11.440> to

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500

a limiter I thought limiter was going to
be<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.590> good<00:04:11.829> choice<00:04:12.010> but<00:04:12.280> then<00:04:12.489> after<00:04:13.030> playing

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239
