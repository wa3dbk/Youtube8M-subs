knaves to be playing with his knob right
here<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:36.460> knob<00:01:36.730> is<00:01:36.910> how<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.090> control<00:01:37.330> the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
here this knob is how you control the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.630 
here this knob is how you control the
end<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:38.320> controls<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:39.100> amount<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.430> air<00:01:39.610> going

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
end it controls the amount of air going

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.300 
end it controls the amount of air going
into<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.060> crankcase<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:41.800> that<00:01:42.010> actually

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
into the crankcase so that actually

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.120 
into the crankcase so that actually
leans<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.790> richens<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.330> mixture<00:01:43.950> I'm<00:01:44.950> gonna

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
leans and richens the mixture I'm gonna

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.740 
leans and richens the mixture I'm gonna
stop<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.520> engine<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:45.910> turned<00:01:46.150> left<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.660> it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
stop the engine is turned left and it

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.870 
stop the engine is turned left and it
opens<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.110> right<00:01:47.260> up<00:01:47.410> so<00:01:48.190> it<00:01:48.280> doesn't<00:01:48.550> suck<00:01:48.730> up

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
opens it right up so it doesn't suck up

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.270 
opens it right up so it doesn't suck up
much<00:01:49.150> fuel<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.990> start<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.680> engine<00:01:50.950> for<00:01:51.070> fuel

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
much fuel and start the engine for fuel

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.850 
much fuel and start the engine for fuel
and<00:01:51.520> kills<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.910> there's<00:01:52.840> no<00:01:52.960> electrical<00:01:53.380> stop

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
and kills it there's no electrical stop

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.110 
and kills it there's no electrical stop
switch<00:01:54.160> or<00:01:54.310> anything<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.670> just<00:01:54.730> turn<00:01:55.000> this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
switch or anything you just turn this

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.960 
switch or anything you just turn this
knob<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:56.160> then<00:01:57.160> you<00:01:57.310> close<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.610> all<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.820> way

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970

knob and then you close it all the way
in<00:01:58.150> and<00:01:58.300> start<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.660> you'll<00:01:59.350> hear<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.620> pop<00:01:59.650> like

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
in and start it you'll hear it pop like

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.330 
in and start it you'll hear it pop like
it<00:02:00.250> did<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:01.510> then<00:02:01.630> I<00:02:01.690> turn<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.050> start<00:02:02.410> start

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
it did and then I turn to start start

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.430 
it did and then I turn to start start
it's<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.030> pretty<00:02:04.270> rich<00:02:04.479> mixture<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.020> allows<00:02:05.229> it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
it's a pretty rich mixture it allows it

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.190 
it's a pretty rich mixture it allows it
to<00:02:05.470> run<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> little<00:02:06.100> better<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:07.270> once<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.990> gets

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
to run a little better and once it gets

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.080 
to run a little better and once it gets
up<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:08.470> speed<00:02:08.740> when<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.520> start<00:02:09.790> bring<00:02:10.000> it
