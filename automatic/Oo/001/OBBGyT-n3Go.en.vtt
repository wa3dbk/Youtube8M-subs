00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 We are already started as the Brazilian fight 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.130
 I like it badly though michael 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.889
 richman the Brazilian - Japanese 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.570
 there fighting for bond 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 could not be alone ever a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.090
 Oo kick starts already online and hitting 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.850
 duo words make the lines 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.279
 could also easily be a card 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.560
 the main striking a child is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.359
 commanding the team was now a Christian 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.000
 shortened the knee distance was 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.550
 flung up from the American 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.969
 faces the same ex the main draw 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 in the main fight of the preliminary card 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.510
 Look who made the emarket by staying 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.879
 closely following the barking 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.020
 sharpness of the Brazilian was up with the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.539
 your box 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.230
 Finally, it was very well kept for me and 10 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.039
 to 9 for him in that first go to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.570
 second round is already an action for you 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.000
 and more political gets dangerous 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.430
 the first round as well. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500
 tight our southern cruise a good 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 sequence and dispatched shortened 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.540
 distance and now it's all up 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.799
 what about to try the knockout and if 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 recovered well and will fulfill all that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.140
 be used with the head and started in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.720
 second best of all, 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 fall is equilibrium on the ground where it 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.390
 is going better than the first 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.310
 too much response there the Brazilian is there 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.430
 flees quickly beyond the onslaught of 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.680

 andrÃ©s confirmed mike mitchell was 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.860
 using and abusing now gained confidence 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.259
 a draw in the final 12 minutes of the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.979
 second assault since he lost more 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.259
 something of this year but only after 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.450
 the bis package he's right he has a 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.750
 A woman who plays hard for this 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.750
 category can also be used 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.220
 really not promic pace then blow 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.160
 have to win the third round as well 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.850
 to leave no doubt with a second 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.530
 unquestionably went by goi 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.090
 and look how strong he is and more 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.739
 beautiful again having to keep the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.050
 pressure ops out he passes rookie tried 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.200
 pick up the guillotine now slipped 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.860
 The boat was also the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.410
 kitten there to escape the onslaught 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.370
 the last May deadline is the last 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.230
 Assault, how did you talk about it? 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.340
 Brazilian likes death of shorts 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.930
 blue 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.660
 however the American will get you 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.840
 walk back now you'd rather not 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:54.070
 risk only protects yourself in curitiba came 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.720
 up against attacks now brazilian 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.269
 but a Brazilian kick 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.269
 and then it ends up fighting is that the arms 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.870

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.870
