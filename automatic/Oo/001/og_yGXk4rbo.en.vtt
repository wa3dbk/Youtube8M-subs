00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 hi my name is denis and my name is 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.280
 Xenia and we will be again today 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.190
 test google application by the way what 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.660
 do you shout anything that anything 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.689
 chew shouted we will not shout i 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.700
 In general I like to scream open the application 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.300
 google recognizes not only the quietest 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.640
 sounds like whisper new sounds which 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:43.829
 very difficult to hear noisy environment 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:46.260
 and now we'll probably show you the most 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.660
 simple experience with the sound of the phone from 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.829
 plastic cups and I'll even let 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.440
 tell Katyusha 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.930
 how it works 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 so plastic cup in this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.300
 designs fulfills the role and dynamics and 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.300
 microphone 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.259
 when one caller is on the phone 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.360
 sound waves create air vibrations 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.270
 which are transmitted to the walls and bottom 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.369
 a cup which in turn 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.899
 passes you lie on another 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.940
 rope side sound wave 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.920
 causes the bottom and walls to fluctuate 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.720
 another cups these vibrations 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.520
 transmitted to air and 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.520
 perceived by the other party's ear 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.700
 ok google sound speed 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:36.060
 340 and 29 meters per second 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.360
 29 acres for sure 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.250
 and now we will see how it works 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.679
 google application in noisy environments 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.780
 this they on my most favorite experiences he 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.200
 very cheerful and he is called flashy 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.840
 balls 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.740
 we have an evening and we'll start with 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.740
 small ball 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.679
 ok google for i no longer communicate 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.679

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.190
 I want to try too 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 ok google 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 bread 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.780
 you wanted to tell me something to sound on 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:09.810
