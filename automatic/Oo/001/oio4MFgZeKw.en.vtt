plamen<00:01:34.829> left<00:01:35.100> mid<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.720> left-wing<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.229> probably

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
plamen left mid or left-wing I probably

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.730 
plamen left mid or left-wing I probably
say<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.130> blaming<00:01:38.400> left<00:01:38.759> me<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.110> 352<00:01:40.110> just

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
say more blaming left me in a 352 just

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620 
say more blaming left me in a 352 just
because<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.909> position<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
because that is a kind of position that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
because that is a kind of position that
he'd<00:01:42.750> worked<00:01:43.020> best<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.159> saw<00:01:44.340> my

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.100 
he'd worked best with and if you saw my
albrighton<00:01:45.030> review<00:01:45.329> earlier<00:01:45.360> today<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
albrighton review earlier today if you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.050 
albrighton review earlier today if you
didn't<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.409> check<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> play<00:01:47.850> him

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
didn't go check it out and play him

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.109 
didn't go check it out and play him
right<00:01:48.479> mid<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.320> 352<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.310> you'll<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
right mid in the 352 and you'll have a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
right mid in the 352 and you'll have a
very<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.930> good<00:01:52.200> partnership<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.310> I

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
very very good partnership there but I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.160 
very very good partnership there but I
think<00:01:53.610> he's<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:54.000> good<00:01:54.210> player<00:01:54.329> he's<00:01:54.840> going

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
think he's a very good player he's going

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.069 
think he's a very good player he's going

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
doesn't have the best curve but he

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.440 
doesn't have the best curve but he
scored<00:02:11.220> some<00:02:11.400> quite<00:02:11.700> nice<00:02:11.849> for<00:02:11.879> next<00:02:12.270> shots

I cut sitting near the box Eli the pass

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.470 
I cut sitting near the box Eli the pass
across<00:02:17.010> or<00:02:17.340> he'll<00:02:17.519> score<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:17.970> himself<00:02:18.090> which

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
across or he'll score it himself which

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.479 
across or he'll score it himself which
is<00:02:18.629> very<00:02:18.870> very<00:02:19.079> good<00:02:19.200> indeed<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.069> like<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
is very very good indeed and I like it

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.580 
is very very good indeed and I like it
about<00:02:20.700> him<00:02:20.939> very<00:02:21.239> much<00:02:21.629> also<00:02:22.200> he's<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.439> Game

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
about him very much also he's in Game

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.229 
about him very much also he's in Game
strength<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.040> very<00:02:23.220> good<00:02:23.489> now<00:02:23.670> he's<00:02:23.819> not<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
strength is very good now he's not the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.600 
strength is very good now he's not the
quickest<00:02:24.659> by<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:24.989> mile<00:02:25.349> he's<00:02:25.620> not<00:02:25.920> very<00:02:26.099> fast<00:02:26.400> at

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
quickest by a mile he's not very fast at

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.550 
quickest by a mile he's not very fast at
all<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.329> his<00:02:27.450> dribbling<00:02:27.930> makes<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.319> for<00:02:28.470> it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
all but his dribbling makes up for it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.770 
all but his dribbling makes up for it
and<00:02:28.680> also<00:02:28.829> his<00:02:29.430> strength<00:02:29.939> makes<00:02:30.239> up<00:02:30.510> for<00:02:30.689> it<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and also his strength makes up for it a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.690 
and also his strength makes up for it a
lot<00:02:31.140> now<00:02:31.379> he's<00:02:31.500> dribbling<00:02:31.739> feels<00:02:32.159> really<00:02:32.489> good

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
lot now he's dribbling feels really good

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.550 
lot now he's dribbling feels really good
it<00:02:32.819> didn't<00:02:33.060> feel<00:02:33.150> like<00:02:33.209> 78<00:02:33.989> he<00:02:34.079> feels<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.409> lot

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it didn't feel like 78 he feels a lot

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.490 
it didn't feel like 78 he feels a lot
better<00:02:34.829> it<00:02:35.250> feels<00:02:35.459> more<00:02:35.879> like<00:02:35.939> 84<00:02:36.780> 85<00:02:37.230> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
better it feels more like 84 85 and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.110 
better it feels more like 84 85 and
that's<00:02:37.650> because<00:02:37.950> he's<00:02:38.040> quite<00:02:38.280> slow<00:02:38.670> which

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
that's because he's quite slow which

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.490 
that's because he's quite slow which
means<00:02:39.359> he<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.629> close<00:02:39.780> quarters<00:02:40.200> dribble<00:02:40.439> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
means he can close quarters dribble a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.319 
means he can close quarters dribble a
lot<00:02:40.709> easier<00:02:40.859> than<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.250> faster<00:02:41.609> players<00:02:41.790> which

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
lot easier than the faster players which

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.309 
lot easier than the faster players which
means<00:02:42.540> he<00:02:42.599> doesn't<00:02:42.720> need<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.079> higher

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
means he doesn't need the higher

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.440 
means he doesn't need the higher
dribbling<00:02:43.739> stat<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.579> kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:45.000> know<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
dribbling stat to kind of you know be a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.000 
dribbling stat to kind of you know be a
good<00:02:45.750> dribbler<00:02:46.079> which<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.409> really<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.889> about

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
good dribbler which I really like about

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.890 
good dribbler which I really like about
him<00:02:47.280> plus<00:02:47.760> with<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.000> whole<00:02:48.209> card<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.569> makes<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
him plus with the whole card it makes it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.080 
him plus with the whole card it makes it
71<00:02:49.290> pace<00:02:49.680> doesn't<00:02:50.129> make<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.489> too<00:02:50.760> bad<00:02:50.970> it

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
71 pace doesn't make it too bad it

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.089 
71 pace doesn't make it too bad it
actually<00:02:51.180> makes<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.629> quite<00:02:51.780> bearable<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.950> I

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
actually makes it quite bearable and I

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.410 
actually makes it quite bearable and I
actually<00:02:53.280> recommend<00:02:53.579> that<00:02:53.909> you<00:02:54.000> go<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.180> try

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
actually recommend that you go to try

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.610 
actually recommend that you go to try
them<00:02:54.569> out<00:02:54.659> if<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.170> find<00:02:55.319> him<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
them out if you can find him on the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.890 
them out if you can find him on the
market<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.879> he's<00:02:57.000> very<00:02:57.359> hard<00:02:57.629> to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
market that is because he's very hard to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.050 
market that is because he's very hard to
