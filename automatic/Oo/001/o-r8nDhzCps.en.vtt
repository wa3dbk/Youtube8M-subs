completely dead so we're going to going

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.859 
completely dead so we're going to going
to<00:00:19.859> show<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> test<00:00:20.490> real<00:00:20.699> quick<00:00:20.910> you

to show you what the test real quick you

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.790 
to show you what the test real quick you
know<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> first<00:00:22.199> thing<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.439> want<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> check

know the first thing you want to check

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.529 
know the first thing you want to check
whenever<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.310> happens<00:00:23.789> that's<00:00:24.180> actually

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
whenever this happens that's actually

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.670 
whenever this happens that's actually
pretty<00:00:24.750> simple<00:00:25.430> I've<00:00:26.430> already<00:00:26.789> taken<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
pretty simple I've already taken the

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
pretty simple I've already taken the
case<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.340> microwave<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.090> basically<00:00:30.480> how

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
case off the microwave and basically how

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
case off the microwave and basically how
you<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.250> it's<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> couple

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
you do that it's going to be a couple

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.900 
you do that it's going to be a couple
screws<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.270> back<00:00:34.340> all<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> way<00:00:35.610> around

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
screws in the back all the way around

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
screws in the back all the way around
that<00:00:36.090> perimeter<00:00:36.360> once<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.050> take<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.350> screws

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that perimeter once you take them screws

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
that perimeter once you take them screws
out<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.070> hole<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.180> slides<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:39.540> off

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
out the hole it just slides right off

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.330 
out the hole it just slides right off
you<00:00:40.140> can't<00:00:40.350> figure<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.710> don't<00:00:40.980> work<00:00:41.160> on

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
you can't figure that out don't work on

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.650 
you can't figure that out don't work on
it<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.980> pretty<00:00:44.280> simple<00:00:44.520> screws<00:00:45.510> in

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it so that is pretty simple screws in

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
it so that is pretty simple screws in
the<00:00:45.719> back<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.559> whole<00:00:46.710> shell<00:00:46.950> comes<00:00:47.190> off<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the back the whole shell comes off and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.220 
the back the whole shell comes off and
the<00:00:48.239> whole<00:00:48.329> microwave<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> be

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the whole microwave is going to be

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.430 
the whole microwave is going to be
exposed

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.290 

the<00:00:52.890> piece<00:00:53.220> you<00:00:53.250> want<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.150> it's

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the piece you want to go for when it's

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
the piece you want to go for when it's
completely<00:00:54.750> dead<00:00:55.130> is<00:00:56.130> right<00:00:56.400> up<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
completely dead is right up here at the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.230 
completely dead is right up here at the
top<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> means<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> microwave

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
top and what that means is the microwave

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.850 
top and what that means is the microwave
was<00:01:00.480> overheated<00:01:00.960> maybe<00:01:01.260> something<00:01:01.590> was<00:01:01.680> too

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
was overheated maybe something was too

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.820 
was overheated maybe something was too
hot<00:01:02.390> something<00:01:03.390> was<00:01:03.480> too<00:01:03.630> big<00:01:03.930> inside<00:01:04.559> there

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
hot something was too big inside there

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.330 
hot something was too big inside there
top<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:05.960> microwave<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.200> too<00:01:07.380> hot<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
top of the microwave got too hot and it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.060 
top of the microwave got too hot and it
killed<00:01:08.550> that<00:01:08.640> thermostat<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
killed that thermostat so what I'm going

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.010 
killed that thermostat so what I'm going
to<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.340> bypass<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.000> real<00:01:12.180> quick<00:01:12.420> plug<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to do is bypass that real quick plug the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.070 
to do is bypass that real quick plug the
microwave<00:01:13.440> back<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.190> see<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:14.910> happens

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.930

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
hastily stuck a piece of wire between

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.090 
hastily stuck a piece of wire between
those<00:01:22.950> two<00:01:23.100> connections<00:01:24.619> plug<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> microwave

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
those two connections plug the microwave

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:38.170 
those two connections plug the microwave
back<00:01:26.340> into<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> wall<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:29.190> here<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.270> go

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.359
