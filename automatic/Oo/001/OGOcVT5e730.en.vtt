Everyone knows artists such as Picasso, van Gogh, and all the other famous ones.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:42.000
However, these artists, despite their popularity,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:02.000
have only drawn works of art to show several perspectives to their audience. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The artists of today, which are on par with van Gogh and Picasso, are the developers at ArenaNet. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They continually strive to perfect their masterpiece – Guild Wars 2. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:02.000
A masterpiece, which we, the Guild Wars 2 Community, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:22.000
cannot simply observe from one perspective.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:42.000
In fact, we experience it; we’re running through this masterpiece 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and we’re going deeper and deeper into these portraits, in order to experience it to the fullest.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:22.000
With this video, I want to thank ArenaNet on behalf of the Guild Wars 2 Community,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:42.000
as well as myself for gifting us such a masterpiece. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You are the artists of today, you are the artists of the modern era!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:22.000
We, the guild DarkMojo, are proud to be a part of this work of art!
