this<00:00:40.710> baggage<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.600> case<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.020> relate<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
this baggage in the case that relate to

the DC restoration in particular but

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.220 
the DC restoration in particular but
that's<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> cloud<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.930> eyes<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that's not going to cloud the eyes of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.360 
that's not going to cloud the eyes of
