00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
image on the back I just want to know

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.729 
image on the back I just want to know
here<00:02:10.840> there<00:02:10.989> is<00:02:11.079> a<00:02:11.110> little<00:02:11.350> bit<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.590> water

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
here there is a little bit of water

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:12.990 
here there is a little bit of water
marking<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:12.519> see<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.760> right<00:02:12.970> there

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
marking you just see it right there

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.640 
marking you just see it right there
that's<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.480> only<00:02:13.780> spot<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:14.350> showing

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
that's the only spot that it's showing

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.050 
that's the only spot that it's showing
up<00:02:14.799> there<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.370> basically<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:15.730> looks<00:02:15.910> like

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
up there and basically it looks like

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.550 
up there and basically it looks like
there's<00:02:16.239> water<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.750> know<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.989> between<00:02:17.380> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
there's water you know in between the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.960 
there's water you know in between the
case<00:02:17.769> and<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.100> phone<00:02:18.310> but<00:02:18.519> basically<00:02:18.730> what<00:02:18.880> it

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
case and the phone but basically what it

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.250 
case and the phone but basically what it
is<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.329> back<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.660> phone<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.930> pressing

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
is is the back of the phone is pressing

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.030 
is is the back of the phone is pressing
up<00:02:20.410> against<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.889> case<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.310> making<00:02:21.579> that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
up against the case and making that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.039 
up against the case and making that
a<00:02:22.069> little<00:02:22.700> artifact<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.329> guess<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.900> that's

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
a little artifact I guess on it that's

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.630 
a little artifact I guess on it that's
the<00:02:24.140> only<00:02:24.170> spot<00:02:24.409> it's<00:02:24.739> not<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.099> bad<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:25.340> you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the only spot it's not that bad but you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.250 
the only spot it's not that bad but you
know<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:25.819> not<00:02:26.000> something<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.840> prefer<00:02:27.140> to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
know that's not something you prefer to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.319 
know that's not something you prefer to
have<00:02:27.439> on<00:02:27.709> these<00:02:28.040> type<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.400> clear<00:02:28.579> cases<00:02:28.849> and<00:02:29.209> on

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
have on these type of clear cases and on

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.490 
have on these type of clear cases and on
the<00:02:29.390> front<00:02:29.599> here<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:29.780> plastic<00:02:30.170> comes<00:02:30.349> up<00:02:30.469> just

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
the front here the plastic comes up just

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.140 
the front here the plastic comes up just
to<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> glass<00:02:31.250> there<00:02:31.489> really<00:02:31.640> isn't<00:02:31.849> much<00:02:31.969> of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to the glass there really isn't much of

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.670 
to the glass there really isn't much of
a<00:02:32.299> raised<00:02:32.569> edge<00:02:32.870> there<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.170> when<00:02:33.379> you<00:02:33.409> put<00:02:33.590> it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
a raised edge there so when you put it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.830 
a raised edge there so when you put it
down<00:02:33.890> on<00:02:34.189> the<00:02:34.400> surface<00:02:34.609> the<00:02:35.480> glass<00:02:35.659> will

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
down on the surface the glass will

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.270 
down on the surface the glass will
probably<00:02:36.079> be<00:02:36.170> touching<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.590> service<00:02:37.099> just

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
probably be touching that service just

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.800 
probably be touching that service just
that<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.640> very<00:02:38.000> very<00:02:38.030> slight<00:02:38.359> so<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.629> you're<00:02:38.750> on

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
that a very very slight so if you're on

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.479 
that a very very slight so if you're on
a<00:02:38.870> very<00:02:38.989> flat<00:02:39.349> level<00:02:39.650> service<00:02:40.099> it<00:02:40.220> might<00:02:40.340> give

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
a very flat level service it might give

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.309 
a very flat level service it might give
