00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
you can't really get up there the only

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.769 
you can't really get up there the only
way<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.520> get<00:00:24.730> up<00:00:24.850> there<00:00:25.029> is<00:00:25.240> by<00:00:25.420> doing<00:00:25.480> this

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
way to get up there is by doing this

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.720 
way to get up there is by doing this
glitch<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.380> it<00:00:26.500> has<00:00:26.710> not<00:00:26.949> been<00:00:27.010> patched<00:00:27.490> yet

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
glitch and it has not been patched yet

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.609 
glitch and it has not been patched yet
which<00:00:27.940> is<00:00:27.970> awesome<00:00:28.300> so<00:00:29.050> what<00:00:29.170> you<00:00:29.230> do<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.410> you

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
which is awesome so what you do is you

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.710 
which is awesome so what you do is you
go<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.800> this<00:00:29.980> corner<00:00:30.310> you<00:00:30.880> double<00:00:31.300> jump<00:00:31.539> and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
go to this corner you double jump and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.049 
go to this corner you double jump and
then<00:00:31.810> go<00:00:31.930> backwards<00:00:32.469> you<00:00:33.219> land<00:00:33.489> up<00:00:33.670> on<00:00:33.879> this

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
then go backwards you land up on this

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.630 
then go backwards you land up on this
late<00:00:34.449> thing<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:34.989> then<00:00:35.140> what<00:00:35.440> you'd<00:00:36.069> want<00:00:36.489> to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
late thing and then what you'd want to

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.479 
late thing and then what you'd want to
avoid<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.659> white<00:00:37.989> just<00:00:38.800> avoid<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.370> completely

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
avoid the white just avoid it completely

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.000 
avoid the white just avoid it completely
because<00:00:40.030> if<00:00:40.659> you<00:00:40.870> hit<00:00:41.050> it<00:00:41.199> you'll<00:00:41.319> fall<00:00:41.649> and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
because if you hit it you'll fall and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.090 
because if you hit it you'll fall and
you<00:00:42.670> just<00:00:42.699> double<00:00:43.269> jump<00:00:43.510> right<00:00:44.440> up<00:00:44.499> onto<00:00:44.859> the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
you just double jump right up onto the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.419 
you just double jump right up onto the
roof<00:00:45.249> there<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.649> then<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:47.859> can<00:00:48.039> double<00:00:48.399> jump

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
roof there and then you can double jump

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.199 
roof there and then you can double jump
around<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.449> boom<00:00:50.019> there<00:00:50.829> on<00:00:51.069> top<00:00:51.429> of<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.909> roof

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:52.209 
around and boom there on top of the roof

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:55.049 
around and boom there on top of the roof
which<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:52.989> really<00:00:53.499> really<00:00:53.769> cool<00:00:54.219> and<00:00:54.819> you<00:00:55.030> can

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
which is really really cool and you can

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.209 
which is really really cool and you can
actually<00:00:55.510> get<00:00:55.690> all<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.109> way<00:00:56.199> up<00:00:56.589> to<00:00:57.069> the<00:00:57.100> top

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
actually get all the way up to the top

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.699 
actually get all the way up to the top
top<00:00:59.760> right<00:01:00.760> here<00:01:01.149> which<00:01:01.569> is<00:01:01.780> sick<00:01:02.260> because

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:02.709 
top right here which is sick because

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:05.189 
top right here which is sick because
then<00:01:03.369> if<00:01:03.729> you're<00:01:04.360> playing<00:01:04.540> like<00:01:04.750> search<00:01:05.020> and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
then if you're playing like search and

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.750 
then if you're playing like search and
destroy<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.590> can<00:01:05.860> look<00:01:06.010> at<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.250> bomb<00:01:06.460> right

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
destroy you can look at the bomb right

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.940 
destroy you can look at the bomb right
there<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.750> other<00:01:07.930> bombs<00:01:08.200> in<00:01:08.440> between<00:01:08.770> you

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
there the other bombs in between you

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.920 
there the other bombs in between you
can't<00:01:09.160> really<00:01:09.250> see<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.700> but<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:10.540> thought<00:01:10.780> this

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
can't really see it but I thought this

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.260 
can't really see it but I thought this
was<00:01:11.110> awesome<00:01:11.650> definitely<00:01:12.430> really<00:01:12.640> cool<00:01:12.790> and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
was awesome definitely really cool and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.380 
was awesome definitely really cool and
it's<00:01:14.140> useful<00:01:14.890> in<00:01:15.130> multiplayer<00:01:15.760> until<00:01:16.150> it<00:01:16.240> gets

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
it's useful in multiplayer until it gets

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.510 
it's useful in multiplayer until it gets
patched<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.230> can<00:01:17.380> also<00:01:17.530> jump<00:01:18.010> up<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.370> the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
patched and you can also jump up on the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.390 
patched and you can also jump up on the
turtle<00:01:18.880> if<00:01:19.300> you<00:01:19.930> guys<00:01:20.110> remember<00:01:20.410> that<00:01:20.770> spawns

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
turtle if you guys remember that spawns

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.000 
turtle if you guys remember that spawns
you<00:01:21.790> can<00:01:21.940> actually<00:01:22.270> get<00:01:22.390> on<00:01:22.540> top<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.870> it<00:01:23.200> which

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
you can actually get on top of it which

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.070 
you can actually get on top of it which
is<00:01:24.190> really<00:01:24.460> cool<00:01:24.730> so<00:01:25.120> if<00:01:25.360> you're<00:01:25.840> like<00:01:26.050> a
