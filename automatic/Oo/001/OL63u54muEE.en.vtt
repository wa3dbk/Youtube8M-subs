two tubes that lead into ear ear points

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.630 
two tubes that lead into ear ear points
and<00:00:38.260> has<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.600> way<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.629> amplifying<00:00:41.470> sound<00:00:42.400> so

microphone point on the ice that's a

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.560 
microphone point on the ice that's a
scope<00:01:19.360> app<00:01:19.659> on<00:01:19.990> your<00:01:20.080> iPhone<00:01:20.619> well<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.570> iPhone

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
did that bird yeah okay there there you

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.419 
did that bird yeah okay there there you
go<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.229> right<00:01:53.439> at<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.649> apex<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.399> heart

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
go so right at the apex of the heart

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.989 
go so right at the apex of the heart
like<00:01:55.270> six<00:01:55.630> different<00:01:55.899> places<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.369> can

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
like six different places that you can

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:00.389 
like six different places that you can
stick<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:58.869> but<00:01:59.259> because<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.979> microphone

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
stick that but because the microphone

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.069 
stick that but because the microphone
point<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:00.939> small<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.329> really<00:02:01.630> have<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.990> be

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
point is so small you really have to be

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.980 
point is so small you really have to be
quite<00:02:02.380> accurate<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:03.700> actually<00:02:04.359> left<00:02:04.689> of

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
quite accurate and so actually left of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.809 
quite accurate and so actually left of
nipple<00:02:05.380> I'm<00:02:05.469> just<00:02:05.710> below<00:02:06.039> at<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.369> really<00:02:06.640> good

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
nipple I'm just below at a really good

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:17.730 
nipple I'm just below at a really good
point<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.810> access

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.730 

and<00:02:18.370> then<00:02:18.550> after<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.090> gets<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.540> little<00:02:20.500> bit

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
and then after it gets a little bit

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.620 
and then after it gets a little bit
reading<00:02:21.070> can<00:02:21.340> actually<00:02:21.700> tap<00:02:22.000> on<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
reading can actually tap on the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.990 
reading can actually tap on the
stethoscope<00:02:22.960> there<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.280> gives<00:02:24.490> you<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
stethoscope there and it gives you a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.060 
stethoscope there and it gives you a
readout<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:26.350> have<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.530> little<00:02:26.710> short<00:02:26.890> readout

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
readout you have a little short readout

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.370 
readout you have a little short readout
you<00:02:27.280> could<00:02:27.460> send<00:02:27.760> off<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.270> your<00:02:28.690> doctor's

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
you could send off to your doctor's

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.490 
you could send off to your doctor's
office<00:02:29.530> or<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.010> friend<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:31.330> meant<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.110> be<00:02:32.230> kind

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
office or a friend that meant to be kind

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.700 
office or a friend that meant to be kind
of<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.650> fun<00:02:32.830> app<00:02:33.070> at<00:02:33.280> first<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:33.730> then<00:02:34.710> dr.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
of a fun app at first but then dr.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.250 
of a fun app at first but then dr.
Bentley<00:02:36.210> recognized<00:02:37.210> that<00:02:37.540> uh<00:02:37.570> people<00:02:38.050> who

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
Bentley recognized that uh people who

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.040 
Bentley recognized that uh people who
are<00:02:38.320> interest<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.240> we're<00:02:40.240> doctors<00:02:40.720> nurses

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
are interest in it we're doctors nurses

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.130 
are interest in it we're doctors nurses
and<00:02:41.440> probably<00:02:41.830> EMT<00:02:42.370> people<00:02:42.700> because<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
and probably EMT people because you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.750 
and probably EMT people because you
could<00:02:44.320> have<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:45.010> at<00:02:45.130> all<00:02:45.220> times<00:02:45.280> and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
could have this on you at all times and

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.560 
could have this on you at all times and
you<00:02:45.850> wouldn't<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.960> stethoscope

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
you wouldn't have to have a stethoscope

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.030 
you wouldn't have to have a stethoscope
you<00:02:49.570> could<00:02:49.720> use<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.020> ice<00:02:50.170> stethoscope<00:02:50.800> app

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
you could use the ice stethoscope app

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.970 
you could use the ice stethoscope app
now<00:02:51.760> like<00:02:52.240> I<00:02:52.360> said<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.630> could<00:02:53.080> measure<00:02:53.560> your

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
now like I said you could measure your

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.600 
now like I said you could measure your
heart<00:02:54.280> rate<00:02:54.540> or<00:02:55.540> hear<00:02:55.840> your<00:02:55.990> heart<00:02:56.200> rate<00:02:56.610> off

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
heart rate or hear your heart rate off

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.800 
heart rate or hear your heart rate off
of<00:02:57.820> another<00:02:57.970> point<00:02:58.450> say<00:02:58.780> your<00:02:59.020> neck<00:02:59.290> and<00:03:00.810> you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
of another point say your neck and you

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.540 
of another point say your neck and you
know<00:03:01.900> there's<00:03:02.110> possibilities<00:03:02.890> for<00:03:03.190> use<00:03:03.370> that

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
know there's possibilities for use that

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.570 
know there's possibilities for use that
my<00:03:03.730> current<00:03:04.030> microphone<00:03:04.630> for<00:03:04.840> other<00:03:05.020> things

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
my current microphone for other things

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.520 
my current microphone for other things
people<00:03:06.580> have<00:03:06.820> been<00:03:06.910> talking<00:03:07.270> about<00:03:07.330> maybe<00:03:07.870> for

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
people have been talking about maybe for

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.630 
people have been talking about maybe for
a<00:03:08.560> sonogram<00:03:09.330> or<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:11.500> know<00:03:11.590> just<00:03:11.620> listen<00:03:12.460> to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
a sonogram or you know just listen to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:25.360 
a sonogram or you know just listen to
heart<00:03:14.610> taking<00:03:15.610> your<00:03:15.790> heart<00:03:15.940> rate

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.370 

just<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.360> accelerometer<00:03:27.020> mode<00:03:27.200> because

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
just like the accelerometer mode because

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.260 
just like the accelerometer mode because
it<00:03:27.470> makes<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.770> sound<00:03:27.920> electronic<00:03:28.370> okay<00:03:29.090> yeah

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
it makes it sound electronic okay yeah

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.360 
it makes it sound electronic okay yeah
he's<00:03:29.510> talking<00:03:29.660> about<00:03:30.080> one<00:03:30.349> of<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.650> modes

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
he's talking about one of the modes

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.680 
he's talking about one of the modes
there<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:33.760> accelerometer<00:03:34.760> here<00:03:35.510> where's

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
there the the accelerometer here where's

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.510 
there the the accelerometer here where's
where's<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.260> microphone<00:03:36.650> on<00:03:36.680> here<00:03:38.860> okay<00:03:39.860> see

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
where's the microphone on here okay see

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.479 
where's the microphone on here okay see
if<00:03:40.580> they<00:03:40.700> can<00:03:40.819> hear<00:03:41.000> it

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
if they can hear it

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.550 
if they can hear it
so<00:03:43.489> it's<00:03:43.640> interpreting<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.239> sound<00:03:44.530> or<00:03:45.530> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
so it's interpreting the sound or the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.870 
so it's interpreting the sound or the
accelerometer<00:03:48.040> well<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.250> would<00:03:49.430> be<00:03:49.459> my<00:03:49.670> heart

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
accelerometer well it would be my heart

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.940 
accelerometer well it would be my heart
if<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.180> was<00:03:50.269> holding<00:03:50.569> it<00:03:50.660> up<00:03:50.780> there<00:03:50.950> sorry

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
if I was holding it up there sorry

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.350 
if I was holding it up there sorry
there's<00:03:52.130> not<00:03:52.250> much<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.550> hear<00:03:52.819> right<00:03:53.000> now<00:03:53.030> I'm

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
there's not much to hear right now I'm

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.050 
there's not much to hear right now I'm
RC<00:03:53.660> but<00:03:55.599> she'd<00:03:56.599> be<00:03:56.750> able<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:56.959> hear<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:58.060> think

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
RC but she'd be able to hear it I think

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.940 
RC but she'd be able to hear it I think
that<00:03:59.150> was<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.360> microphone<00:03:59.780> yeah<00:04:01.239> I<00:04:02.950> don't

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
that was the microphone yeah I don't

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.150 
that was the microphone yeah I don't
know<00:04:04.069> usability<00:04:04.760> wise<00:04:04.940> it's<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.360> little<00:04:06.160> we

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
know usability wise it's a little we

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.830 
know usability wise it's a little we
found<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.790> be<00:04:07.819> a<00:04:07.940> little<00:04:08.269> bit<00:04:08.420> buggy

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
found it to be a little bit buggy

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.380 
found it to be a little bit buggy
especially<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.040> keyboard<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.880> sending<00:04:11.330> it

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
especially the keyboard and sending it

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.270 
especially the keyboard and sending it
first<00:04:11.630> thoughts<00:04:11.810> not<00:04:11.989> very<00:04:12.260> easy<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.650> read<00:04:12.980> and

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
first thoughts not very easy to read and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.090 
first thoughts not very easy to read and
it<00:04:14.000> was<00:04:14.180> hard<00:04:14.390> for<00:04:14.420> me<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.810> see<00:04:15.019> how<00:04:15.349> accurate

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
it was hard for me to see how accurate

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.039 
it was hard for me to see how accurate
it<00:04:16.280> was<00:04:16.459> but<00:04:17.090> yeah<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:17.329> couldn't<00:04:17.750> tell<00:04:17.870> when

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
it was but yeah you couldn't tell when

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.159 
it was but yeah you couldn't tell when
it<00:04:18.169> start<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.769> stop<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:20.510> wasn't<00:04:21.019> usable

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
it start and stop and it wasn't usable

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.900 
it start and stop and it wasn't usable
in<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:21.560> capacity<00:04:21.739> it<00:04:22.280> wasn't<00:04:22.580> really

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
in that capacity it wasn't really

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.250 
in that capacity it wasn't really
intuitive<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.840> would<00:04:23.960> press<00:04:24.229> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
intuitive that you would press the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.469 
intuitive that you would press the
stethoscope<00:04:24.950> to<00:04:25.100> keep<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.310> read<00:04:25.490> out<00:04:25.639> the

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
stethoscope to keep the read out the

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.960 
stethoscope to keep the read out the
mail<00:04:26.750> icons<00:04:27.260> are<00:04:27.440> all<00:04:27.500> rather<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.370> icons<00:04:28.790> are

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
mail icons are all rather the icons are

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.469 
mail icons are all rather the icons are
hidden

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
hidden

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.850 
hidden
I<00:04:29.510> mean<00:04:29.750> features<00:04:30.110> are<00:04:30.229> hidden<00:04:30.470> it's<00:04:30.650> there

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
I mean features are hidden it's there

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.790 
I mean features are hidden it's there
but<00:04:31.160> it's<00:04:31.430> not<00:04:31.610> very<00:04:31.910> usable<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.690> see<00:04:33.680> the

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
but it's not very usable I see the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.040 
but it's not very usable I see the
potential<00:04:34.160> for<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.300> want<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.690> commend

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
potential for and so I want to commend

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.529 
potential for and so I want to commend
Peter<00:04:36.740> Bentley<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.340> his<00:04:37.490> students<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:38.060> to

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
Peter Bentley and his students and to

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.480 
Peter Bentley and his students and to
keep<00:04:38.690> working<00:04:39.080> on<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.200> improve<00:04:39.650> that<00:04:39.919> app<00:04:40.160> and

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
keep working on it improve that app and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.000 
keep working on it improve that app and
it<00:04:40.910> could<00:04:41.300> really<00:04:41.600> be<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:41.960> quite<00:04:42.410> usable<00:04:42.890> cuz

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
it could really be a quite usable cuz
