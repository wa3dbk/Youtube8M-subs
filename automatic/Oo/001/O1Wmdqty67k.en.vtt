00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
welcome to part 2 of my tutorial on how

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.829 
welcome to part 2 of my tutorial on how
to<00:00:02.580> make<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.210> car<00:00:03.750> crash<00:00:04.020> in<00:00:04.290> 3dsmax<00:00:05.660> and<00:00:06.660> this

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
to make a car crash in 3dsmax and this

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.169 
to make a car crash in 3dsmax and this
part<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.290> trail<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:08.040> are<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.670> tackle

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
part of the trail we are going to tackle

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.580 
part of the trail we are going to tackle
the<00:00:09.740> crumpling<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.519> metal<00:00:12.349> and<00:00:13.349> as<00:00:13.469> you

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the crumpling of the metal and as you

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.530 
the crumpling of the metal and as you
can<00:00:13.710> see<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.340> fold<00:00:14.549> along<00:00:14.700> from<00:00:15.089> last

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
can see if you fold along from last

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.160 
can see if you fold along from last
tutorial<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:17.480> got<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.720> car<00:00:18.930> going

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
tutorial that we have got the car going

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.470 
tutorial that we have got the car going
into<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> metal<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.490> nothing<00:00:20.970> happens<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
into the metal but nothing happens to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.060 
into the metal but nothing happens to
the<00:00:21.779> car<00:00:21.960> apart<00:00:22.199> from<00:00:22.350> all<00:00:22.470> these<00:00:22.619> bits<00:00:22.800> fly

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
the car apart from all these bits fly

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.089 
the car apart from all these bits fly
off<00:00:24.170> it's<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.890> want<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:27.060> yet<00:00:28.099> very

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
off it's what we want just yet very

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
off it's what we want just yet very
about<00:00:29.279> frame<00:00:29.640> zero<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:32.930> tackle<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.260> so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
about frame zero we can tackle this so

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.700 
about frame zero we can tackle this so
basically<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.430> need<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> two<00:00:36.680> copies<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
basically what we need is two copies of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.049 
basically what we need is two copies of
the<00:00:38.309> metal<00:00:39.379> which<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.710> red<00:00:40.890> section<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the metal which is the red section of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.660 
the metal which is the red section of
the<00:00:42.180> car<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.710> copy<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the car here so if we just copy it

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
the car here so if we just copy it
across<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:46.520> right<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.989> make<00:00:49.320> sure

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
across like this right so then make sure

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.110 
across like this right so then make sure
it's<00:00:49.469> copy<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.129> mean<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.399> call<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> one

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it's copy I mean you just call this one

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's copy I mean you just call this one
crashed<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.410> rename<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.949> one

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
crashed and if you just rename this one

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.939 
crashed and if you just rename this one
here<00:00:56.670> endear<00:00:56.969> modify<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.960> call<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:59.329> or

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
here endear modify and call this one or

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.960 
here endear modify and call this one or
rich<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.309> all<00:01:03.979> basically<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.250> need<00:01:05.400> two

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
rich and all basically we need two

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.190 
rich and all basically we need two
copies<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:08.040> well<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.640> need<00:01:08.970> two<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.510> them

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
copies of this well we need two of them

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.920 
copies of this well we need two of them
so<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> Concord

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so that one can be the Concord

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
so that one can be the Concord
one<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.770> original<00:01:16.979> one

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
one and one can be just the original one

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.289 
one and one can be just the original one
and<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.180> complan<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:19.020> used<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
and the complan will be used with the

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.570 
and the complan will be used with the
Morpher<00:01:21.299> modifier<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.500> create<00:01:22.920> which<00:01:23.400> will

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
Morpher modifier to create which will

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880 
Morpher modifier to create which will
allow<00:01:23.700> us<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> animate<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.020> basically<00:01:25.290> what

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
allow us to animate it so basically what

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
allow us to animate it so basically what
we<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:28.909> um<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.360> technically<00:01:30.780> at

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
we want to do is um so technically at

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.319 
we want to do is um so technically at
the<00:01:30.990> moment<00:01:31.079> both<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.700> linked<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the moment both of these are linked to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
the moment both of these are linked to
the<00:01:33.479> box<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.799> drives<00:01:35.040> along

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the box so as you see as it drives along

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
the box so as you see as it drives along
they<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.640> both<00:01:35.820> linked<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.780> what<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:36.990> want<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
they are both linked so what we want to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
they are both linked so what we want to
do<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.500> unlink<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> original<00:01:38.700> ones<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.060> now

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
do is unlink the original ones for now

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.899 
do is unlink the original ones for now
because<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> fact<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.520> want<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> be

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
because of the fact that we want to be

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.120 
because of the fact that we want to be
working<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.299> crashed<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> moment

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
working the crashed one at the moment

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
working the crashed one at the moment
just<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> shape<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.899> now

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
just so we can get a shape of it so now

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.469 
just so we can get a shape of it so now
if<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.229> align<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.850> crashed<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.360> which

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
if we just align the crashed one which

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.200 
if we just align the crashed one which
is<00:01:48.600> still<00:01:48.840> linked<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> box<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
is still linked to the box to the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.130 
is still linked to the box to the
original<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.750> puts<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> back

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
original one so that just puts it back

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.539 
original one so that just puts it back
in<00:01:52.320> position<00:01:54.680> but<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.799> one's<00:01:56.009> original<00:01:56.219> one

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
in position but this one's original one

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.920 
in position but this one's original one
still<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.270> one's<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> crash<00:01:57.750> one

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
still and this one's to crash one

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.260 
still and this one's to crash one
remember<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.729> so<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.850> got<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> talk<00:02:00.240> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
remember that and so we got to talk to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.600 
remember that and so we got to talk to
you<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.750> literally<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.520> over

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you and literally if you just go over

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.139 
you and literally if you just go over
here<00:02:03.469> turn<00:02:04.469> off<00:02:04.560> grid<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.969> move

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
here turn off grid for now we can move

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.800 
here turn off grid for now we can move
forwards<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.899> where<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.789> into<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.819> cylinder

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
forwards to where it's into the cylinder

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.040 
forwards to where it's into the cylinder
or<00:02:09.989> where<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.379> crashing<00:02:10.709> into<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> most<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
or where it's crashing into the most and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.150 
or where it's crashing into the most and
basically<00:02:13.050> now<00:02:13.290> we're<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.709> deform

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
basically now we're just going to deform

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.530 
basically now we're just going to deform
it<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:18.030> know<00:02:18.060> make<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.420> look

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
it so that we can you know make it look

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.330 
it so that we can you know make it look
like<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.930> collided<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.920> I'm<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.099> gonna<00:02:20.190> go

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
like it's collided so I'm just gonna go

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.690 
like it's collided so I'm just gonna go
to<00:02:20.489> vertex<00:02:20.670> selection<00:02:21.569> mood<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.650> instead<00:02:23.610> of

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
to vertex selection mood and instead of

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.850 
to vertex selection mood and instead of
going<00:02:23.910> one<00:02:24.330> by<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.930> moving<00:02:25.170> them<00:02:25.500> I'm

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
going one by one and moving them I'm

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.020 
going one by one and moving them I'm
going<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.310> go<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.900> soft<00:02:27.900> selection<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:29.030> use

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
going to go to soft selection and use

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.690 
going to go to soft selection and use
soft<00:02:30.300> selection<00:02:31.220> I'm<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.550> start

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
soft selection I'm just going to start

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.830 
soft selection I'm just going to start
off<00:02:32.849> by<00:02:32.879> just<00:02:33.510> grabbing<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.040> just

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
off by just grabbing this and just

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.059 
off by just grabbing this and just
pushing<00:02:36.840> ah<00:02:39.080> we<00:02:40.080> done<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> bit<00:02:40.410> better<00:02:40.440> section

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
pushing ah we done a bit better section

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.699 
pushing ah we done a bit better section
so<00:02:41.190> I'm<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.519> push<00:02:41.700> stop<00:02:42.060> pushing

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
so I'm just going to push stop pushing

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.710 
so I'm just going to push stop pushing
these<00:02:43.709> around<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:46.970> kind<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.030> wrap<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.420> round

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
these around to kind of wrap it round

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.770 
these around to kind of wrap it round
the<00:02:48.989> pole<00:02:53.150> right<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.180> once<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.540> kind<00:02:57.750> of

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the pole right so so once you kind of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.440 
the pole right so so once you kind of
got<00:02:57.959> where<00:02:58.379> are<00:02:58.500> we<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:59.250> we<00:02:59.400> hit<00:02:59.489> Z<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.819> zoom<00:03:00.300> to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
got where are we if we hit Z a zoom to

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.399 
got where are we if we hit Z a zoom to
wherever<00:03:00.629> we<00:03:00.900> are<00:03:01.019> so<00:03:02.930> yeah<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.140> kinda<00:03:04.319> got

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
wherever we are so yeah so you kinda got

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.990 
wherever we are so yeah so you kinda got
the<00:03:04.500> crash<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.519> you're<00:03:05.670> kind<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.849> going

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the crash and if you're kind of going

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.960 
the crash and if you're kind of going
you<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.420> kind<00:03:06.659> of<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:06.900> push<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.409> pull

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
you can kind of just push and pull

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.979 
you can kind of just push and pull
different<00:03:08.970> thoughts<00:03:09.360> um<00:03:09.450> cuz<00:03:09.569> we've<00:03:09.659> got<00:03:09.780> soft

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
different thoughts um cuz we've got soft

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.630 
different thoughts um cuz we've got soft
selection<00:03:10.230> on<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.709> kind<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.980> makes<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.340> rough

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
selection on it kind of makes a rough

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.390 
selection on it kind of makes a rough
selection<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:13.530> ones<00:03:13.709> around<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.370> we

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
selection of the ones around it so we

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.399 
selection of the ones around it so we
can<00:03:14.670> kind<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.180> move<00:03:15.750> them<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.170> we're

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
can kind of just move them and we're

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.880 
can kind of just move them and we're
just<00:03:16.560> trying<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.769> juggle<00:03:16.920> up<00:03:17.480> kind<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.599> on<00:03:18.890> even

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
just trying to juggle up kind of on even

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.460 
just trying to juggle up kind of on even
the<00:03:20.010> surface<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:22.099> here<00:03:23.099> we<00:03:23.190> go<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:24.200> just<00:03:25.200> move

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
the surface so here we go you just move

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.800 
the surface so here we go you just move
this<00:03:25.739> all<00:03:25.980> along<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.510> now<00:03:27.510> if<00:03:27.569> we<00:03:27.659> come

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
this all along like that now if we come

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.570 
this all along like that now if we come
out<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:28.140> vertex<00:03:28.650> mode<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.129> kind<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.430> get

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
out of vertex mode you can kind of get

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.729 
out of vertex mode you can kind of get
an<00:03:29.640> idea<00:03:29.670> what<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:30.120> just<00:03:30.150> done<00:03:30.510> we've<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:33.239> know

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
an idea what we just done we've you know

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.080 
an idea what we just done we've you know
crumpled<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.950> car<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.799> obviously<00:03:38.010> do<00:03:38.220> a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
crumpled the car you can obviously do a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.130 
crumpled the car you can obviously do a
lot<00:03:39.690> more<00:03:39.720> damage<00:03:39.959> than<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.870> but<00:03:42.870> for

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
lot more damage than just this but for

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.850 
lot more damage than just this but for
the<00:03:43.260> sitter<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.590> think<00:03:43.860> this<00:03:43.950> would<00:03:44.129> do

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
the sitter I think this would do

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.990 
the sitter I think this would do
technically<00:03:46.860> what<00:03:47.040> we've<00:03:47.190> got<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.790> car

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
technically what we've got is the car

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.550 
technically what we've got is the car
we've<00:03:48.299> got<00:03:48.450> what<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:49.319> after<00:03:49.760> we<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.879> the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
we've got what the after we have the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.500 
we've got what the after we have the
result<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.830> collision<00:03:53.099> done<00:03:53.790> now<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.090> you

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
result of the collision done now so you

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.000 
result of the collision done now so you
can<00:03:54.780> see<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.260> cars<00:03:55.470> now<00:03:55.849> dented<00:03:56.849> but<00:03:58.010> we

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
can see that the cars now dented but we

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.220 
can see that the cars now dented but we
don't<00:03:59.189> want<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.370> dented<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.730> whole<00:03:59.939> time

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
don't want it dented the whole time

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.710 
don't want it dented the whole time
that's<00:04:01.230> what<00:04:01.439> we<00:04:01.530> want<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.799> do<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.569> okay<00:04:03.569> right

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
that's what we want to do is okay right

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.559 
that's what we want to do is okay right
so<00:04:03.750> we've<00:04:03.959> got<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.260> original<00:04:04.799> one<00:04:04.920> here<00:04:05.220> and

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
so we've got the original one here and

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.399 
so we've got the original one here and
we<00:04:06.569> also<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:09.420> crashed<00:04:09.689> one<00:04:09.900> so

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
we also have the crashed one so

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.020 
we also have the crashed one so
technically<00:04:10.799> we<00:04:11.010> don't<00:04:11.340> want<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.760> crashed

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
technically we don't want the crashed

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.289 
technically we don't want the crashed
one<00:04:12.269> linked<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:14.310> Box<00:04:14.549> anymore<00:04:14.790> which<00:04:15.269> is

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
one linked to the Box anymore which is

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.840 
one linked to the Box anymore which is
hidden<00:04:15.840> remember<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:17.130> we're<00:04:17.549> just<00:04:17.579> going<00:04:17.759> to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
hidden remember so we're just going to

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.110 
hidden remember so we're just going to
want<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.060> unlink<00:04:18.570> selection<00:04:19.820> so<00:04:20.820> now<00:04:20.940> at<00:04:21.030> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
want to unlink selection so now at the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.629 
want to unlink selection so now at the
moment<00:04:21.269> we<00:04:22.169> don't<00:04:22.290> have<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:23.070> crashed<00:04:23.400> one

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
moment we don't have the crashed one

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.390 
moment we don't have the crashed one
which<00:04:23.790> means<00:04:24.030> we<00:04:24.150> can<00:04:24.270> just<00:04:24.419> move<00:04:24.540> out<00:04:24.750> now

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
which means we can just move out now

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.150 
which means we can just move out now
all<00:04:25.759> and<00:04:26.630> we<00:04:26.780> don't<00:04:26.900> also<00:04:27.259> have<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.770> original

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
all and we don't also have the original

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.010 
all and we don't also have the original
one<00:04:28.190> it<00:04:28.460> connected<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.120> if<00:04:29.270> we<00:04:29.389> just<00:04:29.509> unhide

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
one it connected so if we just unhide

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.860 
one it connected so if we just unhide
all<00:04:30.880> which<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.030> now<00:04:32.150> shown<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.479> box<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.780> we

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
all which is now shown in the box and we

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.620 
all which is now shown in the box and we
can<00:04:32.990> just<00:04:33.169> i<00:04:33.440> select<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.430> original<00:04:34.729> metal<00:04:35.330> and

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
can just i select the original metal and

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.439 
can just i select the original metal and
just<00:04:36.320> link<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.620> back<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.759> now<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.090> then<00:04:38.240> just

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
just link it back so now and then just

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.270 
just link it back so now and then just
hide<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.750> box<00:04:38.930> again<00:04:39.229> so<00:04:39.710> now<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:39.889> can<00:04:40.070> see

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
hide the box again so now you can see

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.600 
hide the box again so now you can see
that<00:04:40.490> we<00:04:40.639> actually<00:04:40.850> do<00:04:41.360> have<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:43.039> normal<00:04:43.370> car

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
that we actually do have the normal car

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.659 
that we actually do have the normal car
there<00:04:43.910> however<00:04:44.509> when<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:44.990> crashes<00:04:45.669> we

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
there however when it crashes we

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:47.999 
there however when it crashes we
technically<00:04:47.180> have<00:04:47.270> what<00:04:47.570> we<00:04:47.660> had<00:04:47.810> before

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
technically have what we had before

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.920 
technically have what we had before
nothing<00:04:49.009> happens<00:04:49.400> but<00:04:50.120> we<00:04:50.270> but<00:04:50.479> what<00:04:50.630> we<00:04:50.780> do

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
nothing happens but we but what we do

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.490 
nothing happens but we but what we do
have<00:04:50.960> now<00:04:51.350> is<00:04:51.590> we<00:04:51.770> have<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.840> crashed<00:04:54.169> mesh

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
have now is we have the the crashed mesh

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.020 
have now is we have the the crashed mesh
here<00:04:55.190> so<00:04:56.030> if<00:04:56.180> we<00:04:56.330> go<00:04:56.479> into<00:04:57.340> if<00:04:58.340> we<00:04:58.400> set<00:04:58.699> this<00:04:58.820> one

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
here so if we go into if we set this one

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.790 
here so if we go into if we set this one
well<00:05:00.940> control<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.210> mean<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.780> do<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:02.990> so

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
well control that I mean to do that so

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.620 
well control that I mean to do that so
if<00:05:03.889> we<00:05:04.010> go<00:05:04.130> into<00:05:04.280> this<00:05:04.460> one<00:05:04.639> here<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.030> we<00:05:05.419> go<00:05:05.570> to

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
if we go into this one here and we go to

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.260 
if we go into this one here and we go to
modifier<00:05:06.440> list<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:07.340> they<00:05:07.430> add<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.610> Morpher

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
modifier list and they add a Morpher

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.070 
modifier list and they add a Morpher
modifier<00:05:09.490> in<00:05:11.350> we<00:05:12.350> can<00:05:12.500> literally<00:05:12.740> just<00:05:12.889> go<00:05:13.070> to

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
modifier in we can literally just go to

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.969 
modifier in we can literally just go to
furniture<00:05:15.080> on<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:15.289> first<00:05:15.500> slot<00:05:15.680> and<00:05:15.860> just

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
furniture on the first slot and just

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.710 
furniture on the first slot and just
pick<00:05:16.190> object<00:05:16.580> from<00:05:16.669> scene<00:05:16.940> you<00:05:17.270> can<00:05:17.389> pick<00:05:17.570> it

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
pick object from scene you can pick it

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.900 
pick object from scene you can pick it
and<00:05:18.349> as<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:18.620> see<00:05:18.770> as<00:05:18.949> you<00:05:19.039> bring<00:05:19.460> this<00:05:19.550> level

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
and as you see as you bring this level

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.170 
and as you see as you bring this level
up<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.870> dents<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.620> car<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:22.610> now<00:05:22.880> we<00:05:22.940> have

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
up it dents the car so now we have

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.839 
up it dents the car so now we have
control<00:05:23.599> of<00:05:23.660> how<00:05:23.900> much<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:25.039> dentin<00:05:25.430> comes

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
control of how much of the dentin comes

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.300 
control of how much of the dentin comes
through<00:05:26.240> which<00:05:27.080> is<00:05:27.320> usefulness<00:05:28.039> how<00:05:28.160> we're

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
through which is usefulness how we're

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.360 
through which is usefulness how we're
gonna<00:05:28.370> animate<00:05:28.639> that<00:05:29.090> the<00:05:29.419> crash<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:31.010> if<00:05:31.039> we<00:05:31.250> go

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
gonna animate that the crash so if we go

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.290 
gonna animate that the crash so if we go
to<00:05:32.800> in<00:05:33.800> fact<00:05:34.099> we<00:05:34.310> can<00:05:34.430> actually<00:05:34.550> just<00:05:34.820> hide<00:05:35.090> the

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
to in fact we can actually just hide the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.490 
to in fact we can actually just hide the
crash<00:05:35.510> layer<00:05:35.720> now<00:05:35.870> we<00:05:35.900> don't<00:05:36.050> actually<00:05:36.289> need

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
crash layer now we don't actually need

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.060 
crash layer now we don't actually need
it<00:05:36.620> anymore

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
it anymore

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.640 
it anymore
so<00:05:37.669> if<00:05:37.789> we<00:05:37.910> come<00:05:38.090> along<00:05:38.360> now<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:39.820> we<00:05:41.590> go<00:05:42.590> to

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
so if we come along now and we go to

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.200 
so if we come along now and we go to
where<00:05:42.979> we<00:05:43.099> want<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.310> crash<00:05:43.520> well<00:05:43.970> what<00:05:44.120> we

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
where we want the crash well what we

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.990 
where we want the crash well what we
wanted<00:05:44.419> to<00:05:44.510> stop<00:05:44.659> conflict<00:05:45.139> which<00:05:45.409> is<00:05:46.000> their

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
wanted to stop conflict which is their

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.560 
wanted to stop conflict which is their
frame<00:05:47.960> 12<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.710> she<00:05:49.370> started<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.150> frame<00:05:50.389> before

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
frame 12 and she started a frame before

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.960 
frame 12 and she started a frame before
and<00:05:51.020> then<00:05:51.199> it's<00:05:51.349> a<00:05:51.620> bit<00:05:52.039> more<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.250> a<00:05:52.370> better

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
and then it's a bit more of a better

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.460 
and then it's a bit more of a better
animation<00:05:53.449> so<00:05:53.539> if<00:05:53.599> you<00:05:53.659> just<00:05:53.780> do<00:05:53.930> this<00:05:54.050> and<00:05:54.349> we

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
animation so if you just do this and we

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.050 
animation so if you just do this and we
just<00:05:54.500> like<00:05:54.770> quickly<00:05:55.220> just<00:05:55.370> like<00:05:55.430> do<00:05:55.789> that<00:05:55.909> up

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
just like quickly just like do that up

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.820 
just like quickly just like do that up
and<00:05:56.300> down<00:05:56.510> that<00:05:56.810> means<00:05:57.110> it's<00:05:57.289> just<00:05:57.320> sets<00:05:57.650> it's

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
and down that means it's just sets it's

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.800 
and down that means it's just sets it's
a<00:05:57.919> zero<00:05:58.130> the<00:05:58.280> hallway<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.610> on<00:05:58.729> there<00:05:58.940> it<00:05:59.630> just

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
a zero the hallway and on there it just

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.290 
a zero the hallway and on there it just
adds<00:05:59.930> a<00:06:00.050> keyframe<00:06:00.380> and<00:06:00.949> if<00:06:01.159> you<00:06:01.250> go<00:06:01.340> to<00:06:01.400> I'm

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
adds a keyframe and if you go to I'm

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.270 
adds a keyframe and if you go to I'm
just<00:06:02.479> gonna<00:06:02.599> go<00:06:02.720> to<00:06:02.780> that<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.380> frame<00:06:03.620> 13<00:06:04.070> I'm

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
just gonna go to that the frame 13 I'm

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.000 
just gonna go to that the frame 13 I'm
just<00:06:04.430> whipping<00:06:04.550> up<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:05.000> 100<00:06:05.449> so<00:06:06.080> now<00:06:06.229> as<00:06:06.440> it

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
just whipping up to 100 so now as it

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:13.270 
just whipping up to 100 so now as it
crashes<00:06:07.520> into<00:06:08.949> that<00:06:09.949> the<00:06:10.310> pole<00:06:10.639> it<00:06:11.860> dents<00:06:12.860> and

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
crashes into that the pole it dents and

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.279 
crashes into that the pole it dents and
then<00:06:13.729> by<00:06:14.030> the<00:06:14.120> time<00:06:14.300> it's<00:06:14.510> going<00:06:14.659> off<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.110> pole

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
then by the time it's going off the pole

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.620 
then by the time it's going off the pole
it's<00:06:15.620> fully<00:06:15.979> dented<00:06:16.430> and<00:06:16.669> that<00:06:17.000> is<00:06:17.180> the<00:06:17.389> finish

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
it's fully dented and that is the finish

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.550 
it's fully dented and that is the finish
of<00:06:17.720> the<00:06:17.810> animation<00:06:18.550> so<00:06:19.550> that<00:06:19.909> is<00:06:20.210> how<00:06:20.419> you

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
of the animation so that is how you

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.870 
of the animation so that is how you
accomplish<00:06:21.560> that<00:06:21.800> so<00:06:22.250> now<00:06:22.520> if<00:06:22.610> we<00:06:22.669> watch<00:06:22.849> this

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
accomplish that so now if we watch this

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.120 
accomplish that so now if we watch this
free<00:06:23.270> we<00:06:23.419> actually<00:06:23.780> do<00:06:24.020> have<00:06:24.289> the<00:06:24.710> car<00:06:24.919> that

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
free we actually do have the car that

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.439 
free we actually do have the car that
dense<00:06:25.760> as<00:06:26.240> it<00:06:26.539> goes<00:06:26.630> through<00:06:26.840> which<00:06:27.440> is<00:06:28.449> really

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
dense as it goes through which is really

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.459 
dense as it goes through which is really
useful<00:06:29.870> it's<00:06:30.020> not<00:06:30.199> as<00:06:31.900> time<00:06:32.900> consuming<00:06:32.930> as

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:33.469 
useful it's not as time consuming as

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.269 
useful it's not as time consuming as
using<00:06:34.130> the<00:06:34.639> cloth<00:06:34.880> modifier<00:06:35.120> and

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:37.279 
using the cloth modifier and

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:40.299 
using the cloth modifier and
but<00:06:37.849> also<00:06:38.199> it's<00:06:39.199> just<00:06:39.409> it's<00:06:39.679> a<00:06:39.709> different<00:06:39.739> way

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:40.309 
but also it's just it's a different way

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:41.349 
but also it's just it's a different way
about<00:06:40.429> it<00:06:40.789> I<00:06:40.909> guess

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:41.359 
about it I guess

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.329 
about it I guess
I<00:06:41.389> find<00:06:41.869> this<00:06:41.959> effort<00:06:42.529> easier<00:06:42.949> than<00:06:43.099> cloth

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:43.339 
I find this effort easier than cloth

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.119 
I find this effort easier than cloth
because<00:06:43.909> I<00:06:44.329> just<00:06:45.079> find<00:06:45.229> it<00:06:45.349> confusing<00:06:45.469> the

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:46.129 
because I just find it confusing the

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:49.089 
because I just find it confusing the
COFF<00:06:46.309> method<00:06:46.759> and<00:06:47.199> this<00:06:48.199> is<00:06:48.349> just<00:06:48.529> quick<00:06:48.889> and

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
COFF method and this is just quick and

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:54.429 
COFF method and this is just quick and
easy<00:06:49.519> and<00:06:49.849> also<00:06:50.479> you<00:06:50.839> can<00:06:52.689> sorry<00:06:53.779> if<00:06:53.959> you

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:54.439 
easy and also you can sorry if you

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.489 
easy and also you can sorry if you
unhide<00:06:55.129> all<00:06:55.789> again<00:06:56.539> and<00:06:56.809> then<00:06:56.989> just<00:06:57.199> hide<00:06:57.379> this

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:57.499 
unhide all again and then just hide this

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:00.549 
unhide all again and then just hide this
box<00:06:58.839> if<00:06:59.839> you<00:06:59.989> were<00:07:00.079> to<00:07:00.169> make<00:07:00.289> another

00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:00.559 
box if you were to make another

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:04.929 
box if you were to make another
duplicate<00:07:01.189> of<00:07:01.339> this<00:07:02.619> just<00:07:03.619> like<00:07:03.769> that<00:07:03.949> coffee

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:04.939 
duplicate of this just like that coffee

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.549 
duplicate of this just like that coffee
crash<00:07:05.389> day<00:07:05.599> one<00:07:05.779> this<00:07:05.989> is<00:07:06.139> leave<00:07:06.229> it<00:07:06.349> like<00:07:06.469> that

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:06.559 
crash day one this is leave it like that

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.279 
crash day one this is leave it like that
and<00:07:07.279> if<00:07:07.489> we<00:07:07.639> were<00:07:07.789> to<00:07:07.939> go<00:07:08.149> and<00:07:08.539> to<00:07:08.869> make<00:07:09.049> sure<00:07:09.079> or

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.289 
and if we were to go and to make sure or

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.649 
and if we were to go and to make sure or
soft<00:07:09.529> selections<00:07:10.009> that's<00:07:10.459> again<00:07:10.759> and<00:07:10.999> the

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:11.659 
soft selections that's again and the

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:15.239 
soft selections that's again and the
dent<00:07:11.899> up<00:07:12.019> the<00:07:12.199> reef<00:07:12.519> like<00:07:13.519> this<00:07:13.849> would<00:07:14.089> we<00:07:14.149> just

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:15.249 
dent up the reef like this would we just

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:17.919 
dent up the reef like this would we just
take<00:07:16.249> some<00:07:16.459> of<00:07:16.549> the<00:07:16.610> reef<00:07:16.759> selection<00:07:17.299> and<00:07:17.569> just

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:17.929 
take some of the reef selection and just

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:19.689 
take some of the reef selection and just
like<00:07:18.110> push<00:07:18.619> it<00:07:18.799> down<00:07:18.949> so<00:07:19.219> as<00:07:19.309> if<00:07:19.429> it's<00:07:19.579> like

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:19.699 
like push it down so as if it's like

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.139 
like push it down so as if it's like
been<00:07:19.879> dented<00:07:20.329> the<00:07:20.449> roof<00:07:21.519> so<00:07:22.519> say<00:07:22.669> if<00:07:22.789> like<00:07:22.969> it's

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:23.149 
been dented the roof so say if like it's

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:25.149 
been dented the roof so say if like it's
crash<00:07:23.449> -<00:07:23.629> then<00:07:23.779> like<00:07:23.959> a<00:07:23.989> brick<00:07:24.439> falls<00:07:24.709> onto<00:07:24.919> its

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:25.159 
crash - then like a brick falls onto its

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:27.339 
crash - then like a brick falls onto its
roof<00:07:25.399> it'd<00:07:25.849> be<00:07:25.969> really<00:07:26.119> unlucky<00:07:26.479> but<00:07:27.110> say<00:07:27.259> if

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:27.349 
roof it'd be really unlucky but say if

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:28.539 
roof it'd be really unlucky but say if
that<00:07:27.469> happened<00:07:27.799> you're<00:07:27.919> going<00:07:28.039> to<00:07:28.129> empty<00:07:28.309> stop

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:28.549 
that happened you're going to empty stop

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:32.249 
that happened you're going to empty stop
to<00:07:29.079> pick<00:07:30.079> object<00:07:30.469> from<00:07:30.619> scene<00:07:30.860> select<00:07:31.789> it

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:32.259 
to pick object from scene select it

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:35.049 
to pick object from scene select it
which<00:07:33.259> is<00:07:33.439> over<00:07:33.829> crashed<00:07:34.129> one<00:07:34.369> and<00:07:34.819> then

00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:35.059 
which is over crashed one and then

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:36.939 
which is over crashed one and then
literally<00:07:35.299> you<00:07:35.389> animate<00:07:36.079> it<00:07:36.289> however<00:07:36.619> you<00:07:36.769> ant

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:36.949 
literally you animate it however you ant

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:38.979 
literally you animate it however you ant
like<00:07:37.219> your<00:07:37.369> anime<00:07:37.609> to<00:07:37.699> the<00:07:37.789> first<00:07:38.029> one<00:07:38.209> so<00:07:38.779> now

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:38.989 
like your anime to the first one so now

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:42.369 
like your anime to the first one so now
we've<00:07:39.109> got<00:07:39.229> two<00:07:39.439> crashes<00:07:39.829> seeing<00:07:41.199> so<00:07:42.199> that's

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:42.379 
we've got two crashes seeing so that's

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.709 
we've got two crashes seeing so that's
how<00:07:42.499> I<00:07:42.529> would<00:07:42.669> create<00:07:43.669> it<00:07:43.819> so<00:07:43.969> you<00:07:44.269> can<00:07:44.389> keep<00:07:44.539> on

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:44.719 
how I would create it so you can keep on

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:46.689 
how I would create it so you can keep on
adding<00:07:44.959> more<00:07:45.289> and<00:07:45.439> more<00:07:45.529> different<00:07:45.860> crashed

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:46.699 
adding more and more different crashed

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.559 
adding more and more different crashed
objects<00:07:47.299> -<00:07:48.579> for<00:07:49.579> every<00:07:49.759> time<00:07:49.939> the<00:07:50.360> car

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:50.569 
objects - for every time the car

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:51.789 
objects - for every time the car
collides<00:07:50.959> with<00:07:51.079> someone<00:07:51.349> else

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:51.799 
collides with someone else

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:55.239 
collides with someone else
which<00:07:52.429> is<00:07:52.669> really<00:07:53.599> useful<00:07:53.869> so<00:07:54.409> savor<00:07:54.649> a<00:07:54.979> big

00:07:55.239 --> 00:07:55.249 
which is really useful so savor a big

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:56.649 
which is really useful so savor a big
bold<00:07:55.459> of<00:07:55.669> us<00:07:55.759> to<00:07:55.849> fall<00:07:56.029> in<00:07:56.089> the<00:07:56.179> roof<00:07:56.329> you<00:07:56.479> can

00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:56.659 
bold of us to fall in the roof you can

00:07:56.659 --> 00:08:00.369 
bold of us to fall in the roof you can
just<00:07:56.869> crash<00:07:57.110> it<00:07:57.369> some<00:07:58.369> more<00:07:58.929> but<00:07:59.929> yeah

00:08:00.369 --> 00:08:00.379 
just crash it some more but yeah

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:04.379 
just crash it some more but yeah
so<00:08:00.799> that's<00:08:00.979> how<00:08:01.219> I<00:08:02.209> would<00:08:03.169> deform<00:08:03.709> the<00:08:03.860> car<00:08:04.039> in

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:04.389 
so that's how I would deform the car in

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:06.879 
so that's how I would deform the car in
the<00:08:05.389> next<00:08:05.989> tour<00:08:06.199> I'm<00:08:06.289> gonna<00:08:06.409> go<00:08:06.529> through<00:08:06.709> on

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:06.889 
the next tour I'm gonna go through on

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:10.529 
the next tour I'm gonna go through on
how<00:08:07.039> to<00:08:07.099> smash<00:08:07.759> the<00:08:08.539> windshield<00:08:08.929> on<00:08:09.469> the<00:08:09.949> front
