 spanish manuel vasquez hand tal bento was able to describe the nautical 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.140
 He arrived in Barcelona at his peak. 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.690
 a period when words could barely keep up with the speed of the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.720
 the fans will sum up everything in a single word. 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.790

 only it had to be this apparent 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.920
 October 12, 1996 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 in that day 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.250
 ronaldo made the most beautiful 446 goals scored 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.570
 the game without much importance a predictable rout on the compostela 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.230
 turned into a show 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.330
 the brightness of history 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.190
 to see ronaldo left the midfield to dismantle alone the opposing team 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 nor the fat fake coach believed 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.060
 like every great work of art ronaldo's painting is also in the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 museum 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.729

 the fan can review as many times as he wants 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.540
 the collection on the ronaldo is consecrating it seems until he spent his life 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.020
 whole club 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.549
 holiday season 96 97

 it was difficult to go to the stadium then governor ronaldo 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 were 51 games 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.040

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.319
 that the fans bet on kleber 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.849

 the conflict began in the carnival of 97 when the phenomenon escaped to celebrate 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.929

 a few months later it was Copa America time the club wanted him to stay 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.969
 but ronaldo was faithful to the national team and won titles 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.400
 without him Barcelona lost a game and the championship 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.289

 say that ronaldo left Barcelona without saying goodbye 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.869
 but for who the god behind this crowd
