last<00:00:00.299> topic<00:00:00.719> and<00:00:01.050> then<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.680> done<00:00:01.860> but<00:00:02.340> this

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
last topic and then we're done but this

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.130 
last topic and then we're done but this
is<00:00:02.700> really<00:00:03.120> important<00:00:03.570> topic<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:04.020> would

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
is really important topic you would

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.579 
is really important topic you would
enjoy<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.740> topic<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.279> let's<00:00:05.460> see<00:00:06.350> the<00:00:07.350> last

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
enjoy this topic so let's see the last

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.759 
enjoy this topic so let's see the last
topic<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:09.019> how<00:00:10.019> does<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.099> macrophage<00:00:12.500> sit<00:00:13.500> in

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
topic is how does a macrophage sit in

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.240 
topic is how does a macrophage sit in
the<00:00:14.280> tissue<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.880> how<00:00:15.839> does<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.350> become<00:00:16.529> active

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the tissue and how does it become active

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.150 
the tissue and how does it become active
and<00:00:17.490> detaches<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> tissue<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.680> very

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and detaches on the tissue so very very

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.880 
and detaches on the tissue so very very
interesting<00:00:20.359> phenomena<00:00:21.359> very<00:00:22.080> important

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
interesting phenomena very important

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.370 
interesting phenomena very important
phenomena<00:00:23.460> let's<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.240> how<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.510> works

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.740 

and<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> last<00:00:32.700> topic<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.300> well<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and that is a last topic as well so you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.510 
and that is a last topic as well so you
should<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:34.110> happy<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> lecture<00:00:35.399> is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
should be happy that here the lecture is

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.660 
should be happy that here the lecture is
finishing<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.649> am<00:00:37.649> happy<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
finishing I am happy so here it is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.000 
finishing I am happy so here it is
macrophages<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.379> funny<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.829> let's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
macrophages this is just funny so let's

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:59.660 
macrophages this is just funny so let's
say<00:00:45.980> these<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.039> some<00:00:47.250> cells<00:00:58.190> these<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.250> cells

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
say these are some cells these are cells

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.510 
say these are some cells these are cells
some<00:01:00.359> cell<00:01:00.629> connective<00:01:01.199> tissue<00:01:01.520> endothelium

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
some cell connective tissue endothelium

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.399 
some cell connective tissue endothelium
some<00:01:02.789> cells<00:01:03.860> there<00:01:04.860> comes<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.580> macrophage<00:01:06.409> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
some cells there comes a macrophage that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.950 
some cells there comes a macrophage that
big<00:01:07.710> dude<00:01:08.299> that<00:01:09.299> comes<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:10.640> sits<00:01:11.640> down<00:01:11.960> onto

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
big dude that comes here sits down onto

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.880 
big dude that comes here sits down onto
the<00:01:13.110> cells<00:01:14.479> now<00:01:15.479> keep<00:01:15.750> keep<00:01:16.229> an<00:01:16.409> eye<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.560> this

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the cells now keep keep an eye on this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.499 
the cells now keep keep an eye on this
discussion<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:18.060> important

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
discussion this is a very important

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.960 
discussion this is a very important
discussion<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.759> read

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
discussion I have to really go and read

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.630 
discussion I have to really go and read
a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.689> books<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> lot<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.590> areas<00:01:22.979> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
a lot of books and lot of areas to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
a lot of books and lot of areas to
collect<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.299> material<00:01:24.540> from<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.439> have

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
collect this material from you I have

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.010 
collect this material from you I have
not<00:01:25.799> produced<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.460> material<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.810> not

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
not produced this material so it is not

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.679 
not produced this material so it is not
mine<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> figure<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> out<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
mine but I do go and figure it out and

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.510 
mine but I do go and figure it out and
bring<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.229> make<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.439> try<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.310> easy

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
bring it and make it try to make it easy

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.080 
bring it and make it try to make it easy
for<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
for you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.910 
for you
so<00:01:33.570> check<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.860> macrophages<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:36.920> when

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so check this out macrophages here when

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.690 
so check this out macrophages here when
the<00:01:38.040> macrophage<00:01:38.759> appears<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.110> tissue<00:01:40.740> what

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the macrophage appears on a tissue what

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.859 
the macrophage appears on a tissue what
it<00:01:41.880> does<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.810> throws<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.920> integrins

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
it does is it throws out integrins

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.690 
it does is it throws out integrins
remember<00:01:45.869> integrins<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:46.710> those<00:01:46.950> Dai<00:01:47.310> Matic

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
remember integrins are those Dai Matic

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
remember integrins are those Dai Matic
proteins<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:48.990> present<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
proteins they are present on the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.950 
proteins they are present on the
endothelial<00:01:50.460> surface<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.090> well<00:01:51.299> for

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.520 
neutrophil and monocyte adherence to the
endothelium<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.840> rolling<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
endothelium for the rolling and and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.730 
endothelium for the rolling and and
slowing<00:01:59.310> down<00:01:59.490> same<00:02:00.450> integrins<00:02:01.049> are<00:02:01.079> here

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
slowing down same integrins are here

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.450 
slowing down same integrins are here
these<00:02:02.490> integrins<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.390> used<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.590> attached<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
these integrins are used to attached to

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.449 
these integrins are used to attached to
thee<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> tissue<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.220> how<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
thee to the tissue that is how the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.960 
thee to the tissue that is how the
macrophages<00:02:09.060> become<00:02:09.890> resident<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.790> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
macrophages become resident they go and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
macrophages become resident they go and
land<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> tissue<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
land on the tissue and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.699 
land on the tissue and
abbit<00:02:13.980> how<00:02:14.939> do<00:02:15.000> they<00:02:15.329> grab<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.870> tissue<00:02:16.049> they

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
abbit how do they grab the tissue they

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.729 
abbit how do they grab the tissue they
grab<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.189> tissue<00:02:17.400> with<00:02:17.670> these<00:02:17.849> integrins<00:02:18.739> but

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
grab the tissue with these integrins but

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.039 
grab the tissue with these integrins but
there<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.159> fun<00:02:20.640> thing<00:02:21.239> which<00:02:21.450> happens<00:02:21.870> here

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
there is a fun thing which happens here

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.140 
there is a fun thing which happens here
i'd<00:02:22.230> love<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:22.920> such<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> beautiful<00:02:23.549> thing

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
i'd love it it's such a beautiful thing

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.300 
i'd love it it's such a beautiful thing
so<00:02:24.989> now<00:02:25.140> what<00:02:25.290> happens<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.829> let<00:02:26.040> us<00:02:26.099> say<00:02:26.189> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
so now what happens is let us say the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.140 
so now what happens is let us say the
macrophages<00:02:26.819> have<00:02:26.970> attached<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.500> tissue

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
macrophages have attached to the tissue

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.849 
macrophages have attached to the tissue
these<00:02:30.150> integrins<00:02:31.099> these<00:02:32.099> integrins<00:02:32.819> caused

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
these integrins these integrins caused

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.170 
these integrins these integrins caused
just<00:02:34.859> by<00:02:35.010> presence<00:02:35.519> these<00:02:35.670> are<00:02:35.790> chemical

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
just by presence these are chemical

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.020 
just by presence these are chemical
substances<00:02:36.659> so<00:02:36.810> their<00:02:36.989> presence<00:02:37.500> causes

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
substances so their presence causes

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.720 
substances so their presence causes
tumor<00:02:39.030> growth<00:02:39.299> factors<00:02:40.220> alpha<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.430> become

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
tumor growth factors alpha to become

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.819 
tumor growth factors alpha to become
activated<00:02:42.620> TGIF<00:02:43.620> why<00:02:44.010> do<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.909> I<00:02:44.939> have<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.829> it's

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
activated TGIF why do I so I have a it's

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.369 
activated TGIF why do I so I have a it's
now<00:02:47.299> confirmed<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.720> some<00:02:48.930> sort<00:02:49.109> of<00:02:49.230> her

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
now confirmed I have some sort of her

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.259 
now confirmed I have some sort of her
dyslexia<00:02:49.879> so<00:02:51.079> tgf-beta<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.459> tumor<00:02:53.940> growth

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
dyslexia so tgf-beta so tumor growth

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.160 
dyslexia so tgf-beta so tumor growth
factor<00:02:54.810> beta<00:02:55.019> becomes<00:02:56.389> active<00:02:57.389> when<00:02:57.629> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
factor beta becomes active when the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.640 
factor beta becomes active when the
integrins<00:02:58.620> are<00:02:58.650> present<00:02:59.780> now<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.620> a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
integrins are present now here is a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.589 
integrins are present now here is a
funny<00:03:01.950> thing

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
funny thing

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.559 
funny thing
macrophage<00:03:03.599> has<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:06.680> receptor<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:08.129> its<00:03:09.060> surface

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
macrophage has a receptor on its surface

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.410 
macrophage has a receptor on its surface
for<00:03:10.790> tumor<00:03:11.790> growth<00:03:12.060> factors<00:03:12.540> beta<00:03:13.909> so<00:03:14.909> when

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
for tumor growth factors beta so when

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.479 
for tumor growth factors beta so when
the<00:03:15.569> tumor<00:03:15.900> growth<00:03:16.170> factor<00:03:16.560> beta<00:03:16.889> becomes

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
the tumor growth factor beta becomes

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.599 
the tumor growth factor beta becomes
active<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.359> goes<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.169> sits<00:03:19.440> down<00:03:19.739> here<00:03:21.410> on

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
active it goes and it sits down here on

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.050 
active it goes and it sits down here on
to<00:03:23.609> its<00:03:23.760> receptors<00:03:24.329> on<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.569> macrophage<00:03:26.060> that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
to its receptors on the macrophage that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.009 
to its receptors on the macrophage that
causes<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.799> causes<00:03:29.599> second<00:03:30.599> messenger

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
causes that causes second messenger

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.930 
causes that causes second messenger
system<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.590> become<00:03:31.739> active<00:03:32.370> inside<00:03:32.879> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
system to become active inside the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.059 
system to become active inside the
macrophage<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.129> that<00:03:35.129> then<00:03:35.669> causes<00:03:36.299> a

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
macrophage and that then causes a

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:43.059 
macrophage and that then causes a
down-regulation<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:39.230> macrophage<00:03:40.230> activities

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
down-regulation of macrophage activities

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.409 
down-regulation of macrophage activities
it<00:03:44.069> causes<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.699> down-regulation<00:03:45.389> of

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
it causes the down-regulation of

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.680 
it causes the down-regulation of
lysosomal<00:03:46.400> enzyme<00:03:47.400> production<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.150> causes

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
lysosomal enzyme production it causes

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.229 
lysosomal enzyme production it causes
down<00:03:48.989> regulation<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.859> phagocytosis<00:03:50.579> it

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
down regulation of the phagocytosis it

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.030 
down regulation of the phagocytosis it
causes<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.870> down<00:03:52.199> regulation<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.859> the

causes the down regulation of the
macrophage<00:03:53.370> activity<00:03:54.060> very<00:03:55.049> important<00:03:55.560> thing

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
macrophage activity very important thing

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.430 
macrophage activity very important thing
please<00:03:56.370> remember<00:03:56.669> it<00:03:56.970> look<00:03:57.180> at<00:03:57.329> this<00:03:57.510> when<00:03:58.139> a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
please remember it look at this when a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.319 
please remember it look at this when a
macrophage<00:03:59.040> sits<00:03:59.639> so<00:03:59.849> let's<00:04:00.030> say<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:00.269> is

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
macrophage sits so let's say this is

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.030 
macrophage sits so let's say this is
alveolar<00:04:00.989> macrophages<00:04:01.290> itting<00:04:01.799> on<00:04:01.919> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
alveolar macrophages itting on the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.059 
alveolar macrophages itting on the
alveolus<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.329> tissue<00:04:03.479> in<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.810> lungs<00:04:04.069> when

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
alveolus so the tissue in the lungs when

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.039 
alveolus so the tissue in the lungs when
the<00:04:05.190> macrophage<00:04:05.849> sits<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.359> there<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.720> dust

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
the macrophage sits in there this a dust

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.479 
the macrophage sits in there this a dust
cell<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:09.239> puts<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.900> launching<00:04:10.799> pads<00:04:11.129> on

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
cell it it puts the launching pads on

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.119 
cell it it puts the launching pads on
the<00:04:11.729> ground<00:04:12.000> which<00:04:12.269> are<00:04:12.449> the<00:04:12.569> integrins

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
the ground which are the integrins

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.099 
the ground which are the integrins
integrins<00:04:14.129> when<00:04:14.459> they<00:04:14.639> help<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.599> macrophage

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
integrins when they help the macrophage

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.379 
integrins when they help the macrophage
connect<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.889> tissue<00:04:17.099> they<00:04:17.669> also<00:04:17.880> do<00:04:18.209> one

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
connect with the tissue they also do one

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.810 
connect with the tissue they also do one
more<00:04:18.570> activity<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.199> that<00:04:19.349> is<00:04:19.560> they<00:04:20.070> activate

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
more activity and that is they activate

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.080 
more activity and that is they activate
the<00:04:21.750> tumor<00:04:22.349> growth<00:04:22.560> factor<00:04:22.889> beta<00:04:23.039> once<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
the tumor growth factor beta once the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.000 
the tumor growth factor beta once the
tumor<00:04:24.450> growth<00:04:24.659> factor<00:04:25.020> beta<00:04:25.200> is<00:04:25.409> activated

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
tumor growth factor beta is activated

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.850 
tumor growth factor beta is activated
that

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
that

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.420 
that
factor<00:04:27.129> is<00:04:27.219> going<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.520> go<00:04:27.699> and<00:04:28.060> get<00:04:28.840> attached

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
factor is going to go and get attached

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.300 
factor is going to go and get attached
here<00:04:30.430> on<00:04:30.759> the<00:04:31.060> receptor<00:04:31.509> on<00:04:31.599> the<00:04:31.750> macrophage

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
here on the receptor on the macrophage

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.589 
here on the receptor on the macrophage
that<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.490> why<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:33.699> is<00:04:33.729> very<00:04:33.939> important<00:04:34.389> for<00:04:34.479> you

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
that is why it is very important for you

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.089 
that is why it is very important for you
to<00:04:34.629> remember<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.259> macrophage<00:04:35.830> has<00:04:36.069> a

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
to remember that macrophage has a

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.879 
to remember that macrophage has a
tgf-beta<00:04:36.849> receptor<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.569> it<00:04:37.719> okay<00:04:38.319> so<00:04:38.680> once

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
tgf-beta receptor on it okay so once

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.279 
tgf-beta receptor on it okay so once
that<00:04:39.099> receptor<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.639> activated<00:04:39.849> it<00:04:40.539> sends<00:04:41.229> a

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
that receptor is activated it sends a

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.170 
that receptor is activated it sends a
signal<00:04:41.439> down<00:04:41.800> inside<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.460> macrophage<00:04:42.759> and

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
signal down inside the macrophage and

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.909 
signal down inside the macrophage and
the<00:04:43.240> macrophage<00:04:43.780> activities<00:04:44.530> are<00:04:44.710> down

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
the macrophage activities are down

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.119 
the macrophage activities are down
regulated<00:04:45.639> good<00:04:46.629> so<00:04:47.110> now<00:04:47.319> this<00:04:47.560> macrophage

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
regulated good so now this macrophage

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.029 
regulated good so now this macrophage
has<00:04:48.340> landed<00:04:49.180> on<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.479> tissue<00:04:49.689> shut<00:04:50.530> down<00:04:50.770> the

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
has landed on the tissue shut down the

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.170 
has landed on the tissue shut down the
engines<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.699> it<00:04:51.789> is<00:04:51.819> sleeping<00:04:53.490> good<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.789> has

become a resident macrophage waiting for
an<00:04:57.909> event<00:04:58.180> now<00:04:59.080> what's<00:04:59.289> gonna<00:04:59.409> happen<00:04:59.529> check

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:00.219 
an event now what's gonna happen check

an event now what's gonna happen check
this<00:05:00.340> out<00:05:00.550> this<00:05:00.699> is<00:05:00.759> funny<00:05:01.090> so<00:05:01.810> here<00:05:02.050> comes<00:05:02.349> a

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
this out this is funny so here comes a

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.320 
this out this is funny so here comes a
funny<00:05:05.129> pathogen<00:05:06.129> that<00:05:07.050> could<00:05:08.050> be<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.199> virus<00:05:09.330> so

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
funny pathogen that could be a virus so

downregulated

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.780 
downregulated
so<00:06:40.720> the<00:06:40.840> whole<00:06:40.990> cycle<00:06:41.380> is<00:06:41.470> reversed<00:06:41.860> now<00:06:42.070> in

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
causes the receptor stimulation to go

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.910 
causes the receptor stimulation to go
away<00:06:49.960> that<00:06:50.830> causes<00:06:51.400> the<00:06:52.260> reduction<00:06:53.260> in

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
away that causes the reduction in

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.080 
away that causes the reduction in
macrophage<00:06:54.820> activity<00:06:55.390> to<00:06:56.080> go<00:06:56.260> away<00:06:56.850> so<00:06:57.850> what

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
macrophage activity to go away so what

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.730 
macrophage activity to go away so what
was<00:06:58.270> the<00:06:58.390> macrophage<00:06:58.900> activity<00:06:59.410> the

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
was the macrophage activity the

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.990 
was the macrophage activity the
macrophage<00:07:00.190> activity<00:07:00.670> is<00:07:00.760> to<00:07:00.850> do

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
macrophage activity is to do

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.240 
macrophage activity is to do
phagocytosis<00:07:01.660> macrophage<00:07:02.560> activity<00:07:03.040> is<00:07:03.130> to

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
phagocytosis macrophage activity is to

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.460 
phagocytosis macrophage activity is to
produce<00:07:03.430> cytokines<00:07:03.760> so<00:07:04.600> we<00:07:04.780> had<00:07:04.990> suppressed

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
produce cytokines so we had suppressed

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.440 
produce cytokines so we had suppressed
it<00:07:05.680> by<00:07:05.830> putting<00:07:06.100> the<00:07:06.370> tumor<00:07:06.730> growth<00:07:06.940> factor<00:07:07.240> on

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
it by putting the tumor growth factor on

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.350 
it by putting the tumor growth factor on
it<00:07:08.280> so<00:07:09.280> as<00:07:09.400> soon<00:07:09.520> as<00:07:09.670> we<00:07:09.790> take<00:07:10.000> that<00:07:10.120> off

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
it so as soon as we take that off

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.050 
it so as soon as we take that off
macrophage<00:07:11.230> is<00:07:11.380> free<00:07:11.590> it's<00:07:12.430> gonna<00:07:12.640> take<00:07:12.910> the

launching pads off is now active and

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.460 
launching pads off is now active and
doing<00:07:16.180> function<00:07:16.630> and<00:07:16.810> what<00:07:16.930> is<00:07:17.050> the<00:07:17.140> function

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
doing function and what is the function

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.290 
doing function and what is the function
phagocytosis<00:07:18.430> is<00:07:18.700> going<00:07:18.880> to<00:07:18.940> start<00:07:19.150> eating

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
phagocytosis is going to start eating

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.240 
phagocytosis is going to start eating
these<00:07:19.630> guys<00:07:19.870> and<00:07:20.140> it's<00:07:20.800> going<00:07:20.980> to<00:07:21.040> start

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
these guys and it's going to start

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.740 
these guys and it's going to start
secreting<00:07:21.490> this<00:07:21.910> I<00:07:22.060> took<00:07:22.240> means<00:07:22.450> tumor

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
secreting this I took means tumor

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.660 
secreting this I took means tumor
necrosis<00:07:22.840> factor<00:07:23.140> until<00:07:23.860> you<00:07:23.950> can<00:07:24.130> six<00:07:24.370> and<00:07:24.550> so

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:24.670 
necrosis factor until you can six and so

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.700 
necrosis factor until you can six and so
on<00:07:24.700> so<00:07:25.330> that<00:07:25.360> is<00:07:25.810> how<00:07:26.110> a<00:07:26.460> resident<00:07:27.460> macrophage

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710 
on so that is how a resident macrophage

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.740 
on so that is how a resident macrophage
experiences<00:07:29.710> or<00:07:29.980> finds<00:07:30.400> out<00:07:30.700> a<00:07:30.730> pathogen<00:07:31.540> and

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
experiences or finds out a pathogen and

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.980 
experiences or finds out a pathogen and
becomes<00:07:32.200> active<00:07:32.880> very<00:07:33.880> very<00:07:34.270> important<00:07:34.810> thing

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990 
becomes active very very important thing

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.700 
becomes active very very important thing
so<00:07:35.590> it<00:07:35.800> is<00:07:36.010> the<00:07:36.160> integral<00:07:37.170> which<00:07:38.170> causes<00:07:38.590> the

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
so it is the integral which causes the

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.220 
so it is the integral which causes the
macrophage<00:07:39.220> to<00:07:39.430> become<00:07:39.790> dormant<00:07:40.060> or<00:07:40.720> it<00:07:41.080> is

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.230 
macrophage to become dormant or it is

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.710 
macrophage to become dormant or it is
the<00:07:41.380> absence<00:07:41.920> of<00:07:42.070> integrin<00:07:42.640> which<00:07:43.180> causes<00:07:43.600> the

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720 
the absence of integrin which causes the

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.200 
the absence of integrin which causes the
macrophage<00:07:44.230> to<00:07:44.380> become<00:07:44.680> active<00:07:45.010> and<00:07:45.250> then<00:07:46.060> we

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.210 
macrophage to become active and then we

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.940 
macrophage to become active and then we
know<00:07:46.390> that<00:07:46.630> if<00:07:46.870> we<00:07:47.140> have<00:07:47.290> gamma<00:07:47.530> interferon

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:47.950 
know that if we have gamma interferon

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.210 
know that if we have gamma interferon
then<00:07:48.730> the<00:07:48.910> activity<00:07:49.690> becomes<00:07:50.080> hyper<00:07:50.500> activity

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.220 
then the activity becomes hyper activity

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.880 
then the activity becomes hyper activity
and<00:07:51.460> what<00:07:51.850> is<00:07:52.000> that<00:07:52.180> more<00:07:52.510> messenger<00:07:52.900> RNA<00:07:53.320> more

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:53.890 
and what is that more messenger RNA more

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.170 
and what is that more messenger RNA more
phagocytosis<00:07:54.640> more<00:07:55.540> lysosomal<00:07:57.180> enzyme

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:58.180 
phagocytosis more lysosomal enzyme

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.300 
phagocytosis more lysosomal enzyme
production<00:07:58.450> and<00:07:58.780> increase<00:07:59.650> rate<00:08:00.280> of

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310 
production and increase rate of

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.540 
production and increase rate of
phagocytosis<00:08:01.300> and<00:08:01.840> tissue<00:08:02.650> breakdown<00:08:02.920> or<00:08:03.340> the

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:03.550 
phagocytosis and tissue breakdown or the

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.600 
phagocytosis and tissue breakdown or the
digestion<00:08:04.030> in<00:08:04.660> the<00:08:04.900> macrophage<00:08:05.530> so<00:08:06.130> that<00:08:06.370> is

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.610 
digestion in the macrophage so that is

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.390 
digestion in the macrophage so that is
our<00:08:06.790> big<00:08:07.060> cell<00:08:07.390> macrophage<00:08:08.110> I<00:08:08.380> hope<00:08:08.980> that<00:08:09.220> you

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 
our big cell macrophage I hope that you

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.090 
our big cell macrophage I hope that you
liked<00:08:09.760> it<00:08:09.940> we<00:08:10.600> will<00:08:10.870> see<00:08:11.080> you<00:08:11.230> next<00:08:11.260> time<00:08:11.650> thank

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:12.100 
liked it we will see you next time thank

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.250 
liked it we will see you next time thank
you
