00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.560
 to ensure the increase in the demand for raw materials for industry is estimated 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.810
 that the eucalyptus plantation would need to grow by 630 thousand hectares per year in 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.859
 Brazil 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.650
 Estimates love the attention of nurserymen like Alfredo who bets on the 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:24.050
 quality of production to boost sales 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.820
 in the nursery of ramirinho north of santa catarina the objective has been 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.840
 achieved after a successful test of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.730
 I made five trays with the witness which is the standard use that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.859
 they used tcm advisor 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.699
 I used it from about 15 to 20 days is in the nursery 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.170
 when after the germination of their eucalyptus seeds 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.560
 and continued to sin until the end of his cycle in the nursery 500 ml for each without 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.400
 liters of water every 15 days as soon as the plants went to the field in the 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.409
 termination 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.840
 the changes began to appear 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.860
 the results surprised 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.799
 considered 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.229
 improvements in seedling size and rooting 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.580
 were found tablets 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.220
 besides growth 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.070
 the best developed root system 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.200
 brought other advantages 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.460
 high spectra 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.850
 wet in the collation of them very good and the growth is not if 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.370
 differentiated in growing heights 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.090
 and then we went to observe the root system was also better 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.930
 this root system causes the plant to absorb more nutrients 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.500
 she gets more and more stiff is that she has less if she is old to diseases 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 hence in the field it has the differential of catching very large 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.950
 the greatest difficulty one has is due to several 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.620
 factors and substrate of lack of homogeneity in the quality substrate 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.140
 and there is also a lack of a product of what the bridge actually does then 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.660
 if they read it is complete right? 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.850
 barn a potentiating nutrient absorption 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.330
 leaving the plant more resistant 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.600
 she grew more than I all the more witness with the quality of it 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.019
 and roots ned and hardness retired aspect disease also in the nursery 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.329
 strengthened the plant 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.160
 left the most balanced the nurseryman also praises 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.620
 happens in the formation of the fines and the high rate of 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.569
 standardization the nursery that has a large scale is very interesting 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.400
 she went ahead 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.659
 ten to 15 days so we can sell it earlier 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.069
 and with this spectator and of the quality of the change and uniformity also with much 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.330
 industry experience 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.360
 alfredo highlight the importance of this auction we already adopted the product he 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.710
 is being used systematically among many products that we already 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.520
 we have tested over that period that we have worked for ten years 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.819
 that was the one that worked the most 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.469
 the product brings together various desired deborah characteristics 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.659
 the nursery group 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:04.449
