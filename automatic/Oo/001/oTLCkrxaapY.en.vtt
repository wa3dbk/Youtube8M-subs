yesterday and I did a color wash with
pink<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.330> both<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.810> them<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.380> what

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
pink on both of them just to see what

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.679 
pink on both of them just to see what
would<00:01:10.590> happen<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.600> as<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> gold

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
would happen and as you can see the gold

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
would happen and as you can see the gold
leaf<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.380> gets<00:01:16.680> pulled<00:01:16.950> off<00:01:17.159> when<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.460> put

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
leaf really gets pulled off when you put

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.370 
leaf really gets pulled off when you put
water<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.630> Moisture<00:01:19.020> makes<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
water on it well Moisture makes it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.200 
water on it well Moisture makes it
dissolve<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.159> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.430> deteriorates<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
dissolve it kind of deteriorates it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.550 
dissolve it kind of deteriorates it
anyway<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.750> usually<00:01:21.900> don't<00:01:22.229> want<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> put

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
anyway so you usually don't want to put

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590 
anyway so you usually don't want to put
anything<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.950> gold<00:01:23.340> leaf<00:01:23.549> which<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.479> know

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
anything on gold leaf which is you know

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
anything on gold leaf which is you know
I<00:01:24.630> was<00:01:24.869> interested<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.590> class<00:01:25.830> because

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I was interested in this class because

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.070 
I was interested in this class because
when<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.000> saw<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.270> she<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:27.479> doing<00:01:27.570> washes<00:01:27.990> on

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
when I saw that she was doing washes on

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
when I saw that she was doing washes on
gold<00:01:28.259> leaf<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.560> thought<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.130> why<00:01:29.490> would

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
gold leaf I thought well why why would

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.990 
gold leaf I thought well why why would
you<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:31.020> definitely<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> look

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
you do that and it's definitely a look

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.160 
you do that and it's definitely a look
usually<00:01:33.000> when<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:33.360> doing<00:01:33.630> gold<00:01:33.810> leaf<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
usually when you're doing gold leaf you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.330 
usually when you're doing gold leaf you
don't<00:01:34.380> want<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.799> anything<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.220> gonna

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
don't want to do anything that's gonna

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.999 
don't want to do anything that's gonna
ruin<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.890> me

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.850 
ruin it and I'm you know this is to me
this<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.280> kind<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.520> ruining<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.860> when

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
this is kind of ruining it because when

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.590 
this is kind of ruining it because when
in<00:01:41.220> culinary<00:01:41.400> school<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:42.180> teach<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.479> how<00:01:42.570> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
in culinary school they teach you how to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.149 
in culinary school they teach you how to
put<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.409> leave<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.040> it's

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
put it on and leave it on so it's

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.530 
put it on and leave it on so it's
perfect<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.210> what<00:01:45.390> you're

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
perfect and this is not what you're

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
perfect and this is not what you're
going<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.530> you're<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:46.979> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
going for but if you're going for this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.580 
going for but if you're going for this
kind<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.310> an<00:01:47.430> antique<00:01:47.579> ripped<00:01:48.119> up<00:01:48.299> look<00:01:48.590> then

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
kind of an antique ripped up look then

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.260 
kind of an antique ripped up look then
that's<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
that's you know that's what you get and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.730 
that's you know that's what you get and
the<00:01:54.270> stuff<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> had<00:01:54.750> been<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the stuff that had been on there for a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.380 
the stuff that had been on there for a
long<00:01:55.920> time<00:01:55.950> didn't<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.700> pulled<00:01:56.880> off<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.240> much

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
long time didn't get pulled off as much

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
long time didn't get pulled off as much
but<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> did<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.350> eat<00:01:58.829> through<00:01:59.219> parts<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
but it did kind of eat through parts of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.620 
but it did kind of eat through parts of
it<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.729> putting<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> alcohol

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it and so you know putting the alcohol

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.709 
it and so you know putting the alcohol
on<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.610> will<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.939> deteriorate<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> gold

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
on it will kind of deteriorate the gold

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.210 
on it will kind of deteriorate the gold
leaf<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.229> that's<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.799> you're<00:02:07.950> looking

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
leaf so if that's what you're looking

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.830 
leaf so if that's what you're looking
for<00:02:08.399> go<00:02:08.550> ahead<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> color<00:02:09.179> wash<00:02:09.390> if<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
for go ahead and do a color wash if you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.970 
for go ahead and do a color wash if you
want<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.619> pristine<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
want it to be pristine and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.920 
want it to be pristine and
it's<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.250> solid<00:02:12.670> don't<00:02:12.910> do<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.240> color<00:02:13.480> wash<00:02:13.690> over

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
it's a solid don't do a color wash over

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.660 
it's a solid don't do a color wash over
it<00:02:14.170> because<00:02:14.410> it<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:14.590> rips<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> up<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
it because it just rips it up and the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.120 
it because it just rips it up and the
vodka<00:02:18.910> did<00:02:19.420> work<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:20.349> not<00:02:20.590> sure<00:02:20.739> if<00:02:20.890> every

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
vodka did work I'm not sure if every

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.650 
vodka did work I'm not sure if every
clear<00:02:21.310> would<00:02:21.489> evaporate<00:02:21.730> faster<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.510> not

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
clear would evaporate faster and not

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.240 
clear would evaporate faster and not
cause<00:02:22.900> quite<00:02:23.230> as<00:02:23.440> much<00:02:23.650> because<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.040> really

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
cause quite as much because it really

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.559 
cause quite as much because it really
did<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.849> see<00:02:25.000> right<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.360> really

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
did like you see right here it really

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.750 
did like you see right here it really
did<00:02:25.690> pull<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:25.959> off<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.709> that<00:02:27.370> could<00:02:27.550> be<00:02:27.640> why

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
did pull it off and that could be why

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.670 
did pull it off and that could be why
the<00:02:27.819> higher<00:02:28.030> alcohol<00:02:28.600> content<00:02:29.050> would<00:02:29.470> work

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the higher alcohol content would work

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.979 
the higher alcohol content would work
just<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.730> evaporate<00:02:31.180> not<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:31.810> much

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
just to evaporate not have this much

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.260 
just to evaporate not have this much
moisture<00:02:32.260> sitting<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.830> gold<00:02:33.010> leaf<00:02:33.270> but

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
moisture sitting on the gold leaf but

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.210 
moisture sitting on the gold leaf but
you<00:02:34.510> know<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.870> think<00:02:35.560> any<00:02:35.709> moisture<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
you know I think any moisture that you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.530 
you know I think any moisture that you
put<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.459> there<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.670> gonna<00:02:36.819> do<00:02:36.940> something<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
put on there is gonna do something to it

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.360 
put on there is gonna do something to it
and<00:02:38.110> even<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.620> brushing<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.040> with<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.220> brush

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
and even just brushing it with the brush

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.550 
and even just brushing it with the brush
is<00:02:39.519> gonna<00:02:39.700> do<00:02:39.819> something<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:41.260> anyway<00:02:41.500> so

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
is gonna do something to it so anyway so

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.800 
is gonna do something to it so anyway so
I'm<00:02:41.680> taking<00:02:41.830> this<00:02:42.099> transfer<00:02:42.580> sheet<00:02:42.819> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
I'm taking this transfer sheet the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.970 
I'm taking this transfer sheet the
transfer<00:02:44.200> sheets<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.709> gold<00:02:44.860> leaf

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
transfer sheets have the gold leaf

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.820 
transfer sheets have the gold leaf
attached<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.550> them<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:47.019> loose<00:02:47.350> leaf<00:02:47.560> ones

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
attached to them and the loose leaf ones

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.890 
attached to them and the loose leaf ones
the<00:02:48.400> gold<00:02:48.610> leaf<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:49.000> loose<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.810> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
the gold leaf is loose and you have to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.509 
the gold leaf is loose and you have to
be<00:02:49.959> super<00:02:50.319> careful<00:02:50.350> turn<00:02:50.920> off<00:02:51.040> all<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.280> fans

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
be super careful turn off all the fans

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.830 
be super careful turn off all the fans
turn<00:02:51.819> off<00:02:51.940> all<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> air<00:02:52.239> conditioning<00:02:52.660> don't

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
turn off all the air conditioning don't

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.620 
turn off all the air conditioning don't
breathe<00:02:53.250> because<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.489> leaf<00:02:54.910> itself<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.480> so

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
breathe because the leaf itself is so

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.710 
breathe because the leaf itself is so
thin<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:57.610> will<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:57.940> get<00:02:58.180> blown<00:02:58.330> away<00:02:58.480> by<00:02:58.660> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
thin it will just get blown away by the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.870 
thin it will just get blown away by the
wind<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.680> I've<00:02:59.860> dampened<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.370> surface<00:03:00.730> of

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
wind and I've dampened the surface of

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.960 
wind and I've dampened the surface of
this<00:03:01.060> just<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.720> little<00:03:01.810> bit<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:03.549> just<00:03:03.580> gently

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970

this just a little bit you just gently
rub<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.360> on<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:08.590> really<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:08.980> not<00:03:09.160> hard<00:03:09.430> once

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
rub it on this really is not hard once

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.000 
rub it on this really is not hard once
you<00:03:10.000> do<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.900> like<00:03:11.049> why<00:03:11.500> was<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.709> afraid<00:03:11.830> of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
you do it you like why was I afraid of

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.780 
you do it you like why was I afraid of
cold<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.739> see<00:03:14.739> that's<00:03:14.890> not<00:03:15.069> quite<00:03:15.280> dry<00:03:15.549> so

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
cold and see that's not quite dry so

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.390 
cold and see that's not quite dry so
it's<00:03:15.910> not<00:03:16.000> coming<00:03:16.180> off<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:17.890> can<00:03:18.010> always<00:03:18.190> fold

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it's not coming off you can always fold

solid piece the light in here is really

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.390 
solid piece the light in here is really
bad<00:04:01.690> but<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.739> solid<00:04:03.069> piece<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:03.280> can

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
bad but this is a solid piece you can

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.370 
bad but this is a solid piece you can

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
had the wash put on it and it does make

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
it look old and kind of beat up if you

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.740 
it look old and kind of beat up if you
do<00:04:13.359> a<00:04:13.389> color<00:04:13.630> wash<00:04:13.810> over<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:16.299> solid

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
do a color wash over it and the solid

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.890 
do a color wash over it and the solid
piece<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:17.530> what<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.489> always<00:04:18.880> look<00:04:19.359> for<00:04:19.570> in<00:04:19.690> gold

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
piece is what I always look for in gold

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.899 
piece is what I always look for in gold
its<00:04:20.169> shinier<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:21.310> obviously<00:04:21.669> because<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
its shinier just obviously because the

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.420 
its shinier just obviously because the
color<00:04:22.090> wash<00:04:22.270> will<00:04:22.450> tone<00:04:22.599> it<00:04:22.720> down<00:04:22.840> depending

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
color wash will tone it down depending

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.340 
color wash will tone it down depending
while<00:04:23.520> you're<00:04:23.669> putting<00:04:23.820> on<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.930> shiny<00:04:25.110> or

while you're putting on it it's shiny or

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.990 
while you're putting on it it's shiny or
it's<00:04:25.500> solid<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:25.979> doesn't<00:04:26.009> have<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> rips<00:04:26.669> in

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
it's solid it doesn't have the rips in

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.570 
it's solid it doesn't have the rips in
the<00:04:27.240> tears<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.900> brakes<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.620> depending<00:04:29.490> on

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
the tears and the brakes so depending on

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.620 
the tears and the brakes so depending on
what<00:04:29.669> you're<00:04:29.789> looking<00:04:29.820> for<00:04:30.210> that's<00:04:30.360> what<00:04:30.570> you

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
a color wash is basically just a liquid

a color wash is basically just a liquid
with<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.669> really<00:04:36.180> tiny<00:04:36.870> amount<00:04:37.289> of<00:04:37.440> color<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.949> it

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
with a really tiny amount of color in it

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.570 
with a really tiny amount of color in it
and<00:04:38.550> it's<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.060> watercolor<00:04:39.419> technique<00:04:40.580> where

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
and it's a watercolor technique where

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
and it's a watercolor technique where
you<00:04:41.639> use<00:04:41.759> just<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.030> little<00:04:42.270> tiny<00:04:42.389> bit<00:04:42.479> of

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
you use just a little tiny bit of

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.740 
you use just a little tiny bit of
watercolor<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.460> wash<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.699> across<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.509> canvas

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
watercolor and wash it across the canvas

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.980 
watercolor and wash it across the canvas
and<00:04:46.199> it<00:04:46.259> drips<00:04:46.470> down<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.889> it's<00:04:47.009> very<00:04:47.190> thin<00:04:47.990> it

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
and it drips down and it's very thin it

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.480 
and it drips down and it's very thin it
looks<00:04:49.169> like<00:04:49.320> I<00:04:49.350> had<00:04:49.710> some<00:04:49.919> kind<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.100> metal<00:04:50.370> in

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
looks like I had some kind of metal in

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.420 
looks like I had some kind of metal in
this<00:04:50.669> little<00:04:51.389> dish<00:04:52.009> that's<00:04:53.009> probably<00:04:53.280> from

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
this little dish that's probably from

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.590 
this little dish that's probably from
yesterday<00:04:53.759> because<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:53.970> was<00:04:54.060> using<00:04:54.210> this<00:04:54.419> for

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
yesterday because I was using this for

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.330 
yesterday because I was using this for
the<00:04:54.660> color<00:04:54.840> wash<00:04:54.990> yesterday<00:04:55.380> in<00:04:55.889> case<00:04:56.099> for

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
the color wash yesterday in case for

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.070 
the color wash yesterday in case for
this<00:04:56.460> one<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.639> did<00:04:56.849> a<00:04:56.880> green<00:04:57.180> just<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:57.960> can

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
this one I did a green just so you can

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.900 
this one I did a green just so you can
see<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.289> difference<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:58.979> if<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.490> do<00:04:59.610> a<00:04:59.639> wash

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
see the difference so if you do a wash

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.189 
see the difference so if you do a wash
on<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.210> top<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.509> that<00:05:00.599> you<00:05:00.720> can<00:05:00.840> see<00:05:00.960> how<00:05:01.080> it

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
on the top of that you can see how it

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.689 
on the top of that you can see how it
kind<00:05:01.289> of<00:05:01.410> tones<00:05:01.590> down<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.039> peachy<00:05:02.910> color<00:05:03.090> and

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
kind of tones down the peachy color and

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.659 
kind of tones down the peachy color and
if<00:05:05.699> you're<00:05:05.970> gonna<00:05:06.090> wash<00:05:06.419> on<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.770> top<00:05:08.250> with<00:05:08.550> the

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
if you're gonna wash on the top with the

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:09.469 
if you're gonna wash on the top with the
gold

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
gold

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.029 
gold
I'll<00:05:09.840> get<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:10.199> it's<00:05:10.320> kind<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.530> shiny<00:05:10.740> in<00:05:10.949> the

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
I'll get it so it's kind of shiny in the

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.089 
I'll get it so it's kind of shiny in the
light<00:05:12.320> very<00:05:13.320> gently<00:05:13.800> just<00:05:15.320> do<00:05:16.320> that

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
light very gently just do that

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.700 
light very gently just do that
this<00:05:17.759> is<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:17.910> really<00:05:18.270> soft<00:05:18.539> brush<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:19.349> bristles

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
this is a really soft brush the bristles

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.520 
this is a really soft brush the bristles
are<00:05:19.800> very<00:05:19.830> soft<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:20.490> would<00:05:20.729> not<00:05:20.880> use<00:05:21.210> in<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:22.380> in

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
are very soft I would not use in the in

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.870 
are very soft I would not use in the in
the<00:05:22.620> crafty<00:05:22.949> class<00:05:23.130> you<00:05:23.280> use<00:05:23.310> kind<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.669> stiff

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
the crafty class you use kind of a stiff

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.879 
the crafty class you use kind of a stiff
brush<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.539> that<00:05:24.750> really<00:05:25.050> pulls<00:05:25.349> the<00:05:25.530> gold<00:05:25.710> so

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
brush and that really pulls the gold so

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.010 
brush and that really pulls the gold so
if<00:05:25.979> you<00:05:26.099> want<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.400> get<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.240> look<00:05:27.479> then<00:05:27.659> use<00:05:27.990> a

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
if you want to get that look then use a

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.659 
if you want to get that look then use a
stiffer<00:05:28.320> brush<00:05:30.620> I'm<00:05:31.620> still<00:05:31.919> kind<00:05:32.130> of<00:05:32.190> I<00:05:32.400> like

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
stiffer brush I'm still kind of I like

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.659 
stiffer brush I'm still kind of I like
the<00:05:33.080> technique<00:05:34.080> of<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:35.070> like<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.580> effect

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
the technique of the I like the effect

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.520 
the technique of the I like the effect
of<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.090> colors<00:05:36.389> on<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.690> gold<00:05:36.900> but<00:05:36.990> I'm<00:05:37.229> I

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
of the colors on the gold but I'm I

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.740 
of the colors on the gold but I'm I
don't<00:05:37.680> like<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:38.010> ripped<00:05:38.729> up<00:05:38.880> surface<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:39.479> I

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
don't like the ripped up surface so I

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.629 
don't like the ripped up surface so I
don't<00:05:40.680> know<00:05:40.770> if<00:05:40.860> I<00:05:40.919> would<00:05:41.039> do<00:05:41.130> that<00:05:41.159> on<00:05:41.370> a<00:05:41.400> cake

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
don't know if I would do that on a cake

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.839 
don't know if I would do that on a cake
unless<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.060> was<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.180> specific<00:05:42.780> reason<00:05:43.139> but<00:05:43.849> all

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
unless it was a specific reason but all

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.899 
unless it was a specific reason but all
right<00:05:45.000> so<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.240> wash<00:05:45.570> this<00:05:45.979> just<00:05:46.979> paint<00:05:47.729> it<00:05:47.849> on

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
right so to wash this just paint it on

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.060 
right so to wash this just paint it on
there<00:05:48.120> let<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.300> drip<00:05:48.539> down<00:05:48.919> then<00:05:49.919> you're

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
there let it drip down then you're

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.999 
there let it drip down then you're
gently<00:05:50.340> gonna<00:05:50.550> go<00:05:50.699> over<00:05:51.150> it<00:05:51.470> I'm<00:05:52.470> trying<00:05:52.680> not

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
gently gonna go over it I'm trying not

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.249 
gently gonna go over it I'm trying not
to<00:05:53.070> rip<00:05:53.400> it<00:05:53.550> up<00:05:53.729> because<00:05:54.539> again<00:05:54.870> this<00:05:55.020> just

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
to rip it up because again this just

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:56.659 
to rip it up because again this just
goes<00:05:55.380> against<00:05:55.770> everything<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.190> I<00:05:56.370> was<00:05:56.490> ever

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
goes against everything that I was ever

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.310 
goes against everything that I was ever
taught<00:05:59.389> but<00:06:00.389> it<00:06:00.479> is<00:06:00.599> nice<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.810> know<00:06:01.110> that<00:06:01.139> you

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
taught but it is nice to know that you

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.170 
taught but it is nice to know that you
can<00:06:01.500> do<00:06:01.740> a<00:06:02.039> different<00:06:02.490> color<00:06:02.699> and<00:06:02.909> kind<00:06:03.090> of

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
can do a different color and kind of

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.210 
can do a different color and kind of
tone<00:06:03.330> it<00:06:03.449> down<00:06:03.539> see<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.930> green<00:06:04.259> really<00:06:04.860> tones

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
tone it down see that green really tones

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.890 
tone it down see that green really tones
down<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.909> gold<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:08.520> shiny<00:06:08.820> gold<00:06:10.639> and<00:06:11.750> you<00:06:12.750> can

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
down the gold the shiny gold and you can

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.189 
down the gold the shiny gold and you can
see<00:06:13.169> I<00:06:13.590> hope<00:06:14.490> you<00:06:14.639> can<00:06:14.759> see<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.870> difference

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
see I hope you can see the difference

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.290 
see I hope you can see the difference
that<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:16.710> one<00:06:16.889> is<00:06:16.979> the<00:06:17.099> pink<00:06:17.310> from<00:06:17.880> yesterday

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
that this one is the pink from yesterday

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.149 
that this one is the pink from yesterday
and<00:06:18.659> that<00:06:19.289> one<00:06:19.440> is<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.680> green<00:06:19.889> and<00:06:19.919> you<00:06:20.130> can

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
and that one is the green and you can

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.350 
and that one is the green and you can
see<00:06:20.400> there's<00:06:20.580> a<00:06:20.669> difference<00:06:20.940> in<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.150> color

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
see there's a difference in the color

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.730 
see there's a difference in the color
and<00:06:23.270> it<00:06:24.270> just<00:06:24.539> gives<00:06:24.690> the<00:06:24.900> gold<00:06:25.199> a<00:06:25.349> little<00:06:25.590> bit

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
and it just gives the gold a little bit

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.700 
and it just gives the gold a little bit
of<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:25.889> different<00:06:26.360> look<00:06:27.360> to<00:06:27.419> it<00:06:27.630> and<00:06:28.229> this<00:06:28.650> one

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
of a different look to it and this one

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.469 
of a different look to it and this one
is<00:06:28.949> nice<00:06:29.099> I<00:06:29.310> didn't<00:06:29.610> brush<00:06:29.789> this<00:06:30.030> one<00:06:30.150> as<00:06:30.330> hard

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
is nice I didn't brush this one as hard

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.120 
is nice I didn't brush this one as hard
I<00:06:30.570> think<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:30.840> brush<00:06:30.990> that<00:06:31.110> I<00:06:31.229> used<00:06:31.440> on<00:06:31.889> this

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
I think the brush that I used on this

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.240 
I think the brush that I used on this
one<00:06:32.340> yesterday<00:06:32.779> was<00:06:33.779> a<00:06:34.020> lot<00:06:34.169> stiffer<00:06:34.500> and<00:06:34.889> it

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
one yesterday was a lot stiffer and it

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.090 
one yesterday was a lot stiffer and it
probably<00:06:35.430> pulled<00:06:35.700> more<00:06:35.909> of<00:06:36.029> the<00:06:36.150> leaf<00:06:36.300> off

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
probably pulled more of the leaf off

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.830 
probably pulled more of the leaf off
this<00:06:37.460> one<00:06:37.670> doesn't<00:06:38.000> seem<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.360> be<00:06:38.480> pulling<00:06:38.630> as

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
this one doesn't seem to be pulling as

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.120 
this one doesn't seem to be pulling as
much<00:06:38.960> of<00:06:39.110> the<00:06:39.170> leaf<00:06:39.320> off<00:06:39.500> and<00:06:39.740> it<00:06:39.800> didn't<00:06:40.010> give

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
much of the leaf off and it didn't give

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.000 
much of the leaf off and it didn't give
it<00:06:40.190> a<00:06:40.250> nice<00:06:40.400> kind<00:06:40.670> of<00:06:40.760> greeny<00:06:40.970> color<00:06:41.540> so<00:06:42.260> you

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
it a nice kind of greeny color so you

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.850 
it a nice kind of greeny color so you
can't<00:06:43.220> use<00:06:43.400> vodka<00:06:43.880> because<00:06:44.450> I<00:06:44.840> started<00:06:45.530> off<00:06:45.680> by

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
can't use vodka because I started off by

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.260 
can't use vodka because I started off by
saying<00:06:45.890> that<00:06:46.250> one<00:06:46.400> of<00:06:46.430> the<00:06:46.580> questions<00:06:46.970> on<00:06:47.120> this

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
saying that one of the questions on this

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.880 
saying that one of the questions on this
was<00:06:47.450> can<00:06:47.660> you<00:06:47.750> use<00:06:47.870> vodka<00:06:48.260> with<00:06:48.380> this<00:06:48.530> and<00:06:48.740> she

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
was can you use vodka with this and she

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.020 
was can you use vodka with this and she
answered<00:06:49.160> no<00:06:49.340> but<00:06:50.470> I've<00:06:51.470> I<00:06:52.070> tried<00:06:52.580> it<00:06:52.730> it<00:06:52.820> seems

dry first and then wash it over but you

know<00:07:06.470> painting<00:07:06.830> on<00:07:06.950> it<00:07:07.100> does<00:07:07.310> tone<00:07:08.000> it<00:07:08.150> down<00:07:08.240> a

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
know painting on it does tone it down a

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.090 
know painting on it does tone it down a
little<00:07:08.390> bit<00:07:08.570> it<00:07:08.930> gives<00:07:09.020> it<00:07:09.200> a<00:07:09.260> different<00:07:09.410> color

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100

or<00:07:10.760> a<00:07:10.790> different<00:07:10.850> reflection<00:07:11.180> and<00:07:12.070> it<00:07:13.070> is<00:07:13.220> a

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
or a different reflection and it is a

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.500 
or a different reflection and it is a
nice<00:07:13.490> effect<00:07:13.670> you<00:07:13.970> just<00:07:14.000> have<00:07:14.240> to<00:07:14.300> be<00:07:14.390> careful

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.510

not<00:07:14.780> to<00:07:14.900> pull<00:07:15.080> too<00:07:15.110> much<00:07:15.410> off<00:07:15.590> unless<00:07:16.430> that's

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
not to pull too much off unless that's

what<00:07:16.790> you're<00:07:16.940> really<00:07:17.180> looking<00:07:17.300> for<00:07:17.660> and<00:07:18.110> I

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
what you're really looking for and I

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.840 
what you're really looking for and I
don't<00:07:18.650> know<00:07:18.770> why<00:07:18.920> you'd<00:07:19.070> look<00:07:19.220> for<00:07:19.250> that<00:07:19.460> if

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
don't know why you'd look for that if

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.780 
don't know why you'd look for that if
you<00:07:20.270> do<00:07:20.420> do<00:07:20.600> this<00:07:20.860> do<00:07:21.860> a<00:07:21.890> colored<00:07:22.580> fondant

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:22.790 
you do do this do a colored fondant

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.090 
you do do this do a colored fondant
underneath<00:07:23.210> just<00:07:23.510> to<00:07:23.660> have<00:07:24.530> the<00:07:24.650> contrast

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100 
underneath just to have the contrast

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.970 
underneath just to have the contrast
when<00:07:25.520> it<00:07:25.610> pokes<00:07:25.820> through<00:07:25.910> and<00:07:26.780> she<00:07:27.740> was<00:07:27.860> doing

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
when it pokes through and she was doing

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.880 
when it pokes through and she was doing
a<00:07:28.280> I<00:07:28.700> think<00:07:29.150> it<00:07:29.210> was<00:07:29.300> on<00:07:29.420> black<00:07:29.660> a<00:07:30.140> silver<00:07:30.680> leaf

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:30.890 
a I think it was on black a silver leaf

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.460 
a I think it was on black a silver leaf
so<00:07:31.460> you<00:07:32.390> know<00:07:32.510> use<00:07:32.660> the<00:07:32.810> gold<00:07:33.020> with<00:07:33.170> the<00:07:33.260> black

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470 
so you know use the gold with the black

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.200 
so you know use the gold with the black
tones<00:07:33.800> for<00:07:34.280> a<00:07:34.340> silver<00:07:34.700> or<00:07:34.730> gold<00:07:34.970> leaf

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.210 
tones for a silver or gold leaf

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.480 
tones for a silver or gold leaf
depending<00:07:35.630> on<00:07:35.720> what<00:07:35.810> you're<00:07:35.930> using<00:07:36.400> but<00:07:37.400> you

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490 
depending on what you're using but you

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.180 
depending on what you're using but you
can<00:07:37.670> use<00:07:37.850> vodka<00:07:38.200> if<00:07:39.200> you<00:07:39.350> can't<00:07:39.560> get<00:07:39.740> Everclear

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.190 
can use vodka if you can't get Everclear

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.100 
can use vodka if you can't get Everclear
which<00:07:40.370> not<00:07:40.520> everybody<00:07:40.730> can<00:07:41.000> and<00:07:41.570> that<00:07:41.780> was<00:07:41.900> the

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
which not everybody can and that was the

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.270 
which not everybody can and that was the
basic<00:07:42.440> point<00:07:42.680> of<00:07:42.770> doing<00:07:42.890> this<00:07:43.070> whole

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 
basic point of doing this whole

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.400 
basic point of doing this whole
experiment<00:07:43.790> so<00:07:43.940> that's<00:07:44.750> it<00:07:44.930> leave<00:07:45.200> any

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:45.410 
experiment so that's it leave any

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.020 
experiment so that's it leave any
questions<00:07:45.800> if<00:07:45.920> you<00:07:46.010> have<00:07:46.040> them<00:07:46.220> and<00:07:46.460> I'll<00:07:46.850> get

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.030 
questions if you have them and I'll get

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.840 
questions if you have them and I'll get
back<00:07:47.180> to<00:07:47.210> you<00:07:47.360> soon<00:07:47.510> as<00:07:47.570> I<00:07:47.690> can
