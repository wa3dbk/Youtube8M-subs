 let's take a splash of vinegar 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.420
 we have added the paprika and we stir 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.960
 until it is more or less the sauce 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.960
 compact 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.460
 we have stopped the game so that we are not 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.979

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.310

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.389
 speak russian 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.389
 and stay here for about five minutes 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.630
 with the chopped casserole 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.879

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.230
 to give it a little bit like now that 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.090

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.030

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.060

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.330

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.330
 of salt 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.790
 the typical pause bag and it will be 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:39.550

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.230
 now we will taste salt 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:16.660
 and we hope and we will set a good deadline 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:18.940
 It has already been a couple of minutes longer 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.289
 we leave four minutes and apply the 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.569
 Pattern 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.830
