00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello I just made this video for 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 explain what you have to do 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 to recover your scholarships so I hope 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.210
 that is of great help to you the most 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.610
 important of all is that you do not fall 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.080
 the despair I understand that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.289
 you are probably going through a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.750
 very difficult situation at this time 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.519
 But if he can stay calm 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.789
 you will be able to perform the steps 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.880
 necessary to reconquer your ex 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:34.170
 now I'm going to reveal you the first great 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.899
 secret to recover your ex tell 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.780
 who agrees with the break like this 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.600
 is to tell you that you agree with a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.239
 break now you're probably 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.200
 thinking that that is the first great 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.480
 secret then if that's the time I'm going 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.129
 explain why it works so 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.620
 you have to do is tell your ex that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.800
 you understand your decision perfectly 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.539
 tell it calmly and grant it to me if 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.859
 you want to tell him in person or if 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.290
 you want to be done by mail 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.720
 electronic 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.500
 If you made a mistake, apologize 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.390
 briefly say something like I'm very sorry 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.190
 have caused some discomfort I admit 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.530
 that in some moments I did wrong and I 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.130
 I made a mistake so I understand perfectly 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.170
 your decision if you did not do anything wrong or not 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.710
 I made no mistake then I do not know 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.090
 Excuse me, you do not have to do what 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.030
 what you have to do after 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.970
 remove from your ex momentarily by 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.760
 a few days but simply nothing is everything 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.820
 has worked this first step that you 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.600
 akaba bera is extremely important 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.810
 let's see why they work there are 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.020
 different psychological reasons 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.759
 Interesting 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.729
 first that all human beings 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.429
 we want what we can not have 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.899
 remember the famous platonic love a 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.149
 of the reasons why it is so strong 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.189
 it is precisely because he is a person 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.630
 that you can not is like something 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.700
 unattainable 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.710
 [Music] 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.450
 or the reason why it works is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.159
 because many times we do not 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.739
 we value what we have until we 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.709
 we lose the most common example that you 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.390
 can give with this is health so 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.190
 general when we have health not the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.200
 we appreciate it enough but if we 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.760
 we get sick there is when we give ourselves 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.730
 realize how important it is to have 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.980
 health then if it makes you understand 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.230
 ex you're going to move on with your life 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.120
 you are giving that false illusion that already 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.760
 I lost you which will work to your 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.020
 favor 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.760
 [Music] 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.310
 you remember when I told you that the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.960
 despair was not good because at 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.240
 tell everything exists according to the 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.220
 break you're not showing that 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.000
 despair which is a very good thing 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.420
 well 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.520
 now listen to this that you think you can 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.300
 go through your ex mind when you tell him 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.680
 that the adventure does not bother you much 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.440
 probably think you found 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.360
 another person to a good term what yes 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.030
 is achieving with all this is to make 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.610
 your ex thinks of you that I can not get you out 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.280
 of his head that's why this first 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.930
 step is so powerful 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.299
 [Music] 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.400
 remember I told you that a part of the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.370
 secret was to move away momentarily from 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.670
 your ex so give him the opportunity to 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.879
 I miss you if you do not move away you can never 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.260
 give you the chance to miss you 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.890
 believe me that nothing that your ex will start you 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.820
 miss 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.890
 you already have half the battle nothing 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.890
 [Music] 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.200
 finally this first step establishes the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.150
 basis that will allow you to implement 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.590
 the other steps 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.349
 [Music] 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.690
 now if you would like to know what they are 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.760
 the other secrets the only thing that they have 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.810

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:53.970
