00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.610
 Today is the influence of the drum instructor Akiyoshi number this time with a samba kick while Phil's beating 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.460
 Or 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:21.980
 What do I began to any person practice for those that Na want to do it Toka drum solo 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.270
 I would like to introduce a proposal or a trick 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 If you idea is referred to as a very simple 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.170
 Hmm 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.579
 Line on your own once you know even in the United States 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 Because I think that I can devise it, and I can do it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:45.250
 A little in the form Toka've been Tari drama lot until now towards the fine ferocity advanced towards Toka Intermediate 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.270
 I think Do was a little I recommend videos to those who are thought Nante Do not have stalled 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.990
 Then 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:56.010
 What kind of thing should I do? 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:01.859
 I'm going to try tom-turn, so yeah already 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:05.159
 Just change this sound of the instrument and your feet will lock 5 or something like a few ears 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.700
 Or it has become a Datte Nan accustomed price clicks into place 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:14.369
 I think that it is often the case that it is simple and it is difficult to write 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.030
 So you're good with his feet while what really simple to as a moving image of I I basis practice until now 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.090
 It has been abolished 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.119
 Such a signboard car practice is good and that kind of 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.650
 I think it would be good to win in a row 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.220
 I'll do it for a moment . It's like this. For example, you can change the manual four times. 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.220
 I think that 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.470
 Hmm 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:59.049
 I like to change 4 times each like this or, for example, I hit it twice, so let's go to the 4th floor 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.049
 2444 Meet or not , but it is life 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.280
 It is a phrase often used in words but a 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.450
 It may be quite difficult to match with this third song, but a little practice like that 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.450
 It may be good to try 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260
 Hmm 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.590
 It means that it is finished 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.579
 I wonder if or gotten seafood fill up roots freely is after 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.680
 Hmm 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:56.310
 It is only bears the but 16 O to become in many places Kitara but for many 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.920
 I think it's good to practice turning 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.790
 That 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.060
 That older brother is an accent 8000 part of the practice 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.319
 Movement of arms and kanehiro 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:16.239
 When simply hit this hard fight Toka or has become at once this difficult time to help 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.989
 I practice accent because I think that it is very good to get intonation and rhythmic 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.819
 Let's go 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:25.690
 For example , there is only one accent in 16 minutes. 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:29.920
 I wonder if there are only two 8 minutes and some 8 sickness 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.490
 Said one only Toka I think that has been until winning streak now in such a feeling I Toka only two, but so 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.190
 What 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.910

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.910
 Had 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.480
 I had 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.590
 Hmm 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.520

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:32.930
 It is to Toka or try to increase the note was rice with feeling 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:37.430
 And it feels like I'm going to add a benefit in the third and third before 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.810
 All the time 16 since also going just become a little ne er noisy 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.850
 Hey that put the relationship by putting the benefits it is in the 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:50.700
 For example , I want to 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:53.100
 It becomes the third if it is the second in the case of this 16 minutes &amp; 16 distribution that I hit it in the distribution 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.050
 You may go all out in a way or something like that 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.760
 Well someone with that sort of N-turn Saturn was people rhythm was Tan, such as he hit 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.760

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.500
 Putsu 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.540
 Putsu 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.200

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.700
 We 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.480
 I feel like I hit it more and more now I have a little more rhythm now 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.330
 But 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.330
