 the very forgetfulness fallaci be seen 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.070
 affected there were practically failures in 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.860
 the security according to them 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.739

 who saved his life by miracle we see 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.239
 the moment in which we say that happens 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.750
 that just the tire mesh 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.960
 has to absorb the hit happened 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.619
 good added to all this there was a lot 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.149
 land in the circuit this had been 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.649
 warned by the pilots both in the

 Qualifying tests on Friday 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.549
 of the day Saturday ends up being one of the 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.369
 main drawbacks the dust 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.740
 also because beyond the mesh of 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.080
 tires and not absorb the blow of 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.810
 falaschi returns it to the track issue 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.030
 what is it that can never happen is good 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.830
 the dust cloud does not allow the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.270

 it can be corroborated at a glance 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.159
 because we do not know which one is the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.790
 blows the one that ends up causing him 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.300
