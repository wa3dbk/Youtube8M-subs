00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 as many already know access 5 ha 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 presented a new game called 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.130
 vertigo but much has been said since 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.110
 that the closed beta was finished and they have 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.330
 there were very varied opinions with 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.490
 regarding the game in this video 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 We will analyze various aspects of the game and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.930
 I will also tell you things that you did not know about 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.939
 he after watching this video you would play 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.939
 dirty bomb well let's start 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.600
 but 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.440
 this is a game created by splash the 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.090
 magic for windows or for pc the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.580
 game at a glance it looks interesting 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.710
 his graphics are good though 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.270
 knowing the access games 5 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.640
 surely he will not have many 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.220
 requirements the gameplay is like in 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.140
 any other normal fps game for 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.940
 who play operation 7 may they 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.040
 it's a bit uncomfortable since the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.440
 character can not crouch on the sides 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.379
 the player will also be able to point their 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.729
 weapons this is important in a fps since 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.619
 that you avoid that style of 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.630
 counter-strike in which you can not 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.790
 point weapons and sometimes it turns out 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.040
 annoying there is also a great variety of 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.320
 weapons from sliders to machine guns 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720
 In addition, it can be observed that 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.520
 there will be something like doctors where yes 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.680
 you die they will be able to relive you 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.830
 honestly the game reminds me of a 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.560
 little to time force 32 the game takes place 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.780
 in london of 2020 that as the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.940
 announcement after receiving a mysterious e 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.920
 unexpected attack radiation has been 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.450
 scattered on the streets leaving them 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.420
 desert with the exception of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.190
 mercenaries the soldiers are hired 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 so that they dive into these dangerous 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.960
 areas 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
 get valuable items there are several 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.250
 mercenary groups in london and the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.799
 different factions face each other 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.929
 they the game does not have mode 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.000
 campaign but it has several modes of 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.610
 play each one with different 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.409
 objectives from escorting vehicles to 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.450
 extraction and deactivate pumps up 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.789
 hack several terminals while you

 move with your team the game modes 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.869
 confirmed are dead match which is the 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.700
 classic game mode in which several 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.319
 teams will face each other and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.420
 stoke watts where the teams are 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.700
 will face in turns being attackers or 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.650
 defenders and they will try to endure what 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.110
 maximum possible before changing 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.569
 mistakes the team that manages to survive 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.510
 More time as a defender will also win 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.190
 also has secondary missions 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.200

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.180
 your characters to unlock team and 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.549
 new skills also apparently 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.380
 there will be something called enhancers that 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.810
 help you level up faster 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.360

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.030
 weapon types aspects and accessories 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.220
 for weapons the why of access 5 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.799
 promote this game is because splash 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.130
 the magic was associated with access 5 since 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.630
 this 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.130
 they offered him the opportunity to 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.380
 distribute the game all over 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.880
 Latin America and how access 5 is a 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.970
 well-known company in 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.680
 latin america they accepted in the beta 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.840
 test many of the users that what 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.940
 they proved that in the game they abound 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.920
 the books but this is normal because the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.080
 be a closed beta game is 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.210
 normal that there are many errors since 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.370
 that is the goal of the beta correct 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.170
 errors but many of the users that 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.210
 they received their beta they could not 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.640
 try it for the famous error code 3 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.770
 that did not let in the game but 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.750
 since it is a beta phase, it is normal that 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.820
 this kind of errors and you may in the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.460
 open beta will be corrected most 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.190
 these problems if you liked the video by

 before the open beta started 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.380
 so my opinion on the game 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.290
 it will be reflected according to this 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.490
 now I'll leave you with the gameplay 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.490
