00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.230

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.400
 First of all I am here in the web 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.400
 surface logged in as admin and go 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.079
 pay attention to the main menu on parcel center 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.300
 on that sdsm 42 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.279
 the package center sees something different 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.900
 off than in previous versions 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.210
 then I go to multimedia and 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.800
 we install the itunes server here 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.110
 then I have in the main menu 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.699
 iTunes server available at 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.830
 first start he asks me like that 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.930
 common name because should be the 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.600
 common name will be the same as here 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.550
 on all devices that access it 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.410
 so on my itunes server 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.780
 access my senology diskstation 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.140
 and I can do it all 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.670
 password protection means those 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.059
 clients those devices in my 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.219
 network via itunes release so 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.869
 to access my itunes server 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.520
 first enter my password 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.080
 I make the smart playlists 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.950
 afterwards and I click here 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.240
 take over 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.300
 I did not make any changes 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.850
 that 's it, too, I'll add now like 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.970
 here you can see media content like music 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.520
 or videos in the folder music and 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.450
 video on my sinology diskstation 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.700
 These are automatically on mine 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.420
 clients like itunes server release 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.550

 a very detailed video about itunes 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.360
 releases for those in my channel 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.649
 I'm very intense on that 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.849
 received and especially the 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.450
 differences between one 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:43.149
 private release and an itunes release 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.000
 the media library as it is the case here 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.849
 you can only go to the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 First of all, content accesses the whole thing 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.800
 an itunes release shows i show 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.380
 give it a quick look in the file station 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.050
 I have here the folder video and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.500
 the folder music and everything in there 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.289
 that is then available for mine 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.319
 clients I would like more folders now 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.020
 then define for my itunes server 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.690
 I go to the control panel go on 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.610

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 high-resolution videos on mobile devices 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.949
 do not stream in this high resolution 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.449
 to have to 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.979

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.780
 please note that is only one 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.229
 release and the libraries different 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.789
 manage itunes is not like this here 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.340

 disconnect and all 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.350
 technical information 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.820
 you can find this on x.de and 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.080
 there is behind search just times 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.850
 itunes 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.250
 I have my own very detailed 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.270
 made video where i made the difference 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.979
 between mediatheks release and 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.870
 private release and that exactly 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.060
 explain so much more there's itunes 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.650
 server actually does not have to say there are 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.050
 still other possibilities like me now 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.400
 shared media libraries on the zoology 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.440
 put down disk station 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.970
 but that has in principle with the itunes 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.100
 server release on the sinology 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.750
 Diskstation relatively little to do 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.030
 for more videos around the topic 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.160
 synology diskstation the device and 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.250
 You can also find more complex tasks 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.870
 comics or in my channel i say 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.250
