the<00:00:19.689> air<00:00:19.840> side<00:00:20.609> important<00:00:21.609> thing<00:00:21.730> with

the air side important thing with

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.210 
the air side important thing with
alcohol<00:00:22.240> is<00:00:22.359> it's<00:00:22.840> a<00:00:22.900> part<00:00:23.140> of<00:00:23.260> society<00:00:24.160> and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
alcohol is it's a part of society and

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.470 
alcohol is it's a part of society and
the<00:00:24.340> thing<00:00:24.460> with<00:00:24.550> alcohol<00:00:24.820> therefore<00:00:25.180> is<00:00:25.300> to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
the thing with alcohol therefore is to

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.050 
the thing with alcohol therefore is to
use<00:00:25.810> it<00:00:25.960> in<00:00:26.080> a<00:00:26.170> safe<00:00:26.439> manner<00:00:26.490> an<00:00:27.490> alcohol<00:00:27.910> can

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
use it in a safe manner an alcohol can

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.570 
use it in a safe manner an alcohol can
be<00:00:28.090> impairing<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:28.960> safety<00:00:29.349> both<00:00:29.560> because<00:00:30.460> of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
be impairing to safety both because of

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.939 
be impairing to safety both because of
still<00:00:30.789> in<00:00:30.910> your<00:00:31.029> system<00:00:31.680> so<00:00:32.680> your<00:00:32.830> blood

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
still in your system so your blood

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.119 
still in your system so your blood
alcohol<00:00:33.430> is<00:00:33.730> above<00:00:34.299> zero<00:00:34.629> for<00:00:35.559> driving<00:00:35.920> as<00:00:36.010> we

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
alcohol is above zero for driving as we

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.759 
alcohol is above zero for driving as we
know<00:00:36.250> that<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.670> limit<00:00:36.820> is<00:00:37.030> 0.05<00:00:37.809> for<00:00:38.080> aviation

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
know that the limit is 0.05 for aviation

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.759 
know that the limit is 0.05 for aviation
it's<00:00:39.159> essentially<00:00:39.760> zero<00:00:40.030> or<00:00:40.330> 0.02<00:00:40.780> which

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
it's essentially zero or 0.02 which

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.039 
it's essentially zero or 0.02 which
allows<00:00:42.129> for<00:00:42.330> cough<00:00:43.330> medicines<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:43.960> other

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:44.049 
allows for cough medicines and other

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:45.810 
allows for cough medicines and other
things<00:00:44.320> that<00:00:44.500> may<00:00:44.680> just<00:00:44.920> nudge<00:00:45.159> it<00:00:45.190> above<00:00:45.519> zero

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
things that may just nudge it above zero

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.299 
things that may just nudge it above zero
but<00:00:46.059> point<00:00:46.570> o2<00:00:46.690> is<00:00:46.960> essentially<00:00:47.470> zero<00:00:47.890> the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
but point o2 is essentially zero the

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.340 
but point o2 is essentially zero the
other<00:00:48.460> part<00:00:48.790> of<00:00:49.059> it<00:00:49.239> is<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.900> make<00:00:50.049> sure<00:00:50.229> that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
other part of it is to make sure that

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.170 
other part of it is to make sure that
there<00:00:50.530> are<00:00:50.680> no<00:00:51.010> other<00:00:51.040> adverse<00:00:51.699> effects<00:00:52.030> of

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
there are no other adverse effects of

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.149 
there are no other adverse effects of
alcohol<00:00:52.600> so<00:00:52.839> even<00:00:53.379> when<00:00:53.589> alcohol<00:00:53.769> is<00:00:53.979> out<00:00:54.129> of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
alcohol so even when alcohol is out of

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.710 
alcohol so even when alcohol is out of
your<00:00:54.280> system<00:00:54.729> you<00:00:54.940> can<00:00:55.360> still<00:00:55.600> be

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
your system you can still be

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.410 
your system you can still be
significantly<00:00:56.470> impaired<00:00:57.339> from<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.180> effects

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
significantly impaired from the effects

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.660 
significantly impaired from the effects
of<00:00:58.540> hangover<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.110> following<00:00:59.470> day<00:00:59.680> so<00:01:00.430> if

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
of hangover the following day so if

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.240 
of hangover the following day so if
somebody<00:01:01.000> has<00:01:01.119> had<00:01:01.150> a<00:01:01.299> big<00:01:01.960> night<00:01:01.989> on<00:01:02.379> alcohol

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
somebody has had a big night on alcohol

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.799 
somebody has had a big night on alcohol
then<00:01:03.460> they<00:01:03.790> probably<00:01:04.089> are<00:01:04.390> not<00:01:04.420> going<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.720> be

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
then they probably are not going to be

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.270 
then they probably are not going to be

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.630 
so codeine Xin the opiate family the
same<00:01:51.610> family<00:01:52.060> as<00:01:52.180> heroin<00:01:52.780> morphine<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:54.310> you

taking your medicine for is probably

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.089 
taking your medicine for is probably

that's<00:02:16.460> why<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> lot<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.000> packages<00:02:17.450> talk

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
that's why a lot of the packages talk

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.770 
that's why a lot of the packages talk
about<00:02:17.960> not<00:02:18.620> doing<00:02:18.800> safety<00:02:19.220> type<00:02:19.640> events<00:02:20.570> like

about not doing safety type events like
