00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
compact refinery that should be easy to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.580 
compact refinery that should be easy to
build<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.970> anybody<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.570> doesn't<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.349> them

how<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> make<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.730> refinery<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:37.110> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
how to make a refinery and this is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.880 
how to make a refinery and this is
actually<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.300> nice-sized<00:00:39.300> oil<00:00:39.989> spill<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.829> I

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
actually a nice-sized oil spill that I

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.639 
actually a nice-sized oil spill that I
found<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.600> he<00:00:42.660> goes<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
found so he goes all the way down to the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.630 
found so he goes all the way down to the
water<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:45.379> all<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.800> over<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.610> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
water and all the way over here so I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.979 
water and all the way over here so I
should<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> good<00:00:49.140> sized<00:00:49.559> amount<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.160> oil

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.930 

I'm<00:00:54.989> gonna<00:00:55.230> head<00:00:55.559> over<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> refinery<00:00:56.520> now

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I'm gonna head over to the refinery now

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.599 
I'm gonna head over to the refinery now
I<00:00:57.239> didn't<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.370> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
more cans so you can see my a quarry way

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
more cans so you can see my a quarry way
down<00:01:32.640> there<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.659> pretty<00:01:33.869> much<00:01:34.110> on

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
down there and it's pretty much on

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.510 
down there and it's pretty much on
autorun<00:01:35.780> sends<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.900> stuff<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.380> here

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
autorun sends all the stuff down here

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.370 
autorun sends all the stuff down here
where<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.850> unloaded<00:01:39.689> into<00:01:39.900> barrels<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.240> I

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
where I just unloaded into barrels and I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.340 
where I just unloaded into barrels and I
just<00:01:43.380> make<00:01:43.619> sure<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.399> stuff<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.350> not

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
just make sure that the stuff is not

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:54.800 
just make sure that the stuff is not
full<00:01:53.000> actually<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.060> should<00:01:54.240> turn<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
full actually I should turn off the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
full actually I should turn off the
quarry<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.439> that's<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:58.430> spill

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
quarry because that's going to spill

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
quarry because that's going to spill
over<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.689> probably<00:02:01.680> about<00:02:01.770> five<00:02:02.159> minutes

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
over in probably about five minutes

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.240 
over in probably about five minutes
and<00:02:03.539> I'm<00:02:04.140> doing<00:02:04.500> something<00:02:04.920> else<00:02:05.039> right<00:02:05.280> now

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
so I still got the same setup on the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.350 
so I still got the same setup on the

three combustion engines I'm pulling
water<00:02:45.840> out<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.829> same<00:02:48.110> water<00:02:49.110> source<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:49.769> I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
water out of the same water source as I

water out of the same water source as I
am<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.760> quarry<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.450> run<00:02:51.599> them<00:02:51.720> both<00:02:51.840> at

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.440 
matter and then i have this to pump oil
into<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.450> combustion<00:03:01.140> engines<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:02.239> have<00:03:03.239> this

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
into the combustion engines I have this

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.610 
into the combustion engines I have this
the<00:03:03.690> pole<00:03:03.900> oil<00:03:04.620> into<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.920> refinery<00:03:08.489> and

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the pole oil into the the refinery and

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.680 
the pole oil into the the refinery and
then<00:03:10.620> i<00:03:10.650> have<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.220> engine<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.359> pull<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:14.690> fuel

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
then i have this engine to pull the fuel

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:27.710 
then i have this engine to pull the fuel
out<00:03:16.130> into<00:03:17.130> here<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.670> i<00:03:21.030> will<00:03:23.269> actually<00:03:26.720> because

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
out into here so i will actually because

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.390 
out into here so i will actually because
I<00:03:27.959> notice<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.500> lot<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:30.049> youtubers<00:03:31.069> don't<00:03:32.069> do

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
I notice a lot of youtubers don't do

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.430 
I notice a lot of youtubers don't do
this<00:03:32.609> which<00:03:33.299> is<00:03:33.480> actually<00:03:34.340> sit<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.780> give

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
this which is actually sit back and give

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.580 
this which is actually sit back and give
people<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:38.069> good<00:03:38.870> view<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.060> will<00:03:42.389> give<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.470> a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
people a good view so I will give you a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.890 
people a good view so I will give you a
couple<00:03:43.859> second<00:03:44.430> view<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.239> pause<00:03:45.870> it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
couple second view so you can pause it

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:55.880 
couple second view so you can pause it
and<00:03:46.700> do<00:03:47.700> your<00:03:47.910> setup<00:03:53.780> okay

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
and do your setup okay

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.090 
and do your setup okay
so<00:03:56.890> now<00:03:57.040> all<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.550> do<00:03:58.350> add<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.410> whole<00:03:59.740> bunch<00:03:59.800> of

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
so now all we do add a whole bunch of

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:14.720 
so now all we do add a whole bunch of
oil<00:04:08.880> now<00:04:11.010> come<00:04:12.010> on<00:04:12.100> this<00:04:12.340> engine<00:04:13.380> which<00:04:14.380> will

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
oil now come on this engine which will

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.070 
oil now come on this engine which will
start<00:04:15.730> filling<00:04:16.090> up<00:04:16.209> this<00:04:16.390> one<00:04:18.750> turn<00:04:19.750> on<00:04:19.900> this

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
start filling up this one turn on this

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.080 
start filling up this one turn on this
one<00:04:21.780> which<00:04:22.780> will<00:04:23.130> fill<00:04:24.130> up<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.310> refinery<00:04:25.230> and

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
one which will fill up the refinery and

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:40.230 
one which will fill up the refinery and
then<00:04:28.090> turn<00:04:28.390> on<00:04:28.450> this<00:04:28.660> one<00:04:32.490> twill<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:38.850> then<00:04:39.850> set

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
then turn on this one twill and then set

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.190 
then turn on this one twill and then set
my<00:04:40.740> torches<00:04:44.790> which<00:04:45.790> will<00:04:46.000> start<00:04:46.240> up<00:04:46.450> the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
my torches which will start up the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:58.670 
my torches which will start up the
combustion<00:04:47.590> engines

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.120 

and<00:04:59.660> eventually<00:05:00.660> I'm<00:05:00.990> going<00:05:01.199> to<00:05:01.350> replace<00:05:01.800> all

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
and eventually I'm going to replace all

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.120 
and eventually I'm going to replace all
this<00:05:02.490> pipe<00:05:02.729> with<00:05:03.090> gold<00:05:03.360> pipe<00:05:03.660> because<00:05:04.500> cold

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
this pipe with gold pipe because cold

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.670 
this pipe with gold pipe because cold
pipe<00:05:05.400> can<00:05:05.669> actually<00:05:06.060> hold<00:05:06.270> more<00:05:06.630> water<00:05:06.900> than

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
pipe can actually hold more water than

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:16.910 
pipe can actually hold more water than
the<00:05:08.300> cobblestone

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:37.560 

but<00:05:17.920> i<00:05:18.010> think<00:05:18.310> i<00:05:18.460> only<00:05:18.610> got<00:05:18.930> five<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:36.570> shouldn't

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
but i think i only got five I shouldn't

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.510 
but i think i only got five I shouldn't
really<00:05:37.720> be<00:05:37.900> doing<00:05:38.260> that<00:05:38.470> right<00:05:38.770> now<00:05:39.180> but<00:05:41.520> see

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
really be doing that right now but see

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.590 
really be doing that right now but see
because<00:05:42.700> I<00:05:42.970> just<00:05:43.180> cut<00:05:43.420> off<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.600> water<00:05:45.450> but<00:05:46.450> I

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
because I just cut off the water but I

00:05:46.600 --> 00:06:11.700 
because I just cut off the water but I
think<00:05:46.840> they're<00:05:47.020> all<00:05:47.170> full<00:05:47.470> yeah

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.610 

so<00:06:12.710> as<00:06:12.860> you<00:06:12.980> can<00:06:13.220> see<00:06:13.870> got<00:06:14.870> full<00:06:15.800> oil<00:06:16.100> here<00:06:17.620> so

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
so as you can see got full oil here so

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.030 
so as you can see got full oil here so
we<00:06:19.250> just<00:06:19.280> shut<00:06:19.639> down<00:06:19.700> that<00:06:20.630> one<00:06:23.889> even<00:06:24.889> though

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
we just shut down that one even though

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.530 
we just shut down that one even though
it's<00:06:25.790> probably<00:06:26.419> it<00:06:26.930> still<00:06:27.560> pulls<00:06:27.889> oil<00:06:28.540> because

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
it's probably it still pulls oil because

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.870 
it's probably it still pulls oil because
the<00:06:29.840> the<00:06:30.320> pressure<00:06:30.590> from<00:06:30.950> the<00:06:31.190> combustion

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
the the pressure from the combustion

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.170 
the the pressure from the combustion
engines<00:06:32.450> will<00:06:33.169> still<00:06:33.530> pull<00:06:33.860> oil<00:06:34.160> into<00:06:35.000> that

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
engines will still pull oil into that

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:42.810 
engines will still pull oil into that
you<00:06:35.720> just<00:06:35.930> need<00:06:36.200> to<00:06:36.440> initially<00:06:37.250> start<00:06:37.610> it<00:06:37.760> off

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.320 

and<00:06:43.930> the<00:06:44.930> machines<00:06:45.290> they<00:06:45.680> have<00:06:45.889> enough<00:06:46.330> they

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
and the machines they have enough they

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.320 
and the machines they have enough they
they<00:06:47.930> run<00:06:48.139> off<00:06:48.320> of<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:48.620> oil<00:06:48.770> so<00:06:49.280> you<00:06:50.150> don't

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
they run off of the oil so you don't

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:57.990 
they run off of the oil so you don't
need<00:06:50.450> need<00:06:50.690> to<00:06:50.870> put<00:06:51.790> anything<00:06:52.790> in<00:06:53.120> them<00:06:55.780> and

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
need need to put anything in them and

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.129 
need need to put anything in them and
the<00:06:59.000> power<00:06:59.479> source<00:07:00.130> for<00:07:01.130> the<00:07:01.790> refinery<00:07:02.540> comes

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:03.139 
the power source for the refinery comes

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.060 
the power source for the refinery comes
from<00:07:03.410> your<00:07:03.740> combustion<00:07:04.520> engines<00:07:05.090> and<00:07:06.070> then

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
from your combustion engines and then

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.730 
from your combustion engines and then
you<00:07:07.220> to<00:07:07.340> sit<00:07:07.580> here<00:07:07.760> and<00:07:07.940> you<00:07:08.000> wait<00:07:08.870> and<00:07:08.900> you<00:07:09.110> get

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
you to sit here and you wait and you get

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.670 
you to sit here and you wait and you get
the<00:07:11.020> fuel<00:07:12.020> which<00:07:12.770> can<00:07:13.070> run<00:07:13.340> multiple<00:07:14.000> things

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
the fuel which can run multiple things

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.680 
the fuel which can run multiple things
you<00:07:15.680> can<00:07:15.860> run<00:07:16.039> combustion<00:07:16.789> engines<00:07:17.270> off<00:07:17.450> of

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
you can run combustion engines off of

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.590 
you can run combustion engines off of
the<00:07:18.020> fuel<00:07:18.289> which<00:07:18.710> is<00:07:19.430> actually<00:07:20.030> more

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
the fuel which is actually more

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.710 
the fuel which is actually more
efficient<00:07:21.169> than<00:07:21.320> the<00:07:21.380> oil
