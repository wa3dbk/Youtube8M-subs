 e adepa embroidering the analysis also with yolosa that could not change states 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.500
 and part 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.750
 of what you are and this person was doing was just that 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.040
 that aspect that I wanted to touch part of Ramadan is taking place in the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.220
 Muslim moved arch 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.070
 p in contrast to everything that is happening 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.270
 in Tripoli what reading can also be given 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.940
 to this contrast 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.800
 if they resort or believe 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.330
 this action 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.200
 within the framework of Ramadan one month 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.690
 it was sacred 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.470
 stop the islam 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.130
 and what of these 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.310
 agreement 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.090
 an action of this kind 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.500
 many muslims 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.400
 to clerics of the world spreads the expansion of this nature in a moment 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.690
 which is supposed to be sacred 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.000
 for Islam 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.170
 to the Peruvian 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.090
 the goal of NATO we believe that he was accelerated by the needs 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.000
 same 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.620
 what the hegemonic serrat powers behind this criminal action 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.800
 to give 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 without anything about libya in syria the agency of 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.500
 and achieve is the goal of pacifying, I repeat, it will not be possible to pacify Libya 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.420
 now the one 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.530
 is it so 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.130
 there is an economic bleeding also on the other hand 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.860
 on the part of europe that we can not resist long to maintain is the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.109
 new swamp 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.669
 like days moment in irak 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.289
 envy 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:19.349
 and in Afghanistan they would be three unbearable marshes 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.669
 which the economic bleeding 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:26.290
 percent and europe and the united states could not resist in moments we know of 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:32.419
 hurtful crisis large dv percent five decades our country explains 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.109
 day tend to increase 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.949
 I want to emphasize this 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.840
 the poma they are pulling on libya on irak 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.260
 about kepa pianist or other countries the africa 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.219
 and the world 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.030
 they are running by account 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.840
 of European and American citizens today until they achieve 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.740
 control those countries and take all this tape interpreters that there 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.610
 stores another point that I wanted to highlight from the economic issue in Libya the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.099
 what 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.549
 Kadhafi had done something very important many months before the invasion this 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.959
 criminal action of lota 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.359
 there were some be repatriated 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.179
 all the gold of winter had repatriated 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.619
 to libya 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.469
 he had taken it to Libya that she continues in international coffers at the bank 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.460
 international government brought back to Libya 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.850
 proposed viability dollar and currency the first Libyan dinar pole that 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.930
 would be lamont the currency that would supplant the dollar throughout the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.500
 Africa 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.969
 It was a Libyan proposal 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.829
 that is important to win 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.199
 at the time 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.559
 what libya network do repatriation of all its gold 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.629
 the proposal of the pine forest 1 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.979
 these donations of moamar the kadafi 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.629
 naturally it did not benefit the interests of Moscow and for the time being 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.350
 united and also in another topic words for the analysis of why 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.659
 these actions against Libya not only that for its 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.790
 for its pattern and the love that underlies there the largest possible reserve of the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.850
 world has libyan fossil water 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.019
 if not also of the gold that he had repatriated 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.499
 moments before the invasion just before the aggression and the proposal 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.519
 of him africa for all the rich 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.780
 of the currency 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.109
 the dinar forum 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.639
 a Libyan dinar backed in gold 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.180
 i question that we repeat we benefit from presenting the project
