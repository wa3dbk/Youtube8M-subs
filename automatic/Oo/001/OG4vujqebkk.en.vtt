 Eurosceptic populist nationalists

 right and left radicals this is alarming 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.390
 signal but still an absolute majority 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.670
 deputy mandates got 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.350
 democratic parties parties that 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.090
 defend centrist positions and 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.530
 advocate the continuation of the process 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.470
 European integration 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.590
 first of all it is conservatives and 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.840
 social democrats 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.790

 five percent of the vote 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.609
 the head of the party which in recent years 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.980
 somewhat moved away from the former Russian 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.150
 rhetoric known for advocating 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.939
 exit france 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.040
 from the European Union and NATO, the French clearly gave 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.590
 understand what they want again and decide their 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.079
 the fate themselves our people only want that 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.959
 policies that will shape 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.700
 the french and for the french if 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.709
 national front succeed 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.200
 agree with right-wing deputies 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.720
 from other countries they will be able to form 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.760
 separate fraction then they 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.450
 could get subsidies from the budget 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.760
 Parliament 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.950
 however the right populist parties from 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.349
 sweden and denmark uk already 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.859
 stated that it is not going to cooperate with 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.019
 the French National Front is not 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.359
 less success le pen is a failure of politics 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.579
 President of the Socialists Francois Hollande 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.590
 the day after the election he was 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.079
 forced to convene a crisis meeting 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.840
 very village palace in his televised address 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.889
 to the citizens of the country he promised to change 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.889
 your political course 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.930
 at the summit there and I will insist on 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.870
 volume to henceforth priorities of the European Union 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.590
 stable growth of the employment economy 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.419
 investment in great britain win 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.519
 got the right populist party 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.340
 independence of the united kingdom 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.060
 voted for it almost 28 percent 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.060
 population 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.710
 a whole army of party supporters said 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.390
 your word is the best result 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.370
 which we have seen in the last 100 years 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.650
 now at party representatives 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.560
 independence of the united kingdom 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.960
 will be in the European Parliament apparently 24th place 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.570
 it is this party that favors quitting 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.160
 UK from the EU at the same time in 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.290
 a number of countries including in 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.280
 Germany and Austria and Italy the Netherlands 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.770
 romania and poland 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.000
 ruling parties managed to keep and 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.980
 partially strengthen your positioning result 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.870
 European elections will discuss with an expert 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.900
 in touch with bonum studio head 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.920
 his daughter, whether in Brussels, Christian 3p 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.810
 mr trip in many countries 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.580
 voter support managed to enlist 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.650
 anti European parties is it possible 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.000
 say that this way they expressed 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.920
 their distrust of eu voters on 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.800
 actually expressed a vote of no confidence 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.080
 politician but this one at the bridge turned out 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.210
 rather heterogeneous need 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.100
 consider each country separately from 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.350
 one who uk for example 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.810
 voted for the ultra right party 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.540
 independence voted against 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.670
 EU feet the French who led to 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.380
 victory national front voted 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.540
 rather against political elites in 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.910
 paris against the government which is not 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.300
 solved the problem of unemployment as well 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.760
 vs 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.580
 not popular president francois holland 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.530
 no doubt all this from will affect 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.270
 Europe as a whole here in Brussels 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.280
 election results once again started 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.030
 anxious populists right and left 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.860
 sense 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.230
 will be able the next few years 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.690
 present anti European mood 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.370
 Brussels and countries shavings besides 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.200
 as already seen in france 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.990
 britain they will try 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.940
 influence the game of this national policy 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.420
 parliaments 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.100
 Opab fly away phase feat far and how 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.050
 specific election results can 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.700
 change European politics after 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.970
 this vote, the European Union will still be 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.040
 expand 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.890
 I think that amid this outbreak 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.490
 political storm pro-European forces with 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.950
 Brussels 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.810
 will work even closer together 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.770
 conservative social democrats 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.300
 liberals and greens at the same time row 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.520
 national governments will be less 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.650
 engage in European politics is 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.409
 applies to countries where populist 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.989
 the parties got real 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:47.029
 clothing as regards the reception of new countries 

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:49.669

 reforming the eurozone also 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:00.979
