00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:05.170
 with the SG unit will affect on Saturday afternoon the table second of the 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.440
 football-class as a guest at the KSG forward Dessau the home side in 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.969
 red-yellow with a win and two losses started the season 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.230
 Wittenberge - 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.990
 so far undefeated 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.029
 the guests with an offensive lineup from the beginning tried the booklet itself 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.320
 to tear 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.390
 but the HSG achieved before 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.810
 time and again straw Korsch of the balls cleverly distributed Winkler 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.929
 could only manage with a foul here 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.640
 without balls a case for the number six a stroker place exactly like 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.030
 Neumann be a dog is a competitive match made for the HSG 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.620
 the ball long on the way new entry Westendorf jumps highest and west 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.870
 the bakers goal no chance one to zero for the HSG it was the first goal 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.280
 for the 41-year-old new signing in Paris against St 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.400
 Neumarkt only with escort Westendorf with all his experience 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.560
 and the HSG tried to follow suit on please and he pulls 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.940
 Decker has him follow him 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.380
 Wittenberg with counterplay but if it went fast then it became dangerous 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.929
 but he had success before Hoffmann on the ball for the captain of Wittenberge one 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:11.939
 painful matter though 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.000
 everything compliant 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.850
 75 spectators then burned down the HSG fireworks as the followers long 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.260
 had not seen 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.760
 first the new one only the opponent 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.840
 then he failed after preliminary work by Watzke to Becker 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.159
 and then the best margin opportunity Neumann with four goals in the last 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.009
 four wanted to play the fifth 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.260
 maybe by a dormant ball 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 Straw Gold Spinnen Westendorf but at Wittenberg at the Fastende sets otherwise 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.060
 would have it here 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.240
 already for the ninth time instead of h 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.960
 and the home side kept pushing for the second goal, benefiting from the four 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.680
 Pars the Wittenberger back team straw gold fought the ball lays down 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.590
 the ball right 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.450
 but Becker without problems 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 the guests after 38 minutes again with a discharge attack Andreas 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.970
 Jäckel the player-coach moves from 22 meters 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.710
 before there are any problems and it should get worse as sg-schlussmann 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.750
 injured this turn and had to replace a short time later 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.609
 be for him 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.399
 came Ronnie Selonke 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.889
 Unimpressed by this forward Dessau ahead Jeffrey Neumann the 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:22.099
 21-year-old a meter 78 tall striker shows why he is so important to the KSG 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.510
 even if he is here 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.669
 at the end the overview is missing 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.649
 then half time was the HSG forward Dessau fourth highly deserved with one too 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.209
 zero 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.969
 In the second round, the guests meadows long long in coming the coaching team 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.519
 Crew more salary that apparently has a lot to tell their crew 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.830
 after a whistle-break, Diaz continued where she left off, though 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.169
 This cross was probably rather happy than goal shot 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.849
 After 60 minutes finally unit Wittenberg again with the fast 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.769
 Ball on or behind Vincenz Mayer March can only look behind Tobias Nowak 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.359
 with the first test for sailors 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.229
 passed 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.879
 biggest chance the HSG in passage number two missed Berkemann the 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.709
 completely free after a Strukow Stars goal narrowly missed 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.649
 but also word salaries after 65 minutes can close the bag goes full 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.649
 Risk and fails 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.169
 and so came 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.969
 what had to come a corner kick turned Dennis Fischer a 73 Ston 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.459
 Minute to 1 1 equalization no two minutes later again corner for 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.379
 Wittenberg again René Fischer and again the gate for the guests 120th 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.199
 Seconds required unit Wittenberg to turn a game by long ago 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.199
 would have three or four to zero 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.980
 the HSG put everything on a card now played with three tips a goal 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.979
 but should not fall anymore 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.689
 the age of the accused 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.730
 it just that in the javelin and so better than expected 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.189
 also won legally clear game-defining but what 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.389
 missed goal to shoot more bovine past punished that 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.999
 that has complicated the developers I have a big heart 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.829
 and we fail to close the bag in the second book, "Maybe 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.829
 the match against Hoffenheim 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.259
 normal 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.419
 the 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.269
 if spring already means a lot 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.129
 Dr 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.610
 red-red that way 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.990
 with Prof 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.420
 even more bitter is the defeat because both goalkeeper's success as 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.650
 Expression and injured next is the city derby with 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.719
 Roßlau on the program of the HSG forward 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.119
 with Merkin against did everything right in the table but one 

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:38.969
 Place down until yesterday was
