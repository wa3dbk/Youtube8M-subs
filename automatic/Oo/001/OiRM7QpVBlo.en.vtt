now<00:03:26.820> one<00:03:27.120> last<00:03:27.360> example<00:03:27.570> on<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.170> townhall<00:03:28.770> 8<00:03:28.830> so

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
now one last example on a townhall 8 so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.340 
now one last example on a townhall 8 so
now<00:03:29.880> we're<00:03:30.060> looking<00:03:30.180> at<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> town<00:03:30.720> hall<00:03:30.750> 8<00:03:30.990> this

now we're looking at a town hall 8 this
base<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.800> actually<00:03:31.980> pretty<00:03:32.460> tough<00:03:32.730> for<00:03:32.760> me<00:03:33.090> to

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
base is actually pretty tough for me to

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
strategy we just learned should not be a

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.740 
strategy we just learned should not be a
