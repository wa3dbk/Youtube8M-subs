 cantinflas 

00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.759
 and the earthquake 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.559
 and now comes to bat for the proxies 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.559
 every attempt 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
 it seems that this time Nicaraguan sank completely 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.679
 I hope to do better in the field I think it is the case how I would like to know 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:30.819
 play very well 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:31.840
 Dear friend 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.900

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.280
 we do not want that juvenile was slow to issue 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.630

 country forgive me sir christian hobbit bermudez trip 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.639
 I think he's going to steal 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:57.400
 what form of apathy 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.489
 before entering 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.389
 and there are gestha hacienda we are in England in the 17th century 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.090
 these guys practice the game together to this version of the advances 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.090
 they are never old because they used more for peace and opposition 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.659
 the boxer tried to run until the present decree luque lopez expensive 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.260
 art 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.299
 amorÃ³s that poor man must be very angry 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.730
 with the one who hit him 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.830
 I'm not angry it was wet no no we're not down I'm angry because I 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.920
 hit 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.500
 wet houston 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 it meant that he had been hit with the bull to make him a paul 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.430
 now I understand 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.460
 I'm going to tell you that I want to play give me regular permission 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.810
 this is rex 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.700
 I must explain why london games were sometimes played with two 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.210
 three or four passes 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.620
 depending on the number of players taking part 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.620
 is already looking more like baseball now c 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.070
 the fire spread the American colonies 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.399
 at the beginning and gps 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.399
 the very other game called still little 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.290
 I call him that because the young people treated their village neighbors 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:20.709
 nearby 8a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.880
 we are seeing no partners a version of the popular in ezeiza 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.389
 because the protected building 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.320
 the combo I do not know how to play like before 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.229
 that's the problem there were still no rules 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.320
 efe the fol 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.830
 that this was how he began to be called was almost always married by gentlemen 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.689
 had to appear on the scene someone who was imprisoned 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.909
 until now 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.060
 when seven years ago appeared on the scene quilmes west 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.870
 is a young man from New York named Alexander FarfÃ¡n 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.899
 It is the year of 1845 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:59.019
 these are going to be the new rules for the baseball game 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.939
 the field is going to be a perfect diamond square 90 10 bolivars the batter 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.859
 will be placed in the fourth low or the beginning 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.560
 the batter after he finished throwing the ball to the player who is in the base 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.559
 before this one but without hitting them 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:15.989
 there will only be one oscar 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.480
 if only three men out of the box called large gardens 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.409
 they included a maximum of nine players per team a new 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.959
 fadesa's position a process 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.859
 lent by team at each entrance ran into the reflections we are 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.759
 killing 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:35.989
 some of the software ideas did not last the batter was allowed to 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.439
 asked how high the ball wanted to reach the base after nine 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.869
 bad shots this tactical aspect plus the first time was done 21 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.859
 careers 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.400
 although some things have changed I think the recession and torrijos for very 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:52.900
 good part of their votes 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.050
 abc friend this annotation was overwhelming for you 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.999
 but he's right the game got better and started to be very popular 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.609
 however in 1860 most of the young people changed their payments 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.229
 a american civil war 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.829
 thus has begun 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.289
 the war even helped the game to spread 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.379
 when the soldiers was not suffocating davant els ports 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.090
 it is said that he has opened against him a union general invented the 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.939
 baseball in 1839 technician putting new york 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.959
 but as we have seen this is not very likely 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:40.159
 in 1868 a young man called country garden formed the first professional team of 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.110
 baseball in cincinatti 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.159
 It was the first time that an entire team proposes to play 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.069
 he called his team the california angels 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.330
 not dear friend the red cincinnati stockings 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.270
 the red socks and other professional teams proved that the public 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.270
 I could pay to make a bridge available 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.179
 over time the original helmet rules have made were retiring and the 

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:10.110
 team to play also improved 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.630
 for example in 1875 they began to wear gloves to protect the hands of the 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.629
 players 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:23.599
 very good 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.599
 I wish they had tried to have me in Mexico 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.900
 in 1876 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.200
 the teams from eight cities came together to form the national league 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.879
 and in 1893 the American League was born 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.550
 baseball was beginning to become the national pastime of the states 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.389
 United 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.080
 and speaking of pastime I spent time and I have to continue 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.439
 practicing 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.820
 but now as a comeback there's never happened 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.820
 the notarized vessel 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.879
 what would be called this young girl 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:00.909
 why of 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.699
 I would say that you arrived 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:03.610
