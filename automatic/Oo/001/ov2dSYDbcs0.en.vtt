00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.140
 there are very good two on youtube in the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.690
 I'll tell you how to put 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.510
 figures in the softland clan chat and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.870
 be in the clan chat or in the chat 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.190
 general web 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.890
 figures that kind of figures I mean 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.290
 good as with the program that recorded not 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.540
 I know if I think about how many plans I do not 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.030
 record the video the audio if so it is not 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.170
 it does not make good sense here in the two 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:31.540
 for example I will put 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:34.150
 so that inside and a tank is put that 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.580
 is exactly what happens in the clan 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.510
 soft client for example other than in the 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.110
 client client chat for example 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.570
 another one that I have is I put apple what 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.570
 enter and you put the apple apple 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.239
 I think the pf if made from someone else 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.640
 original and authentic and you put this but 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.930
 the original and authentic and as a code 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.789
 of bars and says is verified by 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.649
 facebook, well, this is also another 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.449
 thing that is put I will not open the clan 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.600
 blowers because as I said no 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.090
 I can the figurines but in short 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.030
 well let's look for the figures we 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.789
 let's go to safari now if it serves with 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.350
 any search engine with google if with 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.539
 I do not remember this but for example 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.759
 chrome and all that yes but I'm going to 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.820
 that family that is the default I'm going 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.300
 to put 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.490
 this 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.490
 I the principle that figures 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.030
 symbols here is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.970
 the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.000
 and good thing is that I'm good at what they are 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.620
 This one is figures made with symbols 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.900
 taringa 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.900
 it's a taringa blog 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 here's how many easy there are many 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.870
 good for example also very figures 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.830
 big no 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.870
 do not 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.340
 you can not put for example this 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.820
 tree this other can not or can not 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.820
 that this yes 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.630
 for example this can be put that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.630
 It said ipod I'm ready anyway 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.190
 this video I already had my channel but 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.930
 Now I'm going to do it 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.540
 recording the plant with the air since it 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.430
 sees a lot better if what and if it gets worse 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.140
 the screen of the lake and well here what 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.020
 we have for example this tank will 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.400
 we leave pressed we put him good 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.400
 we select everything that is the tank 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.939
 do not 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.880
 here back we have the tank 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.290
 selected we give you in copy and a 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.730
 Once we have copied we 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.730
 let's go to settings 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.910
 then we're going to 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.490
 keyboard 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.270
 and here on the keyboard where it says 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.550
 quick functions here quick functions 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.550
 well here you can put 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.780
 for example 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.579
 the one that I have here of known pq pq 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.579
 it is because 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.180
 like for example so that plants me 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.670
 I just write an 11 and put one 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.730
 wave an antidote troops level 4 and 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.319
 dark troops and good to not have 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.730
 that writing all that once and for all 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.730
 time and again then well 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.310
 where is for example me here and I have 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.930
 here the one of tank that can see it but 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.860
 well let's create another quick function 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.450
 in phrase we leave pressed we give in 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.880
 paste and the tank will automatically 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.140
 turn off and here in quick function I'm going to 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.980
 put 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.980
 well I have but I will put 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.300
 and so 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.389
 irving 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.230
 but it's coming off a bit of the 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.230
 school that today 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:28.060
 a man was and here I will continue 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.800
 and we have to say only that here 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.380
 it's also that he does not know how to lower the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.740
 little thing is that blue and good thing here 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.740
 I'll put 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.160
 irving as intro 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.810
 and here is a way that I know 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.729
 use no tricks or hacks there is no 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.960
 jailbreak there is no room there is nothing 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.259
 that's just this 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.580
 and I think it's good they can put 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.280
 a lot of things true for example I 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.870
 I have to one of gat 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.210
 this is funny because when they write 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.280
 something looks like that, it's a cross between all 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.700
 the of these words phrases and all that 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.080
 they cross and this is father this but 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.280
 Well, I hope you have served them and 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.280
 until the next and back
