00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.880
 hi friends so today I'm going 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.599
 show you how to look 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.940
 videos for the shows especially 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.890
 programs in French is that the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.780
 emissions on tf1 m6 etc 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.030
 so when you know 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.300
 people who live outside the 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.750
 france can not visualize 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.150
 videos 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.189
 these videos 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.710
 it's forbidden I 'm not why 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.250
 so I'm going to show you a tip 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.079
 How to solve this problem 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.250
 so first of all i'm going to go on 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.420
 google chrome 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:47.980
 yes I will go to go to the site that 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:51.850
 will allow me then to recover a 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.180
 French ip address then I'm going to m 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.440
 after the site link on the part 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.420
 description so when you see here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.580
 ip address then what an ip address 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 French then 95 x 121 points 63 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.680
 passes in 44 and the port is 80 then 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.430
 I will go now on mozilla 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.960
 firefox 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.950
 so it's easier to set up 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.640
 personally I have not tried on 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.619
 google chrome os on internet explorer 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.270
 so I advise you to do the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:34.140
 configuration on moselle not a force 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.140
 so I'm going to go on tools options 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.670
 then there is the general English data 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.460
 networks etc so I'm going to go on 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.190
 English network then settings 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.080
 so here we see you parameters of 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.290
 connection then the configuration of the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.560
 proxy server to access the internet 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.500
 so by default it's not proxy 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.710
 so I'm going to pick a cheat 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.050
 of proxy offer I'm going to pick 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.580
 manual configuration of proxim then 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.130
 I have already done the configuration 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:15.450
 so in I'm going to make a cop is copied 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:21.720
 this ip address copy 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:26.190
 yes here I will paste this address 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:32.430
 so yes port 80 here there were 80 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.989
 but here we do 80 I click ok and I 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.709
 click ok then we did the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.640
 configure an ip address 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:44.280
 French then lost there is a small 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.069
 disadvantage is that after doing 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:53.730
 the configuration the connection is going 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.569
 of mine then I'm going to click and a 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.019
 other times on tools then on options 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:07.079
 yes in settings i'm going to click on 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:11.129
 no proxy ok ok I'm going now 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:14.299
 also go for example tf1 point fr and 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.299
 finally point fr 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.900
 so 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.490
 this is the official site of tf1 point fr 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.630
 so I'm going for example 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.140
 click on the link that will us 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.840
 allow access to the secret premium 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.800
 story 7 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.230
 so I'm going to click see it back 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.750
 we will sell please so it's just a 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.820
 example you can even click on 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:56.400
 other shows or movies and christians 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:04:02.060
 so I'm going to choose a god life a 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.060
 example the premium of June 7, 2013 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.750
 the loan of June 7, 2013 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.750
 so I click on relay 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.360
 so for people the people who 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.870
 do not live in France so here is the 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.170
 result 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:24.840
 so when you see here sorry sorry 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.610
 video that is valid from your country 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.180
 so for people who do not live 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.790
 in France they do not have the possibility 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.620
 done forbidden I do not know why they 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.160
 do not have the opportunity to watch 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.730
 videos put on channel sites 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.160
 French is that tf1 m6 etc 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.930
 so we go after doing the 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.180
 proxy server configuration we are going 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:53.010
 go back to tools options then 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.850

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.430
 settings 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.240
 so we already did the configuration 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.490
 manual 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.270
