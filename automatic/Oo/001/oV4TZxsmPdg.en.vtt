00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.660
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.700
 podcast follow this a free tv today 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.370
 it's about the astrophotography again 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.160
 go specifically around the moon we want 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.480
 Today the mouth part thematize like 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.310
 we can do the moon the best 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.590
 program because you know it 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.170
 maybe in normal mode with the 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.820
 Camera then you really know what 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.100
 the look the sky and one holds 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.259
 Outsmart mouth here an example 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.210
 you can see a little longer , too 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.640
 from fashion jewelry and not at all 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.440
 moon completely outshines the sky 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.540
 even very dark 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.460
 but of course we want to keep the mouth shut 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.720
 Report much better and want 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.119
 islam deal what we do here 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.000
 just before this picture was very good 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.950
 recognizable also the moon corona that is 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.009
 such a left-handed appearance the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.789
 bending and refraction of the light 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.700
 is caused by the whole 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.020
 The particles of course in brightness 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 float and here at another 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.789
 For example, where do you see that very well? 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.009
 whole even more enhanced with beautiful 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.030
 Just rainbow colors on it 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.890
 Pay attention to the mouth is not just 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.810
 light gray but we have more often 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.610
 also to a header deduction degree too 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.050
 the happy area with it 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.610
 Of course that is also very good 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.069
 Taking pictures is also a very nice thing 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.020
 possibilities to represent differently 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.670
 but we now want only times so 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.550
 We deal with the moon in general 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.220
 You can take a better picture of it 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.990
 Of course, I'm getting much better at it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.440
 manual mode in manual mode 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.970
 because in the automatic camera points the camera 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.770
 by not just wanting to list 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.450
 The sky is extremely dark and me 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.740
 I have a small bright disc 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.290
 that is very clear that they are natural 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.120
 thinking overlooked because the camera itself 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.190
 essential to the pain business 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.260
 concentrated and we need at the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.150
 moon photography a very short 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.760
 The moon's exposure time will be natural 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.680
 extremely he illuminated by the sun 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.780
 gets a lot of light off you can 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.600
 yes even during the dog seen in the sky 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.980
 here also on this example one 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.020
 very nice opportunity in connection 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.110
 just pull off the land with the clouds 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.610
 Programming everyone knows enough on the day 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.320
 by short exposure time and thus 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.810
 the courage of the day sees clearly that 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.940
 all the more that we also do it at night when it is 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.210
 dark is only short exposure times 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.780
 need around the moon very nice 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.050
 to represent that one the structures 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.970
 recognizes in the mouth he is so bright receives 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.090
 the whole environment with if it 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.100
 is dark and that means we even 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.080
 not necessarily attractive 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.510
 is and is recommended of course it is 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.270
 better but it is not even mandatory 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.670
 required on this example the picture 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.080
 which I always want to discuss briefly there 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.950
 I have an exposure time of 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.230
 a 250 chelsea base was in the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.630
 deepest night an exposure time the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.620
 you're almost out of it 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.090
 can reach 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.379
 the turn was in the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.000
 Of course I can laugh too 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.440
 I can still open the 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.349
 further shorten exposure time 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.629
 it can be somewhat uplifting with iso 200 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.960
 So even with a low iso 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.720
 area that means I need here 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.400
 Report very briefly and then I get 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.900
 the structures are very well captured 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.170
 Of course, best with one 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.680
 telephoto lens that I like the moon very much 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.380
 ground 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.930
 Of course I can also use the computer 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:05.780
 Of course, that does not mean the same 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.220
 Filling up on the picture but getting through 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.630
 a cut in the post-processing 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.890
 you can achieve that very well so the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.270
 moon is not always too bright to illuminate 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.450
 make sure that he is great 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.310
 The product looks like here 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.590
 it from the camera, the photo it works 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.730
 very blue and gray but I have exactly 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.360
 here are the possibilities of processing 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.250
 with hubert curve a few corrections 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.710
 perform and there very nice the 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.480
 to bring out structures for 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.650
 here at this example how it still is 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.590
 even finished looks 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.670
 you can already see the craters it has to 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.560
 not only the full moon 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.310
 It is also possible to be photographed 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.590
 very good 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.060
 Just a half moon degree to the 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.460
 You can then country at the straight 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.590
 then really nice contours 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.810
 recognize because that is no longer of the 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.970
 side a field 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.770
 the topic of the moon 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.290
 photography if you liked it 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.910
 Can you follow the marks and 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.590
 subscribe to this channel there is 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.480
 soon to follow with the next 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.370
 let yourself be surprised and until then 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.370
 nice time and nice mode
