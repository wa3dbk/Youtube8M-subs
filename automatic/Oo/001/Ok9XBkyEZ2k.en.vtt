which<00:03:52.930> worked<00:03:53.140> very<00:03:53.440> well<00:03:53.580> but<00:03:54.580> in<00:03:54.970> some<00:03:55.480> cases

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
which worked very well but in some cases

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.990 
which worked very well but in some cases
could<00:03:56.170> give<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.650> trouble<00:03:57.010> replacing<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.820> bit

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
could give you trouble replacing the bit

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.080 
could give you trouble replacing the bit
so<00:03:58.780> we<00:03:59.050> turn<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.560> maker<00:03:59.890> slide<00:04:00.190> around<00:04:00.310> bolted

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
so we turn the maker slide around bolted

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.350 
so we turn the maker slide around bolted
it<00:04:01.210> directly<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.930> x-axis<00:04:02.440> plate<00:04:02.710> and

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
it directly to the x-axis plate and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.870 
it directly to the x-axis plate and
mounted<00:04:04.360> this<00:04:04.950> spindle<00:04:05.950> mount<00:04:06.220> plate<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.790> the

mounted this spindle mount plate to the

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.660 
we've replaced the mild steel ma
threaded<00:04:36.670> rod<00:04:36.850> with<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.690> stainless<00:04:38.350> steel<00:04:38.670> ma

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
threaded rod with a stainless steel ma

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.190 
threaded rod with a stainless steel ma
threaded<00:04:40.150> rod<00:04:40.620> which<00:04:41.620> is<00:04:41.650> stronger<00:04:42.370> and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
threaded rod which is stronger and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.909 
threaded rod which is stronger and
straighter<00:04:44.200> than<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.920> mild<00:04:45.130> steel<00:04:47.220> version

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
straighter than the mild steel version

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.629 
straighter than the mild steel version
all-in-all<00:04:49.759> I<00:04:50.000> think<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.840> design<00:04:51.199> is

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
all-in-all I think the design is

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.020 
all-in-all I think the design is
stronger<00:04:52.639> more<00:04:53.210> expandable<00:04:54.639> easier<00:04:55.639> to

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
stronger more expandable easier to

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:07.190 
stronger more expandable easier to
assemble<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:57.280> let's<00:04:58.280> be<00:04:58.430> honest<00:04:58.729> better<00:04:59.539> look

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.379
