00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.969
 hello friends of the channel of stopped a point 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.000
 It is welcome to a new video we are going 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.150
 to teach these type lighters 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.700
 blowtorch called turbo flame that we 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 they supply the Scottish brand 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:28.259
 we have highlanders in green 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.239
 olive and in black are lighters that 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.399
 They have a rubber coating 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.000
 dollars with a rubber growth 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.550
 very resistant they wear a hood 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 also rubber to protect what 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.450
 is the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.230
 if they have a lock button on the 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.670
 call to avoid that we have to be 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.970
 holding this when we have to do 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.890
 long-term cigarette lighters 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.900
 enough capacity about 20 minutes of 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.930
 Total start time with a deposit 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.330
 quite large and that has been tested 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.930
 in altitude conditions of 3,000 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.750
 meters 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.300
 produces a very fine flame that ends 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.909
 on the needle they call it called type 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.810
 laser and 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.549
 good that lighters that good apart from 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.579
 ignite fire are a tool 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.009
 excellent for the workshop for tasks 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.149
 that we may need is additional in 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.549
 those that we may need fire 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.850
 Mental cast metal drilling 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.799
 to cut and you have to use ropes 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.270
 a very versatile tool very 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.750
 very useful practice 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.400
 and at a very reasonable price 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.320
 then let's try one of 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.720
 they are going to do a test fusing 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.190
 lead that I believe demonstrates that the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.190
 power calls him from 1,300 degrees 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.190
 centigrade is very very interesting yes 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.190
 but 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.260
 good as I said we are going to make a 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.460
 small test run for 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.640
 that you see the power of the flame 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.000
 melting then some lead 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.710
 let's use some pens 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.110
 carbine of four and a half 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.730
 let's put a handful here 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.459
 in this in this brick 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.100
 and let's heat them with the lighter 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.490
 so you can see how they melt 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.260
 and they are grouped into a single drop of lead 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.560
 and so you can observe the power of 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.560
 lighter 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.800
 see what the treatment is 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.800
 righ now 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.140
 molten 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.140
 the meeting is 1,300 degrees which is 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.390
 very hot at the end where 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.390
 easily you already know 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.580
 fix as easily we're going 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.040
 getting 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.060
 melting the loins we heat up a 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 little more to be cleaned 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.740
 and we are grouping the drops is used 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.020
 a rod can actually be 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.020
 anything other than six charges 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.010
 we have done it now completely 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.010
 molten 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.450
 as the flame is so fine to those who 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.280
 so narrow point has 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.340
 this is not at the maximum power level of 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.080
 cigarette lighter do not fix that allows 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.610
 also this very accurate work 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.900
 would even allow to be a speaker of 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.920
 this year has a deft little as 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.530
 it's a flame that ends 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.800
 and the tremendously small here you have 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.230
 they threw me a lighter remember that the 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.900
 the flame of what they speak works in 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.519
 any position 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.519
 but that will be called 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.510
 now 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.629
 and automatically a tool 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.430
 excellent you can find it in cheap 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.129
 one point is thank you very much for 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.569
 visit us and for sharing our 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.870
 videos a greeting 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.870
 see you later
