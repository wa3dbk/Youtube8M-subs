approach<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.549> many<00:01:23.759> mechanical<00:01:24.299> keyboards

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
approach of many mechanical keyboards

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.260 
approach of many mechanical keyboards
one<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> biggest<00:01:26.430> reasons<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:26.880> getting<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
one of the biggest reasons for getting a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.760 
one of the biggest reasons for getting a
mechanical<00:01:27.780> keyboard<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> typing

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
mechanical keyboard is the typing

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.819 
mechanical keyboard is the typing
experience<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.270> first<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.829> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
experience so that's first up the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
experience so that's first up the
keyboard<00:01:32.040> uses<00:01:32.640> kale<00:01:32.909> yellow<00:01:33.360> switches<00:01:33.810> which

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
keyboard uses kale yellow switches which

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
keyboard uses kale yellow switches which
are<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.439> equivalent<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.920> Cherry<00:01:35.159> MX<00:01:35.250> blacks

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
are the equivalent of Cherry MX blacks

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
are the equivalent of Cherry MX blacks
so<00:01:36.570> there<00:01:36.750> are<00:01:36.900> more<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.229> linear<00:01:37.560> switch

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so there are more of a linear switch

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.640 
so there are more of a linear switch
with<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> moderate<00:01:38.579> actuation<00:01:39.210> force<00:01:39.650> however

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
with a moderate actuation force however

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.499 
with a moderate actuation force however
I<00:01:40.890> found<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> switches<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.909> feel<00:01:42.060> more<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
I found the switches to feel more like a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.960 
I found the switches to feel more like a
mid<00:01:42.810> ground<00:01:42.990> between<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.950> Cherry<00:01:44.220> MX<00:01:44.310> light

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
mid ground between the Cherry MX light

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.139 
mid ground between the Cherry MX light
of<00:01:45.149> Reds<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.409> Cherry<00:01:46.649> MX<00:01:46.740> blacks<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
of Reds and the Cherry MX blacks so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.730 
of Reds and the Cherry MX blacks so
they're<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> bit<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> Midway<00:01:49.079> which<00:01:49.320> might<00:01:49.560> be

they're a bit of a Midway which might be

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.740 
they're a bit of a Midway which might be
in<00:01:49.860> part<00:01:50.220> due<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.850> low<00:01:51.060> profile<00:01:51.479> key

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

so I have mixed thoughts in this
conclusion<00:04:39.990> as<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.860> think<00:04:41.490> they're<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.850> pure<00:04:42.120> KX

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
conclusion as I think they're a pure KX

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.090 
conclusion as I think they're a pure KX
is<00:04:42.690> definitely<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.169> really<00:04:43.350> strong<00:04:43.770> product

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
is definitely a really strong product

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.220 
is definitely a really strong product
it's<00:04:44.430> got<00:04:44.580> some<00:04:44.850> compelling<00:04:45.389> value<00:04:45.720> and

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
it's got some compelling value and

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.040 
it's got some compelling value and
really<00:04:47.160> good<00:04:47.430> features<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.330> it's<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.630> that's<00:04:48.900> a

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
really good features and it's a that's a

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.540 
really good features and it's a that's a
pretty<00:04:49.200> nice<00:04:49.380> keyboard<00:04:49.889> all<00:04:50.040> in<00:04:50.190> all<00:04:50.310> but

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
pretty nice keyboard all in all but

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.150 
pretty nice keyboard all in all but
there's<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.480> few<00:04:51.750> little<00:04:51.960> bits<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.560> bobs<00:04:52.800> here

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
there's a few little bits and bobs here

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.010 
there's a few little bits and bobs here
and<00:04:53.310> there<00:04:53.460> which<00:04:53.730> just<00:04:54.000> make<00:04:54.389> me<00:04:54.600> not<00:04:54.810> really

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
and there which just make me not really

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.320 
and there which just make me not really
be<00:04:55.230> able<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.440> love<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.860> one<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.910> big<00:04:57.120> ones

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
be able to love it one of the big ones

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.960 
be able to love it one of the big ones
is<00:04:57.510> definitely<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.020> switch<00:04:58.350> choice<00:04:58.970> because

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
is definitely the switch choice because

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.469 
is definitely the switch choice because
I<00:05:00.060> like<00:05:00.240> cherry<00:05:00.630> MX<00:05:00.930> blues<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:02.479> unfortunately

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
I like cherry MX blues and unfortunately

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.390 
I like cherry MX blues and unfortunately
this<00:05:03.630> only<00:05:03.870> comes<00:05:04.320> in<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.530> cable<00:05:05.070> yellow

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
this only comes in the cable yellow

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.860 
this only comes in the cable yellow
switches<00:05:06.030> which<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:06.510> a<00:05:06.540> bit<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.810> a

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
switches which is a bit of a

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.770 
switches which is a bit of a
deal-breaker<00:05:07.139> for<00:05:07.530> me<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:08.010> end<00:05:08.479> so<00:05:09.479> I

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
deal-breaker for me in the end so I

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.360 
deal-breaker for me in the end so I
would<00:05:10.290> feel<00:05:10.470> free<00:05:10.650> recommending<00:05:11.250> this

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
would feel free recommending this

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.920 
would feel free recommending this
keyboard<00:05:11.610> for<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.030> travel<00:05:12.389> keyboard<00:05:12.810> or

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150 
someone who likes linear switches but I
don't<00:05:15.389> think<00:05:15.630> it<00:05:15.720> will<00:05:15.840> be<00:05:15.990> staying<00:05:16.380> as<00:05:16.650> my

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
don't think it will be staying as my
