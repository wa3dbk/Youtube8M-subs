like<00:00:21.410> all<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.680> other<00:00:21.830> games<00:00:22.100> you<00:00:22.820> build<00:00:23.119> your

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
like all the other games you build your

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.790 
like all the other games you build your
defense<00:00:23.600> from<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:23.960> bottom<00:00:24.320> of<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:24.590> screen

defense from the bottom of the screen
and<00:00:25.039> out<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:26.660> start<00:00:26.960> out<00:00:27.109> with<00:00:27.289> one<00:00:27.560> little

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
and out you start out with one little

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.650 
and out you start out with one little
command<00:00:28.130> post<00:00:28.400> in<00:00:28.609> space<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.180> you<00:00:29.390> can<00:00:29.510> only

and<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.699> splitter<00:00:59.210> which<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.690> just<00:00:59.960> kind<00:01:00.229> of

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
and a splitter which I just kind of

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.310 
and a splitter which I just kind of
thought<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.559> as<00:01:00.830> a<00:01:00.860> sniper<00:01:01.280> as<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:02.720> expand

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
thought of as a sniper as you expand

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.590 
thought of as a sniper as you expand
your<00:01:03.589> base<00:01:03.799> we<00:01:04.100> will<00:01:04.309> expend<00:01:04.820> more<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.420> more

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
your base we will expend more and more

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.749 
your base we will expend more and more
energy<00:01:06.020> you'll<00:01:06.619> just<00:01:06.890> have<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.189> remember<00:01:07.430> to

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
energy you'll just have to remember to

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.639 
energy you'll just have to remember to
build<00:01:07.939> plenty<00:01:08.390> of<00:01:08.509> solar<00:01:08.780> panels<00:01:09.079> to<00:01:09.439> keep

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
build plenty of solar panels to keep

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.980 
build plenty of solar panels to keep
your<00:01:09.859> guns<00:01:10.039> from<00:01:10.280> shutting<00:01:10.700> down<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.810> can

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
your guns from shutting down you can

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.139 
your guns from shutting down you can
also<00:01:12.140> build<00:01:12.530> maintenance<00:01:13.189> droids<00:01:13.579> that<00:01:13.909> fix

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
also build maintenance droids that fix

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.779 
also build maintenance droids that fix
any<00:01:14.390> towers<00:01:14.840> within<00:01:15.109> reach<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:15.789> protective

any towers within reach and protective
shield<00:01:17.030> structures<00:01:17.630> which<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.380> will<00:01:18.530> be

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
shield structures which you will be

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.700 
shield structures which you will be
building<00:01:19.070> plenty<00:01:19.759> of<00:01:20.140> just<00:01:21.140> about<00:01:21.289> every

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
building plenty of just about every

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.380 
building plenty of just about every
structure<00:01:22.039> can<00:01:22.340> be<00:01:22.369> upgraded<00:01:22.609> to<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.119> more

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
structure can be upgraded to a more

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.810 
structure can be upgraded to a more
powerful<00:01:23.600> form<00:01:24.170> there<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.189> a<00:01:25.219> lot<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.549> the

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
powerful form there is a lot to the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.279 
powerful form there is a lot to the
heads-up<00:01:26.179> display<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.929> different

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
asteroids and the game doesn't really

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.300 
asteroids and the game doesn't really
teach<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.479> about<00:01:29.600> them<00:01:29.990> luckily<00:01:30.890> there's<00:01:31.219> a

anything<00:01:35.200> at<00:01:36.200> first<00:01:36.469> the<00:01:36.649> game<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:36.979> lot<00:01:37.159> of

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
anything at first the game is a lot of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.249 
anything at first the game is a lot of
fun<00:01:37.490> as<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:38.030> expand<00:01:38.420> your<00:01:38.509> face<00:01:38.719> and<00:01:38.929> balance

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
fun as you expand your face and balance

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.319 
fun as you expand your face and balance
you're<00:01:39.409> upgrading<00:01:39.909> eventually<00:01:40.909> you'll<00:01:41.149> have

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
you're upgrading eventually you'll have

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.419 
you're upgrading eventually you'll have
your<00:01:41.479> great<00:01:41.780> big<00:01:41.990> death<00:01:42.289> station<00:01:42.829> completed

your great big death station completed

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:44.590 
your great big death station completed
and<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.609> game<00:01:43.939> becomes<00:01:44.270> without

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
and the game becomes without

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.440 
and the game becomes without
