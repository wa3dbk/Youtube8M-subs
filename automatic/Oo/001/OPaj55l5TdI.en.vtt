00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.949 
about six dollars please correct me if
I'm<00:03:26.100> wrong<00:03:26.160> but<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:27.030> one<00:03:27.209> was<00:03:27.450> only<00:03:27.780> ten

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.720 
I'm wrong but this one was only ten
dollars<00:03:28.319> so<00:03:28.560> i<00:03:28.590> think<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.280> was<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> much

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730
