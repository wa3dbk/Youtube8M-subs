00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.600 
family so that's why than that so
they're<00:02:25.560> gonna<00:02:25.650> be<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.830> bit<00:02:25.950> quieter<00:02:26.459> than

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
they're gonna be a bit quieter than

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.400 
they're gonna be a bit quieter than
normal<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.930> test<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:30.629> I'm<00:02:30.750> coming<00:02:31.049> back

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
just puts all power to the system so

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.009 
just puts all power to the system so
effectively<00:03:20.280> functions<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:20.910> same<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.420> an

this one here or the b10 disabled the

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.259 
this one here or the b10 disabled the
heat<00:03:42.720> detector<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.680> then<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.310> one<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:45.209> the

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
heat detector and then the one on the

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.770 
heat detector and then the one on the
very<00:03:45.450> left<00:03:46.310> disabled<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.669> pull<00:03:47.880> station<00:03:48.450> so

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
very left disabled the pull station so

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.559 
very left disabled the pull station so
that's<00:03:49.769> my<00:03:50.549> control<00:03:50.970> panel<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:51.660> far<00:03:51.690> now<00:03:52.530> and

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
that's my control panel so far now and

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.030 
that's my control panel so far now and
again<00:03:54.569> if<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.079> remember<00:03:55.769> from<00:03:55.859> our<00:03:55.980> previous

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
again if you remember from our previous

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.309 
again if you remember from our previous
videos<00:03:57.919> the<00:03:58.919> heat<00:03:59.819> detector<00:04:00.239> doesn't<00:04:00.419> let<00:04:00.660> to

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
videos the heat detector doesn't let to

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.530 
videos the heat detector doesn't let to
fill<00:04:01.500> amount<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.859> current<00:04:02.250> through<00:04:02.549> so<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
fill amount of current through so the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.150 
fill amount of current through so the
consequence<00:04:04.109> of<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> sound<00:04:04.889> it<00:04:05.130> is

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
consequence of that is the sound it is

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.979 
consequence of that is the sound it is
slightly<00:04:05.489> quieter<00:04:05.819> than<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.359> poll<00:04:06.540> station

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
slightly quieter than the poll station

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:07.970 
slightly quieter than the poll station
tunnel<00:04:07.230> test<00:04:07.470> which<00:04:07.680> weenie

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
tunnel test which weenie

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.059 
tunnel test which weenie
trigger<00:04:08.819> system<00:04:09.180> with<00:04:09.450> them<00:04:09.629> means<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.530> also

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
trigger system with them means and also

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.309 
trigger system with them means and also
the<00:04:11.879> strobe<00:04:12.209> isn't<00:04:12.510> flash<00:04:12.719> and<00:04:12.959> again<00:04:13.140> that's

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
the strobe isn't flash and again that's

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.730 
the strobe isn't flash and again that's
due<00:04:13.530> to

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
due to

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.680 
due to
the<00:04:13.860> fact<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.520> heat<00:04:15.000> detector<00:04:15.510> doesn't

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
the fact that the heat detector doesn't

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.510 
the fact that the heat detector doesn't
let<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.990> proper<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.530> might<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.100> current

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
let the proper I might have current

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.930 
let the proper I might have current
through<00:04:17.760> when<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.750> addition<00:04:19.020> to<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.940> I've

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
through when in addition to that I've

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.510 
through when in addition to that I've
kind<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.270> lost<00:04:21.510> my<00:04:21.690> relay<00:04:22.620> for<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:22.980> noobs<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:23.490> I

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
kind of lost my relay for the noobs so I

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.480 
kind of lost my relay for the noobs so I
had<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.880> sort<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.120> just<00:04:24.300> why<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.860> conventional

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
had to sort of just why the conventional

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.440 
had to sort of just why the conventional
way<00:04:26.610> in<00:04:26.760> like<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> series<00:04:27.630> loop<00:04:27.870> anyway<00:04:29.450> I'm

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
way in like a series loop anyway I'm

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.260 
way in like a series loop anyway I'm
gonna<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:30.840> start<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.290> system<00:04:31.560> test<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:33.090> I

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
gonna now start the system test and I

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.140 
gonna now start the system test and I
shall<00:04:33.450> start<00:04:33.780> with<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.800> heat<00:04:35.070> detector<00:04:41.150> okay

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
shall start with the heat detector okay

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.870 
shall start with the heat detector okay
so<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.420> can<00:04:42.540> see<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.810> two<00:04:43.250> LED<00:04:44.250> lights<00:04:44.520> are<00:04:44.850> on

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
so you can see the two LED lights are on

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.930 
so you can see the two LED lights are on
and<00:04:45.240> as<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:46.680> can<00:04:46.770> probably<00:04:46.830> tell<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.640> sound

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and as you can probably tell the sound

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.960 
and as you can probably tell the sound
it<00:04:48.210> isn't<00:04:48.510> as<00:04:48.630> loud<00:04:48.780> as<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:48.990> when<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:49.830> tested<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:50.910> a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
it isn't as loud as a when I tested it a

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.850 
it isn't as loud as a when I tested it a
minute<00:04:51.300> ago<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.810> strobe<00:04:52.110> isn't<00:04:52.350> flashing

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
minute ago and a strobe isn't flashing

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.210 
minute ago and a strobe isn't flashing
that's<00:04:53.580> due<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.240> fact<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:55.070> it's<00:04:56.070> not

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
that's due to the fact that it's not

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.540 
that's due to the fact that it's not
letting<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.790> lot<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.150> current<00:04:57.540> through<00:04:58.550> anyway

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
letting a lot of current through anyway

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.200 
letting a lot of current through anyway
I'm<00:05:00.180> gonna<00:05:00.390> disable<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:01.110> heat<00:05:01.440> detector<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:02.970> we

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
I'm gonna disable a heat detector and we

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.580 
I'm gonna disable a heat detector and we
enable<00:05:03.660> it<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.780> beYOU<00:05:04.230> set<00:05:04.440> it<00:05:04.670> and<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:07.230> next

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
enable it to beYOU set it and the next

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.440 
enable it to beYOU set it and the next
thing<00:05:07.740> I'm<00:05:07.830> gonna<00:05:08.010> test<00:05:08.630> it's<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:09.720> test<00:05:09.750> switch

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
thing I'm gonna test it's a test switch

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.910 
thing I'm gonna test it's a test switch
as<00:05:12.450> you<00:05:12.660> can<00:05:12.810> tell<00:05:12.960> it's<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.140> little<00:05:13.320> bit<00:05:13.680> louder

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
as you can tell it's a little bit louder

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.020 
as you can tell it's a little bit louder
now<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.220> piezo<00:05:14.580> is<00:05:14.880> plus<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:17.160> strobe<00:05:17.730> is

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
now the piezo is plus the strobe is

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:25.129 
now the piezo is plus the strobe is
flashing

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.170 

so<00:05:26.139> just<00:05:27.300> reset<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.389> tests<00:05:28.780> which<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:30.180> shall

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
so just reset the tests which I shall

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.820 
so just reset the tests which I shall
now<00:05:31.240> go<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:32.229> pull<00:05:33.039> the<00:05:33.550> mine<00:05:34.000> notifier

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
now go to and pull the mine notifier

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:51.059 
now go to and pull the mine notifier
nbg<00:05:35.830> 10<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:37.030> here<00:05:37.210> goes

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:56.890 

okay<00:05:52.750> so<00:05:54.699> now<00:05:55.699> I<00:05:55.729> shall<00:05:56.210> demonstrate<00:05:56.449> the

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
okay so now I shall demonstrate the

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.559 
okay so now I shall demonstrate the
silence<00:05:57.379> which<00:05:57.710> I've<00:05:58.009> just<00:05:58.120> showed<00:05:59.120> that<00:05:59.360> you

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
silence which I've just showed that you

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.159 
silence which I've just showed that you
will<00:05:59.720> see<00:05:59.960> the<00:06:00.139> strobe<00:06:00.440> is<00:06:00.590> still<00:06:00.800> flashing

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
will see the strobe is still flashing

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.779 
will see the strobe is still flashing
but<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.319> switch<00:06:03.590> has<00:06:03.710> been<00:06:03.740> thrown<00:06:04.340> only<00:06:04.669> the

a dual port I apologize if this videos
getting<00:06:31.789> a<00:06:32.180> bit<00:06:32.870> long<00:06:33.080> and<00:06:33.650> it's<00:06:33.830> just

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
getting a bit long and it's just

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.709 
getting a bit long and it's just
normally<00:06:35.840> I<00:06:36.699> would<00:06:37.699> find<00:06:37.969> planet<00:06:38.360> in<00:06:38.599> the

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
normally I would find planet in the

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.290 
normally I would find planet in the
balance<00:06:39.050> but<00:06:39.400> its<00:06:40.400> first<00:06:40.580> video<00:06:40.969> in<00:06:41.210> a<00:06:41.270> long

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
balance but its first video in a long

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.070 
balance but its first video in a long
time

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
time

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.129 
time
and<00:06:42.830> it's<00:06:43.069> probably<00:06:43.310> running<00:06:43.960> right<00:06:44.960> now<00:06:45.110> I

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
and it's probably running right now I

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.559 
and it's probably running right now I
guess<00:06:45.409> about<00:06:45.650> maybe<00:06:46.099> six<00:06:46.400> and<00:06:46.580> a<00:06:46.610> half<00:06:46.639> seven

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:47.569 
guess about maybe six and a half seven

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:53.230 
guess about maybe six and a half seven
minutes<00:06:47.990> so<00:06:49.509> the<00:06:50.509> pool<00:06:50.659> station<00:06:51.050> is<00:06:51.139> beset<00:06:52.240> and

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
minutes so the pool station is beset and

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.360 
minutes so the pool station is beset and
then<00:06:56.560> once<00:06:57.560> again<00:06:57.740> to<00:06:58.159> show<00:06:58.370> you<00:06:58.430> that<00:06:58.990> this

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
then once again to show you that this

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.279 
then once again to show you that this
these<00:07:01.370> switches<00:07:01.849> worked<00:07:02.210> just<00:07:02.599> just<00:07:03.020> ranae

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
these switches worked just just ranae

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.860 
these switches worked just just ranae
below<00:07:03.620> and<00:07:05.469> sounder<00:07:06.580> I'm<00:07:07.580> gonna<00:07:07.849> pull<00:07:08.599> up<00:07:08.630> all

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
below and sounder I'm gonna pull up all

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:15.100 
below and sounder I'm gonna pull up all
station<00:07:09.440> again<00:07:11.949> and<00:07:13.360> then<00:07:14.360> this<00:07:14.509> table<00:07:14.870> up<00:07:14.960> all

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
station again and then this table up all

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.749 
station again and then this table up all
station<00:07:16.990> then<00:07:17.990> we're<00:07:18.199> gonna<00:07:18.520> set<00:07:19.520> off<00:07:19.639> the

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 
station then we're gonna set off the

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:26.579 
station then we're gonna set off the
heat<00:07:20.000> detector<00:07:20.509> once<00:07:20.750> again

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:26.589 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:32.320 

and<00:07:27.589> then<00:07:27.830> disable<00:07:28.129> that<00:07:28.459> too<00:07:31.029> and<00:07:32.029> then

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
and then disable that too and then

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.929 
and then disable that too and then
finally<00:07:33.080> I'm<00:07:33.649> gonna<00:07:33.919> trigger<00:07:34.219> the<00:07:34.339> external

00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:34.939 
finally I'm gonna trigger the external

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:39.779 
finally I'm gonna trigger the external
relay<00:07:35.179> with<00:07:35.389> my<00:07:35.569> external<00:07:35.990> mount<00:07:37.599> and<00:07:38.599> again

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:39.789 
relay with my external mount and again

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:46.029 
relay with my external mount and again
disable<00:07:40.789> the<00:07:40.849> external<00:07:41.389> relay<00:07:43.509> finally<00:07:45.039> click

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 
disable the external relay finally click

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:47.829 
disable the external relay finally click
