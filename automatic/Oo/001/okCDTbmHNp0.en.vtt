00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 probably more used to each other 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.280
 teams probably all the same field is not 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.710
 more mated and called after the halftime 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.630
 I already think that in the end they beat 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.100
 Spartak and heavy fields before the weather 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.830
 my daughter therefore probably many were sweating but 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.200
 In principle, I think that 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.080
 even say the first half and each other but 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.960
 sighted parties there already greenhouses 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.360
 attila all hands we did our job 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.000
 It seemed the right time and place you need 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.800
 maybe what the first break 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.559
 mechanically work we earned therefore 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.379
 managed to write down and swords actually 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.440
 it will be hard already that no one 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.070
 80 it was necessary to us quite difficult 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.680
 It was to recoup in such a game 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.260
 insulting the fact that two of our mail missed 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.100
 or say with Spartak your accounts to 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.729
 already twice 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.659
 beat by 40 today needed was important 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:05.560
 it was to be and let's say under continue 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:07.660
 this season on major want from 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.690
 teams congratulate all women with 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.640
 March 8 holiday everyone who is associated with 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.160
 football fans of Krasnodar 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.679
 Spartak his family 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.990
 but we don't see yet congratulated well 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.210
 a gift a gift turned out making 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.280
 small so we will not be cunning. 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.810
 today we are much stronger 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.289
 than sport griffith 3 sport does that mean 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.210
 three points we needed this winnings we 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.560
 knew that it would be hard for the first half 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.180
 ended 00 only and all. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.619
 maybe this is just a coincidence not 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.710
 only me but the whole team played very 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.890
 play well against strong greats 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.360
 teams we always stay say so 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.030
 thoroughly attacking is always hard 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.759
 when you go one on one with the goalkeeper I 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.000
 looked only at the goalkeeper I did not look 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.000
 on both sides
