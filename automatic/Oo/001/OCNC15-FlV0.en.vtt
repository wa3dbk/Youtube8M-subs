00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
browse for our samples I can load a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.220 
browse for our samples I can load a
sampling<00:02:51.739> just<00:02:51.800> off<00:02:52.250> my<00:02:52.940> desktop<00:02:53.480> and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
sampling just off my desktop and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.650 
sampling just off my desktop and
basically<00:02:54.860> we<00:02:54.980> have<00:02:55.190> four<00:02:55.489> banks<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.120> four

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
basically we have four banks of four

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.560 
basically we have four banks of four
sounds<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.350> total<00:02:57.769> 16<00:02:58.250> seconds<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:02.030> we

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.300 

what<00:03:46.890> we<00:03:46.980> can<00:03:47.160> do<00:03:47.310> now<00:03:47.460> is<00:03:47.490> we<00:03:47.700> compute<00:03:48.030> pots

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
what we can do now is we compute pots

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.340 
what we can do now is we compute pots
keep<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.430> clap<00:03:50.640> going<00:03:50.970> or<00:03:51.540> now<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:51.960> can<00:03:52.200> kind

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
keep the clap going or now we can kind

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.730 
keep the clap going or now we can kind
of<00:03:52.500> roll<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.900> then<00:03:58.020> introduce<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.500> pots

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
of roll it and then introduce the pots

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:06.860 
of roll it and then introduce the pots
again<00:03:59.390> get<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.480> snare<00:04:00.720> back<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:05.750> but<00:04:06.750> then

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
again get the snare back in but then

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:15.849 
again get the snare back in but then
what<00:04:07.020> we<00:04:07.080> can<00:04:07.230> also<00:04:07.380> do<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.770> start<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.130> pitch<00:04:08.340> it
