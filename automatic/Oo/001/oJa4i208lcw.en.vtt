00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
the end of the cooking for me I prefer

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.979 
the end of the cooking for me I prefer
it<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.670> be<00:02:30.940> softer<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.480> little<00:02:31.750> while<00:02:31.870> right

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
it to be softer a little while right

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.050 
it to be softer a little while right
okay<00:02:32.470> that's<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.980> thick<00:02:33.220> caramel<00:02:33.370> sauce<00:02:33.850> and

okay that's a thick caramel sauce and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.640 
okay that's a thick caramel sauce and
the<00:02:34.120> reason<00:02:34.450> why<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.660> burns<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.260> because<00:02:35.500> it's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the reason why it burns is because it's

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.080 
the reason why it burns is because it's
got<00:02:35.769> quite<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.980> bit<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.220> sugar<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.760> yeah
