loading a new magazine in game the m16
is<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.490> three<00:01:32.700> round<00:01:32.850> burst<00:01:33.170> which<00:01:34.170> makes<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
is a three round burst which makes it

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.810 
is a three round burst which makes it
pretty<00:01:35.759> slow<00:01:36.000> at<00:01:36.270> 450<00:01:36.960> rounds<00:01:37.079> per<00:01:37.409> minute<00:01:37.820> but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
pretty slow at 450 rounds per minute but

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.319 
pretty slow at 450 rounds per minute but
the<00:01:39.630> advantage<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.710> three<00:01:41.070> brown<00:01:41.670> vs.<00:01:42.090> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the advantage of the three brown vs. is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 
the advantage of the three brown vs. is
the<00:01:42.360> low<00:01:42.659> recoil<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> fast<00:01:44.040> sense

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the low recoil and the in the fast sense

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.510 
the low recoil and the in the fast sense
really<00:01:44.549> helps<00:01:44.850> keep<00:01:45.030> keep<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> gun<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:45.930> target

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
really helps keep keep the gun on target

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.800 
really helps keep keep the gun on target
magazine<00:01:47.520> size<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.970> pretty<00:01:48.119> average<00:01:48.299> at<00:01:48.600> 30

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
magazine size is pretty average at 30

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.980 
magazine size is pretty average at 30
rounds<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:50.549> overall<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.270> real<00:01:51.689> powerful

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
rounds so overall it's a real powerful

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.740 
rounds so overall it's a real powerful
gun<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:53.189> accurate<00:01:53.610> considering<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> three

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
gun very accurate considering the three

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
gun very accurate considering the three
round<00:01:54.990> bursts<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.909> opinion<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.390> probably

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
round bursts in my opinion is probably

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810 
round bursts in my opinion is probably
not<00:01:57.930> best<00:01:58.290> suited<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> new<00:01:59.579> player

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
not best suited to the to the new player

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.249 
not best suited to the to the new player
even<00:02:00.240> though<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.509> part<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
even though it's part of one of the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.140 
even though it's part of one of the
classes<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.630> simply<00:02:03.630> because

shots on-target hardin pro helps with
the<00:03:02.780> reduced<00:03:03.080> flinch<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:03.710> in<00:03:04.640> firefights

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
the reduced flinch so in firefights

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.470

so<00:03:32.930> my<00:03:33.140> three<00:03:33.820> attachment<00:03:34.820> recommendations

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
so my three attachment recommendations

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.850 
so my three attachment recommendations
start<00:03:36.530> with<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.760> red<00:03:37.940> dot<00:03:38.120> sight<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.770> mean<00:03:39.770> the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
start with the red dot sight I mean the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.380 
start with the red dot sight I mean the
I'm<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.250> iron<00:03:40.400> sights<00:03:40.670> are<00:03:40.790> pretty<00:03:40.820> good<00:03:41.120> on

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
I'm the iron sights are pretty good on

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.430 
I'm the iron sights are pretty good on
the<00:03:41.570> m16<00:03:42.320> but<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:43.209> mean<00:03:44.209> this<00:03:44.330> this<00:03:44.630> weapon<00:03:45.230> you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
the m16 but I mean this this weapon you

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.830 
the m16 but I mean this this weapon you
looking<00:03:46.040> at<00:03:46.160> taking<00:03:46.580> more<00:03:47.239> of<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.420> long-range

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
looking at taking more of a long-range

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.020 
looking at taking more of a long-range
approach<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.680> red<00:03:48.830> dot<00:03:49.040> sight<00:03:49.280> gives<00:03:49.940> you

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
approach the red dot sight gives you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.240 
approach the red dot sight gives you
that<00:03:50.209> increased<00:03:50.989> accurate<00:03:51.500> accuracy<00:03:52.160> at

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
that increased accurate accuracy at
