horsepower freaks and what what is this
crazy<00:00:16.590> contraption<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.430> got<00:00:17.490> here<00:00:17.760> John<00:00:18.260> we

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
crazy contraption you got here John we

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.010 
crazy contraption you got here John we
had<00:00:19.529> our<00:00:19.830> fabricator<00:00:20.640> build<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.390> jig<00:00:21.720> that

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
had our fabricator build up a jig that

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.009 
had our fabricator build up a jig that
would<00:00:22.109> basically<00:00:22.230> allow<00:00:22.890> us<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:24.029> test

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
would basically allow us to test

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.650 
would basically allow us to test
clutches<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.250> are<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.519> into<00:00:26.699> SMG<00:00:27.390> cars

clutches that are going into SMG cars
which<00:00:27.960> normally<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.039> able<00:00:29.250> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
which normally we would not be able to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.350 
which normally we would not be able to
test<00:00:29.820> at<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:31.800> know<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> lot<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.640> lot<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
test at all you know a lot of a lot of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.350 
test at all you know a lot of a lot of
determining<00:00:33.960> whether<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.530> clutch<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.550> quote

just bad the clutch feels spongy
anything<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.219> built<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.640> jig

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
anything like that so we built this jig

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.750 
anything like that so we built this jig
with<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> simple<00:01:00.660> clutch<00:01:01.350> slave<00:01:01.829> slave

that actually allows us to feel what the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.630 
that actually allows us to feel what the
pedal<00:01:11.490> feels<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.290> now<00:01:13.290> I've<00:01:14.159> heard<00:01:14.400> about

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
pedal feels like now I've heard about

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.410 
pedal feels like now I've heard about
the<00:01:14.850> SMGs<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.840> sinking<00:01:16.470> often<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.420> when

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the SMGs not sinking often and when

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.440 
the SMGs not sinking often and when
you're<00:01:18.570> using<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.439> gt1<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.580> program<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you're using the gt1 to program it and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.399 
you're using the gt1 to program it and
with<00:01:22.439> our<00:01:22.590> clutches<00:01:22.890> being<00:01:23.810> extra<00:01:24.810> stiff<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
with our clutches being extra stiff to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.140 
with our clutches being extra stiff to

hold back 800-plus wheel horsepower in a
single<00:01:30.479> disc<00:01:30.630> clutch<00:01:31.280> now<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.700> were<00:01:32.790> telling

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
single disc clutch now you were telling

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.340 
single disc clutch now you were telling
me<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:33.450> were<00:01:33.540> some<00:01:33.720> issues<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.320> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
me that there were some issues with that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
me that there were some issues with that
sometimes<00:01:34.979> yeah<00:01:35.700> when<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> first<00:01:36.270> install

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
sometimes yeah when you first install

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.319 
sometimes yeah when you first install
the<00:01:36.900> clutch<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.650> depending<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.549> how<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the clutch it's depending on how you

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.530 
the clutch it's depending on how you
install<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.540> basically

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
install it what the what basically

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.899 
install it what the what basically
torquing<00:01:43.170> pattern<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.310> clutch<00:01:44.579> may

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
torquing pattern you have the clutch may

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.450 
torquing pattern you have the clutch may
not<00:01:45.149> set<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:45.990> correctly<00:01:46.229> when<00:01:47.220> we

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
not set in there correctly when we

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
not set in there correctly when we
install<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.930> we're<00:01:49.079> actually<00:01:49.229> able<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
install this and we're actually able to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.060 
install this and we're actually able to
manually<00:01:50.490> push<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.470> basically<00:01:52.470> every<00:01:52.590> time

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
manually push it in basically every time

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.039 
manually push it in basically every time
you<00:01:53.280> disengage<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.000> aintree<00:01:54.600> engage<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
you disengage your aintree engage the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.630 
you disengage your aintree engage the
clutch<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.880> resets<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.469> speak<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.100> resets

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
clutch it resets it so to speak a resets

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.649 
clutch it resets it so to speak a resets
it<00:01:59.820> allows<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.540> distant

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
it allows the distant

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.230 
it allows the distant
exactly<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:02.799> lines<00:02:03.039> up<00:02:03.340> correctly<00:02:03.819> so<00:02:04.090> much

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
exactly so it lines up correctly so much

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.989 
exactly so it lines up correctly so much
food<00:02:04.679> so<00:02:05.679> this<00:02:05.890> is<00:02:06.039> what<00:02:06.189> we<00:02:06.369> do<00:02:06.549> every<00:02:06.789> time

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
food so this is what we do every time

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.869 
food so this is what we do every time
before<00:02:07.509> we<00:02:08.069> put<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.190> clutch<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.640> car

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
before we put the clutch in the car

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.190 
before we put the clutch in the car
because<00:02:10.149> as<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.569> can<00:02:10.599> see<00:02:10.720> with<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.019> motor

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
because as you can see with the motor

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.440 
because as you can see with the motor
out<00:02:11.290> it's<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:11.739> easy<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.489> look<00:02:13.030> all<00:02:13.209> this<00:02:13.390> up

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
out it's really easy to look all this up

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.190
