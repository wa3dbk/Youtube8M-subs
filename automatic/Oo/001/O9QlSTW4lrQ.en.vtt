00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 and then everyone banfield sniper is that the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.000
 welcome to the channel 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.189
 The first thing I did on bs-4 was 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 play multiplayer and meet the rifles 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.280
 bar chan 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.240
 The rifle that creates the most play was 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.740
 f3 in 98 b which was the only one with giving the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.570
 maximum of 95 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.730
 to my surprise to give this 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.670
 unfortunately put the normal comb of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.330
 11 shots as it is in reality and now 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.330
 the bug will catch 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.899
 comb change is just one of the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.510
 several changes of the bs-4 practically 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.839
 all weapons had modifications as 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.960
 changes in shooting speed by 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.360
 minute we call rpm to 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.979
 changes were also made to the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.680
 in shots by the hip force of coi 798 bravo 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.259
 is an American risk belongs to the family 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.170
 Berti who is one of the most respected in 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.990
 world use ammunition point 338 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.149
 flea magno famous for its precision and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.080
 energy conservation to long 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.289
 distances 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.380
 doing jus 4 as an rifle that has the 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.289
 greater effective reach equal to three thousand 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.289
 two hundred and fifty meters and the largest 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.789
 velocity of the projectile that is equal to 650 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.280
 meters per second 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.310
 among the main changes from f3 to 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.250
 the f4 have a moment's thigh up 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.780
 in the first shot equal to 5 against only 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.220
 21 of f 3 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.640
 decrease in shots per minute rpm of 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.550
 46.2 for only 40 and as we have already said 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.830
 comb increase to 10 shots 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.129
 maximum capacity for 11 shots against 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.310
 six in the old bf3 in golf practice 

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:09.950
 of 4 rifle and 98 b still too good 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.650
 for all kinds of snape or aggressive snap 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.629
 as I departing from the goal and 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.819
 also for those in Libya as it is in 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.099
 real life that is camouflaged the long 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.819
 distance exporting and killing 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.599
 enemies with scopes of 12 41 like a 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.150
 boss 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.220
 I greatly appreciate this kind of dynamics of 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.280
 Real life , but I just want to go up. 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.250
 pulling try network shot or scopino 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.319
 Sculpture and if everything goes wrong, draw more 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.790
 and twist because in this 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.420
 situation, face to face with the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.340
 enemy 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.620
 You missed the first shot of the bar. 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.440
 chan there, just cheering to second the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.900
 operate a great advantage of e 98 b 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.360
 and that makes me play a lot with him here in the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.350
 Four neighborhood light is the substance to 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.510
 at least 150 meters or up to 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.030
 this distance of 150 meters 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.140
 the shot will produce 1 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:06.430
 greater damage than rifles such as sv 98m 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.310
 40 5 why both have both 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.010
 which neither received 28 in 45 both 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.890
 have a minimum of 100 meters 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.650
 and this can make a lot of difference to 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.220
 one pound when they do not hit network shot 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 then they are 50 meters more than the one in 98 b 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.870
 has more damage is accurately 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.920
 aggressive but uses excuses to 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.160
 long distances as from 7 x 8 12 to 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.070
 20 x 4 now has 20 b as well as 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.110
 40 This rip can be very good on my 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.120
 opinion he does not know it 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.100
 Sorry guys, in my opinion, he's just 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.750
 it's not cool if you play with socks 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.220
 averages of 13 points 4 or 4 jun because the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.040
 in 1988 b 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.170
 the smallest dream rpm at shots per minute 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.580
 between riffs boteco chan 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.980
 so if you play with these girls 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.280
 the best riff for you is that 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.360
 which has high rpm and a larger comb can 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.510
 help too 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.890
 already for the levels as in real life 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.329
 camouflaged over long distances 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.549
 this rich and certainly is one of the 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.010
 due to the effective substance 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.430
 excellent to largest available and a drop 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.060
 or the drop is the fall of the bullet 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.850
 the reasonable dropping at 9.80 and a 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.620
 meters per second squared in meters 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.380
 per square second corresponds to 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.169
 acceleration unit for you to have a 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.580
 levels with lower drop than the 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:36.100
 drop of the projectile are fy11 js and sr 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.550
 error scoring at six meters per second 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.370
 squared the greatest or the worst blow neither 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.380
 of books beckham ac in mexico 4 mar 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.720
 with 15 meters per second or quadrato 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.110
 these champions are elite scout and the 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:55.240
 traditional sp-98 buriti drop kings 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.460
 in 98 b has been my main rival until 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.940
 because I do not have one of them and so I 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.860
 I have her most beautiful and 96 until the end of 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.040
 I hope the year I can buy a 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.140
 new console and then yes you bf award 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.300
 it's all guns on the front 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.530
 making a comparison between all 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.810
 chan book books
