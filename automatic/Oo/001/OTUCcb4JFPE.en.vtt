00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.160 
use the item to get through the door
again<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.700> kind<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.030> complicated<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.990> let's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
again it's kind of complicated but let's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.530 
again it's kind of complicated but let's
show<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> build<00:02:07.890> their<00:02:08.360> first<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
show you have to build their first of

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.330 
show you have to build their first of
all<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:10.050> want<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.320> build<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.590> door<00:02:10.830> structure

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
all you want to build the door structure

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.900 
all you want to build the door structure
so<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.820> that<00:02:12.180> you'll<00:02:12.510> actually<00:02:12.540> see<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.910> you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so it that you'll actually see and you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.250 
so it that you'll actually see and you
just<00:02:15.060> want<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.240> follow<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.600> instructions<00:02:16.110> on

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
just want to follow the instructions on

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.160 
just want to follow the instructions on
screen<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:17.340> pretty<00:02:17.550> simple<00:02:17.820> if<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.810> are<00:02:19.110> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
screen it's pretty simple if you are a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.870 
screen it's pretty simple if you are a
bit<00:02:19.620> stuff<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.100> pause<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> video<00:02:20.550> at<00:02:20.790> any

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
bit stuff just pause the video at any

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.440 
bit stuff just pause the video at any
moment<00:02:21.980> next<00:02:22.980> put<00:02:23.220> some<00:02:23.370> redstone<00:02:23.550> down<00:02:24.030> under

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
moment next put some redstone down under

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.090 
moment next put some redstone down under
pressure<00:02:24.720> plates<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.320> like<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.710> picture

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
pressure plates just like in the picture

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.350 
pressure plates just like in the picture
you<00:02:26.250> don't<00:02:26.460> need<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.790> anything<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.240> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
you don't need to do anything to the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.250 
you don't need to do anything to the
repeaters<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.680> place<00:02:28.980> them<00:02:29.100> down<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.080> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
repeaters just place them down so the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.990 
repeaters just place them down so the
next<00:02:31.440> bit<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.830> little<00:02:32.100> confusing<00:02:32.520> but<00:02:32.730> follow

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
next bit so little confusing but follow

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.700 
next bit so little confusing but follow
the<00:02:33.180> pictures<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.780> should<00:02:33.990> be<00:02:34.020> fine<00:02:34.170> in

dispenser under the sticky pistons that

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.400 
dispenser under the sticky pistons that
we're<00:03:01.770> using<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.400> activate<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.510> door<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.930> in

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
we're using to activate the door and in

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.199 
we're using to activate the door and in
it<00:03:04.560> put<00:03:04.739> whatever<00:03:04.950> item<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.850> cleared

earlier or whatever item you're testing

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.070 
earlier or whatever item you're testing
for<00:03:08.070> then<00:03:08.640> all<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.880> need<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.300> repeater<00:03:09.660> with

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
for then all you need is a repeater with

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.199 
for then all you need is a repeater with
no<00:03:10.350> tix<00:03:10.650> added<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.940> piece<00:03:12.180> of

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
no tix added to it and a piece of

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.920 
no tix added to it and a piece of
redstone<00:03:13.070> this<00:03:14.070> part<00:03:14.310> activates<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> door<00:03:15.270> so

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
redstone this part activates the door so

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.720 
redstone this part activates the door so
just<00:03:16.470> follow<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.860> pictures<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.520> there's

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
just follow the pictures because there's

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:25.250 
just follow the pictures because there's
not<00:03:17.820> really<00:03:18.000> much<00:03:18.209> me<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.630> explain<00:03:18.930> here

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.380 

finally<00:03:26.260> up<00:03:26.439> the<00:03:26.650> reset<00:03:27.040> switch<00:03:27.400> which<00:03:28.209> is

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
finally up the reset switch which is

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.569 
finally up the reset switch which is
just<00:03:28.599> a<00:03:28.750> case<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.170> button<00:03:29.409> a<00:03:29.769> bit<00:03:30.040> redstone

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
just a case of a button a bit redstone

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.750 
just a case of a button a bit redstone
and<00:03:30.610> repeater<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.510> you're<00:03:32.319> done<00:03:32.610> so<00:03:33.610> there

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
and repeater and you're done so there

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.569 
and repeater and you're done so there
you<00:03:33.849> go<00:03:33.909> a<00:03:34.239> simple<00:03:34.659> 2<00:03:35.200> by<00:03:35.409> 2<00:03:35.470> item<00:03:36.010> filtered<00:03:36.430> or

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
you go a simple 2 by 2 item filtered or

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.399 
you go a simple 2 by 2 item filtered or
which<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.150> great<00:03:37.390> for<00:03:37.420> use<00:03:37.629> in<00:03:37.750> adventure<00:03:38.230> maps

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
which is great for use in adventure maps

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.009 
which is great for use in adventure maps
since<00:03:38.980> its<00:03:39.310> able<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:39.700> work<00:03:39.819> with<00:03:40.090> items<00:03:40.780> with

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
since its able to work with items with
