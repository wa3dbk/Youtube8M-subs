00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.060
 Losers driven Â«users we want to give you today the iphone app of the Bauhof 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.999
 and Jumbo introduces Kessler to Doom 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:12.119
 it can be downloaded for free on the iPhone and is just 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.149
 ten comma 6 MB in size 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.480
 so a little German language should be available is unfortunately nothing 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.970
 you have to live with it but then you get beaten quite well the acceptance 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.880
 is meant for example task 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.720
 or events in a project to numbers or in a group 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.779
 In addition one loads the field players the app 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.170
 the selling price 4 and can then send each other percent tasks 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.520
 and we will demonstrate this to you now as I am 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.190
 just connected with questions about that and database of me too 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.230
 already so the percent look forward to new iPhone 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.569
 then I can tell you with Sky Blue 

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.890
 they say yes then I just do that 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.960
 and the task it has taken on can of course do it 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.980
 and if we did that, we just say that here 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.660
 a hook and then this is pushed into the list of all the fat tasks 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.130
 on the other hand, of course, there is a task to send questions to 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.329
 for example too 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.820
 the task as a text to speak while saying that it is actually only in 

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:14.090
 Gescher 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.590
 Spoken the neck by year, the teams are wise 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.530
 German team will be represented as I do not recognize it that's why we do 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.650
 Now just have a normal sex and close 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.280
 and we have the conference over again 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.290
 22 Now staple and can now firstly select the list this sets 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.340
 By default you can of course create new lists 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.200
 but we are here now saying the customs office Fabian can be sent 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.540
 By the way, in the year also the email address or the phone number one 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.400
 or select from the address book 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.990
 Pingen is my friend the proposal and send it over 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.380
 and of course he can decide now if he says yes the Malchow 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.960
 or I do not do that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.980
 In addition one has the way also the possibility if one percent on the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.460
 Task clicks to open sunshine chart history 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.259
 and there, for example, we could still make ends meet or none 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.570
 Ask a question, he said that he does not have time 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.369
 and here then accept that and so here they will be 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.069
 reply 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.090
 by pushing again on the pace and then you have - and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.959
 In addition, a little joke made really nice 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.259
 you can turn left up here 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:31.699
 Sort the tasks indulgently unread or after completion 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.869
 and as you can see is to get 10 on the message rows and asks if that 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.869
 maybe one day you can move that can of course accept 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.709
 by more millions of this little red own 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.040
 where the 1 is in there 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.340
 there are all current news displayed would you see 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.679
 also notified by push notifications 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.569
 if you have the course set 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.729
 so suffers nothing with the conference on the 22 Swen so you would have the first 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.029
 move 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:01.900
 and up 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.019
 Because of this reason, Lucia, who was just lying down with her, had arrived 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.309
 Year that collects had done and thus postponed 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:13.149
 and then it is good that way in the settings itself there is still one 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:14.719
 few options 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:15.979
 and you can go here 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.179
 for example, change in the background 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:23.669
 Whatever before by looking at the par wallpapers which looks like 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.759
 You could stay above standard if you do not value that much 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.119
 Overall, the End the Dispute logo is free 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.119
 and is certainly well suited for projects 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.019
 and just a nice 11 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.290
 brought from the sinking which is really well done and so much fun 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.179
 the project work and 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:46.479
 the limited sole task to Euro
