00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
a disappointment there but as compared

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.700 
a disappointment there but as compared
to<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> nexus<00:01:32.310> 5<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> update<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.320> also

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to the nexus 5 it is it update and also

it will have a tenant p HD screen set up

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.190 
it will have a tenant p HD screen set up
the<00:01:38.549> speculation<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.240> far<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.990> could

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the speculation so far is that it could

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.140 
the speculation so far is that it could
sport<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.650> huge<00:01:40.920> screen<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> side<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
sport a huge screen on the side of the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510 
sport a huge screen on the side of the
phablet<00:01:42.689> range<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.530> apparently<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:43.979> won't

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
phablet range but apparently that won't

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.840 
phablet range but apparently that won't
be<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.939> quad<00:01:45.350> HD<00:01:46.350> panel<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.520> won't<00:01:47.759> be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
be a quad HD panel which we won't be

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.929 
be a quad HD panel which we won't be
missing<00:01:48.030> much<00:01:48.210> anyway<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.100> also<00:01:50.250> between
