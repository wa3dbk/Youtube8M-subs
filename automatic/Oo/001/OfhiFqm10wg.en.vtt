00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.630
 to prepare the transparent gelatin 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.970
 let's occupy essence you can 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.270
 use the essence of your preference the one 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.820
 I have here is pineapple flavor too 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.970
 we will occupy a cup of sugar but 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.310
 you can add more or less sugar 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.909
 that depends on you how sweet 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 they want it we will also occupy a pinch 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:33.630
 of citric acid we will take half a cup 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.480
 of cold water this is going to be to hydrate 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.940
 the grenetina 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.290
 we will also occupy 4 tablespoons of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.620
 grenetine that is pork based 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.940
 last let's occupy 1 liter of water yo 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.400
 I recommend that the water be 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.739
 purified so that in this way the 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.530
 result of its transparency is still 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.210
 better they can use too and we're going to 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.110
 start by bringing to heat to fire 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.030
 half a liter of water and then we go 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.330
 to start by adding the ingredients 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.530
 let's add the citric acid 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.530
 we will only occupy a pinch 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.930
 we add the sugar 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.130
 and we are also going to add the flavoring 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.440
 you are going to add the amount that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.790
 you like me I will add 3 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.140
 spoonfuls but you can 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.140
 add more or less 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.740
 and we are going to dissolve it 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.490
 we're going to let the water boil 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.590
 completely we're just going to leave it 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.720
 that hot very well is that the water 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.439
 already warmed up completely we're going to 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.439
 turn off the fire 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.229
 Many times I have been asked if the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.869
 Citric acid is important for 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.469
 transparent gelatin citric acid 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.409
 helps to enhance the taste of the flavoring 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.539
 I only recommend but if you do not 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.509
 you still find you can 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.489
 prepare the transparent gelatin if not 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.229
 they find citric acid that's not going to 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.140
 affect the transparency of your gelatin 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.090
 what is important is to use 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.590
 pork grenetina to obtain the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.590
 transparency of gelatin 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.290
 then we will hydrate the grenetina 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.650
 with 4 tablespoons in half a cup of water 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.650
 cool 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.470
 and we are going to dissolve it very well with a 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.970
 fork 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.970
 until there are no lumps left 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.260
 then we're going to let her hydrate 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.959
 for that you can leave it to a 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.910
 side and wait about 10 minutes but for 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.459
 make this process faster what I 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.160
 I do, I 'm going to take it to refrigerate 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.620
 for about 3 to 4 minutes until the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.930
 grenetina is put as well as fluffed 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.510
 after three minutes we will remove 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.400
 the grenetina of the refrigerator and it's going to 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.160
 be this consistency to dissolve the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.630
 great esteem with hot water and let's 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.319
 to stir very well until we do not 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.319
 lumps are left 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.290
 with a teaspoon can remove the 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.870
 excess of foam if they were joined 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.870
 a lot of foam and here we go 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.820
 let cool for about 20 minutes and a 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.380
 once it has cooled a little and 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.600
 then you can pass it to your mold 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.600
 cups glasses or where they will occupy 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.560
 and that's it, that's how my 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.770
 transparent gelatins I pass them 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.990
 some cups can be used for the 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.300
 artistic gelatin or to encapsulate 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.030
 fruit or for anything else from your 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.530
 preference and this is the result as 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.530
 can see it was super transparent 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.220
 I hope you liked this recipe 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.110
 of the transparent gelatin any 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.100
 doubt or question please leave it to me 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.170
 the comments 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.540
 I thank you very much for seeing my 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.810
 videos and see you until next time 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.810
 goodbye
