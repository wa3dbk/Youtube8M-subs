00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.980
 hi girls today I you 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.699
 shows how to make a mask for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.980
 acne and for oily skin white 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.610
 of egg reduces the excess of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.100
 sebum by reducing pore size 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.400
 the lemon as for him cleared up and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.440
 exfoliates it ideal for not only 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.860
 nor can it reduce the effects of 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.710
 age sunspots as well as the 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.960
 unequal theme the combination of the two 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.960
 ingredients can create a mask 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.880
 perfect for acne is to fight 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.360
 the program I show you 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:50.309
 So here we go to do this 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.550
 mask for acne and oily skin 1 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.980
 we are going to need nine and one 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.780
 half lemon see that it's very 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.420
 economic 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:06.899
 so it will first have to start with 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:10.039
 separate the white from the yellow and we will 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.039
 keep that white 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.440
 here 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:02:11.250
 so let's start by beating this 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:02:14.220
 white until samoussas when 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.250
 you get a creamy lather like 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.880
 this you can then added the half 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.270
 lemon 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.250
 so I 've already pressed it to 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.760
 keep only the juice and remove the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:33.720
 pulp 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:36.019
 so I had the eat of 2006 too and I 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.019
 rebounds 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.440
 here you have now your 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:13.290
 preparation for acne and skin 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:14.390
 greasy and that's it you can apply the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.580
 mask on the face 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.200
 while trying to avoid the 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.690
 eye contour and the contour of the 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.519
 mouth ie the places where the 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.950
 skin is more so the more delicate 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.840
 drier 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.110
 then let you rest the mask 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.430
 for about 30 minutes before 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.049
 rinse with warm water gently 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.760
 next you can add a cream 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:44.489
 moisturizing is finished the lead over the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.500
