so last year I was robbing a Holden it's
a<00:02:13.290> little<00:02:13.680> bit<00:02:13.799> difference<00:02:14.129> in<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.489> way<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
a little bit difference in the way the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.539 
a little bit difference in the way the
handles<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> got<00:02:16.709> used<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.069> obviously

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
handles but I got used to it obviously

it was a really hot day so track was I
was<00:02:20.790> changing<00:02:21.150> part<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.440> end

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
was changing part of it but at the end

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.770 
was changing part of it but at the end
we<00:02:22.739> got<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> good<00:02:23.430> lap<00:02:23.610> time<00:02:23.849> in<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.629> I'm

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
we got a good lap time in you know I'm

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.750 
we got a good lap time in you know I'm
getting<00:02:25.560> back<00:02:25.709> up<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.890> speed<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.340> these<00:02:26.489> cars

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
getting back up to speed with these cars

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.819 
getting back up to speed with these cars
and<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.420> very<00:02:27.930> very<00:02:28.140> different<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.590> Indy

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
and it's very very different to the Indy

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.640 
and it's very very different to the Indy
cars<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:30.540> all<00:02:30.690> about<00:02:30.750> getting<00:02:31.349> back<00:02:31.620> up

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
cars so it's all about getting back up

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.550 
cars so it's all about getting back up
to<00:02:31.799> speed<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.310> enjoying<00:02:33.000> our<00:02:33.450> time<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:34.110> know

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
to speed and enjoying our time you know

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.319 
to speed and enjoying our time you know
I<00:02:34.590> didn't<00:02:35.310> know<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.640> expect<00:02:35.670> I've<00:02:36.150> been

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
I didn't know what to expect I've been

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.759 
I didn't know what to expect I've been
told<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.660> lot<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.870> different<00:02:37.200> things<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.709> I

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
told a lot of different things and so I

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:38.900
