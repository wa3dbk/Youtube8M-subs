00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.219
 in this episode of home recipes ad 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.030
 welcoming us are the colors of the vegetables 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.790
 Seasonal 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.220
 we are in the company of anna ciao anna 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.439
 even though I know they call you well yes 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410
 exactly this in these two names 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.970
 and who knows me for anna chi for betty 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.180
 he knows for both of us 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.500
 and today what prepares us for good today 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.320
 I prepare the gardener who 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.300
 we really like to eat in 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.850
 any time of the year 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.280
 and above all, he likes to eat it 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.780
 in winter when meat is made 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.140
 boiled or maybe the meats are 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.360
 more appetizing to eat and then the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.690
 ingredients for four full cans 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.330
 of pickled vegetables are half 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.080
 kilo of carrots half a kilo of zucchini 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.840
 half of green beans a cauliflower duets 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.590
 of spring onions a stalk of celery salt 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.380
 big 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.840
 a handful of oregano capers a liter 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.840
 of water a liter of vinegar and oil 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.800
 extra virgin olive oil we begin to cook 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.570
 vegetables 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.369
 we have already put a pot on the fire 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.830
 with a liter of water inside 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.149
 I also add the vinegar a liter of vinegar 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.090
 in order to make the gardener a little 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.170
 sweet and sour because then the jars are rare 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.170
 ancient with oil 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.659
 cut the vegetables into small pieces of 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.820
 size more or less equal and when 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.549
 water and vinegar stamp we do not go up and the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.920
 soak first cauliflower carrots that 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.159
 they have similar cooking times three minutes 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.189
 scoliamo and we proceed with the other 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.530
 onion and zucchini aside because 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.130
 they have a faster cooking time and then also 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 the beans and then the celery 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.439
 in short, we must respect how to say a 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.460
 criterion is a strict order 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.979
 respect cooking times 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.800
 especially those who like vegetables a little 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.940
 al dente e 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.940
 it's tastier 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.410

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.590

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.020
 hand to make food 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.330
 lucia puts drained vegetables a 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.420
 dry a bit and then helps mum to 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.430
 pot pots are sterilized there 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.410

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.530
 while re-entering the vessels take 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.260
 gently add vegetables 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.540
 bit of oregano so that to give a little 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.930
 taste then the vessel will remain 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.180
 closed for about two months then the oil 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.180
 the taste of oregano will also arise 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.650
 soak in plenty of oil 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.010
 extra virgin olive oil slowly poured 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.980
