00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.340
 I do not think the presence of the reporter 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.300
 Who wins today's book? 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 when this is already counterproductive 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 whatever happens something I like to see said hawk 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.280
 to participate with us too 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.269
 give option 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.359
 like him 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.150
 then do an investigation 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.560
 with so many pieces that were not assembled so that the situation was 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.820
 complete 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.480
 I actually had trouble even answering our book 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.960
 that this piece of sheet for example second beatriz spoke on a common battery 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.400
 and it worked 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.630
 you will find here in the report of our book we call attention 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.400
 to the fact that the airplane is in low height in position of force and the facts 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.720
 had failed 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.740
 I decide I'm busy 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.160
 and also the wheels so it's really curious that that left steel fact that 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.450
 Do not come down when it's time to be here. 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.790
 launches or 1 61 million 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.580
 is called last with a 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.640
 today this subject without limits 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.040
 the employment issue 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
 posted by samu ops 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 which would not be the only kind of information without retention 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.180
 I think it comes 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.660
 among the most important information 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.390
 There you will see the public. 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.390
 that comes to have science of the book 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.720
 since the beginning of history it was said that the Georgian 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 the total and absolute responsible because if I will be 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.280
 you will see that lamentably I am not accuser 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.210
 for the nautical is a necessary and natural care to preserve the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.550
 name of persons in the case of operators that may be of 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.610
 responsibility of its authors 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.800
 consequently in the middle of the book I feel 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.930
 that three return operators were responsible for flight controller was 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.180
 partly largely responsible 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.570
 for this problem 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.049
 by having taken an unnecessary pilot talk 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.650
 I'm not the technician I heard genius technician you'll listen with vainer 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.799
 better saying 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.109
 here there is a certain moment that one of the technical operators jorginho 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.049
 at this wind speed 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.010
 I ask only for a photo of a specialist in our team said that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.010
 this does not happen in such an airplane 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.719
 together with cristiane 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.459
 kicked out 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.859
 pilot's 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.729
 what exactly are the advantages 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.219
 let's show heart 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.299
 to stare xavi of all this mystery 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.040
 so pregnant is important that ronaldinho refused until the delivery of the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.409
 our justice 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.239
 but the format is only cristiano can out can reveal she managed to have this 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.199
 stay in hand I watched this tape at the residence of da cristiane on the 24th of 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.879
 January 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.889
 I was expecting to present our recent program in SÃ£o Paulo that 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.889
 there was no opportunity for reasons already helena 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.859
 let's hear what we have here 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.859
 maria cristiane the perception about this 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.219
 for those who are already five or six weeks old 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:26.379
 still singing 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.279
 I'm 100% 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.569
 with this year's triumph 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.569
 the burglar 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.219
 pay attention to cooperated Reuters 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.909
 no other storm 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.559
 with 82 years in the area 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.559
 in greater river to the category 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.359
 so the commission 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 and it comes to all plans at the time of the accident 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.080
 we all even knew conversations from buyers before the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.189
 justice 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:43.900
 and it's the last word of the jais terceria I'm with the Sierra my donations are 

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:45.849
 in the basilica 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.050
 and that in the reality of the country in order to 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.150
 show everyone who asks for an explanation 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.300
 Who we talked about on the basis of 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.280
 After one hour 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.039
 go back to undressing 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.240
 the negative control 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.240
 we have two aircraft with no approach 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.220
 this year's event 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.460
 the control 119 final 8 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.630
 the last word of the lakes is called the control because the controller that was 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.599
 entering he told him to do this 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.219
 he watched from the buyers watched the plane approaching approaching 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.300
 and they did not speak 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.589
 nothing just sent them bitter from control 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.490
 This is revolting here. 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.340
 and there is an observation on the topics of recorded state including also in the 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.280
 our work 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.900
 that one of the operators noted that the aircraft was out of alignment and 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.790
 relation to the runway and that the landing gear as I said earlier 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.010
 it was not not low
