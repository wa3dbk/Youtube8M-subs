 the mustang man was eto'o mature a prototype or car concept of the year 1962

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 that the tiffany house distinguished him was the award for excellence in design 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.860
 As you can see the profile of the car is very simple and smiled 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.490
 It is a low car and because it is a brown bear, it has no pillars 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.530
 one thing that distinguish lateral design of the mustang that is being taken and that 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.640
 simulated and this unit in particular fosse the typical sports rims

 proportion to the size of the stafford car broke the mold and when I did 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.400
 from the structure of the fado round on each side the courage in the brand 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.690
 Registered from Ford since always 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.750
 a rectangular strike divided into three vertical segments was the hallmark 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.210
 of the coral like 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.980
 distinctive that still holds today to the last model of the 2008 mustang 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.290
 sitting inside the mustang one realizes the car is simple sober 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.600

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.659
 sports area with two flags 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.759
