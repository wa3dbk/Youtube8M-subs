00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
great look - what do we have underneath

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.810 
great look - what do we have underneath
here<00:00:39.680> lots<00:00:40.070> of<00:00:40.160> storage<00:00:40.870> we've<00:00:41.870> got<00:00:42.820> areas

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
here lots of storage we've got areas

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.520 
here lots of storage we've got areas
here<00:00:44.239> where<00:00:44.420> we<00:00:44.629> can<00:00:44.780> come<00:00:45.020> through<00:00:45.050> with

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
here where we can come through with

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.639 
here where we can come through with
longer<00:00:46.489> items<00:00:46.699> larger<00:00:47.300> items<00:00:47.720> we<00:00:48.110> can<00:00:48.140> handle

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
longer items larger items we can handle

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.410 
longer items larger items we can handle
two<00:00:48.860> by<00:00:49.070> three<00:00:49.310> foot<00:00:49.520> things<00:00:49.790> here<00:00:50.120> no

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
two by three foot things here no

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.360 
two by three foot things here no
bulkheads<00:00:50.989> underneath<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:51.620> rear<00:00:51.829> seat<00:00:52.130> here

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
bulkheads underneath this rear seat here

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.340 
bulkheads underneath this rear seat here
so<00:00:52.640> we<00:00:53.120> can<00:00:53.300> get<00:00:53.450> some<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.809> longer<00:00:54.110> stuff

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
so we can get some of the longer stuff

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.590 
so we can get some of the longer stuff
under<00:00:54.680> whether<00:00:54.860> we<00:00:55.130> come<00:00:55.370> in<00:00:55.520> this<00:00:55.700> way<00:00:55.910> out

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
under whether we come in this way out

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.979 
under whether we come in this way out
that<00:00:56.930> way<00:00:57.110> easy<00:00:57.739> access<00:00:58.340> in<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.480> engine<00:00:59.840> if

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
that way easy access in to the engine if

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.240 
that way easy access in to the engine if
