00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500
 from received the makeup party 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.210
 he will speak in the box x makeup already at 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.650
 my little box but I do not wear makeup 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.530
 I opened with you. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370
 and has more things have button is shadow 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.170
 blush 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.619
 so I think it's going to be really cool not 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.560
 looking suspicious to start 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.869
 to do here is the most curious thing is 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:32.300
 shadow palette 3ds action comics 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:36.090
 bush made a mix that well 24 shade and 32 x 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 so it 's so super compact and comes all 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.620
 these things here in shadow 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.170
 are two sparkling 13 I love how the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.410
 sparkling beach party would spend the night 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.579
 for me it's perfect and here the blushes 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 two things broke is i believe 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.559
 was on transportation because they changed the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.940
 mail then unfortunately it broke 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.350
 the two parts lines but it is also 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.549
 pretty 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.409
 I our 6 second here and all 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.510
 things are very beautiful, right? 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.090
 and has the implementation at least the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.610
 3d shadows I know is time opens 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.420
 a move above shadow 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.310
 normal 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.490
 then I try it or buy it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:26.090
 you if this palette also lives up came 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.950
 the other bullet had a sound for you 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:37.710
 pallet walkway because I continued 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:41.189
 It's for him that looks cool but if a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.520
 so little book looks like the stingy people 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.180
 if the man the colors preferred 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.970
 I love you I have a suitcase like this 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.340
 brown is sure to have some 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.490
 more beige tones also these two shades of 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.509
 purple and so are all Indians so 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.250
 I'm watching here 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.250
 are 12 colors 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.009
 Andrew looks like a moleskine I found one 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:27.569
 Grace we have lots of waves and lots of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:36.180

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:46.739
 and beige also and other shades of purple 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:48.870
 evaluation of purple and stooges still 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.050
 more compact in that it is smaller than 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.880
 us a little more three probes here 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.430
 no more three towers 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:09.860
 this is a 3d shadow also flip online 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:09.860
 they live and we will see things and she 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.820
 said rose of wonderful 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.799
 Today I'm super basic to everyone. 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.750
 shadow but I think it's summertime to give 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.090
 a daring one, and then summer is 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.470
 Coming and I'm going to test these shadows. 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:33.090
 all another bullet had also 3d 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.940
 call find and excel access do not go open 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.900
 the palettes I think I should have opened 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.950
 all with scissors before we get 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.950
 more time consuming video 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.230
 I said that the other was my favorite 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.290
 but now that I came with these 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.330
 variations of brown tones and without 3d with 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.040
 sure it will be my favorite that 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.709
 I'm crazy to test, I should have 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.890
 open the former mayor says that people 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.040
 today I will show you but good 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.810
 next video I already do a makeup 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:17.640
 with this ball but had this pallet 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.630
 It's very thin at the smallest dine girl well. 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.390
 The one that comes is if it's called Sum 3 Leave 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.400
 he spoke words but in four 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.570
 shadow units 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:36.330
 Let's see our is what I think it is. 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:41.340
 perfectly as an illuminator and are 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:45.300
 All December 3rd I had a palette 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.030
 of a random maka 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.260
 I now have several dots of samba 3d 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.110
 so loving it 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.350
 now just to work in the shadows and 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:00.900
 I then opened the compact stage that I 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:03.090
 thinking it's a bronze and not bronze 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.039
 Can a thing that is not mine but him? 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.440
 has a goal of letting it go two things then 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:11.700
 It sure is a bronze 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.669
 there is not a half what I like 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:18.210
 quite normally a brightness but for 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:21.780
 make the outline is dagger is always hard 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.229
 it is not the best is that someone full of 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.470
 nothing where they can smell like this 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:33.419
 depends on the brand and it has nothing on 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.729
 name of health the group went down 23 almost one 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:39.120
 meter behind 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:45.660
 are three colors of the separate square or gives 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:48.950
 to mix and I find perfect people and 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.610
 now everybody 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:55.970
 it's an exciting tale it was 12 for 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.720
 me then I go there and I'll be right back 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:06.520
 well they sent a lipstick shine thing 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:11.210
 3 is a very dark and very dark medium 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.400

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:22.190

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:00.500
 the truth is a little clearer than the 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:04.350
 first red as beautiful as 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.620
