00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and now I'll show you the next step how

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.250 
and now I'll show you the next step how
we<00:02:22.349> can<00:02:22.799> get<00:02:23.510> how<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:24.569> can<00:02:24.780> get<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.080> cream

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
we can get how we can get the cream

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.850 
we can get how we can get the cream
cheese<00:02:27.049> okay<00:02:28.049> so<00:02:28.110> now<00:02:28.409> what<00:02:28.560> we're<00:02:28.709> going<00:02:28.739> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
cheese okay so now what we're going to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.710 
cheese okay so now what we're going to
do<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.129> we're<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.400> take<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.970> cream

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
do is we're going to take the cream

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.069 
do is we're going to take the cream
cheese<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.409> we're<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.040> actually<00:02:33.079> drip

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
cheese and we're going to actually drip

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.170 
cheese and we're going to actually drip
some<00:02:34.319> more<00:02:34.560> way<00:02:34.769> out<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.579> becomes<00:02:35.909> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
some more way out of it so it becomes a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.809 
some more way out of it so it becomes a
thicker<00:02:36.420> consistency<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:37.519> really<00:02:38.519> more<00:02:38.670> like

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
thicker consistency and really more like

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.520 
thicker consistency and really more like
cream<00:02:39.000> cheese<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.299> not<00:02:39.420> quite<00:02:39.750> cream<00:02:40.230> cheese

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
cream cheese it's not quite cream cheese

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.880 
cream cheese it's not quite cream cheese
yet<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.299> maybe<00:02:42.299> there's<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.690> very<00:02:43.409> simple<00:02:43.769> ways

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
yet and maybe there's a very simple ways

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.410 
yet and maybe there's a very simple ways
to<00:02:44.069> do<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.310> many<00:02:44.579> people<00:02:44.760> will<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.090> kind<00:02:45.150> of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
to do this many people will just kind of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
to do this many people will just kind of
tie<00:02:45.629> up<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.930> ends<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:46.530> they'll<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.579> let

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
tie up the ends and they'll kind of let

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.270 
tie up the ends and they'll kind of let
it<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.030> drip<00:02:48.440> they'll<00:02:49.440> tie<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.890> ends<00:02:50.250> you

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
it just drip they'll tie the ends you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.819 
it just drip they'll tie the ends you
like<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.609> end<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.940> kitchen<00:02:51.629> cabinet<00:02:52.260> handle

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
like the end of a kitchen cabinet handle

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.140 
like the end of a kitchen cabinet handle
somewhere<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.700> they'll<00:02:53.970> put<00:02:54.120> a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
somewhere like that and they'll put a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.550 
somewhere like that and they'll put a
bowl<00:02:54.329> under<00:02:54.629> it<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.290> way<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.440> will

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
bowl under it and the way it will

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.470 
bowl under it and the way it will
continue<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.040> drip<00:02:56.220> out<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:57.180> you'll<00:02:57.359> get

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
continue to drip out and you'll get

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.149 
continue to drip out and you'll get
about<00:02:57.629> another<00:02:57.989> two<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.440> three<00:02:58.680> ounces<00:02:58.890> of

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
about another two to three ounces of

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
whey which you can combine with the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.080 
whey which you can combine with the

my own little kind of silly creative way
of<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:08.670> doing<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.090> actually<00:03:09.810> don't<00:03:09.989> have

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
of just doing this actually don't have

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.520 
of just doing this actually don't have
any<00:03:10.349> kitchen<00:03:11.629> cabinet<00:03:12.629> handles<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:13.319> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
sometimes I can get away with too

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.780 
sometimes I can get away with too
sometimes<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:27.139> need<00:03:28.139> another<00:03:28.620> one<00:03:28.919> so<00:03:29.639> let's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790

sometimes I need another one so let's
just<00:03:29.910> kind<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.150> punch<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.540> through<00:03:30.840> there<00:03:31.109> and

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
just kind of punch it through there and

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.990 
just kind of punch it through there and
see<00:03:31.769> if<00:03:31.859> I<00:03:31.919> can<00:03:32.040> get<00:03:32.129> away<00:03:32.220> with<00:03:32.430> two<00:03:34.910> but<00:03:35.910> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
see if I can get away with two but you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.520 
see if I can get away with two but you
get<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.269> idea<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.870> I'm<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:37.109> going<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.379> kind

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
get the idea and I'm just going to kind

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.319 
get the idea and I'm just going to kind
of<00:03:37.620> put<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:37.950> right<00:03:38.069> in<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.310> glass<00:03:38.609> jar<00:03:38.639> I

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
of put it right in this glass jar I

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.900 
of put it right in this glass jar I
probably<00:03:39.810> need<00:03:39.989> one<00:03:40.169> more<00:03:40.519> let<00:03:41.519> me<00:03:41.609> just<00:03:41.760> put

through there we go and I'm just going

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.689 
through there we go and I'm just going
to<00:03:51.030> hang<00:03:51.540> there<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:51.810> about<00:03:52.079> another<00:03:52.579> three<00:03:53.579> to

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
to hang there for about another three to

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.270 
to hang there for about another three to
four<00:03:53.910> hours<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.959> way<00:03:55.349> will<00:03:55.590> continue<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.069> drip

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
four hours the way will continue to drip

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.759 
four hours the way will continue to drip
out<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:57.540> cream<00:03:57.870> cheese<00:03:57.930> will<00:03:58.290> condense<00:03:58.590> a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
out that cream cheese will condense a

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.860 
out that cream cheese will condense a
bit<00:03:58.949> more<00:03:59.220> get<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> nice<00:03:59.790> thick<00:04:00.329> cream<00:04:00.599> cheese

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
bit more get a nice thick cream cheese

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
batch there and then as far as just the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.280 
batch there and then as far as just the
cream<00:04:36.639> cheese<00:04:36.669> goes<00:04:37.210> we'll<00:04:37.510> just<00:04:37.690> unravel

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
cream cheese goes we'll just unravel

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.100 
cream cheese goes we'll just unravel
this<00:04:38.880> very<00:04:39.880> simple<00:04:40.210> it's<00:04:40.389> pretty<00:04:40.630> much<00:04:40.780> done

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
this very simple it's pretty much done

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.490 
this very simple it's pretty much done
and<00:04:41.410> then<00:04:41.979> it's<00:04:42.130> just<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.400> matter<00:04:44.220> nice<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:47.320> it's

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
and then it's just a matter nice so it's

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.740 
and then it's just a matter nice so it's
really<00:04:47.740> thickened<00:04:48.250> up<00:04:48.370> quite<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.790> bit<00:04:49.150> as<00:04:49.449> you

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750
