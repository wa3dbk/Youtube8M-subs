00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
sounds like so yeah it sounds really

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.870 
sounds like so yeah it sounds really
like<00:01:24.750> uh<00:01:25.040> like<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.159> were<00:01:26.280> talking<00:01:26.460> over<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
like uh like you were talking over a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.140 
like uh like you were talking over a
phone<00:01:27.180> or<00:01:27.420> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.750> radio<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.170> guess<00:01:29.150> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
phone or kind of a radio I guess so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
phone or kind of a radio I guess so
that's<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.780> cool<00:01:30.900> effect<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.560> also

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that's a really cool effect you can also

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.770 
that's a really cool effect you can also
I<00:01:31.920> found<00:01:32.250> changing<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> heightening<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I found changing a heightening up the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
I found changing a heightening up the
frequency<00:01:34.259> gives<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.619> more<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> effect

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
frequency gives you more of the effect

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700 
frequency gives you more of the effect
so<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> bump<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> thousand<00:01:37.590> more

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
so I bump it up about a thousand more

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.319 
so I bump it up about a thousand more
and<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:40.520> it's<00:01:41.520> also<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> lot<00:01:42.030> quieter

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and this is what it's also a lot quieter

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.609 
and this is what it's also a lot quieter
so<00:01:42.659> you're<00:01:42.780> gonna<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.140> find<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.439> balance

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
so you're gonna have to find a balance

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.010 
so you're gonna have to find a balance
if<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> change<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.759> frequency<00:01:45.240> but

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
if you want to change the frequency but

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.210 
if you want to change the frequency but
that's<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.409> way<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.680> doing<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.189> think

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
that's one way of doing it and I think

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.200 
that's one way of doing it and I think
it<00:01:47.490> sounds<00:01:47.700> very<00:01:47.820> well<00:01:48.619> very<00:01:49.619> good<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.790> let's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it sounds very well very good so let's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
it sounds very well very good so let's
go<00:01:51.329> ahead<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.600> remove<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.869> plug-in<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.619> try

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
go ahead and remove that plug-in and try

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.620 
go ahead and remove that plug-in and try
the<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.070> way<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:54.119> back<00:01:54.149> into<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the other way so just go back into the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
the other way so just go back into the
plugins<00:01:55.020> after<00:01:55.740> you've<00:01:55.920> moved<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> other

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
plugins after you've moved to the other

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.639 
plugins after you've moved to the other
one<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> look<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.110> gonna<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.439> right

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
one and look for it's gonna be right

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.319 
one and look for it's gonna be right
next<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> resonant<00:01:59.490> filter<00:01:59.729> or<00:01:59.909> right<00:02:00.090> near

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
next to a resonant filter or right near

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.749 
next to a resonant filter or right near
it<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.840> gonna<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.140> called<00:02:01.350> parametric<00:02:02.219> EQ

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it it's gonna be called parametric EQ

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.340 
it it's gonna be called parametric EQ
make<00:02:02.969> sure<00:02:03.119> you're<00:02:03.329> getting<00:02:03.420> parametric<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
make sure you're getting parametric and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.319 
make sure you're getting parametric and
not<00:02:04.469> para<00:02:04.740> graphic<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.790> go<00:02:05.909> ahead<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.180> click

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
not para graphic so go ahead and click

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.710 
not para graphic so go ahead and click
parametric<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.110> ad<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.710> okay<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.599> now<00:02:09.599> we're

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
parametric do ad and okay and now we're

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.029 
parametric do ad and okay and now we're
going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:10.020> into<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> drop<00:02:10.590> down<00:02:10.770> arrow

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
going to go into the drop down arrow

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.020 
going to go into the drop down arrow
again

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
again

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.699 
again
and<00:02:12.240> we're<00:02:12.660> gonna<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.990> find<00:02:13.200> phone<00:02:13.530> line

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
and we're gonna just find phone line

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.400 
and we're gonna just find phone line
effect<00:02:14.010> pretty<00:02:14.280> simple<00:02:14.750> so<00:02:15.750> that's<00:02:15.900> that's
