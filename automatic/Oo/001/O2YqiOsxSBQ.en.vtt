00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
it works really well for using in the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.050 
it works really well for using in the
inner<00:04:12.230> corner<00:04:12.489> for<00:04:13.489> getting<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:13.760> smaller

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
inner corner for getting in smaller

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.390 
inner corner for getting in smaller
spaces<00:04:14.440> because<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.680> is<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:15.860> pretty<00:04:16.250> small

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
spaces because it is a pretty small

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.990 
spaces because it is a pretty small
brush<00:04:17.359> as<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:17.720> can<00:04:17.870> see<00:04:18.370> sorry<00:04:19.370> as<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.880> can

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
brush as you can see sorry as you can

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.110 
brush as you can see sorry as you can
see<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:21.160> it's<00:04:22.160> really<00:04:22.370> good<00:04:22.580> for<00:04:22.700> getting<00:04:22.820> in

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
see so it's really good for getting in

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.310 
see so it's really good for getting in
to<00:04:23.600> small<00:04:23.990> areas<00:04:24.380> of<00:04:24.560> your<00:04:24.650> eye

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320

to small areas of your eye
the<00:04:27.320> next<00:04:27.770> brush<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.250> picked<00:04:28.580> up<00:04:28.760> this<00:04:29.450> one<00:04:29.690> took

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
the next brush I picked up this one took

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.960 
the next brush I picked up this one took
me<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.050> little<00:04:30.440> this<00:04:31.280> one<00:04:31.430> was<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.640> quickest

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
me a little this one was the quickest

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.190 
me a little this one was the quickest
one<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.180> find<00:04:32.360> because<00:04:32.510> they<00:04:32.750> have<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:32.930> whole

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
one to find because they have a whole

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.610 
one to find because they have a whole
simply<00:04:34.070> Simmons<00:04:34.750> section<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.170> aisle<00:04:36.410> and

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
simply Simmons section on that aisle and

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.700 
simply Simmons section on that aisle and
this<00:04:37.190> one<00:04:37.400> is<00:04:37.550> simply<00:04:38.180> Simmons<00:04:38.600> number<00:04:39.470> eight

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
this one is simply Simmons number eight

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.400 
this one is simply Simmons number eight
filbert<00:04:40.460> brush<00:04:40.670> and<00:04:41.060> this<00:04:41.630> one<00:04:41.840> is<00:04:41.990> comparable

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
filbert brush and this one is comparable

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.330 
filbert brush and this one is comparable
to<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.800> mac<00:04:43.010> 249<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.590> you<00:04:45.590> can<00:04:45.740> see<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:45.980> end

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
to the mac 249 and you can see the end

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.010 
to the mac 249 and you can see the end
right<00:04:46.520> there<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:47.000> very<00:04:47.270> thin<00:04:47.690> brush

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
right there it's a very thin brush

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.190 
right there it's a very thin brush
there's<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.040> side<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.640> and<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:50.600> front<00:04:50.810> and

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
there's the side of it and the front and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.150 
there's the side of it and the front and
it's<00:04:51.950> very<00:04:52.190> soft<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:54.380> this<00:04:54.530> one<00:04:54.680> is<00:04:54.830> doable

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
it's very soft and so this one is doable

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.270 
it's very soft and so this one is doable
for<00:04:55.250> Matt<00:04:55.520> 249<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:57.050> does<00:04:57.320> have<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.590> pretty<00:04:57.830> small

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
for Matt 249 it does have a pretty small

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.660 
for Matt 249 it does have a pretty small
tip<00:04:58.700> to<00:04:58.970> it<00:04:59.150> as<00:04:59.240> well<00:04:59.830> so<00:05:00.830> i'm<00:05:01.250> just<00:05:01.280> still

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
tip to it as well so i'm just still

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.160 
tip to it as well so i'm just still
trying<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:01.970> figure<00:05:02.060> out<00:05:02.150> what<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.600> best<00:05:02.750> use

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
trying to figure out what the best use

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.520 
trying to figure out what the best use
for<00:05:03.200> this<00:05:03.590> brush<00:05:03.890> is<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:05.300> is<00:05:05.720> good<00:05:05.960> for<00:05:06.170> doing

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
for this brush is it is good for doing

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.450 
for this brush is it is good for doing
the<00:05:06.770> inner<00:05:06.950> quarter<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.580> outer<00:05:07.760> corner<00:05:08.270> i

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
the inner quarter the outer corner i

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.560 
the inner quarter the outer corner i
don't<00:05:10.460> think<00:05:10.520> i<00:05:10.730> would<00:05:10.790> use<00:05:10.970> it<00:05:11.120> as<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.240> crease

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
don't think i would use it as a crease

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.480 
don't think i would use it as a crease
brush<00:05:11.810> because<00:05:12.170> i<00:05:12.320> think<00:05:12.380> it's<00:05:12.620> too<00:05:12.800> thin<00:05:13.160> on

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
brush because i think it's too thin on

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.550 
brush because i think it's too thin on
the<00:05:13.760> end<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.230> is<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.950> deep<00:05:16.100> for<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.340> 249

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
the end but this is the deep for the 249

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.050 
the end but this is the deep for the 249
again<00:05:18.560> all<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.860> these<00:05:19.010> can<00:05:19.370> be<00:05:19.490> found<00:05:19.640> at<00:05:19.970> a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
again all of these can be found at a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.170 
again all of these can be found at a

probably have them too I don't think

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.820 
probably have them too I don't think
walmart<00:05:26.060> or<00:05:26.660> like<00:05:26.990> target<00:05:27.410> would<00:05:27.500> have<00:05:27.560> these

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
ones were purple and this one is a dupe

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.500

for<00:05:49.580> the<00:05:49.790> mac<00:05:50.060> 217<00:05:51.610> it's<00:05:52.610> right<00:05:52.880> there<00:05:53.090> so<00:05:53.420> it

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
for the mac 217 it's right there so it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.770 
for the mac 217 it's right there so it
has<00:05:53.690> more<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.260> a<00:05:54.410> rounded<00:05:55.190> dome<00:05:55.670> to<00:05:56.030> it<00:05:56.210> and

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
has more of a rounded dome to it and

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.110 
has more of a rounded dome to it and
it's<00:05:57.710> little<00:05:57.920> so<00:05:58.160> it's<00:05:58.310> good<00:05:58.460> for<00:05:58.640> packing<00:05:59.000> in

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
it's little so it's good for packing in

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.020 
it's little so it's good for packing in
color<00:05:59.410> it<00:06:00.410> works<00:06:00.590> really<00:06:00.800> well<00:06:00.980> in<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.670> crease

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
color it works really well in the crease

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.810 
color it works really well in the crease
in<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.600> outer<00:06:02.750> corner<00:06:03.400> just<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:04.490> go<00:06:04.610> back<00:06:04.790> and

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
in the outer corner just to go back and

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.150 
in the outer corner just to go back and
forth<00:06:05.120> you<00:06:05.330> could<00:06:05.480> even<00:06:05.630> use<00:06:05.750> it<00:06:06.140> for<00:06:06.830> the

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
forth you could even use it for the
