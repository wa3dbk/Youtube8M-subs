fifty percent of it you know I be a be
really<00:01:45.119> happy<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.479> 150k<00:01:46.170> experiments<00:01:46.740> for

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
really happy with 150k experiments for

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.740 
really happy with 150k experiments for
three<00:01:47.040> runs<00:01:47.310> Molina<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:47.970> amazing<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.630> my

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
three runs Molina that's amazing in my

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.590 
three runs Molina that's amazing in my
opinion<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.229> prefer<00:01:50.009> 100k<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.329> is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
opinion I prefer 100k but this is

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.160 
opinion I prefer 100k but this is
basically<00:01:52.399> three<00:01:53.399> hundred<00:01:53.759> thousand<00:01:54.210> uh<00:01:54.390> firm

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
experience for kind of doing nothing but

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.870 
experience for kind of doing nothing but

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
looting what kind of excited if we can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
looting what kind of excited if we can
do<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.090> air<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.049> oh<00:02:01.259> yeah

what<00:02:02.969> reason<00:02:03.329> there<00:02:03.450> wasn't<00:02:03.750> update<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
what reason there wasn't update with the

hours sometimes Edinburgh either but it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.820 
hours sometimes Edinburgh either but it
was<00:02:12.989> updated<00:02:13.440> with

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
was updated with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.640 
was updated with
system<00:02:14.580> update<00:02:14.670> being<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.210> now<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.750> do<00:02:16.320> all

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
system update being you now can do all

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.110 
system update being you now can do all
three<00:02:17.070> runs<00:02:17.370> whenever<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.820> want<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
three runs whenever you want to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.100 
three runs whenever you want to
basically<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.620> like<00:02:19.920> my<00:02:20.100> third<00:02:20.820> run<00:02:21.110> in

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
basically this is like my third run in

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.210 
basically this is like my third run in
not<00:02:22.860> too<00:02:23.160> long<00:02:23.190> actually<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.790> did<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.210> do<00:02:24.330> run

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
not too long actually I did but I do run

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.620 
not too long actually I did but I do run
for<00:02:26.220> hours<00:02:26.460> i<00:02:26.490> think<00:02:26.730> actually<00:02:26.820> i<00:02:27.060> did<00:02:27.240> do<00:02:27.420> one

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
for hours i think actually i did do one

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.750 
for hours i think actually i did do one
run<00:02:27.840> earlier<00:02:28.140> today<00:02:28.290> where<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.190> didn't<00:02:29.640> get

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
run earlier today where I didn't get

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.970 
run earlier today where I didn't get
that<00:02:29.820> man<00:02:30.120> were<00:02:30.300> stuff<00:02:31.290> meant<00:02:31.530> because<00:02:31.710> of

that man were stuff meant because of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.370 
that man were stuff meant because of
some<00:02:32.190> scalar<00:02:32.820> picketers<00:02:33.360> that's<00:02:34.200> another

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
some scalar picketers that's another

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.990 
some scalar picketers that's another
issue<00:02:34.620> actually<00:02:34.830> been<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.580> talk<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
issue actually been going to talk to the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.850 
issue actually been going to talk to the
about<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.480> second<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.470> second<00:02:37.740> run<00:02:37.830> i

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
about that in a second the second run i

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.260 
about that in a second the second run i
got<00:02:38.040> alternative<00:02:38.490> thought<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.180> was

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
got alternative thought that was

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.610 
got alternative thought that was
straight<00:02:39.450> after<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> update<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.260> not<00:02:40.440> long

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
straight after the update so not long

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.650 
straight after the update so not long

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
going to get this as well so it's going

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.680 
going to get this as well so it's going

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
still do the hard method but that won't

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.240 
still do the hard method but that won't
really<00:05:19.660> be<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:20.229> effective<00:05:20.530> as<00:05:20.889> it<00:05:21.070> would<00:05:21.220> be

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
put down a little bit why not why should

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.120 
put down a little bit why not why should
it<00:05:54.970> basically<00:05:55.810> I<00:05:56.260> think<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:56.830> should<00:05:57.099> matter

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
it basically I think it should matter

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.800 
it basically I think it should matter
because<00:05:57.639> it's<00:05:57.789> way<00:05:57.940> too<00:05:58.000> easy<00:05:58.120> to<00:05:58.450> get<00:05:58.599> not

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
because it's way too easy to get not

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.870 
because it's way too easy to get not
enough<00:05:59.080> forming<00:05:59.440> the<00:06:00.039> other<00:06:00.160> warrants<00:06:00.580> only

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
enough forming the other warrants only

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.000 
enough forming the other warrants only
don't<00:06:01.090> have<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.300> do<00:06:01.419> for<00:06:01.660> me<00:06:01.950> performing<00:06:02.950> is

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
don't have to do for me performing is

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.400 
don't have to do for me performing is
basically<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.460> waste<00:06:03.669> of<00:06:03.849> experience<00:06:04.389> kind<00:06:05.229> of

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
basically a waste of experience kind of

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.400 
basically a waste of experience kind of
in<00:06:06.250> order<00:06:06.400> to<00:06:06.610> get<00:06:06.760> 99<00:06:07.090> so<00:06:07.750> I<00:06:07.780> do<00:06:07.900> think<00:06:08.260> they

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
in order to get 99 so I do think they

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.140 
in order to get 99 so I do think they
should<00:06:08.620> be<00:06:08.770> put<00:06:08.979> down<00:06:09.160> maybe<00:06:09.460> fifty<00:06:09.849> percent

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
should be put down maybe fifty percent

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.240 
should be put down maybe fifty percent
in<00:06:10.330> order<00:06:10.539> to<00:06:10.660> get<00:06:10.840> like<00:06:11.500> fifty<00:06:11.830> percent<00:06:12.130> of

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
in order to get like fifty percent of

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.420 
in order to get like fifty percent of
phila<00:06:12.700> can<00:06:13.180> speak<00:06:13.389> 50k<00:06:14.349> experience<00:06:14.979> from

phila can speak 50k experience from

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.960 
phila can speak 50k experience from
level<00:06:15.760> 90<00:06:16.120> and<00:06:16.330> over<00:06:17.050> for<00:06:17.770> 25<00:06:18.250> items<00:06:18.460> I<00:06:18.789> think

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
level 90 and over for 25 items I think

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.460 
level 90 and over for 25 items I think
that<00:06:19.120> would<00:06:19.210> be<00:06:19.270> reasonable<00:06:19.690> so<00:06:19.990> that's<00:06:20.289> my

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
that would be reasonable so that's my

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.279 
that would be reasonable so that's my
suggestion<00:06:20.889> for<00:06:21.220> the<00:06:21.400> wilderness<00:06:21.700> war<00:06:21.880> bonds
