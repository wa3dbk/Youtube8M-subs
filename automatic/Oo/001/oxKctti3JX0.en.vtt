00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.660
 Sooner or later the question arises how 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.109
 honor sharpeners from wineglass market for plugs 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.109
 sharpeners 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.839
 never mind that this old sharpener 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.839
 lansky like my new sharpener lansky 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.240
 alem ceramic musat sharpener spider 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.599
 Movies are still some such gizmos everywhere 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.740
 where is Alena ceramics in the process 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.040
 sharpening look rod on it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.129
 going first metal 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:45.320
 This line is clearly visible such 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:49.020
 black gray stripes 2 going fat and 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 dirt from the knife of course the pressure to hone 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.469
 only pure naturally this by itself 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.109
 but it happens in different ways how to cope yes 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:04.220
 very simple here i have here specifically 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.860
 on my wheelbarrow paste eraser normal 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.580
 eraser washer 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.710
 student washed, that is, you can stick 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 and here you can separately use here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:24.229
 I have such a cool too 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:27.950
 pivot any not just calm it 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.950
 part of the washer 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:42.460
 soft tough any one i'm cleaning 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:48.850
 did this one like that that is just tidy up 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:51.850
 with love metal abrasive residue can 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.080
 you can twist like this from the text 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.650
 need to flip 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.120
 so that everything becomes purely ordinary 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.240
 stiralka remove metal once every wheelbarrows 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.240
 mud 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.990
 take a long time 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.180
 but apparently still remained with the need 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.200
 clean everything thoroughly 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.870
 what pollutes our abrasive against 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.880
 important is generally clean 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.440
 after that i do like this 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.170
 plastic container to the left and there 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.330
 hot water and smoothing soap soap 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.450
 tar tar economic any alkaline 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.890
 soap but usually not modern time 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:48.310
 I don't use much after that 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:52.390
 I put in this solution ceramic 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.030
 elements and my hands you did not know 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.380
 it is natural to pour water here 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.049
 diluted soap there was dirt 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.730
 everything is quiet in front of the screen 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.489
 imagine just soapy water 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.400
 calmly take my sponge where if 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.110
 sponge is my take on a new and sponge 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.290
 completely calm the whole thing from 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.190
 my while we have all the dirt goes away 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.519
 especially with medium alen ceramic 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.380
 abrasives have a train over 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:25.060
 the whole thing is washed after that 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.130
 we no longer need the container 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.550
 wash with plain plain water and we can 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.950
 feel free to use 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.470

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.310
 they are not afraid of water for them is dear 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.650
 Wednesday starved not much absorbed but 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:48.310
 trust me here after cleaning and washing 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.300
 alain ceramics works much better 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:58.190
 put on two knives 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:04:01.460

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.270
 boldly rule sharpen my knives but I 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.150
 I will show on the example of Lanske it works and 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:13.160

 other companies for ceramic musat 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.109
 Everywhere where there is a marketplace red market that is 1 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.080
 We wash with a washer 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.770
 soapy water any soapy water can 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.940
 use to remove tandoor to 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.600
 the sharpener was dry clean beautiful and 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:41.510
 the knife for it refueled dragged and not 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.870
 slid by cash desk very elementary 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:55.130
 just that honor and very easy to care for 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:57.430
 always quite small 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.430
 piece of paper 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.090
