information that you need quicker or if
you're<00:00:09.210> using<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:10.080> batch<00:00:10.800> scripts<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.550> order

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
you're using that batch scripts in order

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.350 
you're using that batch scripts in order
to<00:00:11.880> find<00:00:12.120> information<00:00:12.740> you<00:00:13.740> can<00:00:13.950> pipe

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
to find information you can pipe

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.779 
to find information you can pipe
commands<00:00:15.360> together<00:00:16.220> or<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.340> can<00:00:17.369> redirect

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
commands together or you can redirect

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.630 
commands together or you can redirect
output<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> file<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.619> order<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:20.100> gather

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
output to a file in order to gather

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.580 
output to a file in order to gather
information<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.539> save<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.109> text<00:00:22.410> file

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
information and save it in a text file

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.460 
information and save it in a text file
or<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.990> let's<00:00:24.990> go<00:00:25.140> ahead<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
or what have you so let's go ahead and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
clear the screen here if you want to do

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.679 
clear the screen here if you want to do
this<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.720> type<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.080> CLS<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.340> hit<00:00:30.060> enter<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
this you type in CLS and hit enter and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.380 
this you type in CLS and hit enter and
it<00:00:31.109> will<00:00:31.320> clear<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.369> screen<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.300> get

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
it will clear out the screen you can get

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.819 
it will clear out the screen you can get
of<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> garbage<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.380> were<00:00:34.590> looking

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
of all the garbage that you were looking

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.760 
of all the garbage that you were looking
at<00:00:34.950> previously<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
at previously so what we can do here is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.100 
at previously so what we can do here is
we<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:38.129> type<00:00:38.250> an<00:00:38.430> IP<00:00:38.670> config<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
we can type an IP config and this is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.900 
we can type an IP config and this is
going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> give<00:00:40.590> us<00:00:40.620> our<00:00:43.550> information<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.730> our

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
going to give us our information on our

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.310 
going to give us our information on our
IP<00:00:45.270> address<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> say<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:48.149> wanted<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
IP address so say if we just wanted to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
IP address so say if we just wanted to
see<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.809> ipv4<00:00:51.809> address<00:00:52.520> right<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.910> we

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
see this ipv4 address right here and we

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.439 
see this ipv4 address right here and we
don't<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.360> see<00:00:54.600> everything<00:00:55.320> else<00:00:56.449> you

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
don't want to see everything else you

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.990 
don't want to see everything else you
can<00:00:57.510> type<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> IP<00:00:58.140> config<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.219> space<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
can type in the IP config to space and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.619 
can type in the IP config to space and
then<00:01:00.289> shift<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.620> backslash<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:03.239> creates

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
then shift and backslash this creates

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.080 
then shift and backslash this creates
what's<00:01:03.930> called<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.320> pipe<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
what's called a pipe it's just the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.710 
what's called a pipe it's just the
straight<00:01:06.390> line<00:01:07.400> basically<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.600> do

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
straight line basically what we can do

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.719 
straight line basically what we can do
here<00:01:10.110> we'll<00:01:10.320> pipe<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.710> tip<00:01:10.920> line<00:01:11.159> string<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:16.729> now

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
here we'll pipe a tip line string so now

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
here we'll pipe a tip line string so now
let<00:01:18.210> me<00:01:18.270> explain<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.960> does<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:20.189> it'll

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
let me explain what this does what it'll

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.539 
let me explain what this does what it'll
do<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.210> run<00:01:21.450> IP<00:01:21.780> config<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:23.310> won't

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
do it will run IP config and they won't

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.539 
do it will run IP config and they won't
display<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.420> output<00:01:24.830> well<00:01:25.830> it'll<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.159> keep

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
display the output well it'll just keep

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.499 
display the output well it'll just keep
it<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.790> memory<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.990> it'll<00:01:28.229> it'll<00:01:28.590> take<00:01:29.509> IP

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it in memory and it'll it'll take IP

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.249 
it in memory and it'll it'll take IP
config<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.310> pipe<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.820> find<00:01:33.600> string<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
config and pipe it to find string and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.819 
config and pipe it to find string and
just<00:01:34.670> display<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.119> specify<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.259> which

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
just display what we specify here which

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.480 
just display what we specify here which
should<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:39.650> string<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
should be this string this this is the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.039 
should be this string this this is the
only<00:01:41.700> thing<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.000> should<00:01:42.150> come<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.479> this

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
only thing that should come out this

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
only thing that should come out this
ipv4<00:01:43.890> address<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.240> 180<00:01:45.750> 168<00:01:46.610> 150

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
ipv4 address and then 180 168 150

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.569 
ipv4 address and then 180 168 150
so<00:01:48.630> basically<00:01:48.990> takes<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> output<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.220> one

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
so basically takes the output of one

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.600 
so basically takes the output of one
command<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.299> moves<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.470> another<00:01:53.040> command

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
command and moves it to another command

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
command and moves it to another command
so<00:01:55.100> there<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.219> go<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.420> is

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so there we go so you can see this is

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.820 
so there we go so you can see this is
all<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.369> here

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.010 

now<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> useful<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
now this is this is useful and this is a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.760 
now this is this is useful and this is a
pretty<00:02:07.320> simple<00:02:07.590> way<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> finding<00:02:09.240> things<00:02:09.770> you

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
pretty simple way of finding things you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.030 
pretty simple way of finding things you
can<00:02:11.009> pipe<00:02:11.340> several<00:02:12.209> things<00:02:12.480> together<00:02:12.870> if<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
can pipe several things together if you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.020 
can pipe several things together if you
want<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:16.080> say<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.500> wanted<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.490> ifconfig

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
want so say if you wanted to do ifconfig

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.210 
want so say if you wanted to do ifconfig
and<00:02:18.480> then<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.720> pipe<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.230> find<00:02:19.530> string<00:02:19.890> and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and then you pipe it to find string and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.620 
and then you pipe it to find string and
then<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.550> pipe<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.970> fine<00:02:21.180> string<00:02:21.510> to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
then you pipe the fine string to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.180 
then you pipe the fine string to
something<00:02:21.959> else<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.870> also<00:02:25.020> direct<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.920> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
something else you can also direct it to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.750 
something else you can also direct it to
a<00:02:26.220> text<00:02:27.000> file<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.540> file<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.319> any<00:02:28.560> kind<00:02:28.890> so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
a text file or a file of any kind so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.800 
a text file or a file of any kind so
let's<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.959> back<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.709> had<00:02:32.660> how<00:02:33.660> I'm

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
let's go back to what we had how I'm

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.360 
let's go back to what we had how I'm
changing<00:02:34.230> things<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.500> quickly<00:02:34.739> here's<00:02:35.220> I'm

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
changing things so quickly here's I'm

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.970 
changing things so quickly here's I'm
using<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.730> up<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.150> down<00:02:36.420> arrow<00:02:37.050> keys<00:02:37.290> and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
using the up and down arrow keys and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.790 
using the up and down arrow keys and
this<00:02:38.940> will<00:02:39.150> show<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.769> previously<00:02:40.769> used

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
this will show the previously used

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.370 
this will show the previously used
commands<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:42.540> another<00:02:42.750> way<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.080> running<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
commands just another way of running the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.550 
commands just another way of running the
same<00:02:43.620> command<00:02:44.040> again<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.410> we're<00:02:46.500> gonna

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
same command again so what we're gonna

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.100 
same command again so what we're gonna
do<00:02:46.709> we're<00:02:46.830> gonna<00:02:46.890> add<00:02:47.130> on<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:47.580> command

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
do we're gonna add on to this command

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.660 
do we're gonna add on to this command
basically<00:02:49.190> ipconfig<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.280> going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> come<00:02:50.640> out

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
basically ipconfig is going to come out

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.059 
basically ipconfig is going to come out
it's<00:02:51.360> going<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.690> send<00:02:51.930> its<00:02:52.140> output<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.620> find

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
it's going to send its output to find

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.170 
it's going to send its output to find
string<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.610> look<00:02:53.910> for<00:02:54.120> ipv4<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.880> what<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:56.910> want

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
string and look for ipv4 and what I want

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180 
string and look for ipv4 and what I want
to<00:02:57.269> do<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.690> want<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.959> take<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.470> output<00:02:58.739> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
I want to put it in a file so you can

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.130

overwrite<00:03:34.980> everything<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.150> file<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:37.290> use

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
overwrite everything in the file you use

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.319 
overwrite everything in the file you use
a<00:03:37.890> single<00:03:38.700> arrow<00:03:39.000> if<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.959> want<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.320> add<00:03:41.329> to

a single arrow if you want to add to

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.530 
a single arrow if you want to add to
what's<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.109> file<00:03:43.410> already<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:44.760> use<00:03:45.030> too

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
what's in the file already you use too

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.569 
what's in the file already you use too
and<00:03:47.269> this<00:03:48.269> will<00:03:48.540> put<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.959> at<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.920> bottom<00:03:50.190> of

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
and this will put it at the bottom of

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.460 
and this will put it at the bottom of
what<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.940> already<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.450> file<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.079> if<00:03:52.170> we<00:03:52.320> go

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
what is already in the file so if we go

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.630 
what is already in the file so if we go
back<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.829> there<00:03:52.950> there's<00:03:53.160> going<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.310> be<00:03:53.400> two

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
back in there there's going to be two

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.670 
back in there there's going to be two
entries<00:03:54.030> right<00:03:54.930> here<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.500> right<00:03:56.280> above<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:57.680> so

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
entries right here and right above it so

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.750 
entries right here and right above it so
that's<00:03:58.890> one<00:03:59.160> way<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.640> redirecting<00:04:00.530> output

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
that's one way of redirecting output

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.330 
that's one way of redirecting output
from<00:04:02.760> one<00:04:03.090> command<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.600> another<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.200> also<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
from one command to another and also to

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.390 
from one command to another and also to
a<00:04:05.670> file
