00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
Frieza and Goku halves so that's really

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.410

think<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.640> cool<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.539> also<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> wear

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
think that's cool you also can wear

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.930 
think that's cool you also can wear
their<00:00:55.140> outfits<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.760> want

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
their outfits which if you really want

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.540

to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> um<00:00:57.570> i<00:00:57.870> guess<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.280> just

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to do that um i guess that's like just

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
to do that um i guess that's like just
the<00:00:59.820> icing<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> cake<00:01:00.690> i<00:01:00.870> mean<00:01:01.020> we've

while<00:01:11.280> ago<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.549> guess<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.390> hold<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
while ago I guess I was just a hold of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.570 
while ago I guess I was just a hold of
soft<00:01:12.930> before<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> deal<00:01:13.890> since<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.220> cannot<00:01:14.520> I

will only want to resort to mods on the
pc<00:01:32.220> version<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> good<00:01:33.360> way<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
pc version because that is a good way to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
pc version because that is a good way to
actually<00:01:34.380> increase<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> longevity<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
actually increase the longevity of the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually increase the longevity of the
game<00:01:35.610> maybe<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.479> by<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:36.840> much<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.049> people<00:01:37.590> will

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
game maybe not by as much as people will

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
game maybe not by as much as people will
probably<00:01:38.100> would<00:01:38.430> ever<00:01:38.729> think<00:01:39.030> i<00:01:39.210> mean

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
probably would ever think i mean

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.880 
probably would ever think i mean
obviously<00:01:39.990> we're<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> point<00:01:40.680> where

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
obviously we're not at the point where

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.530 
obviously we're not at the point where
we<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.189> get<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.460> stage<00:01:41.759> mods<00:01:42.030> completely

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
we can get like stage mods completely

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.910 
we can get like stage mods completely
change<00:01:42.780> everything<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.290> we've<00:01:43.770> got

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
gotten the entirety of a map change so

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
gotten the entirety of a map change so
we'll<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.390> about<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.290> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
we'll have to see about that but you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.690 
we'll have to see about that but you
know<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:49.979> can't<00:01:50.310> increase<00:01:50.490> along

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
know they really can't increase along

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
know they really can't increase along
give<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> game<00:01:51.210> making<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.479> little<00:01:51.570> bit

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
give me the game making a little bit

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.560 
give me the game making a little bit
more<00:01:51.869> fun<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.460> personally<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
more fun but I think personally that the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.630 
more fun but I think personally that the
cosmic<00:01:55.020> DLC<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:56.040> should<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.250> came<00:01:56.430> out<00:01:56.610> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
cosmic DLC really should have came out a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.980 
cosmic DLC really should have came out a
lot<00:01:56.820> earlier<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.329> really<00:01:57.540> think<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.750> could<00:01:57.899> have

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
lot earlier I really think it could have

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.080 
lot earlier I really think it could have
been<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:01:58.500> better<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> DLC<00:01:59.670> pack<00:01:59.850> came

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
been a lot better if the DLC pack came

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.850 
been a lot better if the DLC pack came
out<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.360> his<00:02:00.479> original<00:02:00.600> time<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.680> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
out in his original time so that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.740

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.470 
audible did enjoy the packer some people
did<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.730> personally<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.760> think<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.390> would

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
did and personally I think that it would

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.420 
did and personally I think that it would
have<00:02:45.600> been<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.840> really<00:02:46.380> good<00:02:46.680> thing<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:47.190> came

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
have been a really good thing this came

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
have been a really good thing this came
out<00:02:47.550> earlier<00:02:47.940> aren't<00:02:48.450> really<00:02:48.660> another<00:02:48.840> reason

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
out earlier aren't really another reason

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
out earlier aren't really another reason
why<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.590> later<00:02:49.800> know<00:02:50.010> why<00:02:50.250> dimps

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
why I was the later know why dimps

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.120 
why I was the later know why dimps
didn't<00:02:51.450> release<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.050> earlier<00:02:52.440> they<00:02:52.830> had

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
didn't release this earlier they had

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.470 
didn't release this earlier they had
some<00:02:53.430> trouble<00:02:53.730> getting<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.000> out<00:02:54.060> or<00:02:54.239> something

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
some trouble getting it out or something

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.479 
some trouble getting it out or something
along<00:02:54.540> those<00:02:54.780> lines<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.230> if<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.190> came<00:02:56.400> out

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
along those lines but if this came out

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.470 
along those lines but if this came out
earlier<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.850> would<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.209> been<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.450> much

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
earlier this would have been a much

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.600 
earlier this would have been a much
better<00:02:58.020> thing<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.290> happen<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> guess<00:02:59.430> that

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
better thing to happen but I guess that

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.520 
better thing to happen but I guess that
it<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.880> didn't<00:03:00.120> happen<00:03:00.209> but<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.200> really<00:03:01.410> want

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
it just didn't happen but I really want

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.690 
it just didn't happen but I really want
to<00:03:01.560> see<00:03:01.620> what<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.860> guys<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.190> about<00:03:02.340> this
