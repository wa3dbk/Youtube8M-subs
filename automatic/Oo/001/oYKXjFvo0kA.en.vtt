00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.009

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.129
I'm Joe Weisenfelder for cars.com
 at the Detroit Auto Show right

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.619
now

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.279
with the F 150 pickup truck from Port
the Lotus

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.359
the big the bulging Ford that

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.699
it's not just for looks that's because
the backup camera is down here the

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:22.699
backup camera is

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.789
an option what's important to know about
this is it's not dependent on

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.180
a navigation system you can now get it
as a stand-alone option for just over

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.300
four hundred bucks

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.059
that's a lot better than paid $2000 for
navigation system just so you can see

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:35.920
what's behind you

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.579
another option are for branded secure

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.489
toolboxes that mount on the inside the
cargo bed there obviously lockable

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.380
water resistant

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.380
you have trouble reaching this we have
trouble reaching something else in the

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.530
bed which is something

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.210
owners complain about 2004 your main the
box like

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.580
much higher to increase the volume
unfortunately made it harder region

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.880
the new solution is this step the click
the button

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.520
then you get a 10-inch I

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.810
step

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.990
so you can reach inside

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.130
this is the that ex-senator you've
probably seen these before

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.549
from but the usually solid piece so
either have to be here

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.429
but have to be on the inside but because
a separate in the middle

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.960
then folds the you can also have it
completely outta the way

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.890
also there's a new track system like
your YouTube seen another pickup trucks

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.280
this is the spring loaded pins system

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.969
that's really easy to do you don't have
gone through a big girl now for anything

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.380
like that

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.450
now another track the borrowed from the
250

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.670
is a stop

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.380
in the tailgate

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.039
once you have to step down to raise this

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.490
a did you something to hold onto I'm not
gonna try this

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.979
for additional information on this car
or any other

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.799
