 what to say the same as last year 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.790
 last year the program was called here 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.470
 no but we changed a little bit like we 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.310
 talked the concept of building a show in 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.050
 The first part was solo numbers with 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.180
 the man who took the microphone and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.600
 second branch it will be 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.959
 mini-play I think you already 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.310
 read the name of the tour this year 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.380
 which classmates refer we 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.540
 decided to remember those most beautiful 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.360
 the years 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.780
 the years that gave us a lot 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.850
 the main impetus for further development 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.270
 we chose precisely in those school 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.530
 years who we should be in the future and probably 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.760
 this platform the platform from which we 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.000
 repelled past having to 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.280
 today this is the present in which we 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.570
 live we are engaged really by 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.760
 Russian cities we pass 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.040
 workshops and some time we 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.810
 we pay to the younger generation by the way in this 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.400
 year maybe even those children who 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.989
 participated in our workshops 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.920

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.769

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.230

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.510

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.959

 found a cup and gloom try also in 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.430
 sport and its there is a certain development 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.070
 just a younger generation is learning on 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.270
 those results that are already at this 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.580
 moment exists 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.419
 and as time goes on the development of course young people 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.419
 already study a little bit 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.119
 Chris not 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.960
