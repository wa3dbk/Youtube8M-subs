00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello guys welcome to prepare the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.809
 puntocom selectivity we go with a video 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.960
 of biology within the topic of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.429
 cellular structure cellular organization 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.820
 and after having recorded the two 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.550
 videos two videos where I made a good 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.160
 outline a good scheme more like 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.810
 scheme of what the cell is the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.250
 characteristics of the eukaryotic cell and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 the characteristics of the cell 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.750
 prokaryotes came up in this video 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 you can indicate in one in a cell the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.100
 different parts the different organs 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.920
 those who have seen what I have 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.300
 indicated in the video of the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.400
 development of the eukaryotic cell as 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.760
 of the cell but I wanted 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.710
 as you can see there on the screen I have placed 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.080
 a cell with the different organs in 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.110
 a cell with a section with a 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.990
 longitudinal section and other section 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.690
 transversal where as I say as you see 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.000
 there are all the organelles and 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.660
 the corresponding blank space 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.510
 to carry out on your part your 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.660
 good stuffing I will indicate by 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.150
 How nice this is a question that 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.820
 can win a few can is a 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.580
 question that they can ask you and it is 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.100
 important that you know what the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.040
 name associated with the image of each one 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.260
 of the organs that are found that 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.360
 they are in the cell is worth as 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.280
 I say there you have it silent but act 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.020
 followed you will have already with the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.050
 names corresponding to each of 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.610
 them me 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.330
 good even though you're going to have the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.980
 solution I do what I suggest is 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.100
 that you try in the first place 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.520
 answer it put you the names 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.890
 in agreement and if you have any doubt then 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.530
 logically look at the transparency or 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.800
 the next image next image that 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.900
 is what you have now is worth where it is 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.520
 exactly the same as before only 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.130
 now with the names on but I 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.320
 I say before you get here it's important 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.119
 that you make an effort that you try 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.530
 place the name of each of them 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.420
 ok and if you have any doubt then 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.960
 you get here right let's go 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.480
 commenting on all of them I think that 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.830
 most are easy if you have already 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.110
 studied the subject of the eukaryotic cell 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.370
 and that of the prokaryotic cell I think 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.380
 that are easy let's start with 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.540
 top right is worth 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.490
 and well you see that there are two 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.070
 images one what would be the one with 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.180
 it would correspond to the interior of the cell 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.489
 and another one already extracted from the cell 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.469
 placed already a little more enlarged 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.290
 already placed outside so that you give him no 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.219
 I remember well the first one that would be the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.840
 number one 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.450
 this agreement look at it and compare it with the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.549
 number five see her so much look at her so much 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.799
 inside as well as outside in the 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.299
 inside the cell as already enlarged and 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.459
 there you have an endoplasmic reticulum 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.360
 there is endoplasmic reticulum that in the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.240
 case of the one 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.640
 in the case of 1 is a reticle 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.220
 endoplasmic smooth while in the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.400
 case of 5 is an endoplasmic reticulum 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.060
 rough associated with clear proteins 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.760
 also in the detail of proximity 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.310
 which has the plasma reticulum or the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.040
 rough endoplasmic that has with the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.950
 evidently efficient core and due 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.910
 to protein synthesis according and its 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 relationship with the DNA and with the rn the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.570
 number 2 where you have there is would be 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.209
 well it's a little bit the border is 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.120
 a little bit what defines the cell 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.760
 eukaryotic is the plasma membrane is worth 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.520
 Here, I'm only mentioning the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.940
 structures and without deepening that we already 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.739
 the time will come without deepening in the 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.150
 characteristics of the organelles of 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.030
 agreement of each of these 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.069
 the number 3 good because it's the ball or the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.569
 ball that is inside of 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.579
 the sphere that is in the 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.709
 inside the cell that is where it 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.069
 find all the genetic material 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.390
 both in DNA and in the rn and it is the 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.069
 core of the cell is worth 4 there what 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.079
 you have also good in 4 can 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.000
 take us a bit of deception if we see it 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.070
 inside the cell because no 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.289
 we see nothing is an arrow that as you see 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.780
 is marking the volume in space 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.820
 the day is reflected in him and plasma of 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.590
 that cell but that's where it 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.780
 find what is really going to give 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.090
 shape that cell and prevent it from 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.510
 crush and prevent it from acquiring a form 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.100
 different is the cytoskeleton is like in 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.470
 our skeleton that we but that we 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.330
 shapes us and in the bones is 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.060
 our skeleton the cell would be what 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.780
 same but cytoskeleton that would be the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.919
 number 4 the number 5 as I said good 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.590
 well, that's endoplasmic reticulum 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.770
 rough and the number 6 that is 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.720
 Associate you see an arrow out one 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.040
 Arrow of rugged endoplasmic removal 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.510
 extended have 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.560
 communities that form the ribosome 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.510
 completely related to the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.720
 protein synthesis and there you have even 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.930
 a filament that reminds the rn that 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.360
 will result in the subsequent room a 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.670
 filament between the two subunits that 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.220
 will lead later to the as I said 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.040
 kitchen synthesis is number six the 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.620
 number seven two structures that 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.920
 find related to the division 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.170
 brain that are the centers of agreement 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.380
 there you have it number seven 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.180
 Cylindrical forms are formed by 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.270
 microtubules just like it happened 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.420
 also as with the cytoskeleton and the 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.110
 micro is the component we will see again 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.140
 its structure its structure later 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.030
 the number 8 is the mitochondria the 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.520
 structure of the organ the key organelle 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.530
 in cellular respiration but the key 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.200
 in obtaining energy so that the 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.170
 cell can develop and the number 9 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.630
 it's related to the secretion is going to be 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.240
 the goal complex if you have 21 more 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.950
 expanded inside the cell that 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.010
 is where the arrow comes from and another one 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.810
 little bit below the smallest one more 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.970
 schematized of good agreement well here 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.180
 you have then the different organs 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.120
 cell phones is worth a little paul I say 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.340
 is one can put them in a cell and 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.170
 with different organs those who have and 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.000
 have to put him mute and have to 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.290
 the names well I'm from this scheme 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.580
 can help you to understand and 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.160
 Well, the different organs 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.170
 that the cell has its morphology and 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.790
 associate them to your name according 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.340
 you have any doubt with documentaries 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.690
 nadal and as always thanks for watching the 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.690
 videos thanks for being there
