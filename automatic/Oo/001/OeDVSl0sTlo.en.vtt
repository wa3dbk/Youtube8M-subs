00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.190
BEGIN.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.590
WITH THAT PART OF THE STORY.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.890
IT WAS NOT JUST ROBIN

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.930
WILLIAM'S CAREER THAT MADE HIM

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.280
SO BELOVED BUT SOMETHING THAT

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.340
SET HIM APART FROM THE REST.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.940
THAT'S THE DISBELIEF AND

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.140
REACTION FROM THE PEOPLE

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.840
OUTSIDE.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.040
ÃºROM YOUNG --

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.340
MILEY CYRUS TWEETED IT, AND

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.520
THAT'S HOW I GOT IT.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.550
TO THE OLDER FANS WHO

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.950
REMEMBER ROBYN WILLIAMS FROM

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.650
MORNING AND BE MINDY, THE TV

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.420
SHOW.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.290
PEOPLE WE TALKED TO WERE ALL

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.090
AFFECTED.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.300
MRS. DOUBT FIRE.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.180
SSOCKED, I WAS SAD.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.850
GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM!

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.910
IT SAID ROBYN WILLIAMS DEAD.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.180
AT THE PLAZA THEATER, HE SAW

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.780
WILLIAMS PERFORM LIVE AT

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.590
PRINCETON.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.120
HE WAS LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.320
EVER SEEN.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.890
HE WAS THE LAST GREAT COMEDIAN.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.470
HE WAS A BRILLIANT ARCHITECT.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.630
HE REMEMBERS WILLIAMS FOR

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.640
CHARITIES AND TROOPS OVERSEAS,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.940
BUT HE THINKS THAT WILLIAMS'

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.010
SHEER TALENT IS WHAT PEOPLE

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.080
DETECT CONNECTED WITH.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.550
PEOPLE IDENTIFIED WITH THAT.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.850
THAT'S WHAT REALLY CAPTURES

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.950
PEOPLE'S IMAGINATIONS.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.300
GOOD PEOPLE, IN HOLLYWOOD, AND

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.000
THE ONES THAT PEOPLE

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.260
REALLY -- ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.730
TALENT.
