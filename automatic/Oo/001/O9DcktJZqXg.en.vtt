00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
without it as it comes with wire so you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.539 
without it as it comes with wire so you
can<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.799> wired<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:31.549> and

and i recommend but i recommend using it
without<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.600> wire<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.530> much<00:01:43.710> more

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
without the wire it's much more
