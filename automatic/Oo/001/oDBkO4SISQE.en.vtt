one but usually you want to change it to
three<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:51.390> warp<00:00:51.629> number<00:00:52.820> on<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.090> map<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.780> only

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
three the warp number on this map I only

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.700 
three the warp number on this map I only
have<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.540> put<00:00:57.600> 0<00:00:57.989> my

have one more so I'm going to put 0 my
bank<00:00:59.040> is<00:00:59.250> 43<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.000> map<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.860> when<00:01:01.980> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
bank is 43 and map is one so when I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
bank is 43 and map is one so when I
click<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.400> do<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.790> say<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.110> everything

click go do I say and then if everything
works<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.159> Warped<00:01:05.400> added<00:01:05.759> that<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.690> corpus

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
works the Warped added that the corpus

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.590 
works the Warped added that the corpus
linked<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> should<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.009> highlighted<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
linked it should be highlighted and for
