00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.050
 I learned from fellow students it was 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.180
 There were quite a lot in the year 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.310
 scholarship has by this one foundation 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410
 The arson is the one in the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.270
 fall and then I have two 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.140
 girlfriends thought come closer try 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.050
 Just do it 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.300
 maybe we are lucky I have one 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.249
 Get e-mail from our college 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.140
 from our high school secretariat the 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.120
 have pointed it out and then 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.679
 I thought hurt me so sorry it can 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.319
 not so I just apply 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.879
 So I myself have myself 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:52.329
 not advertised at maxxim program over 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.519
 the proposed by the examination office bavaria 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.269
 because of the notes, so I'm just 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.059
 come to this 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.219
 So I have the first of the foundation 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.899
 times in my education if experienced 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.970
 you also study on the second 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.950
 educational path and then experienced 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.920
 that it's close to this union 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:23.810
 She also gives scholarship scholarships 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:27.050
 Gives a welcome donation of 300 Euro every month 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.270
 150 euros of this are subsidized by the state 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.030
 150 euro from any for all company 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.850
 And these are also theirs 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.500
 Scholars themselves and it works 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.210
 But I can do that for years afterwards 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.100
 Apply again as it is called 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.230
 it may take up to three years ausreizen 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.670
 if you 're lucky so the 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.460
 Support is so you get in 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.960
 semester around 100 euros outside of 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.720
 this performance is just like that 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.660
 also summer academy can go where you can 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.840
 studying vacation with you 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.700
 then has the different people live 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.330
 possibility that one spoke brussels 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.940
 can make 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.670
 soft skills seminars can participate and 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.380
 especially over a longer one 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.760
 so period is promoted 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.470
 not only as twelfth the mister 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:21.740
 usually with eligible but just as well 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:23.480
 the master level so i joined 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.120
 the foundation is advertised respectively 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.610
 at the group in Nuremberg 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.600
 i have been invited and im 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.060
 Appraised by two students 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.500
 and then this review went on 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.690
 the recording committees 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.840
 I was also invited by 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.180
 so-called trust lecturers of the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.910
 appraised study progress and then 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.319
 just a commission meets the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.170
 decision on the recording or 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.790
 refuse a little bit of us 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.620
 problems but no notes get in the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.330
 preclinical part then we are first 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.130
 to all professors and lecturers 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.770
 gone and got our points in 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.380
 Let's translate notes and have it 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.150
 Let's give birth and then you have to 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.940
 also write a motivational letter 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.300
 in English exactly and then there was that way 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.530
 a tool on the internet everything imprinted 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.530
 that 's it then 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.410
 Often it is just like that 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.660
 financial area of the schoenberg if 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.740
 because it supports books etc 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.930
 what you need everything and I say 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.570
 let's have it as long as we have been there 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.010
 march with the action program too much 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.540
 experience but now also with collected 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.010
 but there are often like this 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.360
 originating tables who I always 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.460
 do not meet there again 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.080
 invitations then can in addition also 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.700
 all are exchanging 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.550
 again just represented 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.680
 So there are differences in the study 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.690
 not really big, i am totally 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.760
 free in the design of the study must 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.490
 However, only semester accountability 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.870
 only file about the progress of the study 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.000
 has already changed a lot so 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.610
 Actually I'm pretty pretty 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.750
 get a lot of contact new companies where 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.430
 Otherwise, you do not actually have any contact 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.280
 because it was then just sometimes 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.140
 Meeting or a tour on the campus 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.820
 was what we students then organized 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.799
 have for our conveyor companies 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.690
 that means you have a lot of new ones 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.950
 People got to know from companies what 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.730
 a later time really much 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.110
 can bring 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.060
 yes we were then invited 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.680
 from us have from our father company 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.900
 sometimes to eat or to 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.730
 summer festivals and Christmas parties so 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.000
 it was so immersed in a 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.760
 working life with vitamin b actually and 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.260
 that was great what generally that 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.060
 Studying concerns it is already 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.260
 just so motivational thrust and man 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.670
 thinks sometimes the money gets 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.740
 Now you do not get it for nothing 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.270
 means one would like somehow now also 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.070
 prove that you deserve it and 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.330
 then maybe exerted himself again 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.470
 a little bit more than you might 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.470
 even without doing
