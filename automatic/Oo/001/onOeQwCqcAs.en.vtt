00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.799 
get cut out with a set of rail cutters
once<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.669> glue<00:02:02.849> is<00:02:02.880> cured<00:02:03.209> you<00:02:03.359> just<00:02:03.539> snip

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:03.809 
once the glue is cured you just snip

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:07.849 
once the glue is cured you just snip
them<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:06.329> finished<00:02:06.659> track<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.109> glued<00:02:07.739> in

of<00:02:10.860> straight<00:02:11.370> track<00:02:11.549> like<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:13.260> kind<00:02:13.439> of

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
of straight track like this it's kind of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.450 
of straight track like this it's kind of
nice<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> have

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
nice to have

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.040 
nice to have
these<00:02:14.610> quick<00:02:14.850> sticks<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.390> don't<00:02:15.630> flex<00:02:15.900> oh

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
these quick sticks that don't flex oh

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.870 
these quick sticks that don't flex oh
you<00:02:16.140> want<00:02:16.320> them<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.620> stay<00:02:16.890> perfectly<00:02:17.550> straight

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you want them to stay perfectly straight

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.820 
you want them to stay perfectly straight
and<00:02:18.180> that's<00:02:18.690> why<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.050> produce<00:02:19.260> these<00:02:19.620> these

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and that's why we produce these these

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
and that's why we produce these these
are<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> non<00:02:20.220> flexible<00:02:20.790> or<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> straight

are the non flexible or the straight

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.560 
are the non flexible or the straight
strips<00:02:21.990> of<00:02:22.740> quick<00:02:23.010> sticks<00:02:23.310> they<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.300> web

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
strips of quick sticks they have a web

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.360 
strips of quick sticks they have a web
on<00:02:24.720> both<00:02:24.960> sides<00:02:25.320> all<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.800> way<00:02:25.950> down<00:02:26.190> that

on both sides all the way down that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.180 
on both sides all the way down that
keeps<00:02:26.610> them<00:02:26.820> from<00:02:27.030> flexing<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.410> simply

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
keeps them from flexing so you simply

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.550 
keeps them from flexing so you simply
glue<00:02:29.370> those<00:02:29.550> down<00:02:29.610> onto<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.120> road<00:02:30.330> bed<00:02:30.600> cut

fairly short about 10 inches long each

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.700 
fairly short about 10 inches long each
we<00:03:26.940> do<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.420> keep<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.840> shipping<00:03:28.350> cost

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
we do this to keep the shipping cost

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.470 
we do this to keep the shipping cost
down<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.460> makes<00:03:29.700> them<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.910> little<00:03:30.120> easier<00:03:30.360> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
down and makes them a little easier to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.750 
down and makes them a little easier to
handle<00:03:30.770> that<00:03:31.770> doesn't<00:03:32.100> create<00:03:32.190> any<00:03:32.310> issues

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
handle that doesn't create any issues

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.520 
handle that doesn't create any issues
and<00:03:32.910> using<00:03:33.180> though<00:03:33.330> because<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:33.870> each<00:03:34.110> quick

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
and using though because with each quick

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.100 
and using though because with each quick
stick<00:03:34.830> strip<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.210> purchase<00:03:36.630> you'll<00:03:36.870> get

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
stick strip that you purchase you'll get

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.620 
stick strip that you purchase you'll get
a<00:03:37.290> set<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.160> these<00:03:38.340> joiners<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.180> what<00:03:39.480> this

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
a set of these joiners and what this

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.410 
a set of these joiners and what this
does<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.200> allow<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.710> join<00:03:41.060> pieces<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.240> them

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
does is allow you to join pieces of them

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.210 
does is allow you to join pieces of them
together<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.620> I'll<00:03:43.710> show<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.980> how<00:03:44.070> they<00:03:44.190> work

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
together so I'll show you how they work

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.610 
together so I'll show you how they work

and<00:03:55.170> these<00:03:55.650> just<00:03:55.890> simply<00:03:56.040> pop<00:03:56.580> out<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.940> here

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
and these just simply pop out of here

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.550 
and these just simply pop out of here
designed<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.490> slip<00:04:00.020> over<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.140> edge<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.440> the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.910 
designed to slip over the edge of the
tie<00:04:01.740> like<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.490> mean<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.920> slide

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
tie like this I mean it's just a slide

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.670 
tie like this I mean it's just a slide
set<00:04:05.220> like<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.600> you<00:04:06.600> put<00:04:06.780> one<00:04:06.960> on<00:04:06.990> each<00:04:07.350> side

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
set like that you put one on each side

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.010 
set like that you put one on each side
like<00:04:08.420> this<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:11.150> now<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.180> piece<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.810> joined

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
like this and now that piece is joined

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.310 
like this and now that piece is joined
together<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.500> still<00:04:13.830> flexible<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:16.170> by

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
together and still flexible so by

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.720 
together and still flexible so by
joining<00:04:16.590> multiple<00:04:16.890> lengths<00:04:17.460> of<00:04:17.609> these

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
joining multiple lengths of these

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.670 
joining multiple lengths of these
together<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.870> can<00:04:19.049> create<00:04:19.350> unlimited

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
together you can create unlimited

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.280 
together you can create unlimited
lengths<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:20.640> track<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.210> you<00:04:21.720> simply<00:04:21.930> just

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
lengths of track and you simply just

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.200 
lengths of track and you simply just
glue<00:04:22.650> them<00:04:22.830> down<00:04:23.070> along<00:04:23.490> your<00:04:23.850> center<00:04:24.150> line

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
glue them down along your center line

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.450 
glue them down along your center line
when<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.050> glue<00:04:25.200> cures<00:04:25.470> these<00:04:25.800> pop<00:04:26.160> right<00:04:26.400> back

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
when the glue cures these pop right back

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.170 
when the glue cures these pop right back
off<00:04:26.880> again

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
off again

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.480 
off again
they're<00:04:28.600> designed<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.200> leave<00:04:29.380> that<00:04:29.650> gap<00:04:30.010> in

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
they're designed to leave that gap in

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.640 
they're designed to leave that gap in
between<00:04:30.700> each<00:04:31.150> section<00:04:31.450> with<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.230> correct

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
between each section with the correct

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.220 
between each section with the correct
spacing<00:04:32.980> so<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.430> can<00:04:33.670> finish<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.480> off<00:04:34.600> with<00:04:34.870> a

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
spacing so you can finish it off with a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.560 
spacing so you can finish it off with a
piece<00:04:35.530> of<00:04:35.680> track<00:04:35.890> built<00:04:36.160> in<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:37.180> one<00:04:37.390> of<00:04:37.420> our

using these clips you can join these

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.340 
using these clips you can join these
strips<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.940> flexible<00:04:43.420> ones<00:04:43.600> together<00:04:43.810> or<00:04:44.200> you

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
strips the flexible ones together or you

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.910 
strips the flexible ones together or you
can<00:04:44.500> join<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:45.040> flexible<00:04:45.910> strip<00:04:46.240> with<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:46.990> non

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
can join a flexible strip with a non

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.070 
can join a flexible strip with a non
flexible<00:04:48.490> or<00:04:48.640> a<00:04:48.670> straight<00:04:49.120> strip<00:04:49.450> like<00:04:49.870> this
