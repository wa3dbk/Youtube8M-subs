alright<00:00:09.809> we're<00:00:09.929> looking<00:00:10.110> at<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> vgn-fw<00:00:12.080> 590

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
alright we're looking at the vgn-fw 590

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.440 
alright we're looking at the vgn-fw 590
okay<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> sony<00:00:14.040> vaio<00:00:14.340> very<00:00:15.059> nice<00:00:15.299> very

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
okay this is a sony vaio very nice very

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.269 
okay this is a sony vaio very nice very
interesting<00:00:16.199> size<00:00:16.410> display<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:16.980> actually<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
interesting size display it's actually a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.900 
interesting size display it's actually a
16-point<00:00:18.029> 4-inch<00:00:18.449> display<00:00:18.800> it's<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.920> 16<00:00:20.369> by<00:00:20.699> 9

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
16-point 4-inch display it's a 16 by 9

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.300 
16-point 4-inch display it's a 16 by 9
native<00:00:21.390> aspect<00:00:22.140> ratio<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
native aspect ratio so it's the it's the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.230 
native aspect ratio so it's the it's the
shape<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.330> TV<00:00:24.630> not<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.019> shape<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:26.240> usual

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
shape of a TV not the shape of a usual

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
shape of a TV not the shape of a usual
computer<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:27.960> not<00:00:28.109> wide<00:00:28.380> screen<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:29.340> 16<00:00:29.640> by

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
computer it's not wide screen it's 16 by

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
computer it's not wide screen it's 16 by
9<00:00:29.880> wide<00:00:30.060> screen<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.840> more<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> TV

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
9 wide screen so it's a more like a TV

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.860 
9 wide screen so it's a more like a TV
and<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.980> actually<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> 1600<00:00:33.300> x<00:00:33.390> 900

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and it actually has a 1600 x 900

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.770 
and it actually has a 1600 x 900
resolution<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.090> that's<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> make<00:00:36.600> sure

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
resolution so that's going to make sure

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.869 
resolution so that's going to make sure
that<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.050> do<00:00:37.170> HD<00:00:37.590> video<00:00:38.010> natively<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
that you can do HD video natively in

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
that you can do HD video natively in
720p<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.260> even<00:00:40.350> run<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> little<00:00:40.770> bit

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
720p or you can even run it a little bit

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920 
720p or you can even run it a little bit
bigger<00:00:41.070> scale<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.360> full<00:00:42.510> sixteen

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
bigger scale it up to the full sixteen

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.990 
bigger scale it up to the full sixteen
by<00:00:43.050> nine<00:00:43.079> hundred<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.460> important<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
by nine hundred and it's important that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.430 
by nine hundred and it's important that
it<00:00:45.059> does<00:00:45.180> HD<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.840> does<00:00:46.140> have<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it does HD because it does have a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.470 
it does HD because it does have a
blu-ray<00:00:46.890> burner<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.940> here<00:00:48.180> actually<00:00:48.300> I'm

processor got 800 burger front side bus

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.539 
processor got 800 burger front side bus
it's<00:01:19.080> got<00:01:19.229> two<00:01:19.409> megabytes<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.830> l2<00:01:20.100> cache<00:01:20.340> so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it's got two megabytes of l2 cache so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.359 
it's got two megabytes of l2 cache so
very<00:01:20.759> very<00:01:20.790> nice<00:01:21.090> very<00:01:21.659> fast<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.650> 4<00:01:22.979> gigabytes

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
