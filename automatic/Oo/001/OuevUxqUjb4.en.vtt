00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.430 
designed for mobile however the fourth
generation<00:02:50.730> processor<00:02:51.209> does<00:02:51.600> require<00:02:52.110> a

due<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.880> fact<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.239> naming

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
due to the fact that the naming

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:24.330 
due to the fact that the naming
conventions<00:04:04.079> are<00:04:04.200> all<00:04:04.350> over<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.709> place

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.830 

here's<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.430> simple<00:04:25.610> graphic<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.180> help<00:04:26.390> clear<00:04:26.810> it

up<00:04:30.580> well<00:04:31.580> that's<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.060> for<00:04:32.150> processors<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:32.870> hope

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
up well that's it for processors I hope

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.960
