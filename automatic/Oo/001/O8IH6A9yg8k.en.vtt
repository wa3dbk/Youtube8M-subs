today's episode the subject is going to
be<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.059> filming<00:00:15.450> board<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.870> know<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.470> seems

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
be the filming board I know this seems

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.109 
be the filming board I know this seems
like<00:00:16.770> something<00:00:17.220> pretty<00:00:17.369> obvious<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.970> most

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
like something pretty obvious to most

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.000 
like something pretty obvious to most
people<00:00:18.539> but<00:00:19.140> we've<00:00:19.380> actually<00:00:19.529> had<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> lot<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
people but we've actually had a lot of

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.220 
people but we've actually had a lot of
subscribers<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.000> InFocus<00:00:21.510> requesting<00:00:22.080> this

subscribers to InFocus requesting this
so<00:00:23.039> I'm<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.640> break<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.939> down<00:00:23.970> explain

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
so I'm going to break it down explain

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.660 
so I'm going to break it down explain
what<00:00:25.380> goes<00:00:25.410> into<00:00:25.710> making<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.070> filming<00:00:26.400> board

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
what goes into making a filming board

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
what goes into making a filming board
and<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.510> benefits<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.080> using<00:00:28.349> them<00:00:28.500> when

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
and the benefits of using them when

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.679 
and the benefits of using them when
you're<00:00:28.980> shooting<00:00:29.160> skateboarding<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
you're shooting skateboarding so the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.569 
you're shooting skateboarding so the
main<00:00:30.840> difference<00:00:31.289> between<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.710> film<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.219> set<00:00:32.430> up

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
main difference between a film is set up

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.100 
main difference between a film is set up
and<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.090> regular<00:00:33.420> set<00:00:33.600> up<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.840> you'd<00:00:33.960> normally

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
and a regular set up that you'd normally

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.990 
and a regular set up that you'd normally
skate<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.649> doing<00:00:34.829> tricks<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.760> wheels

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
skate for doing tricks is the wheels

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.930 
skate for doing tricks is the wheels
filmers<00:00:36.780> will<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.110> cruiser<00:00:37.500> wheels<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.100> that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
filmers will use cruiser wheels and that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.670 
filmers will use cruiser wheels and that
means<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.450> are<00:00:39.480> softer<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.320> usually<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
means that they are softer and usually a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.709 
means that they are softer and usually a
little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:40.950> bigger<00:00:41.309> than<00:00:41.760> regular<00:00:42.360> skate

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
little bit bigger than regular skate

whereas<00:00:51.539> cruiser<00:00:51.960> wheels<00:00:52.199> tend<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> be

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
whereas cruiser wheels tend to be

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.170 
whereas cruiser wheels tend to be
somewhere<00:00:53.370> around<00:00:53.489> 85<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:55.230> 78<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.309> that

somewhere around 85 a to 78 a and that

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.549 
somewhere around 85 a to 78 a and that
just<00:00:57.360> means<00:00:57.510> they're<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> lot<00:00:57.960> softer<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
just means they're a lot softer the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
just means they're a lot softer the
lower<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> number<00:00:59.070> means<00:00:59.489> softer<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> wheel

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
lower the number means softer the wheel

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.029 
lower the number means softer the wheel
higher<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.050> number<00:01:01.350> gets<00:01:01.590> harder<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:01.980> harder

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
higher the number gets harder and harder

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
higher the number gets harder and harder

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
board lined up and the one thing in

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.850 
board lined up and the one thing in
common<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> big<00:01:11.640> soft<00:01:11.970> wheels<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
common is the big soft wheels and the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
common is the big soft wheels and the
benefits<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.850> when<00:01:15.180> you're<00:01:15.299> filming

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
benefits of this is when you're filming

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
benefits of this is when you're filming
on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> sidewalk<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.890> any<00:01:17.009> ground<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.820> get

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
on the sidewalk or any ground you get

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.660 
on the sidewalk or any ground you get
over<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.840> rocks<00:01:19.080> cracks<00:01:19.770> anything<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
over little rocks cracks anything that

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.179 
over little rocks cracks anything that
could<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.180> slight<00:01:21.540> obstruction<00:01:22.229> these

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
could be a slight obstruction these

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.469 
could be a slight obstruction these
wheels<00:01:23.430> will<00:01:23.610> handle<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.119> lot<00:01:24.299> better

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
wheels will handle them a lot better

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.800 
wheels will handle them a lot better
being<00:01:25.140> softer<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.979> smoother<00:01:26.549> ride<00:01:26.810> they

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
being softer they a smoother ride they

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.749 
being softer they a smoother ride they
make<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.409> little<00:01:28.680> bit<00:01:28.860> quieter<00:01:29.400> when<00:01:29.610> you're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
make it a little bit quieter when you're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
make it a little bit quieter when you're
behind<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> camera<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> tend<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> hear

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
behind the camera so you tend to hear

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.740 
behind the camera so you tend to hear
the<00:01:31.710> scale<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.250> filming<00:01:32.670> more<00:01:33.060> than<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the scale of your filming more than the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.100 
the scale of your filming more than the
film<00:01:34.110> s<00:01:34.259> wheels<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.299> by<00:01:36.299> being<00:01:36.540> softer<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
film s wheels and by being softer and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440 
film s wheels and by being softer and
smoother<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.430> little<00:01:38.700> bit<00:01:38.850> bigger<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
smoother and a little bit bigger you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.270 
smoother and a little bit bigger you
have<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> take<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> few<00:01:40.350> less<00:01:40.560> pushes<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.130> keep

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
have to take a few less pushes to keep

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.069 
have to take a few less pushes to keep
up<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> guy<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.210> you're<00:01:42.329> filming<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.840> string

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
up with a guy so you're filming a string

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.499 
up with a guy so you're filming a string
we're<00:01:43.259> going<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.740> smoother

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
we're going to be a lot smoother

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.609 
we're going to be a lot smoother
another<00:01:45.509> thing<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.869> filming<00:01:46.170> boards<00:01:46.470> I've

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
another thing with filming boards I've

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.050 
another thing with filming boards I've
noticed<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> lot<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.159> camera<00:01:47.460> guys<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
noticed a lot of camera guys like to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.940 
noticed a lot of camera guys like to
ride<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> wider<00:01:48.630> deck<00:01:48.960> perhaps<00:01:49.409> even<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.680> longer

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
ride a wider deck perhaps even a longer

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.859 
ride a wider deck perhaps even a longer
wheelbase<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> reason<00:01:51.780> for

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
wheelbase and I think the reason for

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.480 
wheelbase and I think the reason for
this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.380> spend<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.829> lot<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.979> time<00:01:53.280> with

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
this is you spend a lot of time with

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.219 
this is you spend a lot of time with
only<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.939> foot<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> board<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:55.020> back

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
only one foot on the board your back

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.319 
only one foot on the board your back
foots<00:01:55.500> quite<00:01:55.740> often<00:01:56.000> hanging<00:01:57.000> off<00:01:57.090> either

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
foots quite often hanging off either

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.690 
foots quite often hanging off either
dragons<00:01:57.960> control<00:01:58.409> speed<00:01:58.740> or<00:01:58.979> pushing<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.549> give

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
dragons control speed or pushing to give

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.670 
dragons control speed or pushing to give
you<00:01:59.790> some<00:01:59.939> speed<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.960> having<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.469> nice

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you some speed so having a nice

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.649 
you some speed so having a nice
comfortable<00:02:02.250> steady<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.909> underneath<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
comfortable steady right underneath you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.260 
comfortable steady right underneath you
is<00:02:03.960> pretty<00:02:04.290> essential<00:02:04.939> because<00:02:05.939> you're

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
is pretty essential because you're

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.029 
is pretty essential because you're
usually<00:02:06.479> focused<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.259> filming<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> guy

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
usually focused on filming the guy

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.650 
usually focused on filming the guy
looking<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> skater<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.119> looking<00:02:09.479> at<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
looking at the skater or looking at the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.279 
looking at the skater or looking at the
camera

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
camera

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.520 
camera
in<00:02:10.500> between<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.640> having<00:02:11.969> to<00:02:12.930> not<00:02:13.140> look<00:02:13.349> down

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
in between so having to not look down

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.839 
in between so having to not look down
and<00:02:13.739> check<00:02:13.950> where<00:02:14.129> your<00:02:14.219> board<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.609> or<00:02:14.730> where

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
and check where your board is or where

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.970 
and check where your board is or where
your<00:02:14.939> foot<00:02:15.090> placement<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.599> pretty<00:02:15.930> helpful<00:02:16.170> so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
your foot placement is pretty helpful so

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.410 
your foot placement is pretty helpful so
a<00:02:17.010> nice<00:02:17.250> steady<00:02:17.519> rate<00:02:17.790> anything<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.329> you're

the<00:02:37.049> wheels<00:02:37.439> I<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:37.980> now<00:02:38.010> are<00:02:38.340> actually

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
the wheels I have right now are actually

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.209 
the wheels I have right now are actually
a<00:02:38.879> G's<00:02:39.209> they<00:02:39.629> have<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.959> camera<00:02:40.349> on<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> side<00:02:40.920> so

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
a G's they have a camera on the side so

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.770 
a G's they have a camera on the side so
you<00:02:41.250> know<00:02:41.760> they're<00:02:42.000> definitely<00:02:42.209> fulfilling

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
you know they're definitely fulfilling

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.390 
you know they're definitely fulfilling
you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.379> probably<00:02:43.590> see<00:02:43.799> them<00:02:43.889> squishing<00:02:44.340> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
you can probably see them squishing a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.860 
you can probably see them squishing a
little<00:02:44.639> bit<00:02:44.760> when<00:02:44.939> I<00:02:44.970> squeeze<00:02:45.299> them<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
little bit when I squeeze them so the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.920 
little bit when I squeeze them so the
quite<00:02:46.079> soft<00:02:46.379> real<00:02:46.739> smooth<00:02:47.010> ride<00:02:47.359> a<00:02:48.359> little<00:02:48.780> bit

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
quite soft real smooth ride a little bit

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.289 
quite soft real smooth ride a little bit
smaller<00:02:49.409> than<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.709> lot<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.099> film<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.459> use<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:51.150> I

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
smaller than a lot of film is use but I

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.839 
smaller than a lot of film is use but I
like<00:02:51.569> them<00:02:51.780> because<00:02:51.930> they're<00:02:52.919> smooth<00:02:53.609> on<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
like them because they're smooth on the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.339 
like them because they're smooth on the
street<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.389> when<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:54.659> end<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.109> skate

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
street but when you end up in a skate

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.949 
street but when you end up in a skate
park<00:02:55.400> they're<00:02:56.400> not<00:02:56.579> too<00:02:56.790> squishy<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.659> you<00:02:57.840> can

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
park they're not too squishy and you can

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.270 
park they're not too squishy and you can
actually<00:02:58.079> keep<00:02:58.379> your<00:02:58.500> speed<00:02:58.769> up<00:02:58.799> following

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
actually keep your speed up following

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.099 
actually keep your speed up following
someone<00:02:59.639> through<00:02:59.819> bowls<00:03:00.060> or<00:03:00.389> lanes<00:03:00.629> like<00:03:00.900> that

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
someone through bowls or lanes like that

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.199 
someone through bowls or lanes like that
whereas<00:03:01.439> I<00:03:01.680> find<00:03:02.280> if<00:03:02.430> they're<00:03:02.639> too<00:03:02.879> soft

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
whereas I find if they're too soft

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.000 
whereas I find if they're too soft
sometimes<00:03:04.079> you<00:03:04.230> have<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.379> hard<00:03:04.590> time<00:03:04.680> when

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
sometimes you have a hard time when

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.349 
sometimes you have a hard time when
you're<00:03:05.129> pumping<00:03:05.459> through<00:03:05.579> transitions<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
you're pumping through transitions to

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:07.699 
you're pumping through transitions to
keep<00:03:06.510> your<00:03:06.629> speed<00:03:06.840> up<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.230> following<00:03:07.620> a

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
keep your speed up and following a

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.190 
keep your speed up and following a

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
you're going to get bigger cruiser

you're going to get bigger cruiser
wheels<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.060> probably<00:03:12.209> want<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.540> start

wheels<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:19.109> ride<00:03:19.500> my<00:03:19.650> trucks<00:03:19.889> fairly<00:03:20.400> loose

the<00:03:36.060> shop<00:03:36.299> my<00:03:37.229> last<00:03:37.409> recommendation<00:03:37.709> is

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
the shop my last recommendation is

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.890 
the shop my last recommendation is
getting<00:03:38.699> decent<00:03:38.849> bearings<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.479> those<00:03:39.659> wheels

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
getting decent bearings in those wheels

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.689 
getting decent bearings in those wheels
there's<00:03:40.290> no<00:03:40.409> point<00:03:40.650> having<00:03:40.769> nice<00:03:41.069> soft<00:03:41.370> smooth

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
there's no point having nice soft smooth

there's no point having nice soft smooth

the smoothie of filming is going to be

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.490 
the smoothie of filming is going to be
so<00:03:50.729> get<00:03:51.000> some<00:03:51.120> decent<00:03:51.269> bearings<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.840> there<00:03:52.019> if

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
so get some decent bearings in there if

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.020 
so get some decent bearings in there if
you're<00:03:52.680> going<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.889> afford<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.250> drop<00:03:53.819> some<00:03:54.000> cash

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
you're going to afford it drop some cash

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.390 
you're going to afford it drop some cash
on<00:03:54.359> some<00:03:54.389> Swiss<00:03:54.900> those<00:03:55.829> things<00:03:56.040> are<00:03:56.159> amazing

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
on some Swiss those things are amazing

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.250 
on some Swiss those things are amazing
and<00:03:56.790> they'll<00:03:56.879> last<00:03:57.150> through<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.389> long<00:03:57.629> time<00:03:57.959> if

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and they'll last through a long time if

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.860 
and they'll last through a long time if
not<00:03:59.129> just<00:03:59.189> get<00:03:59.579> regular<00:03:59.729> bearings<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.449> take

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
not just get regular bearings and take

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.969 
not just get regular bearings and take
good<00:04:01.019> care<00:04:01.199> of<00:04:01.260> them<00:04:01.470> make<00:04:01.620> sure<00:04:01.650> they're<00:04:01.889> not

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
good care of them make sure they're not

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.229 
good care of them make sure they're not
squeaking<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.609> interfering<00:04:03.060> with<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
squeaking and interfering with the

squeaking and interfering with the

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
filming so that's about it for a filming

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.280 
filming so that's about it for a filming
board<00:04:06.090> there<00:04:06.329> really<00:04:06.479> isn't<00:04:06.689> too<00:04:06.930> much<00:04:07.079> to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
board there really isn't too much to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.199 
board there really isn't too much to
explain<00:04:07.560> on<00:04:07.799> this<00:04:07.919> subject<00:04:08.159> like<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.909> said<00:04:09.090> the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
explain on this subject like I said the

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.149 
explain on this subject like I said the
main<00:04:09.329> difference<00:04:09.750> between<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.169> setup<00:04:10.439> and<00:04:10.889> a

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
main difference between this setup and a

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.589 
main difference between this setup and a
regular<00:04:11.459> set<00:04:11.639> up<00:04:11.729> you'd<00:04:11.909> be<00:04:11.970> skating<00:04:12.269> doing

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
regular set up you'd be skating doing

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.349 
regular set up you'd be skating doing
tricks<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:13.049> other<00:04:13.590> wheels<00:04:13.829> if<00:04:14.669> you<00:04:14.819> get<00:04:15.000> nice

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
tricks on other wheels if you get nice

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.509 
tricks on other wheels if you get nice
soft<00:04:15.750> wheels<00:04:16.019> or<00:04:16.440> smoothing<00:04:16.979> out<00:04:17.130> your<00:04:17.190> ride

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
soft wheels or smoothing out your ride

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.399 
soft wheels or smoothing out your ride
will<00:04:18.000> take<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.209> few<00:04:18.450> less<00:04:18.630> pushes<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.109> keep<00:04:19.260> up

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
will take a few less pushes to keep up

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.440 
will take a few less pushes to keep up
with<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.620> guy<00:04:19.739> you're<00:04:19.919> following<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.519> the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
with the guy you're following and the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.300 
with the guy you're following and the
softer<00:04:21.810> they<00:04:21.900> are<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.229> quieter<00:04:22.680> they'll<00:04:22.860> be

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
softer they are the quieter they'll be

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.400 
softer they are the quieter they'll be
so<00:04:23.430> you'll<00:04:24.210> hear<00:04:24.389> more<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.870> audio<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.320> the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
so you'll hear more of the audio of the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.870 
so you'll hear more of the audio of the
guy<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.770> you're<00:04:25.860> filming<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.490> hopefully

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
guy that you're filming and hopefully

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.550 
guy that you're filming and hopefully
less<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.330> audio<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.930> guy<00:04:28.050> behind<00:04:28.410> the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
less of the audio the guy behind the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.700 
less of the audio the guy behind the
camera<00:04:28.740> falling<00:04:29.250> around<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:30.169> if<00:04:31.169> you're

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
camera falling around and if you're

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.129 
camera falling around and if you're
dedicated<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.910> filming<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.480> recommend<00:04:34.020> getting

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
dedicated to filming I recommend getting

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.740 
dedicated to filming I recommend getting
a<00:04:34.320> full<00:04:34.560> set<00:04:34.830> up<00:04:34.980> that's<00:04:35.430> for<00:04:35.970> filming<00:04:36.360> only

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
a full set up that's for filming only

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.230 
a full set up that's for filming only
and<00:04:36.960> it's<00:04:37.230> not<00:04:37.380> expensive<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:38.100> can<00:04:38.130> take<00:04:39.090> some

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
and it's not expensive you can take some

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.390 
and it's not expensive you can take some
hand-me-down<00:04:39.660> trucks<00:04:40.050> leftover<00:04:40.560> trucks<00:04:40.830> but

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
hand-me-down trucks leftover trucks but

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.890 
hand-me-down trucks leftover trucks but
a<00:04:41.430> driftwood<00:04:41.850> board<00:04:42.240> doesn't<00:04:42.570> need<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.810> have

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
a driftwood board doesn't need to have

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.300 
a driftwood board doesn't need to have
any<00:04:42.930> pop<00:04:43.320> really<00:04:43.710> just<00:04:43.889> needs<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.160> be<00:04:44.280> a

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
any pop really just needs to be a

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.670 
any pop really just needs to be a
comfortable<00:04:44.669> ride<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.270> that<00:04:45.380> way<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.440> have<00:04:46.650> a

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
comfortable ride and that way you have a

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.740 
comfortable ride and that way you have a
board<00:04:46.980> that<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.190> used<00:04:47.490> too<00:04:47.669> because<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.720> know
