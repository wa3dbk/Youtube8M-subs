00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
of cod and a general rule of thumb is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.980 
of cod and a general rule of thumb is
you<00:01:13.820> see<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> thickness<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> cod<00:01:17.570> 1<00:01:18.570> inch

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you see the thickness on this cod 1 inch

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.590 
you see the thickness on this cod 1 inch
equals<00:01:19.530> 10<00:01:20.220> minutes<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> time<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> oven

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
equals 10 minutes of time in the oven

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.700 
equals 10 minutes of time in the oven
generally<00:01:22.409> speaking<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.880> about
