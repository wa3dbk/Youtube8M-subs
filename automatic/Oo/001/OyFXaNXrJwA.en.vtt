00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
a time you know for example in modern

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
a time you know for example in modern
warfare<00:01:25.649> 3<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.429> added<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:26.969> split<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
killstreaks so you had I guess assault

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.359 
killstreaks so you had I guess assault
support<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.079> specialist<00:01:31.679> kill<00:01:31.889> streaks<00:01:32.159> and

support and specialist kill streaks and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.760 
support and specialist kill streaks and
black<00:01:32.579> ops<00:01:32.819> 2<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.899> they<00:01:34.079> added<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> pic

black ops 2 you know they added the pic

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.709 
black ops 2 you know they added the pic
10<00:01:35.009> system<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.639> they<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.939> add<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.359> things

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
10 system so they just add little things
