00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
else that's not very interesting so

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.359 
else that's not very interesting so

pretty<00:01:11.880> interesting<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> helped<00:01:12.960> write<00:01:13.020> in

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
pretty interesting so I helped write in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.450 
pretty interesting so I helped write in
the<00:01:13.409> cheetah<00:01:13.740> now<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> got<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> make<00:01:14.430> sure

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the cheetah now you got to make sure

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.429

that<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> stay<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> cheetah<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.290> if

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that you stay in the cheetah because if

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.020 
that you stay in the cheetah because if
you<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> cheetah<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you do get out of the cheetah when the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
you do get out of the cheetah when the
game<00:01:18.299> ends<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.290> mission<00:01:19.590> ends<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.130> the

game ends or this mission ends then the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
game ends or this mission ends then the
glitch<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.939> work<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.270> make<00:01:21.420> sure<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
