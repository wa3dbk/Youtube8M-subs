this was there was just no way this is
going<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.400> feasible<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:11.040> was<00:03:11.190> already

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
going to be feasible it was already

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.510 
going to be feasible it was already
pouring<00:03:13.080> water<00:03:13.290> almost<00:03:13.800> by<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.160> time<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.370> get

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
pouring water almost by the time I get

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.729 
pouring water almost by the time I get
back<00:03:14.850> home<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:16.470> morning<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:19.080> by<00:03:19.380> flushing

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
back home this morning and by flushing

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.270 
back home this morning and by flushing
it<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.310> would<00:03:20.489> be<00:03:20.580> just<00:03:20.820> far<00:03:21.030> too<00:03:21.480> dangerous

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
it it would be just far too dangerous

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.740 
it it would be just far too dangerous
run<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.370> risk<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.790> hose<00:03:23.970> blowing<00:03:24.630> or

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
run the risk of a hose blowing or

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.920 
run the risk of a hose blowing or
something<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.709> 1/2<00:03:26.220> displeasure

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
something like it's on 1/2 displeasure

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:39.770 
something like it's on 1/2 displeasure
with<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:27.989> new<00:03:28.350> radiator<00:03:38.390> like<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.480> said<00:03:39.660> it

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
with the new radiator like I said it

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:49.930 
with the new radiator like I said it
just<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:40.140> not<00:03:40.350> what<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> was<00:03:41.850> hoping<00:03:41.880> for

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.670 

good<00:03:50.940> old<00:03:51.120> coffee<00:03:51.570> man<00:03:51.990> oh<00:03:54.170> right<00:03:55.170> made<00:03:55.440> about

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
good old coffee man oh right made about

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.350 
good old coffee man oh right made about
a<00:03:55.710> 10<00:03:56.100> millimeter<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:59.820> appropriate

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
a 10 millimeter and the appropriate

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.140 
a 10 millimeter and the appropriate
wrenches<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.810> get<00:04:00.960> that<00:04:01.110> off<00:04:06.080> that<00:04:07.080> might<00:04:07.290> be<00:04:07.470> a

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
wrenches to get that off that might be a

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.900 
wrenches to get that off that might be a
job<00:04:09.150> itself<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:10.310> don't<00:04:11.310> know<00:04:11.400> we'll<00:04:11.520> find<00:04:11.760> out

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
job itself I don't know we'll find out

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.170 
job itself I don't know we'll find out
first<00:04:13.040> go<00:04:14.040> ahead<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.280> get<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.610> hose<00:04:14.910> off<00:04:17.180> mm

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
first go ahead and get this hose off mm

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.120 
first go ahead and get this hose off mm
like<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.510> made<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> video<00:04:18.900> last<00:04:19.290> summer<00:04:19.709> when<00:04:20.100> I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
like I made a video last summer when I

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.659 
like I made a video last summer when I
did<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:25.100> here<00:04:26.100> we<00:04:26.250> go

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
it's clamp just tuck this out of the way

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:55.090 
it's clamp just tuck this out of the way
and<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.570> next<00:04:48.840> thing<00:04:49.080> is<00:04:49.700> cooler<00:04:50.700> lines

it's all loose time ready to get it out
of<00:05:33.690> here<00:05:34.310> there<00:05:35.310> we<00:05:35.430> go<00:05:35.660> now<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:37.320> will<00:05:37.440> come<00:05:37.500> on

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
of here there we go now it will come on

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.800 
of here there we go now it will come on
out<00:05:39.770> what<00:05:40.770> now

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:54.360 

just<00:05:46.810> try<00:05:46.960> it<00:05:47.020> again<00:05:52.110> we're<00:05:53.110> close<00:05:53.380> I<00:05:53.740> see<00:05:54.220> what

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
just try it again we're close I see what

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:15.690 
just try it again we're close I see what
it<00:05:54.460> is<00:05:56.070> tilt<00:05:57.070> it<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.940> it's<00:06:13.210> out<00:06:13.360> of<00:06:13.390> here<00:06:14.700> I've

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
it is tilt it and it's out of here I've

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.010 
it is tilt it and it's out of here I've
almost<00:06:15.880> gotten<00:06:16.390> everything<00:06:17.850> transferred

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
almost gotten everything transferred

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.750 
almost gotten everything transferred
over<00:06:20.910> get<00:06:21.910> the<00:06:22.030> new<00:06:22.300> adapters<00:06:23.230> on<00:06:23.740> I'm<00:06:24.400> leaving

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
over get the new adapters on I'm leaving

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.660 
over get the new adapters on I'm leaving
all<00:06:24.880> the<00:06:25.000> caps<00:06:25.240> on<00:06:25.890> for<00:06:26.890> time<00:06:27.070> for<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.460> time

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
all the caps on for time for the time

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:36.030 
all the caps on for time for the time
being<00:06:28.060> anyway<00:06:30.420> now<00:06:32.100> the<00:06:33.100> next<00:06:33.790> thing<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:35.440> put

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
being anyway now the next thing is put

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.860 
being anyway now the next thing is put
these<00:06:36.190> little<00:06:36.430> adapter<00:06:36.820> or<00:06:37.540> little

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
these little adapter or little

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.100 
these little adapter or little
insulators<00:06:38.650> on<00:06:38.830> these<00:06:39.220> right<00:06:39.460> here<00:06:39.930> it<00:06:40.930> took

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
insulators on these right here it took

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.920 
insulators on these right here it took
me<00:06:41.260> a<00:06:41.290> little<00:06:41.500> bit<00:06:41.650> to<00:06:41.800> figure<00:06:41.950> out<00:06:42.220> how<00:06:42.930> they

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
me a little bit to figure out how they

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.120 
me a little bit to figure out how they
go<00:06:44.080> on<00:06:44.110> or<00:06:44.740> how<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:44.920> get<00:06:45.190> them<00:06:45.340> on<00:06:46.710> but<00:06:47.710> after<00:06:47.890> I

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
go on or how to get them on but after I

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.740 
go on or how to get them on but after I
get<00:06:48.400> the<00:06:48.580> first<00:06:48.730> one<00:06:49.030> on<00:06:49.300> I<00:06:50.100> realized<00:06:51.100> I<00:06:51.750> was

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
get the first one on I realized I was

00:06:52.750 --> 00:07:02.610 
get the first one on I realized I was
doing<00:06:52.990> it

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.619 

this<00:07:03.620> has<00:07:03.770> been<00:07:03.889> the<00:07:04.039> hardest<00:07:04.280> part<00:07:04.400> of<00:07:04.879> the

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:05.629 
this has been the hardest part of the

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:23.580 
this has been the hardest part of the
job<00:07:05.840> so<00:07:06.319> far<00:07:06.349> anyway

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.920 

hooked<00:07:24.590> a<00:07:24.680> hole<00:07:24.860> in<00:07:24.949> the<00:07:25.039> bud<00:07:25.479> well<00:07:26.479> it's<00:07:26.750> no

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
hooked a hole in the bud well it's no

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.110 
hooked a hole in the bud well it's no
big<00:07:26.960> deal

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 
big deal

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.279 
big deal
