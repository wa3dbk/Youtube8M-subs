that by taking on a mascara brush last
era<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:55.100> just<00:02:55.490> darken<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.210> roots<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.600> little

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
era and I just darken the roots a little

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.570 
era and I just darken the roots a little
bit<00:02:56.990> to<00:02:57.140> give<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.440> more<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.680> bit<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.070> natural

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
bit to give it a more a bit of a natural

bit to give it a more a bit of a natural
color<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.150> didn't<00:02:59.720> do<00:02:59.810> that<00:02:59.960> all<00:03:00.170> over<00:03:00.200> because

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
color I didn't do that all over because

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.830 
color I didn't do that all over because
that's<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:01.520> for<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.760> part<00:03:02.180> when<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.360> want<00:03:02.690> my

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
that's just for that part when I want my

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.380 
that's just for that part when I want my
roots<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.260> look<00:03:03.410> darker<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.100> hey<00:03:04.640> if<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.210> don't

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
roots to look darker but hey if I don't

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.630 
roots to look darker but hey if I don't
want<00:03:05.690> my<00:03:05.900> roots<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.470> look<00:03:06.650> dark<00:03:09.220> then<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.340> just

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
want my roots to look dark then I just

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.130 
want my roots to look dark then I just
parted<00:03:11.240> someplace<00:03:11.600> else<00:03:11.900> arm<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:13.550> i<00:03:14.420> only<00:03:14.960> had

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
parted someplace else arm and i only had

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.590 
parted someplace else arm and i only had
black<00:03:15.470> mascara<00:03:16.100> home<00:03:16.520> or<00:03:16.820> i<00:03:16.880> could<00:03:16.970> only<00:03:17.120> find

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
black mascara home or i could only find

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.510 
black mascara home or i could only find
my<00:03:17.750> black<00:03:17.930> mascara<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.620> couldn't<00:03:18.950> find<00:03:19.100> my<00:03:19.220> dark

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
my black mascara I couldn't find my dark

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.970 
my black mascara I couldn't find my dark
brown<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:20.300> I<00:03:20.330> think<00:03:20.780> for<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.110> color<00:03:21.500> dark

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
brown but I think for this color dark

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.090 
brown but I think for this color dark
brown<00:03:22.370> would<00:03:23.120> be<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.390> bit<00:03:23.959> more<00:03:24.230> natural<00:03:24.440> and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
brown would be a bit more natural and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.949 
brown would be a bit more natural and
not<00:03:25.310> as<00:03:25.459> dramatic<00:03:26.030> as<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.360> black<00:03:26.600> if<00:03:26.840> you

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
not as dramatic as the black if you

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.860 
not as dramatic as the black if you
wanted<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.440> try<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:28.070> trick<00:03:28.850> this<00:03:29.420> can<00:03:29.840> be
