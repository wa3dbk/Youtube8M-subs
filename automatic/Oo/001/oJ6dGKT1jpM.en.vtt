00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
sometimes now all the times we times it

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.429 
sometimes now all the times we times it
could<00:02:37.409> be<00:02:37.499> really<00:02:37.709> tough<00:02:39.049> especially<00:02:40.049> if<00:02:40.349> you

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
could be really tough especially if you

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.319 
could be really tough especially if you
don't<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:40.769> moving<00:02:40.920> right<00:02:41.219> away<00:02:41.340> right<00:02:42.060> so

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
don't get moving right away right so

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.729 
don't get moving right away right so
know<00:02:42.599> what<00:02:42.870> you're<00:02:42.959> going<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.139> do<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.379> shoot<00:02:43.560> is

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
know what you're going to do is shoot is

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.000 
know what you're going to do is shoot is
halo<00:02:43.950> thing<00:02:44.250> until<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:44.639> turns<00:02:44.819> red<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:46.010> this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
halo thing until it turns red and this

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.110 
halo thing until it turns red and this
could<00:02:47.189> be<00:02:47.310> easier<00:02:47.340> said<00:02:47.730> than<00:02:47.819> done<00:02:47.879> because

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
could be easier said than done because

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.539 
could be easier said than done because
you<00:02:48.329> get<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> do<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.750> before<00:02:49.400> circle<00:02:50.400> all<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
you get to do it before circle all the

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.800 
you get to do it before circle all the
