live up to its expectations I'll have a
little<00:04:54.600> bit<00:04:54.720> little<00:04:55.140> doubt<00:04:55.350> of<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.560> on<00:04:55.710> my<00:04:55.830> hand

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
little bit little doubt of it on my hand

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.700 
little bit little doubt of it on my hand
right<00:04:56.190> here<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:57.420> says<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.960> dab<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.350> on<00:04:58.500> with

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
right here and it says to dab it on with

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.370 
right here and it says to dab it on with
your<00:04:58.860> finger<00:04:59.190> underneath<00:04:59.550> your<00:04:59.880> eye<00:05:00.290> so<00:05:01.290> we're

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
your finger underneath your eye so we're

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.010 
your finger underneath your eye so we're
going<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:01.560> do<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.830> as<00:05:02.480> you<00:05:03.480> can<00:05:03.570> see<00:05:03.810> that's

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
going to do that as you can see that's

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.800 
going to do that as you can see that's
pretty<00:05:04.320> opaque<00:05:05.180> so<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.210> might<00:05:06.390> have<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.630> little

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
pretty opaque so I might have a little

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.920 
pretty opaque so I might have a little
bit<00:05:07.020> too<00:05:07.230> much<00:05:08.420> have<00:05:09.420> a<00:05:09.450> little<00:05:09.660> bit<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:09.840> that

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
bit too much have a little bit of that

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.590 
bit too much have a little bit of that

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
off we're just going to put it on this I

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.250 
off we're just going to put it on this I
and<00:05:12.870> see<00:05:12.990> if<00:05:13.080> we<00:05:13.170> can<00:05:13.320> tell<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.560> difference<00:05:15.260> so

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
and see if we can tell the difference so

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:25.140 
and see if we can tell the difference so
I'm<00:05:16.320> just<00:05:16.470> dabbing<00:05:16.890> that<00:05:17.070> on
