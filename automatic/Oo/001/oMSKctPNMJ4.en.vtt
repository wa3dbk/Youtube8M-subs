00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
difference with this board is the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.959 
difference with this board is the

squash rails hardened up right on the
fins<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.320> give<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.590> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
fins to give you a little bit of a a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
fins to give you a little bit of a a
little<00:00:44.760> bit<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.150> tweak<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.720> bit<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.200> firm

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
little bit of tweak a little bit of firm

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.060 
little bit of tweak a little bit of firm
of<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.040> pivot<00:00:47.340> point<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.820> board

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
of a pivot point for the board

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.050 
of a pivot point for the board
it's<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.220> concave<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.760> makes<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
it's the concave that makes the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.910 
it's the concave that makes the
difference<00:00:51.240> really<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.770> got<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
difference really and it's got a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.190 
difference really and it's got a
relatively<00:00:53.370> straight<00:00:53.850> rail<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.079> this

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
relatively straight rail so what this

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.710 
relatively straight rail so what this
means<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> you've<00:00:55.740> got<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> board<00:00:56.450> and<00:00:57.450> it<00:00:57.540> gets

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
means is you've got a board and it gets

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.360 
means is you've got a board and it gets
a<00:00:57.810> bit<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.020> lift<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.500> concave<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
a bit of lift from the concave so it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.890 
a bit of lift from the concave so it
picks<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.760> speed<00:00:59.910> run<00:01:00.210> smoothly<00:01:00.450> quickly

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
picks up speed run smoothly quickly

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.229 
picks up speed run smoothly quickly
obviously<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.860> flat<00:01:02.130> so<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.579> paddles<00:01:03.000> dead

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
obviously it's flat so it paddles dead

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
obviously it's flat so it paddles dead
easily<00:01:03.630> and<00:01:03.750> gets<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.320> catches<00:01:04.649> waves

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
easily and gets in and catches waves

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.429 
easily and gets in and catches waves
easily<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:06.450> relatively<00:01:06.869> straight<00:01:07.170> rail

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
easily the relatively straight rail

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.260 
easily the relatively straight rail
keeps<00:01:07.829> it<00:01:08.009> in<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.189> straight<00:01:08.460> line<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.850> keeps<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
keeps it in a straight line and keeps it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.510 
keeps it in a straight line and keeps it
going<00:01:09.450> keeps<00:01:10.140> helps<00:01:10.470> maintain<00:01:10.650> speed

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
going keeps helps maintain speed

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
going keeps helps maintain speed
and<00:01:11.729> gives<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.300> bit<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> hold<00:01:12.720> even<00:01:13.170> in

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and gives you a bit of hold even in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.700 
and gives you a bit of hold even in
mushy<00:01:13.670> rubbishy<00:01:14.670> conditions<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.050> if<00:01:16.530> you're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
mushy rubbishy conditions so if you're

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.700 
mushy rubbishy conditions so if you're
thinking<00:01:16.830> about<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.159> groveler<00:01:18.500> but<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> don't

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
thinking about a groveler but you don't

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.710 
thinking about a groveler but you don't
want<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:19.979> pure<00:01:20.310> down<00:01:20.610> dirty<00:01:20.940> bottom<00:01:21.420> feeder

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
want to go pure down dirty bottom feeder

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.539 
want to go pure down dirty bottom feeder
type<00:01:21.900> groveler<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.979> should<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> think

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
type groveler you should have a think

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.660 
type groveler you should have a think
about<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.299> small<00:01:24.750> wave<00:01:24.960> performer<00:01:25.670> it's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
about this a small wave performer it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.340 
about this a small wave performer it's
going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.970> work<00:01:27.120> from<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:28.080> pretty<00:01:28.290> much

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
going to work from in pretty much

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.320 
going to work from in pretty much
anything<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.120> around

something<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:32.909> performanc<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:35.400> 90%<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
something more performanc but for 90% of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.130 
something more performanc but for 90% of
the<00:01:36.119> waves<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.479> most<00:01:36.750> people<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.049> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the waves that most people in this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
the waves that most people in this
country<00:01:37.200> surf<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> put<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> smile

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
country surf it's going to put a smile

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.530 
country surf it's going to put a smile
on<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.390> face<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> great<00:01:40.260> great<00:01:40.290> job

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
on your face and do a great great job

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.480 
on your face and do a great great job
it's<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.659> relatively<00:01:43.080> simple<00:01:43.380> shape<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:44.340> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it's a relatively simple shape as you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.510 
it's a relatively simple shape as you
can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.850> simple<00:01:45.799> isn't<00:01:46.799> necessarily<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.460> bad

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
can see simple isn't necessarily a bad

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.780 
can see simple isn't necessarily a bad
thing<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:49.590> does<00:01:49.799> exactly<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.610> says<00:01:50.640> on

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
thing it does exactly what it says on

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.780 
thing it does exactly what it says on
the<00:01:51.000> tin<00:01:51.560> captures<00:01:52.560> waves<00:01:52.799> gives<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the tin captures waves gives you the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.160 
the tin captures waves gives you the
chance<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.150> perform<00:01:54.510> a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.720> bit<00:01:54.900> more<00:01:55.049> than

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
chance to perform a little bit more than

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.719 
chance to perform a little bit more than
a<00:01:55.229> groveler<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.220> going<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.400> be<00:01:56.490> great

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
a groveler and it's going to be great

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.960 
a groveler and it's going to be great
fun<00:01:56.970> pretty<00:01:57.570> much<00:01:57.750> anybody<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.380> surf<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.970> if

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
fun pretty much anybody can surf this if
