00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.539 

you<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> guess<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.920> group<00:01:59.219> why<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.430> we

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you know so I guess we group why do we

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.719 
you know so I guess we group why do we
grow<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.939> well<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> made<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> decision<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
grow this well I made a decision to

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.100 
grow this well I made a decision to
include<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.909> our<00:02:03.030> list<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.390> apples<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.960> we

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
include it in our list of apples that we

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.160 
include it in our list of apples that we
would<00:02:04.350> grow<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:06.210> had<00:02:06.329> no<00:02:06.479> idea<00:02:06.509> what<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:06.990> would

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
would grow we had no idea what it would

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.119 
would grow we had no idea what it would
taste<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.530> until<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.840> first<00:02:10.200> tree<00:02:10.500> ripened

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
taste like until the first tree ripened

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.290 
taste like until the first tree ripened
and<00:02:12.140> it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
and it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.650 
and it
a lovely<00:02:13.690> Apple<00:02:14.380> very<00:02:15.340> short<00:02:15.730> shelf<00:02:16.090> life<00:02:16.240> it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
a lovely Apple very short shelf life it

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.440 
a lovely Apple very short shelf life it
really<00:02:16.870> would<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.290> ideal<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.970> tree<00:02:19.300> of

enjoy them for a few days because once

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.760 
enjoy them for a few days because once
there's<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.940> pick<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.660> run<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.200> keep<00:02:47.380> for<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.590> few

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
there's a pick to run you keep for a few

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.460 
there's a pick to run you keep for a few
days<00:02:47.950> say<00:02:48.190> they're<00:02:48.670> soft<00:02:49.090> ish<00:02:49.510> from<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.110> tree

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
days say they're soft ish from the tree

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.040 
days say they're soft ish from the tree
and<00:02:50.680> they<00:02:51.220> will<00:02:51.370> then<00:02:51.520> go<00:02:51.730> completely<00:02:52.480> soft

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
and they will then go completely soft

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.110 
and they will then go completely soft
within<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.950> few<00:02:54.100> days<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.460> storage<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:54.910> there<00:02:55.030> is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
within a few days of storage so there is

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.110 
within a few days of storage so there is
no<00:02:55.240> possibility<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.900> marketing<00:02:56.740> them<00:02:57.120> it

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
no possibility of marketing them it

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.390 
no possibility of marketing them it
would<00:02:58.270> be<00:02:58.330> like<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.600> pear<00:02:59.140> Duende<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.310> we

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
would be like the pear Duende that we

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.660 
would be like the pear Duende that we
once<00:03:00.580> screw<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:02.560> know<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:02.770> really<00:03:02.980> fine<00:03:03.340> but

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
once screw you know it's really fine but

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.030 
once screw you know it's really fine but
it's<00:03:04.360> ready<00:03:04.540> before<00:03:04.840> anything<00:03:05.080> else<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.410> ready

it's ready before anything else is ready

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.400 
it's ready before anything else is ready
but<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.400> won't<00:03:06.550> keep<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.050> of<00:03:08.110> no<00:03:08.230> interest

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
but it won't keep so it's of no interest

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.990 
but it won't keep so it's of no interest

by fossil fuel derived energy so think

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.860 
by fossil fuel derived energy so think
that<00:03:44.350> one<00:03:44.560> through<00:03:44.950> if<00:03:45.940> there<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.300> going<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.720> be

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
that one through if there is going to be

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.810 
that one through if there is going to be
a<00:03:47.200> future<00:03:47.680> for<00:03:47.920> human<00:03:48.250> mate<00:03:48.370> is<00:03:48.520> going<00:03:48.700> to

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
a future for human mate is going to

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.090 
a future for human mate is going to
survive<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:49.300> more<00:03:49.420> than<00:03:49.500> 100<00:03:50.500> years<00:03:50.739> more<00:03:51.040> or

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
survive for more than 100 years more or

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.840 
survive for more than 100 years more or
so<00:03:51.550> it's<00:03:51.940> an<00:03:52.090> open<00:03:52.540> question<00:03:53.580> then<00:03:54.580> in<00:03:54.730> the

so it's an open question then in the
