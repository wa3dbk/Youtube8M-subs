00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.640
 antonio lab the irregular laboratory 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.949
 that a group of young artists young 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.349
 photographers in tow with two years is 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 married in this show than in these 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 days is here at the castel dell'ovo in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.219
 beautiful prison room 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.870
 you gave the opportunity to a group 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 of young people to grow with you and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.969
 then to mature and perfect the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.039
 their path of photographers we have taken 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.660
 loan methods perfectly 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.030
 linked to the theater of antonini and uil 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.649
 antonio laboratories the laboratory ai 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.570
 which I have witnessed for many years and 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.899
 actors repeated the feeling to see 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.399
 a considerable amount of time after which 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.229
 list became increasingly sparse and 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.790
 essential 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.659
 the show was all of these 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.479
 actions 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.950
 the photographers the eight photographers from 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.140
 when they had chosen a 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.180
 subject repeated this action o 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.909
 better returned to the same subject 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.860
 always for a considerable amount of time e 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.990
 these images became more and more 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.340
 thin and essential inside the lab 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.820
 deepening is a prerequisite 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.530
 fundamental for us it begins to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.530
 work when it was paradoxically a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 work is already want then start 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.909
 basically getting it back in 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.820
 there is discussion within you one 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.950
 authentic part ie the laboratory does not 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 necessarily produces artists 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.009
 but at least it produces a photograph that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.869
 he does not lie 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.549
 the eight portfolios we see here at 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.909
 in the castle's prison room 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.219
 of the egg are eight different looks too 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.229
 eight substantially different topics 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.329
 they don't look like me at all 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.750
 about simplification 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.810
 even the installation that is essential 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.789
 was chosen to show these works is 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.220
 extremely particular ie one 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.619
 staging in some theatrical way that 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.380
 I could also consider very close to the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.569
 my way of exposing we brought the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.790
 table that was being studied at my studio 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.200
 we wanted to bring that table here 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.430
 was the protagonist of all of our 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.079
 meetings 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 we wanted to bring you here to castel 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.420
 of the egg for which we have built 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.180
 trained to the architect drag from 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.420
 thinking of creating it is in fact set up a 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.700
 15-meter table where they are placed 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.390
 these eight portfolios you enter the room 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.180
 and it is appears scarce numida must perform 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.280
 this gesture of opening each portfolio 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.849
 see it and then close it and then move on 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.250
 to another 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.959
 I wanted to do a reflection instead 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.319
 moving now from the exhibition to 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.519
 antonio biasiucci on your way to 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.200
 photograph 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.440
 I think it contains some very strong ones 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.989
 elements of simplification in the sense 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.269
 of achieving essentiality 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.450
 that is, you take an object and photograph it 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.400
 it strips it and gives it back to us almost 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.660
 turned into a sign that though 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.940
 contains many meanings 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.030
 possible 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.420
 as if I stored all the le 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.400
 emotions that I lived anyway and then 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.970
 from the moment you decide to photograph 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.280
 I find a subject in reality 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.920
 everything perfectly so it is as if 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.170
 really it was the simplification of a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.780
 of a moment of a period of mine 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.170
 moment when I photograph bread a 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.500
 terribly circumscribed subject 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.820
 this bread becomes a work on 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.010
 starting from the assumption that for 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.720
 make the bread requires the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.860
 earth the water the fire 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.020
 I raised it so that I could talk to you 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.820
 of creation for which this bread 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.430
 they become monoliths 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.140
 they become plans that this image 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.180
 as it becomes more sparse as if 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.000
 let it go away 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.210
 paradoxically, for months it opens up to the other 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.590
 therefore despite the complex image 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.750
 to be able to decipher 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.680
 in reality it is an image perfectly 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.680
 free
