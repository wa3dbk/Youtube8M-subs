00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.620
 the kids their income so on the telly 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.940
 on which we installed 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.490
 cruisecast so here and we'll get you 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.560
 show with the computer that is right 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.119
 next here we installed 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.859
 so in fact chrome on it and we'll get you 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.340
 show how to switch the web 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.690
 directly 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.160
 so actually on on TV that's all 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.660
 simply the browser 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.120
 web directly on the TV so that's it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.110
 it's the browser and you can see 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:58.890
 at that level you have the crom 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:01:05.299
 caste you tap it here's hop it has 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.229
 detected and you will see on TV 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.920
 did not theorize 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.330
 here he sends you directly so in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.900
 does what you have on the computer 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.960
 see on TV so here we go 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.950
 on current ya for example that's up 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:32.780
 see it's the same 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:32.780
 and here we go and so on the site 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.549
 ah yes with a lag time 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.210
 you have the same thing on the computer 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.500
 that so in fact on the tv see then 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.850
 there is a little time of an offset because 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 that it goes through the cloud for 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:58.310
 go down but it works great 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.310
 well here you see 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:09.110
 so after we'll see for example if we 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.260
 go there and have something like it's on TV 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.700
 you do not have the mouse here that these 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.710
 better systems its not a system 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.780
 of mirroring it is not everything 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.070
 what you have on his passes does not know 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.000
 so in fact a system that's all 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.650
 that you have on computer that is going 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.110
 shake his tv there it's just the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.720
 browser so saw that it's just doing 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.190
 it's then suddenly fund 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.920
 investment were enough here we go 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.210
 cut the jump so in fact it's gone 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.620
 number one ie it sends the 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.390
 link you have the room the voice man 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.990
 on a club that returns directly 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.760
 on so the chrome caste of the TV there 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.440
 by mail so in fact we did there 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.410
 are currently testing athenaeus 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.440
 and so in fact it even sends everything 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.620
 which is flash animations and all 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.140
 directly 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.400
 so in fact on the TV I find that 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.400
 it's relatively nice 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.850
 I think it still is not 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.600
 so it works as well there it is on 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.760
 a computer 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.470
 so see we'll see if in full screen 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.000
 it works here in full screen that 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.190
 works then it works as well 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.630
 so yes there is the lag time and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.160
 a lag time between the two 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.500
 so it works as well with 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.220
 chrome so it works only on chrome 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.790
 but it works as well of course as much 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.100
 that in fact a computer under linux that 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.170
 Chrome on Windows there is no 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.940
 problem just go in 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.890
 applications and go into the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.750
 extensions and type chrome cast for 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.050
 install so in fact the extension 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:44.209
 chrome and and then here and there so you 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.100
 can send back his + video of everything 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.200
 that you have on your browser and 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.260
 among others we are in the process of 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.200
 test actually landed directly on 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.630
 so actually on the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.450
 on discounted the direct ones on with so 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.290
 on justin tv and there it works 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.180
 correctly 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.040
 apparently more or less correctly 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.430
 because here you see that hardly shines 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.670
 by aman it crashed here many times by 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.150
 months ago there are problems beyond 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.799
 expectations 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.840
 see that's not exactly what ol 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.720
 yeah yes there are big problems of the 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.740
 attempted 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.510
 apparently it's good for the text 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.190
 but for the video it does not follow 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:33.220
 masses it does not seem to be mass 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.370
 for the video there there was a bug 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.170
 that's less than because 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.420
 that we are using it 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.830
 a stream that is to send the telly 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.050
 then this is also why it lag a 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.850
 little bit here finally good like you 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.180
 can see it works very well 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.330
 children 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.330
 this contrast with the chrome browser
