00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
basically about my hat and you may also

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.130 
basically about my hat and you may also
notice<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.940> slightly<00:00:39.239> darker<00:00:39.660> not<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> lot

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
notice that slightly darker not a lot

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.420 
notice that slightly darker not a lot
it's<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.620> maybe<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> shade<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.250> two<00:00:41.309> darker

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it's like maybe a shade or two darker

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.880 
it's like maybe a shade or two darker
because<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.870> still<00:00:43.079> light<00:00:43.320> brown<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.739> just

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
because it's still light brown it's just

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.590 
because it's still light brown it's just
slightly<00:00:44.100> different<00:00:44.460> tone<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> last

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
slightly different tone because the last

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.690 
slightly different tone because the last
one<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.320> problem<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:47.129> bit<00:00:47.250> too<00:00:47.460> warm

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
weave or not to leave that is the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.080 
weave or not to leave that is the
question<00:02:21.629> and<00:02:22.220> how<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.400> have<00:02:23.550> weaved<00:02:23.819> you

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
question and how do you have weaved you

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.240 
question and how do you have weaved you
knows<00:02:24.239> when<00:02:24.450> has<00:02:24.750> had<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> wave<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.010> would

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
knows when has had a wave and I would

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.210 
knows when has had a wave and I would
prefer<00:02:26.900> Caucasian<00:02:27.900> kind<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.319> examples

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
prefer Caucasian kind of examples

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.710 
prefer Caucasian kind of examples
because<00:02:29.400> obviously<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.180> hair<00:02:30.360> type<00:02:30.599> is

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
because obviously the hair type is

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.479 
because obviously the hair type is
completely<00:02:31.110> different<00:02:31.379> I<00:02:31.470> know<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.680> really

completely different I know that really
the<00:02:32.819> whole<00:02:32.970> idea<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.690> hair<00:02:33.870> weave<00:02:34.019> wasn't

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
the whole idea of the hair weave wasn't

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.720 
the whole idea of the hair weave wasn't
designed<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:34.769> Caucasian<00:02:35.099> air<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.519> first

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
designed for Caucasian air in the first

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.520 
designed for Caucasian air in the first
place<00:02:35.879> but<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.510> lot<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.780> people<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.200> use<00:02:37.379> it<00:02:37.500> and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
place but a lot of people to use it and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.440 
place but a lot of people to use it and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
people with more Caucasian hair types

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.110 
people with more Caucasian hair types
and<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.220> excuse<00:02:41.220> me<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.550> told<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:41.910> I'm<00:02:42.090> not

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
i think and i think there's something

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.070 
i think and i think there's something
like<00:03:37.980> 50<00:03:38.370> pounds<00:03:38.519> so<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:39.180> was<00:03:39.299> basically<00:03:39.420> on<00:03:39.930> my

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
like 50 pounds so it was basically on my

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.500 
like 50 pounds so it was basically on my
list<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.409> was<00:03:40.500> either<00:03:40.709> gonna<00:03:41.010> get<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.879> woven

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
list I was either gonna get the woven

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.199 
list I was either gonna get the woven
extensions<00:03:43.290> out<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:44.310> iphone<00:03:44.549> curvature<00:03:45.000> or<00:03:45.120> i

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
extensions out the iphone curvature or i

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.399 
extensions out the iphone curvature or i
was<00:03:45.420> going<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.569> go<00:03:45.690> with<00:03:45.720> clip<00:03:45.989> ins<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.349> I

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
was going to go with clip ins and I

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.750 
was going to go with clip ins and I
thought<00:03:46.650> if<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:46.950> did<00:03:47.099> going<00:03:47.280> with<00:03:47.400> clip<00:03:47.580> ins

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
thought if I did going with clip ins

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.430 
thought if I did going with clip ins
then<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.209> could<00:03:48.540> always<00:03:48.629> clip<00:03:48.989> out<00:03:49.200> like

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
then I could always clip out like

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.490 
then I could always clip out like
actually<00:03:50.099> snip<00:03:51.030> out<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.480> cut<00:03:51.930> out<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.230> clips

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
actually snip out to cut out the clips

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.259 
actually snip out to cut out the clips
and<00:03:52.709> then<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.860> could<00:03:53.010> have<00:03:53.129> that<00:03:53.430> hair<00:03:53.700> woven

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
and then I could have that hair woven

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.880 
and then I could have that hair woven
into<00:03:54.390> my<00:03:54.569> head<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.900> then<00:03:55.260> obviously<00:03:55.409> it<00:03:55.739> would

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
into my head and then obviously it would

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.460 
into my head and then obviously it would
have<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.400> price<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:57.110> when<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.140> hope<00:03:58.319> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
have the price and when I hope the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.839 
have the price and when I hope the
afro-caribbean<00:03:59.010> job<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.519> that's<00:03:59.580> still<00:03:59.790> a

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
afro-caribbean job so that's still a

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.000 
afro-caribbean job so that's still a
possibility<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.420> could<00:04:00.540> have<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:00.900> very<00:04:01.620> hair

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
possibility I could have this very hair

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.440 
possibility I could have this very hair
woven<00:04:02.459> into<00:04:02.580> my<00:04:02.730> head<00:04:02.879> of<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.060> still<00:04:03.269> matches

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
woven into my head of it still matches

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.880 
woven into my head of it still matches

once<00:05:49.639> they<00:05:49.789> were<00:05:49.880> in<00:05:49.940> my<00:05:50.000> head<00:05:50.300> but<00:05:50.930> other<00:05:51.530> than

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
once they were in my head but other than

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.529 
once they were in my head but other than
that<00:05:51.889> I<00:05:52.220> think<00:05:52.250> that<00:05:52.639> it<00:05:52.760> looks<00:05:52.970> better<00:05:53.270> when

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
that I think that it looks better when

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.300 
that I think that it looks better when
they've<00:05:53.720> actually<00:05:53.870> bead<00:05:54.590> wash<00:05:54.860> when<00:05:55.130> you<00:05:55.220> get

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
they've actually bead wash when you get

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.070 
they've actually bead wash when you get
them<00:05:55.490> front<00:05:55.729> straight<00:05:55.940> out<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.270> packet<00:05:56.599> they

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
them front straight out the packet they

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.420 
them front straight out the packet they
look<00:05:57.260> really<00:05:57.470> really<00:05:57.740> sleek<00:05:58.039> and<00:05:58.220> shiny

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
look really really sleek and shiny

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.760 
look really really sleek and shiny
nothing<00:05:59.180> like<00:05:59.389> most<00:05:59.870> peoples<00:06:00.260> natural<00:06:00.440> hair

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
nothing like most peoples natural hair

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.700 
nothing like most peoples natural hair
maybe<00:06:00.919> like<00:06:01.220> fantastic<00:06:02.090> Kardashian<00:06:02.960> kind<00:06:03.560> of

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
maybe like fantastic Kardashian kind of

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.159 
maybe like fantastic Kardashian kind of
hair<00:06:03.860> but<00:06:04.430> regular<00:06:05.150> people<00:06:05.479> do<00:06:05.599> not<00:06:05.720> have<00:06:05.780> hair

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
hair but regular people do not have hair

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.350 
hair but regular people do not have hair
that's<00:06:06.409> shiny<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:06.979> so<00:06:07.880> generally<00:06:08.240> if<00:06:08.300> you

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
that's shiny and so generally if you

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.210 
that's shiny and so generally if you
give<00:06:08.510> them<00:06:08.539> a<00:06:08.720> nice<00:06:08.960> wash<00:06:09.260> it<00:06:09.710> just<00:06:10.010> kind<00:06:10.190> of

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
give them a nice wash it just kind of

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.710 
give them a nice wash it just kind of
add<00:06:10.400> that<00:06:10.669> a<00:06:10.699> little<00:06:10.880> bit<00:06:10.940> of<00:06:11.030> texture<00:06:11.419> and

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
add that a little bit of texture and

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.760 
add that a little bit of texture and
makes<00:06:11.840> it<00:06:12.020> look<00:06:12.139> a<00:06:12.229> little<00:06:12.320> bit<00:06:12.500> more<00:06:12.620> natural

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
makes it look a little bit more natural

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.890 
makes it look a little bit more natural
so<00:06:13.430> I'm<00:06:13.550> super<00:06:14.030> happy<00:06:14.120> with<00:06:14.330> these<00:06:14.539> ones<00:06:14.780> that

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
so I'm super happy with these ones that

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.240 
so I'm super happy with these ones that
I<00:06:14.960> have<00:06:15.169> but<00:06:15.409> should<00:06:15.590> I<00:06:15.650> get<00:06:15.770> them<00:06:15.889> selling<00:06:16.130> or

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
not I'm very very interested to see what

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.750 
not I'm very very interested to see what
you<00:06:18.289> guys<00:06:18.320> think<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:18.979> what<00:06:19.130> your<00:06:19.250> experience

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
you guys think and what your experience

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.820 
you guys think and what your experience
with<00:06:19.940> weeps<00:06:20.210> has<00:06:20.570> been<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.110> I<00:06:21.560> know<00:06:21.590> that<00:06:21.770> you

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
with weeps has been and I know that you

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.230 
with weeps has been and I know that you
can<00:06:21.949> get<00:06:22.010> my<00:06:22.159> candy<00:06:22.340> weeds<00:06:22.669> but<00:06:22.909> I<00:06:22.970> think

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
can get my candy weeds but I think

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.540 
can get my candy weeds but I think
leaves<00:06:23.840> I<00:06:24.080> think<00:06:24.800> the<00:06:24.889> place<00:06:25.039> near<00:06:25.279> me<00:06:25.370> only

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
leaves I think the place near me only

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.879 
leaves I think the place near me only
does<00:06:25.880> the<00:06:26.740> sew-in<00:06:27.740> ones<00:06:28.039> on<00:06:28.219> the<00:06:28.370> brain

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
does the sew-in ones on the brain

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.040 
does the sew-in ones on the brain
and<00:06:29.129> I<00:06:29.819> think<00:06:30.030> like<00:06:30.060> they<00:06:30.330> have<00:06:30.419> glue<00:06:30.749> them<00:06:30.930> and

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
and I think like they have glue them and

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.420 
and I think like they have glue them and
myself<00:06:31.169> before<00:06:31.530> that's<00:06:31.830> not<00:06:32.039> a<00:06:32.069> problem<00:06:32.249> I've

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
myself before that's not a problem I've

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.379 
myself before that's not a problem I've
still<00:06:32.610> got<00:06:32.699> the<00:06:32.789> glue<00:06:32.969> if<00:06:33.090> I<00:06:33.180> desperately

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
still got the glue if I desperately

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.540 
still got the glue if I desperately
wanted<00:06:33.810> to<00:06:33.900> do<00:06:33.990> it<00:06:34.110> we<00:06:34.199> could<00:06:34.349> do<00:06:34.439> that<00:06:34.469> but<00:06:35.129> my

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
wanted to do it we could do that but my

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.589 
wanted to do it we could do that but my
main<00:06:35.669> problem<00:06:35.849> with<00:06:36.090> that<00:06:36.210> is<00:06:36.360> it's<00:06:36.569> very

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
main problem with that is it's very

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.029 
main problem with that is it's very
difficult<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:37.080> get<00:06:37.229> the<00:06:37.289> glue<00:06:37.439> out<00:06:37.650> of<00:06:37.889> your

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
difficult to get the glue out of your

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.200 
difficult to get the glue out of your
hair<00:06:38.189> and<00:06:38.340> it's<00:06:38.460> quite<00:06:38.639> damaging<00:06:39.029> I

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
hair and it's quite damaging I

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.510 
hair and it's quite damaging I
understand<00:06:39.810> that<00:06:39.900> plots<00:06:40.289> and<00:06:40.560> the<00:06:40.620> braids<00:06:40.860> can

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
understand that plots and the braids can

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.890 
understand that plots and the braids can
pull<00:06:41.789> on<00:06:41.909> your<00:06:41.999> hair<00:06:42.090> and<00:06:42.360> people<00:06:42.629> have<00:06:42.749> had

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
pull on your hair and people have had

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.540 
pull on your hair and people have had
bald<00:06:43.199> patches<00:06:43.529> and<00:06:43.860> terrible<00:06:44.099> things<00:06:44.279> happen

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
bald patches and terrible things happen

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.659 
bald patches and terrible things happen
to<00:06:44.580> them<00:06:44.729> and<00:06:45.020> like<00:06:46.020> that<00:06:46.259> but<00:06:46.529> I<00:06:46.800> think<00:06:47.159> that's

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
to them and like that but I think that's

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.519 
to them and like that but I think that's
probably<00:06:48.449> if<00:06:48.719> you<00:06:48.810> have<00:06:48.960> them<00:06:49.110> for<00:06:49.349> an

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
probably if you have them for an

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:50.809 
probably if you have them for an
extended<00:06:49.919> period<00:06:49.949> of<00:06:50.249> time<00:06:50.310> and<00:06:50.610> I'm<00:06:50.699> just

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
extended period of time and I'm just

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.189 
extended period of time and I'm just
kind<00:06:50.939> of<00:06:51.029> looking<00:06:51.300> for<00:06:51.479> a<00:06:51.509> temporary<00:06:51.960> fix

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
kind of looking for a temporary fix

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.899 
kind of looking for a temporary fix
while<00:06:52.949> I'm<00:06:53.069> getting<00:06:53.370> into<00:06:53.490> this<00:06:53.580> in-between

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
while I'm getting into this in-between

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:56.659 
while I'm getting into this in-between
stage<00:06:54.749> it's<00:06:55.050> like<00:06:55.199> my<00:06:55.800> hair<00:06:55.949> is<00:06:56.039> almost<00:06:56.279> to<00:06:56.550> my

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 
stage it's like my hair is almost to my

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.519 
stage it's like my hair is almost to my
shoulders<00:06:57.150> and<00:06:57.180> it's<00:06:57.419> a<00:06:57.509> bit<00:06:57.659> like<00:06:57.810> well<00:06:58.199> I'm

00:06:58.519 --> 00:06:58.529 
shoulders and it's a bit like well I'm

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:00.170 
shoulders and it's a bit like well I'm
just<00:06:58.800> getting<00:06:59.039> a<00:06:59.069> bit<00:06:59.159> irritated<00:06:59.669> with<00:06:59.759> it<00:06:59.939> and

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
just getting a bit irritated with it and

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.850 
just getting a bit irritated with it and
if<00:07:00.449> I<00:07:00.569> thought<00:07:00.840> I<00:07:01.080> had<00:07:01.319> these<00:07:01.529> for<00:07:01.710> like<00:07:01.800> a

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
if I thought I had these for like a

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.820 
if I thought I had these for like a
month<00:07:02.069> or<00:07:02.279> two<00:07:02.870> permanently<00:07:03.870> in<00:07:03.990> my<00:07:04.110> hair<00:07:04.349> then

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
month or two permanently in my hair then

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.350 
month or two permanently in my hair then
when<00:07:04.949> I<00:07:04.979> come<00:07:05.219> when<00:07:05.460> they<00:07:05.580> come<00:07:05.610> out<00:07:05.849> my<00:07:06.150> hair

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
when I come when they come out my hair

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.999 
when I come when they come out my hair
will<00:07:06.449> be<00:07:06.479> a<00:07:06.569> little<00:07:06.750> bit<00:07:06.900> longer<00:07:07.139> and<00:07:07.620> i'll<00:07:07.860> be

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:08.009 
will be a little bit longer and i'll be

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:09.800 
will be a little bit longer and i'll be
be<00:07:08.490> kind<00:07:08.669> of<00:07:08.729> fresh<00:07:08.969> new<00:07:09.330> again<00:07:09.569> this<00:07:09.659> is

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
be kind of fresh new again this is

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.179 
be kind of fresh new again this is
generally<00:07:10.139> what<00:07:10.199> happens<00:07:10.319> when<00:07:10.770> I<00:07:10.800> do<00:07:10.889> glue

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:11.189
