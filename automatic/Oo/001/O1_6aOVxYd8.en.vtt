00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello girls and girls already arrived 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.410
 Wednesday again and here on my channel 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.360
 Wednesday is April day, I'm just for 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.000
 remember in my last video involve 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.779
 five packs of disney goals 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.430
 and 53 were unpublished and only two 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.170
 were repeated 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.090
 Let's see now if in this video you go 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.250
 give me more luck so i open five 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.199
 packages and I did not have any repeating 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.490
 It's a bit difficult, right? 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.710
 you can see my collection is already 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 big then the probability that I take 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 a repeat will also grow 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.480
 so I 'll start by opening the first 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.340
 Today's package is already here and we will see 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.379
 whether it will be repeated or will be 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:51.180
 silly and unheard of 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:54.809
 Let's start with the cards and came to 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.360
