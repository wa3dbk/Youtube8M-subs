 rod up to 6 meters 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.660
 it is desirable to equip it with a coil and 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.330
 crossing rings through which 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.060
 thread the line diameter to zero as many as 15 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.019
 millimeters with a lead to 0 as many as 12 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.000
 millimeters cross sections in August roach 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.200
 can be caught on the nozzle of an animal 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.820
 so of plant origin 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.299
 booster feeds in natural layers 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.540
 reservoir throughout the day while

 fish keeps a strict daily routine 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.390
 visiting the same places day after day 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.470
 the best gear to perform in August 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.519
 swing rods and fiver leash 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.340
 using Fedor 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.280
 must be short to 15 centimeters a 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.950
 the thickness of its cross section and must exceed 0 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.690
 as much as 12 millimeters 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.329
 he himself is delayed longer in August 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.870
 on the hunt the perfect time for his 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.030
 catching will be the evening and night of thursday this 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.350
 the fish feels great 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.880
 approaching rain and will hunt 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.620
 where more active than usual most often it 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.540
 can be found in deep pits with 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.230
 am snags or during a 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.620
 whirlpools 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.780
 off the steep banks continue to catch 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.940
 river giant at night from the shore to 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.420
 hard spinning or late afternoon with 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.099
 boats on a whine or trolling 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.099
 it should be remembered that he himself is padok 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:48.700
 bait that dragging along the bottom and this 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.770
 can and even need to use exactly 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.200
 so catching this fish by trolling in 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.040
 August becomes the most popular 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.140
 holders of floating funds 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.510
 summarize based on weather conditions 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.360
 and the lunar calendar is the best time for 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.010
 fishing will be the middle of the week zander 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.040
 will keep on average and fast 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.989
 flow in the middle layers of the reservoir we catch 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.230
 spinning wobblers and blades 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.780
 up to 7 centimeters long roach will 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.660
 approach the shore more often to places of free 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.739
 from aquatic vegetation we catch float 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.460
 on the worm 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.620
 dough or bread guster can be found 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.530
 at the bottom of the reservoir with an abundance of algae 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.560
 catch in feeder gear in the morning and 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.169
 evening hours on a sandwich from maggot and 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.240
 counters and of course we continue 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.270
 catching catfish using a tuft 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.250
 or trolling traditional bait 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.100
 bunch of worms landing leech 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.110
 crustacean bear or grasshopper meat
