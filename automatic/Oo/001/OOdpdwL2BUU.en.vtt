are that a lot of these gamers out there
have<00:01:18.030> found<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> TCS<00:01:19.740> work<00:01:19.979> great<00:01:20.400> as

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
have found that the TCS work great as

the<00:01:23.490> next<00:01:23.759> line<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> blue<00:01:24.509> seeds<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.170> was

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the next line up is blue seeds this was

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
the next line up is blue seeds this was
to<00:01:25.710> give<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.189> rigid<00:01:26.369> symbol<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> cannot

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to give a more rigid symbol you cannot

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
to give a more rigid symbol you cannot
fold<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.409> half<00:01:28.439> without<00:01:28.920> breaking<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
fold this in half without breaking in it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.219 
fold this in half without breaking in it
it's<00:01:30.380> also<00:01:31.880> less<00:01:32.880> resilient<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.049> heavy

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it's also less resilient to the heavy

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's also less resilient to the heavy
hitters<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.490> slightly<00:01:35.790> heavier

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
hitters but it's a slightly heavier

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.920 
hitters but it's a slightly heavier
cymbal<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.290> triggering<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.220> cleaner<00:01:38.610> than<00:01:38.930> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
cymbal the triggering is cleaner than it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.340 
cymbal the triggering is cleaner than it
is<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.450> TC<00:01:42.450> cymbals<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> lot<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is on the TC cymbals so a lot of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
is on the TC cymbals so a lot of
drummers<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.740> these<00:01:44.100> however<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:44.759> you're<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
drummers like these however if you're a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.050 
drummers like these however if you're a
heavy<00:01:45.420> hitter<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.619> brake<00:01:47.189> brass<00:01:47.520> cymbals

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
heavy hitter you brake brass cymbals

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.690 
heavy hitter you brake brass cymbals
stay<00:01:48.990> away<00:01:49.140> from<00:01:49.200> these<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:53.189> next<00:01:53.340> line<00:01:53.670> we

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
stay away from these the next line we

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.530 
stay away from these the next line we
have<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.780> cymbals<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.890> cymbals<00:01:56.549> are

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
have are the cymbals now the cymbals are

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.569 
have are the cymbals now the cymbals are
a<00:01:57.619> PC<00:01:59.329> with<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> rubber<00:02:00.570> coat<00:02:01.100> which<00:02:02.100> makes<00:02:02.430> them

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
a PC with a rubber coat which makes them

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.760 
a PC with a rubber coat which makes them
even<00:02:03.000> heavier<00:02:03.270> still<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> lot<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.590> drummers

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.190 
even heavier still so a lot of drummers
like<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.490> lot<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.060> donors<00:02:06.329> also<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.960> them

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
like that a lot of donors also like them

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.140 
like that a lot of donors also like them
because<00:02:07.819> it<00:02:08.819> adds<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:10.069> larger<00:02:11.069> strike

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
because it adds a larger strike

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.420 
because it adds a larger strike
strike<00:02:12.390> surface<00:02:12.959> area<00:02:13.379> instead<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.189> just

actually have a bell zone as well so you

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:51.979 
actually have a bell zone as well so you

symbols the visualize symbols are have

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.259 
symbols the visualize symbols are have
you<00:03:13.829> again<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.220> heavier<00:03:14.609> weighted<00:03:14.819> symbol

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
you again a heavier weighted symbol

these<00:03:15.780> are<00:03:16.349> what<00:03:16.799> our<00:03:16.829> drummers<00:03:17.430> say<00:03:17.639> are<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
these are what our drummers say are the

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.550 
these are what our drummers say are the
closest<00:03:18.449> to<00:03:18.629> the<00:03:18.720> look<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.049> feel<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.470> an

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
acoustic symbol they're weighted heavier

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.800 
acoustic symbol they're weighted heavier
there's<00:03:23.220> definitely<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> more<00:03:24.120> rigid<00:03:24.269> material

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
there's definitely a more rigid material

china form you can actually get an
electronic<00:07:11.099> China<00:07:11.490> that's<00:07:11.789> shaped<00:07:12.210> like<00:07:12.360> a

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 
electronic China that's shaped like a

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.689 
electronic China that's shaped like a
China<00:07:12.840> because<00:07:13.259> all<00:07:13.650> the<00:07:13.889> visualize<00:07:14.279> symbols

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 
China because all the visualize symbols

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:18.140 
China because all the visualize symbols
are<00:07:14.819> molded<00:07:15.300> to<00:07:16.080> true<00:07:16.680> acoustic<00:07:17.520> symbols

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
are molded to true acoustic symbols

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.760 
are molded to true acoustic symbols
that's<00:07:18.360> what<00:07:18.599> the<00:07:18.719> mold<00:07:18.900> is<00:07:19.110> is<00:07:19.289> a<00:07:19.319> true<00:07:19.529> symbol

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
that's what the mold is is a true symbol

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.300 
that's what the mold is is a true symbol
so<00:07:20.069> we've<00:07:20.219> used<00:07:20.370> a<00:07:20.960> an<00:07:21.960> acoustic<00:07:22.439> China<00:07:22.710> 18<00:07:23.219> in

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
so we've used a an acoustic China 18 in

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.659 
so we've used a an acoustic China 18 in
China<00:07:23.580> to<00:07:24.150> create<00:07:24.689> the<00:07:24.839> mold<00:07:25.020> for<00:07:25.319> our<00:07:25.650> 18<00:07:26.490> inch

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669
