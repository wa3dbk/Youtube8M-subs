00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 It was girls I came back with our 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.529
 discolored hair is for those who do not know 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.530
 what it's all about and I'm making a 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.990
 series of videos that I discolor plus 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.170
 my hair then we are in the third 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.699
 stage of treatment for those who did not 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.590
 other two videos 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.930
 I'll leave the link for you guys that you 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.380
 then give the first two 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 steps I did reconstruction, because I 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.529
 had just discolored her hair 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.149
 stands is in need of much product feature 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.120
 reconstructor and in the first two steps 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.960
 I used joico's consultant to leave the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.610
 link to you from the videos below 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 and so I can say that 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.620
 hair is already much recovered is already 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.750
 has improved a lot 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.640
 in the first two in the first two 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.649
 I'm doing treatment at 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.860
 every wash is very hairy 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.809
 dry and I disagreed a lot then the two 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.359
 first is already downloading the hair 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.820
 very fragile she was very 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.850
 care and then brushing with more 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.700
 careful still this time have not taken 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 care but I felt the hair is already okay 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 well- established know it is not but that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.130
 fragile hair and so hard that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.350
 was to edit a more malleable hair 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 so I'm very happy, very satisfied 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.240
 to see the result that the treatment 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.400
 giving much result there that I do not 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.189
 I will be my hair that hair still 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.990
 is still healthy, as far as the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.450
 possible with discolored hair but 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.460
 also healthy then it is a part 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.920
 of the treatment I did today that today 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.900
 after two reconstructions 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.520
 I chose to do a fight in the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.020
 way I thought if I rebuilt 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.009
 if once more it would be a little bit 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.560
 too much 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 so I decided to do some nutrition and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.780
 I'll be right back for the next 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.159
 again and a product I used today 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.750
 was this and also the joy with which it is 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:05.009
 so my favorite of all of life 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.729
 to do hydration in hair tri kingdom 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.179
 it's a way he's perfect he's a 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.400
 treatment balm 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.909
 I just said it's getting thick and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.859
 dry my hair and it's even a hair 12 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.930
 but after so much discoloration it already 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.140
 I'll sign the child 's loss. 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.969
 matter but still it continues 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.620
 being an excellent product 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.569
 Ah, I only recommend him to whom. 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.939
 really has very dry hair 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.069
 damaged because if you use a hair 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.799
 so more normal hair will stay 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:39.700
 heavy it very strong and very powerful 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:42.250
 is this nutrition treatment plus the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.950
 game but he is wonderful and mine is 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.470
 Perfect was much much more solid 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.780
 very satisfied already had a time already 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.090
 I did not use because I have too much 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.220
 product to test many reviews of 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.319
 I paunch for the blog so I just can not 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.510
 deliver the products I like 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.030
 or I actually want to use everything 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.200
 always leaving the new product but this 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.299
 here is one of the products I make 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.209
 It's a matter of having it because it always 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.459
 Help me when my hair is lying 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.250
 discolored and the pack was very 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.430
 dried and usually when around 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.519
 beach or summer even it is very good it 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.579
 It's perfect and I started treatment 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.449
 using this shampoo that gives l'oreal that is the 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:28.030
 he falls on his lap 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:30.370
 he is a show a consensus fact and he 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.060
 that helps protect the color helps keep the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.010
 live hair color one longer and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.790
 so I wanted him because he was a show 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.370
 by sulphate but even it 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.229
 16 being the suit and it cleans the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.419
 hair is up in lower than that of 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.970
 shampoo you will pass and it's as if it did 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.370
 spend the shampoo does and the bread very very 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.009
 well the way and today in paulão of shampoo 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.430
 is to dismiss it donated or will prefer and wash the 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:04:01.750
 hair twice with him and then I passed 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:06.400
 joico lg's nutrition mask 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.829
 asks to leave a duct 35 minutes 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.590
 then leave it for 95 minutes on my 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.480
 hair if I took it well 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.760
 with the towel when you have a 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.989
 hair that really needs 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.699
 treatment 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.650
 The ideal is always to get the 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.780
 excess water before applying the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.080
 product to not dilute this treatment 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.840
 then the charge in five minutes and 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.210
 before they make the key I wanted to do 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.590
 A bad use I 'm finding my 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.900
 her hair need 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.790
 Moreover automating he leaves 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.680
 I take off every wash I'm using a 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.229
 pain product matzá 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.540
 one thing i'm noticing if different 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.540
 when I had blonde hair but 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.910
 also a bit darker is that the 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.970
 hair not so he did not make it high 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.650
 You know I do not know if he is not I do not know. 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.540
 if he is holding a pigment but 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.120
 he does not give up I find it very funny 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.310
 This is the product I chose to use 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.680
 today may yellow it was this magic here 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.740
 That's going to be Thursday, I'm there. 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.560
 in love with this magic she sure is 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.690
 one of my favorites to make 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.970
 amortization in the hair goes to make a 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.120
 video for you guys with my products 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.570
 preferred to do is to yellow the 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.490
 wire but the magic that he is super strong is 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.860
 one that made my hair look so 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.440
 not eyebrow but she fed well 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.270
 on my way because she 's super strong 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.150
 And how do you see my hair is? 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.970
 gray and I went to the pure in his hair 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:40.020
 pass lightly dinner so very much 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.169
 Little thing is I was surprised. 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.650
 but anyway China does not rinse the mask 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:49.500
 From joico I spent this one near the 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.020
 fidel will not mix products like this. 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.930
 but I did not want to pass just the magic says 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.360
 yellowing pain because she does not do so 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.010
 deep hair treatment was not 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.680
 she receives but she does not either 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.120
 treatment was very deep. 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.070
 with dry hair 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.950
 so I really wanted to use both 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.710
 together to be able to have both effects 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.080
 one and is not the most indicated but in this 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.190
 if I had gone it alone but I 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.960
 I did not want to take the risk of my 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.930
 Let's start calling it that's where I am. 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.000
 neurotic with this then I went through 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.500
 march until Thursday, and the result was 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.110
 Great with April 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.840
 It's really cool, I like it a lot. 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:33.070
 And then I finished brushing 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:37.780
 I used this and have motivated the chi of 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.550
 in science that is perfect even though I 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.500
 I am still in the truth for 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.180
 first time I used it but it's a 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.600
 very cool result in my hair 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.430
 and this is also and that was the third to 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.980
 third step of the treatment I'm going to 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.680
 Doing to rebuild my hair. 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.110
 was recent and colorful and I hope 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.880
 help a lot of you who are also 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.880
 going through this same problem in this 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.010
 same situation and on the next page already 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.900
 I'm going back to rebuilding again 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.670
 I think it's important to rebuild 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.250
 hair still sometimes 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.140
 although the hair has already improved a lot 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.320
 so far have been two recuou 2 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.360
 reconstructions and nutrition in the next 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.280
 I'm going to rebuild again and I hope 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.230
 Did you like this diary? 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.900
 while doing if you liked applying 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.890
 I liked it and the channel is a kiss and 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.890
 until the next video
