say<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.479> in<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.750> beginning<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.560> article

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
say that in the beginning of the article

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.450 
say that in the beginning of the article
now<00:05:40.719> the<00:05:40.780> word<00:05:41.050> devalue<00:05:41.710> is<00:05:41.830> often<00:05:42.250> associated

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
now the word devalue is often associated

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.290 
now the word devalue is often associated
with<00:05:43.030> money<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:44.639> usually<00:05:45.639> means<00:05:45.880> to<00:05:46.120> make

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
with money and usually means to make

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.230 
with money and usually means to make
less<00:05:46.780> important<00:05:47.320> so<00:05:47.759> they're<00:05:48.759> afraid<00:05:49.000> by

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
less important so they're afraid by

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.610 
less important so they're afraid by
having<00:05:49.539> two<00:05:49.690> characters<00:05:50.169> who<00:05:50.349> share<00:05:50.590> a

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
having two characters who share a

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.219 
having two characters who share a
similar<00:05:50.740> role<00:05:51.280> that<00:05:52.000> somehow<00:05:52.360> one<00:05:53.020> will

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
similar role that somehow one will

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.800 
similar role that somehow one will
become<00:05:53.380> less<00:05:54.070> important<00:05:54.639> although<00:05:55.630> if<00:05:55.719> you

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
become less important although if you

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.779 
become less important although if you
ask<00:05:55.840> me<00:05:56.259> I<00:05:56.440> think<00:05:56.919> this<00:05:57.099> has<00:05:57.250> more<00:05:57.280> to<00:05:57.550> do<00:05:57.759> with

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
ask me I think this has more to do with

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.230 
ask me I think this has more to do with
popularity<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:58.979> think<00:05:59.979> that<00:06:00.310> Sega<00:06:00.759> is<00:06:00.880> afraid

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
popularity I think that Sega is afraid

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.209 
popularity I think that Sega is afraid
that<00:06:01.419> by<00:06:01.539> bringing<00:06:01.840> back<00:06:02.020> bang<00:06:02.469> he<00:06:03.039> might

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.010 
been around for a long time and is well
established<00:06:20.699> but<00:06:21.699> then<00:06:22.000> they<00:06:22.389> introduce<00:06:22.810> a

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
established but then they introduce a

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
new character who is similar and begins

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.379 
new character who is similar and begins
to<00:06:26.139> overshadow<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:27.130> old<00:06:27.340> character<00:06:27.909> usually

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
to overshadow the old character usually

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.350 
to overshadow the old character usually
in<00:06:28.719> popularity<00:06:29.380> until<00:06:29.620> the<00:06:30.310> old<00:06:30.490> character<00:06:31.060> is

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
in popularity until the old character is

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.350 
in popularity until the old character is
usually<00:06:31.990> non-existent<00:06:32.969> now<00:06:33.969> like<00:06:34.210> I<00:06:34.300> just

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
usually non-existent now like I just

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.230 
usually non-existent now like I just
said<00:06:34.719> is<00:06:34.930> a<00:06:34.990> valid<00:06:35.680> fear<00:06:36.130> but<00:06:36.849> in<00:06:37.089> this

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
said is a valid fear but in this

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.510 
said is a valid fear but in this
situation<00:06:37.479> I<00:06:38.229> don't<00:06:38.860> think<00:06:39.099> it's<00:06:39.370> gonna

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
situation I don't think it's gonna

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.860 
situation I don't think it's gonna
happen<00:06:39.760> I<00:06:40.089> really<00:06:40.389> don't

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
happen I really don't

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.830 
happen I really don't
I<00:06:41.190> mean<00:06:42.190> sure<00:06:42.430> both<00:06:42.700> characters<00:06:43.240> do<00:06:43.540> share

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
I mean sure both characters do share

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.750 
I mean sure both characters do share
similarities<00:06:44.290> but<00:06:45.070> they<00:06:45.220> have<00:06:45.370> differences

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
similarities but they have differences

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.180 
similarities but they have differences
that<00:06:46.030> set<00:06:46.240> them<00:06:46.390> apart<00:06:46.860> therefore<00:06:47.860> I<00:06:47.890> find

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
that set them apart therefore I find

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.970 
that set them apart therefore I find
this<00:06:48.340> idea<00:06:48.730> to<00:06:48.910> be<00:06:49.030> absurd<00:06:49.420> and<00:06:49.750> ludicrous<00:06:50.650> and

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
this idea to be absurd and ludicrous and

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.920 
this idea to be absurd and ludicrous and
I'm<00:06:51.310> sure<00:06:51.550> a<00:06:51.580> lot<00:06:51.700> of<00:06:51.970> fans<00:06:52.210> would<00:06:52.540> agree<00:06:52.810> with

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
I'm sure a lot of fans would agree with

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.290 
I'm sure a lot of fans would agree with
me<00:06:54.330> actually<00:06:55.330> I<00:06:55.600> think<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.020> only<00:06:56.230> way<00:06:56.530> banged

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
me actually I think the only way banged

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.790 
me actually I think the only way banged
somehow<00:06:58.300> make<00:06:58.630> Rouge<00:06:58.960> are<00:06:59.140> less<00:06:59.260> important

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
somehow make Rouge are less important

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.500 
somehow make Rouge are less important
all<00:07:00.160> depends<00:07:00.850> on<00:07:00.910> how<00:07:01.060> the<00:07:01.120> character<00:07:01.690> is<00:07:02.080> used

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510 
all depends on how the character is used

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.760 
all depends on how the character is used
but<00:07:04.510> that<00:07:04.720> is<00:07:04.840> a<00:07:04.930> discussion<00:07:05.290> for<00:07:05.500> another

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
but that is a discussion for another

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.970 
but that is a discussion for another
time<00:07:07.170> now<00:07:08.170> at<00:07:08.290> this<00:07:08.410> point<00:07:08.650> you're<00:07:08.800> probably

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980 
time now at this point you're probably

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.180 
time now at this point you're probably
thinking<00:07:09.340> I'm<00:07:09.730> overreacting<00:07:10.150> and<00:07:10.780> maybe<00:07:11.740> I<00:07:11.860> am

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
thinking I'm overreacting and maybe I am

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.670 
thinking I'm overreacting and maybe I am
just<00:07:12.400> a<00:07:12.580> little<00:07:12.880> but<00:07:13.420> here's<00:07:13.690> the<00:07:13.900> thing<00:07:13.930> it

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
just a little but here's the thing it

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.740 
just a little but here's the thing it
really<00:07:14.890> aggravates<00:07:15.610> me<00:07:15.790> to<00:07:15.910> no<00:07:16.060> end<00:07:16.270> when<00:07:16.540> you

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
really aggravates me to no end when you

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.750 
really aggravates me to no end when you
have<00:07:16.780> Fang<00:07:17.230> who<00:07:17.620> is<00:07:17.770> a<00:07:17.800> well<00:07:18.010> liked<00:07:18.220> character

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:18.760

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
and fairly well developed and yet they

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.850 
and fairly well developed and yet they
