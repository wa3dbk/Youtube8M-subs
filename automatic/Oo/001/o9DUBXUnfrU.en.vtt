I'm<00:02:08.149> gonna<00:02:08.269> have<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.450> pause<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.780> again<00:02:08.810> so

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
I'm gonna have to pause it again so

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.199 
I'm gonna have to pause it again so
basically<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:09.800> took<00:02:10.160> off<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.340> clear<00:02:10.729> wrapping

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.000 
basically I took off the clear wrapping
so<00:02:11.450> she<00:02:11.510> didn't<00:02:11.720> have<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.930> reflection<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.920> I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
so she didn't have a reflection and I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.240 
so she didn't have a reflection and I
put<00:02:13.220> back<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.519> case<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:15.680> certificate

sort of a sea shell
you<00:04:30.120> see<00:04:30.390> shells<00:04:30.660> like<00:04:31.230> this<00:04:31.440> metal<00:04:31.860> hook<00:04:33.980> and

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
you see shells like this metal hook and

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.870 
you see shells like this metal hook and
then<00:04:35.190> on<00:04:35.490> her<00:04:35.700> arm<00:04:35.970> she's<00:04:36.660> got<00:04:37.370> this<00:04:38.370> bracelet

then on her arm she's got this bracelet

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.400 
then on her arm she's got this bracelet
and<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.330> has<00:04:39.570> a<00:04:39.600> seashell<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.710> star<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:42.410> fish

and it has a seashell a star and a fish

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.400 
and it has a seashell a star and a fish
I<00:04:44.450> don't<00:04:45.450> know<00:04:45.630> what<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.840> last<00:04:46.050> thing<00:04:46.260> is

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
I don't know what the last thing is

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.250 
I don't know what the last thing is
there's<00:04:47.070> just<00:04:47.250> another<00:04:47.520> seashell<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:49.200> I

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
there's just another seashell and I

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.570 
there's just another seashell and I
think<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.500> star<00:04:50.960> her<00:04:51.960> tail<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.320> she<00:04:52.950> got<00:04:53.130> shells

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
think a star her tail and she got shells

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.510 
think a star her tail and she got shells
across<00:04:54.090> her<00:04:54.390> tail<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:54.870> then<00:04:55.380> her<00:04:55.800> tail<00:04:56.130> is

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
across her tail and then her tail is

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.940 
across her tail and then her tail is
basically<00:04:57.270> made<00:04:57.570> of<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:58.110> know<00:04:58.230> those<00:04:58.380> fake

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
basically made of you know those fake

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.190 
basically made of you know those fake
flowers<00:04:59.520> that<00:04:59.790> people<00:05:00.030> get<00:05:00.150> it's<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.780> same

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
flowers that people get it's the same

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.310 
flowers that people get it's the same
material<00:05:01.680> I<00:05:02.520> guess<00:05:03.060> it's<00:05:03.240> called<00:05:03.420> taffeta<00:05:04.050> or

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
material I guess it's called taffeta or

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.780 
material I guess it's called taffeta or
maybe<00:05:04.530> that's<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.860> color<00:05:05.100> I<00:05:05.430> don't<00:05:05.670> really

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
maybe that's the color I don't really

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.610 
maybe that's the color I don't really
know<00:05:05.910> what's<00:05:06.060> happening<00:05:06.120> is<00:05:06.690> I'm<00:05:07.260> not<00:05:07.500> an

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.680 
though her tail is green in the movie
but<00:05:16.650> I<00:05:16.710> will<00:05:17.010> get<00:05:17.250> onto<00:05:17.400> that<00:05:17.550> later<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.210> then

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
but I will get onto that later and then

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.190 
but I will get onto that later and then
her<00:05:19.170> other<00:05:19.770> part<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.370> tail<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:21.570> kind<00:05:22.080> of

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
her other part of the tail is kind of

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.030 
her other part of the tail is kind of
heavy<00:05:22.500> material<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.610> then<00:05:23.760> she's<00:05:24.060> got<00:05:24.210> also

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
heavy material and then she's got also

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.400 
heavy material and then she's got also
rhinestones<00:05:26.040> on<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.400> part<00:05:26.730> of<00:05:26.970> it<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:27.450> I'm

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
rhinestones on that part of it and I'm

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.320 
rhinestones on that part of it and I'm
not<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.800> think<00:05:28.830> they<00:05:29.370> said<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.700> was<00:05:29.820> poseable

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
not I think they said it was poseable

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.760 
not I think they said it was poseable
somewhere<00:05:30.690> sorry<00:05:31.169> I'm<00:05:31.290> trying<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.560> give<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:31.710> a

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
somewhere sorry I'm trying to give you a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.170 
somewhere sorry I'm trying to give you a
view<00:05:32.040> but<00:05:32.250> then<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.430> realized<00:05:32.730> that<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:32.940> Box

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
view but then I realized that the Box

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.520 
view but then I realized that the Box
like<00:05:33.480> blocks<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:34.200> when<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.190> turn<00:05:35.460> it<00:05:35.900> but<00:05:36.900> the

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
like blocks you when I turn it but the

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.310 
like blocks you when I turn it but the
tail<00:05:37.980> is<00:05:38.220> poseable<00:05:38.910> and<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.690> think<00:05:39.990> they<00:05:40.200> don't

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
tail is poseable and I think they don't

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.780 
tail is poseable and I think they don't
really<00:05:40.590> mean<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.860> tails<00:05:41.070> poseable<00:05:41.490> but<00:05:41.669> if

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
really mean the tails poseable but if

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.000 
really mean the tails poseable but if
you<00:05:41.940> feel<00:05:42.480> underneath<00:05:43.280> she's<00:05:44.280> got<00:05:45.350> legs<00:05:46.350> so

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
you feel underneath she's got legs so

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.040 
you feel underneath she's got legs so
I'm<00:05:47.730> sure<00:05:47.970> that's<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.360> way<00:05:48.480> you<00:05:48.540> can<00:05:48.690> pose<00:05:48.900> her

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
I'm sure that's the way you can pose her

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.210 
I'm sure that's the way you can pose her
and<00:05:49.290> then<00:05:49.380> she<00:05:49.560> also<00:05:49.770> comes<00:05:50.100> with<00:05:50.490> her<00:05:51.090> stand

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
and then she also comes with her stand

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.050 
and then she also comes with her stand
and<00:05:53.220> it<00:05:53.550> just<00:05:53.730> says<00:05:53.910> Made<00:05:54.690> in<00:05:54.720> China<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:56.060> think

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
and it just says Made in China I think

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.520 
and it just says Made in China I think
it<00:05:57.150> says<00:05:57.300> Made<00:05:57.480> in<00:05:57.510> China<00:05:57.810> doesn't<00:05:58.140> say<00:05:58.380> made

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
it says Made in China doesn't say made

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
it says Made in China doesn't say made
in<00:05:58.680> China<00:06:00.710> yet<00:06:01.710> says<00:06:01.950> Made<00:06:02.100> in<00:06:02.130> China

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
in China yet says Made in China

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.300 
in China yet says Made in China
um<00:06:02.820> and<00:06:03.419> I<00:06:04.290> don't<00:06:04.350> really<00:06:04.770> know<00:06:04.980> how<00:06:05.160> this

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
um and I don't really know how this

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.420 
um and I don't really know how this
stand<00:06:05.640> attaches<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:06.630> I<00:06:06.660> guess<00:06:07.020> you<00:06:07.890> can<00:06:08.160> like

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
stand attaches but I guess you can like

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.330 
stand attaches but I guess you can like
put<00:06:09.169> it<00:06:10.169> I<00:06:10.350> don't<00:06:10.650> want<00:06:10.770> to<00:06:10.830> worry<00:06:10.980> you<00:06:11.160> would

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
put it I don't want to worry you would

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.950 
put it I don't want to worry you would
put<00:06:11.610> it<00:06:11.790> I<00:06:11.970> guess<00:06:12.150> you<00:06:12.180> would<00:06:12.390> just<00:06:12.570> lean<00:06:12.780> her

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
put it I guess you would just lean her

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.850 
put it I guess you would just lean her
against<00:06:13.200> a<00:06:13.380> Stan

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
against a Stan

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.070 
against a Stan
I'm<00:06:14.400> sure<00:06:14.610> she<00:06:14.729> can<00:06:14.849> stand<00:06:15.120> up<00:06:15.270> on<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.599> stand

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
I'm sure she can stand up on the stand

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.839 
I'm sure she can stand up on the stand
if<00:06:16.500> you<00:06:16.620> bend<00:06:16.830> her<00:06:16.919> tail<00:06:17.189> but<00:06:17.460> she's<00:06:17.669> not

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
if you bend her tail but she's not

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.179 
if you bend her tail but she's not
coming<00:06:18.180> out<00:06:18.210> of<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.419> box<00:06:18.599> obviously<00:06:19.189> because

coming out of the box obviously because

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.890 
coming out of the box obviously because
my<00:06:20.669> parents<00:06:21.090> might<00:06:21.240> want<00:06:21.419> to<00:06:21.479> sell<00:06:21.659> her

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
my parents might want to sell her

my parents might want to sell her
something<00:06:22.680> one<00:06:23.069> day<00:06:23.280> even<00:06:23.729> though<00:06:23.909> I<00:06:23.939> would
