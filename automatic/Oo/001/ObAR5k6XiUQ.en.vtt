00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 hello to all I sell hard 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.610
 video where I will present a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.090
 software called niece boots 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.320
 so it's software that consists of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 stream of a server's amp of boots so 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.029
 to start you download the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.079
 software so I put the link in the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.260
 description so you download it 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:39.539
 this is niece boots and at points 3 e ex 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.600
 so that gives that gives you that so you 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:48.200
 launch it here run will not have to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200
 somewhere 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.270
 here she is there excuse me so and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.270
 their lambs 510 boots 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.790
 here's a hundred in point 3 e so then you 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.640
 sectioned an smp server so me I 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 were looking for one in the list 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.650
 so then something that would be ready 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.650
 from France it would be better 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.130
 yeah it's on this server so you 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.460
 copy lipped between you country if the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.360
 port rated port default by this is the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.960
 number of bots 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.790
 know you are so five months I was leaving 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.820
 if 1password if a password to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.800
 server the name of the bot 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.990
 I will mark blur of boot shots 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.000
 here then it's for 20 06 spawn when 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.700
 the cognac so spawn if they play as well 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.570
 joined he sends a message if he 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.450
 joined effect so leave here then 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.580
 larks character too that's part 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 of the name that makes you believe to score 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.090
 boots 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.769
 in fact there is the name of the bot and a shot 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.989
 and the simple like that if there was there is 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.330
 the name of the bot here and after there will be a 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.650
 number of characters the case because the wants 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.090
 It can not have our server 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.700
 so that must take another no 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.320
 random so that will be there you can 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.750
 choose characters that will be in 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.670
 the name then once all the fields 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.820
 filled you click on connect so 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.290
 here the wood will have to connect 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.570
 so that's where we can see who are 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.150
 connected as one can see my boots 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.209
 are there they are connected 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:49.269
 look at boys boys boy boys boys in 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.290
 add a little bit they went to 26 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:57.370
 people still other boxes 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:03:00.750
 look good I add the dose 30 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.750
 people is holding 33 people 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.440
 we will put the dose as you see 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.670
 the boots the koné who connects and 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.450
 look at everything we see all the bins is 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.620
 what was only the mark is 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:15.370
 connected with the say that the boots get 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.600
 connect then add the dose is good 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.020
 I think they banny me power 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.520
 they are smart and my ban will be 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:29.460
 not good he's good pigeon I 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.900
 added about yeah that when sibot 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.480
 corn it takes the maximum brain the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.480
 max possible from füle wat 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.150
 ah yes there is really a fule 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.560
 so it works according to the servers 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.090
 by making management servers 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.050
 of hot antibes right there at the same time they 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.170
 have ban it's normal some 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:00.310
 disguised people from ikebana boots 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.650
 dirtyban all as much as you are all 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.020
 the same ip that's why we do 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:14.490
 disconnect one stayed on another 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:14.490
 server is this one by default 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.190
 connection know collecting see if 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.520
 it does not connect more or less 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.520
 of time 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.780
 is called harry lapp the interest of 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.780
 successfully connect 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.420
 the promoted lot I'll take that one 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:12.310
 disconnect his 7.8 ok connect a good 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.510
 salary does not work a good thing it's 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.930
 so bullish ping that does well 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:24.490
 slow things down when uploads to 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:27.610
 side is normal yeah well it's not 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.110
 serious so free practical software 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.310
 that I would have mine the link in the 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.800
 description you can try on them 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.920
 servers that annoys you 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.470
 I advise you to click 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.720
 here a ways exist that allows of on 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.040
 all the servers where there are sentences 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.720
 of the kind joined the server and that is 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.340
 acquitted the server like that it costs the 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.980
 cat 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.340
 they have no time for you ben what 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:53.020
 so that's not bad day they 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.130
 can talk more about ventura who 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.880
 understand nothing anymore that does that 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.260
 join for that's not bad so I 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.200
