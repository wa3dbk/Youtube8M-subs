00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.400
 and when the machine is no longer the guarantee of 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.809
 the appropriateness of the correct expendable 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.770
 all cash is me again 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.830
 repeat after the plan 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.340
 and then the question arises in many 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.140
 there is truth too many truth lucii 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.230
 I wanted to find something and in the end itâ€™s like 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.270
 right but really what's right 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.190
 no answer the only thing that i will say is that 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.440
 correct is when to change most often 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.140
 strict regulations in terms of suffering 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.759
 cash this here starting 2010 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.780
 there until 2012 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.230
 here but will not be worse if we will 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.570
 change 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.100
 masked hands pass more often including 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.489
 engine oils and give something like that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.850
 so that's about it about everything about it about 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.280
 to all 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.980
 I will tell all of the following video clip 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.410
 specifically each model that's what it is for 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.050
 need to know including for you 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.600
 warranty machine and warranty line 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 machine understand this whole picture understanding 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.309
 really setting matters you will just be 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.009
 understand what to spend money on 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.579
 but what can we really say so not to spend 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.399
 something really affects let down on 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.780
 quality work car on 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.240
 extending the life of your engine 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.009
 and that, in principle, may not be much 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.869
 concerns this gearbox to the soviet 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.359
 important points of the replacement belt 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.009
 timing on diesel let's say a car like 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.060
 often need to change the candles that shows 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.729
 service practice 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.259
 which shows the real situation that 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.109
 we are going on let's say in Russian 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.609
 market and so on and for yourself you must 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.259
 strengthen the main picture of what is the time limit 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.920
 changed in the Russian market 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.779
 really three times well, that's tough 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.869
 wrong 2 these are regulations which 

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:46.049
 were not acting until 2010 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.509
 2010 they changed and 2013 them 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.479
 changed again and so we 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.799
 machines with understanding at the moment about 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.319
 what can make sure on the official website 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.149
 in android when you go find out where 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.849
 what regulations go through on your 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.960
 by car they ask you for a model up 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:06.119
 the twelfth year or since 2012 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.069
 and then you choose a garden and with this they 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.610
 you are given regulations when and what and where 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.610
 need to change
