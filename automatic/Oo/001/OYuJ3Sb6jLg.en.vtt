Indus<00:00:44.730> tests<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.719> overall<00:00:46.140> project<00:00:46.469> how

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
Indus tests but overall project how

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.700 
Indus tests but overall project how
behavior<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.370> pattern<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.210> seen<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:49.020> so

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
behavior a pattern can be seen here so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
behavior a pattern can be seen here so
for<00:00:49.950> demonstration<00:00:50.100> purposes<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.300> shot<00:00:51.570> the

wall at the height of target dummies

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.600 
wall at the height of target dummies
head<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.690> bullet<00:00:55.020> marks<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:56.039> seen<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.489> the

from 50 meters aiming at head level and
as<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.890> bullets<00:01:20.430> land<00:01:20.820> pretty

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
as you can see all bullets land pretty

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.800 
as you can see all bullets land pretty
much<00:01:21.570> where<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> aiming<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:27.119> next<00:01:27.420> test

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
much where are you aiming the next test

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.990 
much where are you aiming the next test
the<00:01:28.049> same<00:01:28.290> weapon<00:01:28.770> only<00:01:29.400> hundred<00:01:29.820> meter

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the same weapon only hundred meter

the same weapon only hundred meter
distance<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.780> target<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.009> result<00:01:32.340> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
distance to target and the result is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.640 
distance to target and the result is
pretty<00:01:32.640> much<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> same<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> 50<00:01:34.079> meter<00:01:34.259> test

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
pretty much the same as it 50 meter test

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.219 
pretty much the same as it 50 meter test
all<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.520> bullet<00:01:35.759> hit<00:01:35.970> marks<00:01:36.420> group<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.960> at<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.969 
when this weapon was at 150 meter
distance<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:52.380> distance<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.890> can

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
distance and this distance we can

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.039 
distance and this distance we can
finally<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.610> effect<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.450> bullet<00:01:54.750> drop

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
finally see some effect of bullet drop

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.230 
finally see some effect of bullet drop
as<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.250> bullets<00:01:56.700> are<00:01:56.850> landing

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
as you can see the bullets are landing

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.520 
as you can see the bullets are landing
in<00:01:57.360> target's<00:01:57.899> neck

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
in target's neck

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.789 
in target's neck
so<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.340> chest<00:01:59.729> area<00:02:00.390> level<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.380> did<00:02:01.560> one

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
so that's chest area level we did one

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.980 
so that's chest area level we did one
test<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> new<00:02:02.610> conglomerate<00:02:02.909> Gauss<00:02:03.540> saw

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.039 
test with a new conglomerate Gauss saw
from<00:02:04.409> 150<00:02:05.219> meter<00:02:05.430> distance<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:06.060> well<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.930> you

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
from 150 meter distance as well as you

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.260 
from 150 meter distance as well as you
can<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.160> seems<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.700> bullets<00:02:09.030> landed

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
can see here it seems the bullets landed

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.859 
can see here it seems the bullets landed
a<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.810> lower<00:02:10.080> than<00:02:10.259> shoot

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
a bit lower than shoot

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.869 
a bit lower than shoot
deterrent<00:02:11.409> weapon<00:02:11.709> from<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.040> same<00:02:12.280> distance

deterrent weapon from the same distance

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.059 
deterrent weapon from the same distance
of<00:02:13.209> course<00:02:13.780> could<00:02:14.049> be<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.230> shooters<00:02:14.709> error

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
of course could be a shooters error

sovereignty ones also for clarification

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.180 
sovereignty ones also for clarification
we<00:03:21.819> used<00:03:22.000> six<00:03:22.389> x<00:03:22.720> scopes<00:03:23.230> for<00:03:23.650> precise

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
we used six x scopes for precise

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.059 
we used six x scopes for precise
shooting<00:03:24.790> at<00:03:24.910> targets<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:26.139> demonstration<00:03:26.919> I

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
shooting at targets for demonstration I

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.819 
shooting at targets for demonstration I
use<00:03:27.370> three<00:03:27.730> point<00:03:27.940> four<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.629> four<00:03:28.959> x<00:03:29.290> scopes

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
use three point four and four x scopes

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.309 
use three point four and four x scopes
so<00:03:30.129> the<00:03:30.669> actual<00:03:31.000> distance<00:03:31.419> could<00:03:31.840> be<00:03:31.900> seen

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
so the actual distance could be seen

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.920 
so the actual distance could be seen
easier<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.790> that's<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.269> for<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.540> weapons

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
easier so that's it for this weapons
