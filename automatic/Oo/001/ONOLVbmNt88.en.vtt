 ipad mini 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.950
 Wi-Fi and the fact that 3g is 500 gigabytes 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:47.219
 here we see this image 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.649
 ipad focus case past whole video 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.480
 for some reason, it’s awful just 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.399
 I take off the quality right now I don’t know how to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.309
 quality will need to do something but 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.050
 in general, I'm going to take 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.149
 semi-professional stone is not all the same 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.489
 I will take a professional DSLR 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 that vidos will be cool and awesome 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.920
 such a box is probably written here 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.930

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.460
 this is also an apple so open the lid 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.220

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.810

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.319
 apples one apple I'm already on the glue and this 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.090
 yet decided to save well how to save 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.900
 I don't know where to glue everything from me 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.480
 glue for dinner 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.430
 these apples are all stuck here 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.190
 we see a fork by the way I will immediately say about this 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.709
 plug blunt plug charges ipad whole 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.930
 eight hours even somewhere more so 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.849
 I had to order myself instead 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.269
 forks here is such a block adapter from 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.700
 apple and it charges literally two for 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.860
 half an hour somewhere even faster 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.540
 maybe two and a half hours frei here 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.100
 it's eight o'clock I don't know why they 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.900
 put in the kit exactly this plug but 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.390
 For me, this is a moron seems so I 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.139
 bought just such a plug and this plug is just 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.760
 put the box and it already lies there well 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:16.540
 know it comes with models from 1 and falls 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:20.030
 4 seems to be all so Likey 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.840
 I'll tell you about lighting will do right away 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.510
 comparing with 30 bin see what here 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.100
 cables of course lighting and 30 ben noi 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.100
 look there is of course a difference 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.560
 so look hefty so 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.060
 small but another beauty lighting 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.960
 and what can be inserted by either side 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.030
 straight let's down charging audrey cybine 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.880
 you have them just inserted so here 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:57.150
 in such a position as lighting any to me 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:04:03.170
 it seems + 1 time I put here close 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:08.190
 shorter box close the box 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.350
 let her be right here so focus on 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.900

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.700
 all the focus on the ipad see this 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.299
 here ipad black version this one 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.330
 denotes that the 3g module went 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.340
 There are no versions of this here in my opinion 5 or 8 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.470
 I do not know megapixel camera but it shoots 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.790
 she is decent here we see of course 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.560
 Apple is about to sign ipad and here 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.780
 all sorts of garbage type 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:44.630
 written Fok took the way already bought for 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:49.520
