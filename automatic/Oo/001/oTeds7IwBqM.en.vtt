00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.379
 hello everyone I hope you meet 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.600
 very well in this video I'm going to make a 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.550
 time was nominated by my friend marito 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.300
 I will put your name here if you like 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 go visit his channel I send him a kiss 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.269
 many kisses 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.240
 Marito sorry I had not had 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.280
 time to record this the video but for 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.860
 I already had time to do it, I hope that 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.020
 you like it's going to be a bit short this 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.780
 video because I have to go but 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.850
 I hope you like it 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.540
 the first question is if you were 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.070
 cosmetic which one I would choose to be and why 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.329
 I imagine everyone must know the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.409
 answer to this question 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.899
 I would choose to be mascara I love the 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:45.750
 mask so it's a make-up 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.879
 favorite is that I would have to choose the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.370
 mascara would be mascara if it were a makeup 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.640
 being that only applying a 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.890
 first that already changes the look changes 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.049
 completely all question number two 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.930
 what is your obsession when it comes to going 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:04.110
 shopping my obsession lately have been 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.240
 the glazes because lately I have 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.569
 I have been very fond of the enamels of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.920
 I really love Ian and that has been 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:15.530
 better than that lately I've been 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.530
 buying many varnishes 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.020
 very soon I will make the video of the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.660
 collection of my varnishes was a 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.410
 request for my yellow friend I'm 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.300
 enrolling this video just that I want 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.210
 fix some things before doing 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.630
 this video shows a garment that you have 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.030
 saved for a long time and that is the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.510
 that you use the least but you still refuse to 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.510
 Discard 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.930
 look in my closet and I found this this 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.990
 chalet quito 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.000
 It's been about two years since I bought it and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.650
 I have not used it but it makes me know 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.250
 that would be very good for this time 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.070
 of spring so maybe I'll 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.660
 I do not know why I did not put it on 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.479
 but they still have the label here 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.479
 As you can see, I have not put it on 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.509
 portfolio that you bring in that moment 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.180
 is the portfolio that I bring at this moment 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.360
 This was my husband's gift for Christmas 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.530
 along with the bag so it's the one that 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.530
 I bring in this moment 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.569
 with what perfume you identify me like 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.299
 much this perfume of brown smell in this 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.010
 perfume is using it for years since 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.560
 I was going to elementary school I loved this 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.249
 perfume and I like it a lot because it smells 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.159
 like a is like a very cool smell like 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:52.350
 come here and less if I use it a lot because 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.300
 I'm not finishing it 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.590
 the life that can not be missing in your 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.590
 cosmetic case 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.330
 and lately I was liking a lot 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.580
 this lipstick I almost do not know about people 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.650
 that use lipsticks but these brand 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.850
 man that are the leperos like them a lot 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.440
 because they are not so dark colors and 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.210
 also 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.210
 They are like mint before 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.270
 you do not dry your lips 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.860
 what is the pocket mirror that 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.860
 you use 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.450
 you are here 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.230
 I like it because it is very small and 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.230
 fits in my portfolio 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.970
 the last question of comfortable shoes 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.970
 favorites these 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.360
 I really like these shoes because they are 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.640
 very tall and those have no heels 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.640
 and I always wear these shoes 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.270
 thank you very much for watching this video I'm going to 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.580

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.200
 names here I hope you liked it
