00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.050
 Yes 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.290
 playstation all-stars battle royal 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.080
 so it's the sony game that wanted 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.610
 more or less mid may smash bros then 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.040
 everyone knows about how 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.080
 works smash bros but at playstation 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.059
 all-star battle royal is the game 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.160
 birthday in quotation marks from the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.070
 playstation brand that brings together a little 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.230
 all the characters more or less 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.199
 emblematic of the brand and puts them 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.510
 in a fighting game a little bit 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.840
 stuff everything with lots of objects with 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:02.839
 super attacks and finally it's a 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.670
 little different from this match then the 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.790
 feature of playstation all star 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.220
 is that they do not rest on the ring 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.750
 outcome like smash bros ie 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.620
 that the characters you will be able to the state 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.110
 pay as much as you want 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.080
 opponents like m the players 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.540
 humans it will not die naturally 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.869
 to kill them you have to fill a bar 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.340
 of super and use a super attack 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.390
 so that's it works a little 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.770
 differently because the smash bros 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.300
 it was really a damage meter that 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.910
 was being tapped into the meck 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.860
 the more they would go out but there we went 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.090
 three levels of super knowing they 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.130
 are becoming more powerful and that 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.450
 the super level 3 in general te 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.520
 make it possible to fuck everyone 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.470
 the screen very very easily but he 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.410
 takes a long time for climbs 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.980
 especially if in the meantime you do not get 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.930
 badly typing by others 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.500
 there are various ways to mount one's 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.220
 the simplest gauge is to type 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.450
 normally to do sequences 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.070
 especially because it's very very 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.930
 important in the game and it's true that 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.900
 the game has an almost game-like dimension 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 fighting is much more developed than 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.320
 in smash bros you can do combos 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.050
 there are joggers I get the but 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.000
 on the ground it is a little less developed 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.980
 on the dodges but the whole side 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.210
 offensive in any case is a lot more 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.070
 evolved that what we could find 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.680
 in this match and the contrario objects 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.050
 it's also a way to raise your gauge 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.940
 but not directly since when you go 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.370
 use objects or shops 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.230
 it's actually going to bring out orbs 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.610
 of energy of the characters you're going 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.990
 have to pick up but that can be 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.790
 picked up by the other players so 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.730
 it's a bit of a double-edged sword 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.440
 final it works rather well it's 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.260
 true we were a bit suspicious at 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.540
 departure and even if it does not have the potato 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.130
 of this match the side we can go out to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.840
 any time we can kill very people 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.950
 easily there is still a 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.950
 pretty interesting mechanics 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.349
 so even if the super system the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.299
 gaming system in general 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.090
 and it's interesting 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.219
 we must recognize that level 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.889
 balancing well it's a bit difficult 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.989
 to estimate for now who's going to be the 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:11.319
 more advantageous that will be the most 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.459
 disadvantaged but there are still some 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.439
 worries about the types of super 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.099
 so the super attack is easy to 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.269
 trigger it is also very easy to 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.519
 defuse since it is enough that there is a 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.750
 character who types during kill 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.639
 I assure you, father, whoever 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.930
 leave to make a mug so that this one 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.359
 no one and you share 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.930
 but there are characters who have 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:37.510
 especially level 1 and 2 supers who 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.260
 are really not abusing but that are 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.109
 very powerful 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.489
 because they have zone attacks 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.489
 that can go vertically 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.409
 or who will cover an area anyway 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.280
 quite happy it's consistent that go 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.319
 allow you to have the benefits 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.939
 much more easily than with 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.280
 characters that attack a father be at the 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.769
 times I think including sweet tooth or 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.989
 so the famous magazine that yet 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.459
 could have attacks that got you 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.060
 a lot of people and actually it's blocking 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.099
 a guy 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.359
 then that of the wages and there are 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.359
 guys really characters that are 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:10.660
 very favored we will say by this system 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:15.550
 and since there is no way 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.290
 between unimed go out and friends of the 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.299
 Queen was to kill otherwise than with the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.010
 great it's a little detrimental when 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.440
 even in my opinion on the long term to the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.750
 balance of the game especially as the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.610
 dodges are like I said a little bit 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.440
 just now not necessarily obvious to 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.760
 go out and that his request really 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.290
 a lot more work and 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.270
 complexity and grip that this 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.010
 that can be found in smash bros then 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.320
 the last important point in 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.320
 playstation all-star battle royal it's 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.690
 the dress and the content then it's 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.910
 true that at this level we are left 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.880
 a little on his hunger at the content level 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.430
 we do not really have a lot of 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.530
 characters the next will arrive in dlc 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.540
 there will be some free but we 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.030
 knows that a good many of the others who 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.990
 will be paying there is also a lack of 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.970
 personality or two anyway 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.340
 embedding throughout the interface the 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.450
 menus there are a lot of little details 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.490
 who make it really a game 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.800
 sad simply for a game 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.390
 that they made a big party it's 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.640
 very very sad the last boss is 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.260
 an illustrious stranger who is who knew 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.410
 a little bit I was in the united states but 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.060
 that's all and at the level of the 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.140
 content the mode the solo mode is 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.900
 really rickety 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.360
 it's an arcade mode to con with just 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.280
 a succession of small fights there 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.040
 is not two there is no real challenge where 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.050
 the challenges are very very boring there is a 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.320
 little initiation but we do not learn 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.810
 great thing about the characters know it's 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.720
 delicate 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.660
 as a game really a 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.240
 unimportant having a meeting of 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.440
 charismatic characters and and 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.240
 fun or really classy that's it 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.900
 lack of consistency and that's really what 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.900
 serving the game 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.260
 we expected the worst with playstation 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.810
 royal lissar battle finally we are 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.370
 a little pleasantly surprised especially 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.020
 on the game system it's true that 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.730
 that's what will really make the 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.850
 difference compared to smash bros for 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.950
 those who love smash bros it's sure that 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.540
 it works differently and 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.230
 it's not bad anymore to have done a 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.960
 super system a little different from 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.720
 to try to get a little bit 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.090
 part of smash bros on some sides 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.800
 on the other hand the game would have deserved to 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.330
 get a lot more inspiration from smash bros 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:44.660
 on the variety of its content really 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.420
 all the while wrapping the side the 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.890
 really festive side of caen that we can 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.990
 have in smash bros and all the 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.000
 joke there is a game a little too much 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.320
 serious about something that should 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.320
 to be much more regulated
