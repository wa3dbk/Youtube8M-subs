00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:11.550
A Lesson for my Teacher

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.633
I lived on the Mosque Street in Rameswaram,

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.133
a city famous for its Shiva temple.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.633
a city famous for its Shiva temple.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.550
a city famous for its Shiva temple.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.383
a city famous for its Shiva temple.

00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:24.133
Every evening on my way home from the mosque,

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.467
I would linger near the temple.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:29.883
I would linger near the temple.

00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:32.133
I always felt like a stranger here

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.550
as the temple goers stared suspiciously at me.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.717
They probably wondered what a Muslim boy was doing

00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:37.883
in front of a temple.

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:39.467
in front of a temple.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:40.967
in front of a temple.

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:44.550
in front of a temple.

00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:47.300
The truth was that

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.800
The truth was that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
I loved to listen to the rhythmic chanting of the mantras,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.133
though I never understood a word.

00:00:56.133 --> 00:01:00.050
There was a strange magic in them.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.717
Of course, something else led me there. My best friend,

00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:08.217
Ramananadha Sastry,

00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:09.133
was the son of the head priest.

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.883
was the son of the head priest.

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:18.217
He sat beside his father at this hour,

00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:20.383
reciting hymns.

00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:22.300
Ram would steal a smiling glance at me from time to time.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.550
Ram would steal a smiling glance at me from time to time.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.133
Ram would steal a smiling glance at me from time to time.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.133
At school, Ram and I always sat together

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.717
At school, Ram and I always sat together

00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:38.133
At school, Ram and I always sat together

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.133
on the first bench of our classroom.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.967
We were like brothers.

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:46.300
We were like brothers.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.383
However, being a Hindu priest's son,

00:01:47.383 --> 00:01:49.800
he wore a sacred thread,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.883
while my white cap marked me as a Muslim.

00:01:50.883 --> 00:01:54.633
while my white cap marked me as a Muslim.

00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:58.467
One day, when we were in the fifth standard,

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.300
One day, when we were in the fifth standard,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.550
a new teacher came to our class.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.383
He looked strict.

00:02:05.383 --> 00:02:08.217
He went around the class tapping his cane on his palm

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:11.050
He went around the class tapping his cane on his palm

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.550
and stopped before us.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550
and stopped before us.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.633
“You, the one in the white cap.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:20.050
“You, the one in the white cap.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.883
How dare

00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:24.050
you sit beside the temple priest’s son!” He shouted,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.883
you sit beside the temple priest’s son!” He shouted,

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:27.550
“Go sit on the last bench.”

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.967
“Go sit on the last bench.”

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:32.050
I felt hurt. With tears in my eyes,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.383
I picked up my books

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:36.300
and shifted to the last row.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.133
and shifted to the last row.

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:41.050
Ram and I

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.217
wept together silently after school.

00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:46.133
wept together silently after school.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:48.383
We thought we would not be allowed to be friends anymore.

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:52.050
We thought we would not be allowed to be friends anymore.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.383
When I reached home that day my father looked at me

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:00.717
and asked, “Were you crying... what’s wrong son?”

00:03:00.717 --> 00:03:02.550
and asked, “Were you crying... what’s wrong son?”

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.467
I recounted the whole incident to my father

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:07.717
I recounted the whole incident to my father

00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:08.883
While Ram also told his family the same story.

00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:13.050
While Ram also told his family the same story.

00:03:13.883 --> 00:03:15.800
Early the next morning

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.717
Ram came running to our house and said,

00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:19.800
“Father has asked you to come to our house immediately.”

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.217
“Father has asked you to come to our house immediately.”

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:27.217
I was terrified.

00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:30.050
I thought I was in for some more trouble.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.050
I thought I was in for some more trouble.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.967
We hurried back to Ram's house.

00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:36.133
My heart skipped a beat when I saw our new teacher standing there.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.383
My heart skipped a beat when I saw our new teacher standing there.

00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:41.883
My heart skipped a beat when I saw our new teacher standing there.

00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:43.717
“In the light of our discussion,

00:03:43.717 --> 00:03:46.300
“In the light of our discussion,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.217
apologise to Kalam here,”

00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:49.550
apologise to Kalam here,”

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.633
said Ram’s father

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:54.550
with a stern face.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.717
I could not believe what I had just heard!

00:03:56.717 --> 00:04:00.550
The head priest was asking the teacher to apologise to me?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.883
“No child is less than another in God’s eyes.

00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:05.050
“No child is less than another in God’s eyes.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.717
“No child is less than another in God’s eyes.

00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:07.717
“No child is less than another in God’s eyes.

00:04:07.717 --> 00:04:09.467
“No child is less than another in God’s eyes.

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:11.633
It is your duty as a teacher to help students

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:13.217
live in harmony in spite of the differences in their background.

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:14.133
live in harmony in spite of the differences in their background.

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.133
live in harmony in spite of the differences in their background.

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:18.550
live in harmony in spite of the differences in their background.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.883
live in harmony in spite of the differences in their background.

00:04:20.883 --> 00:04:21.967
You can no longer teach in this school,” he said.

00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:24.550
You can no longer teach in this school,” he said.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.217
Our teacher immediately asked me to forgive him.

00:04:27.217 --> 00:04:28.383
He hugged me and said,

00:04:28.383 --> 00:04:31.050
“I am sorry, Kalam,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.550
I have learnt an important lesson in life today.”

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.883
I have learnt an important lesson in life today.”

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:35.883
I have learnt an important lesson in life today.”

00:04:35.883 --> 00:04:38.383
I have learnt an important lesson in life today.”

00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:41.133
Ram’s father saw that the teacher sincerely regretted his behaviour

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:43.800
Ram’s father saw that the teacher sincerely regretted his behaviour

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.717
and permitted him to continue teaching.

00:04:46.717 --> 00:04:50.467
and permitted him to continue teaching.

00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:53.967
From that day on, Ram and I

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:57.050
sat together proudly on the front bench.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.967
sat together proudly on the front bench.

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:02.967
We have remained the best of friends ever since.
