guess<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.400> unique<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.700> some<00:01:20.939> ways<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.540> it's

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
guess is unique in some ways I know it's

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.890 
guess is unique in some ways I know it's
it's<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> out<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.439> my<00:01:22.590> opinion<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.900> also

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's kind of out in my opinion and also

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
it's kind of out in my opinion and also
if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.830> quickly<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.159> picks<00:01:26.220> lot

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
if you also just quickly this picks lot

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.249 
if you also just quickly this picks lot
looks<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.720> good<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:27.960> text

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
looks really really good at this text

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:28.910 
looks really really good at this text
bag

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
bag

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
bag
but<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> look<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.790> stuff<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
but then if you look at stuff like the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.410 
but then if you look at stuff like the
axe<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.590> shovel<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.150> slightly<00:01:33.150> odd<00:01:33.240> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
axe and the shovel it's slightly odd in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
axe and the shovel it's slightly odd in
the<00:01:33.479> same<00:01:33.659> way<00:01:33.840> I'd<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.409> maybe<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.950> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the same way I'd I know maybe it's a you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.260 
the same way I'd I know maybe it's a you
know<00:01:35.189> preference<00:01:35.549> thing<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:35.909> let's<00:01:36.030> try<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
know preference thing but let's try and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.660 
know preference thing but let's try and
focus<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> buildings<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.439> um

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
focus on the buildings right now so um

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.679 
focus on the buildings right now so um
if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:38.880> all<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.030> buildings<00:01:39.390> were<00:01:39.479> going

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
if you look all the buildings were going

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.810 
if you look all the buildings were going
past<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.670> all

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
past and they all have this they all

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.100 
past and they all have this they all
have<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> two<00:01:42.630> problems<00:01:42.960> they

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
have like one of two problems they

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.719 
have like one of two problems they
overlook<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.710> look<00:01:43.829> pretty<00:01:44.100> good<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.460> which

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
overlook you look pretty good like which

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.580 
overlook you look pretty good like which
I<00:01:44.850> guess<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> problem<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.229> loads<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.500> them

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
I guess is a problem but loads of them

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020 
I guess is a problem but loads of them
just<00:01:46.770> looked<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.130> they<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.340> normally<00:01:47.820> but

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
just looked like they do normally but

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.389 
just looked like they do normally but
quite<00:01:48.270> bland<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.020> I'd<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.220> one

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
quite bland and I'd know like this one

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.800 
quite bland and I'd know like this one
it<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.549> looks<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:50.909> an<00:01:51.030> orange<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.570> brown

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
it just looks like an orange and brown

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.020 
it just looks like an orange and brown
mashup<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.310> textures<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.820> work

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
mashup and the textures don't work

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
mashup and the textures don't work
together<00:01:54.299> properly<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.930> its<00:01:55.020> sudden<00:01:55.439> it's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
together properly in its sudden it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.580 
together properly in its sudden it's
kind<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> odd<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.930> this<00:01:57.930> text<00:01:58.200> fact<00:01:58.350> definite

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
kind of odd like this text fact definite

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.170 
kind of odd like this text fact definite
has<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> weakness<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.189> converting<00:01:59.700> worlds<00:01:59.969> over

has a weakness in converting worlds over

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
has a weakness in converting worlds over
to<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.689> there's<00:02:01.469> loads<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.159> just

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
to it because there's loads of just

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.310 
to it because there's loads of just
under<00:02:02.610> incompatibilities<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.960> half<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
under incompatibilities because half the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.569 
under incompatibilities because half the
textures<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.890> seem<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.369> look<00:02:05.520> like

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
textures and it seem to look like

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.800 
textures and it seem to look like
they're<00:02:06.799> coming<00:02:07.799> from<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.879> hop<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.569> try<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
they're coming from like hop and try to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.600 
they're coming from like hop and try to
look<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.410> normally<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.489> other

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
look like they normally do and the other

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.970 
look like they normally do and the other
hop<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> textures<00:02:12.300> seem<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.780> try<00:02:13.020> it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
hop the textures seem to try it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.679 
hop the textures seem to try it
I<00:02:14.010> did<00:02:14.579> it<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:14.999> seem<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.269> try<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.540> look

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
I did it they seem to try and look

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.209 
I did it they seem to try and look
really<00:02:16.079> good<00:02:16.260> which<00:02:16.409> is<00:02:16.560> great<00:02:16.739> for<00:02:16.859> creative

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
really good which is great for creative

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:18.559 
really good which is great for creative
way<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.549> pick<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.879> blocks<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.359> for

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
way you can pick the blocks that's for

way you can pick the blocks that's for
survival<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.349> doesn't<00:02:20.040> seem<00:02:20.249> particularly

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
survival it doesn't seem particularly

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.489 
survival it doesn't seem particularly
great<00:02:20.969> because<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.389> means<00:02:21.540> juice<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.260> stuck

if I if I to give some advice if you
were<00:02:31.769> looking<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.250> by<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:33.000> text<00:02:33.299> pack<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
were looking just by one text pack so

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.629 
were looking just by one text pack so
far<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.230> haven't<00:02:34.379> got<00:02:34.530> any<00:02:34.739> I'd<00:02:35.159> say<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.519> you

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
far you haven't got any I'd say if you

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.250 
far you haven't got any I'd say if you
wanted<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:36.000> text<00:02:36.150> back<00:02:36.359> that<00:02:36.629> does<00:02:36.810> what<00:02:37.109> this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
wanted to text back that does what this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.220 
wanted to text back that does what this
does<00:02:37.319> like<00:02:38.069> some<00:02:38.639> of<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.879> time<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.870> how<00:02:40.049> it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
does like some of the time like how it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.229 
does like some of the time like how it
you<00:02:40.379> know<00:02:40.409> like<00:02:40.769> right<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:41.189> it<00:02:41.370> looks<00:02:41.400> just

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
you know like right now it looks just

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.909 
you know like right now it looks just
kind<00:02:42.629> of<00:02:42.689> like<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> never<00:02:43.109> but<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.799> know<00:02:43.889> a

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:43.919 
kind of like the never but you know a

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.409 
kind of like the never but you know a
little<00:02:44.189> bit<00:02:44.310> better<00:02:44.459> I'd<00:02:44.939> recommend<00:02:45.329> going

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.419 
little bit better I'd recommend going

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.000 
little bit better I'd recommend going
the<00:02:45.599> natural<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.139> fancy<00:02:46.439> text<00:02:46.680> pack<00:02:46.829> they

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the natural the fancy text pack they

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.720 
the natural the fancy text pack they
look<00:02:47.189> really<00:02:47.549> really<00:02:47.669> great<00:02:48.030> at<00:02:48.299> what<00:02:48.450> they<00:02:48.480> do

I guess the Mass Effect ex back like um

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.149 
I guess the Mass Effect ex back like um
those<00:03:01.169> are<00:03:01.199> definitely<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.650> ones<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.949> want

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159

if you want a crazed text backer thing
this<00:03:04.469> seems<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.799> be<00:03:04.859> somewhere<00:03:05.189> in<00:03:05.280> between

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
this seems to be somewhere in between

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.789 
this seems to be somewhere in between
and<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:05.969> honestly<00:03:06.269> I'm<00:03:06.870> not<00:03:07.109> seeing<00:03:07.409> the<00:03:07.620> use

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
and I honestly I'm not seeing the use

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.860 
and I honestly I'm not seeing the use
for<00:03:08.040> too<00:03:08.189> much<00:03:08.310> because<00:03:08.579> it's<00:03:08.849> I<00:03:09.180> know<00:03:09.599> that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
for too much because it's I know that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.240 
for too much because it's I know that
the<00:03:10.049> mix<00:03:10.230> between<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.560> two<00:03:10.680> doesn't<00:03:10.980> work<00:03:11.099> too

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
the mix between the two doesn't work too

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.970 
the mix between the two doesn't work too
well<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.549> me<00:03:11.609> um<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:13.019> does<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.469> a<00:03:13.500> great<00:03:13.680> use

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
well for me um it does have a great use

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.069 
well for me um it does have a great use
for<00:03:14.010> building<00:03:14.250> cities<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.849> stuff<00:03:15.060> but<00:03:15.840> as<00:03:15.930> far

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
for building cities and stuff but as far

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.249 
for building cities and stuff but as far
as<00:03:16.109> flavor<00:03:16.349> goes<00:03:16.590> maybe<00:03:17.069> give<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> mess<00:03:18.259> how

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:19.259 
as flavor goes maybe give a mess how

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:20.809 
as flavor goes maybe give a mess how
have<00:03:19.379> you<00:03:19.530> sawn<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.829> never<00:03:19.979> the<00:03:20.400> never<00:03:20.579> does

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
look you know kind of cool bit which is

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.689 
look you know kind of cool bit which is
good<00:03:22.500> it's<00:03:23.189> a<00:03:23.310> nice<00:03:23.639> mix<00:03:23.879> up<00:03:24.030> never<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:25.579> on<00:03:26.579> the

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
good it's a nice mix up never and on the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.580 
good it's a nice mix up never and on the
ground<00:03:26.879> does<00:03:27.239> look<00:03:27.509> a<00:03:27.599> little<00:03:27.689> strange<00:03:28.199> in<00:03:28.470> a

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
ground does look a little strange in a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.689 
ground does look a little strange in a
way<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.889> might<00:03:29.040> make<00:03:29.189> mining<00:03:29.579> more

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
way that might make mining more

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.159 
way that might make mining more
enjoyable<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.359> you<00:03:30.540> know<00:03:30.629> what<00:03:30.840> might<00:03:31.019> want<00:03:31.139> to

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
enjoyable so you know what might want to

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:31.819 
enjoyable so you know what might want to
bear<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.470> in<00:03:31.560> mind

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
bear that in mind

see<00:03:32.430> I'm<00:03:32.519> gonna<00:03:32.639> go<00:03:32.790> down<00:03:32.939> and<00:03:33.180> mine<00:03:33.569> or<00:03:33.840> I

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
see I'm gonna go down and mine or I

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.390 
see I'm gonna go down and mine or I
can't<00:03:34.139> actually<00:03:34.259> mine<00:03:34.530> right<00:03:34.680> now<00:03:34.709> oh<00:03:34.829> I<00:03:35.250> do

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
can't actually mine right now oh I do

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.909 
can't actually mine right now oh I do
have<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.579> pickaxe<00:03:35.849> it's<00:03:36.180> not<00:03:36.359> a<00:03:36.389> new<00:03:36.689> one<00:03:36.919> BS

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
have a pickaxe it's not a new one BS

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.289 
have a pickaxe it's not a new one BS
this<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.220> what<00:03:38.340> underground<00:03:38.729> looks<00:03:38.939> like<00:03:39.150> if

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
this is what underground looks like if

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.119 
this is what underground looks like if
you<00:03:39.329> were<00:03:39.419> to<00:03:39.720> branch<00:03:39.959> mining<00:03:40.379> it<00:03:40.949> looks

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
you were to branch mining it looks

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.349 
you were to branch mining it looks
different<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.699> way<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:42.060> actually<00:03:42.180> makes

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
different in a way that actually makes

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.999 
different in a way that actually makes
it<00:03:42.629> a<00:03:42.720> lot<00:03:42.810> more<00:03:42.870> friendly<00:03:43.349> like<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:43.799> very

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.009 
it a lot more friendly like this is very

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.679 
it a lot more friendly like this is very
plastic<00:03:44.310> texture<00:03:44.849> packing<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:45.329> look<00:03:45.509> at<00:03:45.629> the

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
plastic texture packing like look at the

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.550 
plastic texture packing like look at the
bores<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:47.099> you<00:03:47.159> you<00:03:47.790> know<00:03:47.909> if<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.989> idea<00:03:49.349> of

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
bores so you you know if if the idea of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.270 
bores so you you know if if the idea of
a<00:03:50.689> texture<00:03:51.689> pack<00:03:51.870> that's<00:03:52.259> like<00:03:52.739> kind<00:03:53.009> of<00:03:53.159> a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
a texture pack that's like kind of a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.550 
a texture pack that's like kind of a
cross<00:03:53.549> between<00:03:53.729> lots<00:03:54.060> texture<00:03:54.449> packs<00:03:54.659> like<00:03:55.199> I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
cross between lots texture packs like I

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.439 
cross between lots texture packs like I
guess<00:03:55.949> this<00:03:56.159> could<00:03:56.189> kind<00:03:56.669> of<00:03:56.819> be<00:03:56.939> lots<00:03:57.120> texture

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
guess this could kind of be lots texture

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.300 
guess this could kind of be lots texture
pack<00:03:57.599> someone<00:03:57.959> appeals<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:58.889> this<00:03:59.099> is

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
pack someone appeals to you this is

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
however if you really want a texture

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.420 
however if you really want a texture
pack<00:04:04.319> also<00:04:04.500> look<00:04:04.709> at<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.859> wolf<00:04:05.069> he's<00:04:05.250> just

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
pack also look at the wolf he's just

pack also look at the wolf he's just
amazing<00:04:05.669> looking<00:04:06.090> but<00:04:07.049> if<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.259> want<00:04:07.379> to

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
amazing looking but if you want to

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.929 
amazing looking but if you want to
texture<00:04:07.650> pack<00:04:07.889> that<00:04:08.129> does<00:04:08.280> one<00:04:08.639> thing

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
texture pack that does one thing

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.520 
texture pack that does one thing
specifically<00:04:09.449> I<00:04:09.719> don't<00:04:10.169> think<00:04:10.289> this<00:04:10.409> is

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
specifically I don't think this is

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.610 
specifically I don't think this is
honestly<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.949> one<00:04:11.159> to<00:04:11.310> go<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.669> because<00:04:12.620> if

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
honestly the one to go for because if

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.890 
honestly the one to go for because if
you<00:04:13.709> look<00:04:13.859> around<00:04:14.159> it<00:04:14.430> just<00:04:14.699> it's<00:04:15.569> just<00:04:15.689> too

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
you look around it just it's just too

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.689 
you look around it just it's just too
many<00:04:16.229> texture<00:04:16.560> packs<00:04:16.739> all<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.159> like<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.459> has

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
many texture packs all it like it has
