00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
everyone knows that Robin Williams

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.520 
everyone knows that Robin Williams
passed<00:00:39.540> away<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> few<00:00:40.050> days<00:00:40.440> ago<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.309> ago<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
passed away a few days ago or a ago and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.500 
passed away a few days ago or a ago and
in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.980> news<00:00:44.160> they<00:00:44.340> said<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.789> he<00:00:45.120> committed

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
in the news they said that he committed

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.139 
in the news they said that he committed
suicide<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> don't<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:47.789> they're

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
suicide and so but I don't think they're

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.229 
suicide and so but I don't think they're
really<00:00:48.300> respecting<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.410> actor<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.670> think

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
really respecting that actor I think

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.830 
really respecting that actor I think
they're<00:00:51.390> kind<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.629> milk<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> using

they're kind of milk it out but I using

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.160 
they're kind of milk it out but I using
him<00:00:54.840> earth<00:00:55.399> or<00:00:56.399> his<00:00:56.789> character<00:00:57.059> or<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:58.020> like

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
him earth or his character or just like

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.180

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.830 
like just I don't kind of like well I
don't<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:02.820> factor<00:01:03.239> didn't<00:01:03.570> sound

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
don't think the way factor didn't sound

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.310 
don't think the way factor didn't sound
like<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.290> wrong<00:01:04.530> Williams<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.610> mean

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
like it was wrong Williams but I mean

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
like it was wrong Williams but I mean
it's<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.409> kind<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> sad<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:08.790> using

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it's just kind of sad that they're using

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.590 
it's just kind of sad that they're using
like<00:01:10.250> their<00:01:11.250> cartoon<00:01:11.850> version<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> Robin

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
like their cartoon version of Robin

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.320 
like their cartoon version of Robin
Williams<00:01:12.950> even<00:01:13.950> though<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.150> voice

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
Williams even though it's not the voice

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.010 
Williams even though it's not the voice
is<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.840> handsome<00:01:16.369> anyways<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.299> wanted
