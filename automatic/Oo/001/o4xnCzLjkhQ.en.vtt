00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.540
 Yes 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.380
 Atlas Weinhausen presents the telescopic loader for the first time at Bauma 2010 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:13.229
 75 d 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.439
 When designing the machine, special emphasis was placed on an attractive one 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.400
 Design laid 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.930
 as pale managing director Artur Gabriele explained wow-forum 24 TV that 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.399
 Concept of the device and presented the wheel loader Arier 95 shortly 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.590
 we are a completely new device for the Moore Weyerhaeuser we 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:34.940
 have tried here 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.560
 to make a device with 55 kW 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.520
 Percent of these engine powers and percent a wheelbase from 2009 to 50 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.720
 Millimeters on 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.910
 Percent on ship mill of 4000 80 millimeters and a penalty of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 4000 of a 50 millimeters 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.360
 yes who is trying that 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.890
 to introduce the features of the old cabin in the end 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.390
 completely new exterior shape of the cabin 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.210
 so we took advantage of the seaweed stage we saw and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.470
 Over the last few years, I've gotten integrated with one here 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.700
 completely new exterior design 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.170
 The hood has been completely redesigned 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.650
 and have been optimized out we have been trying to search here 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.610
 as far as possible to get down with the outside noise leaving the driver 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.770
 a better feeling Urt in the cabin as well as out of the cabin 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.380
 have these 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.940
 Bonnet here one a reduction of the nominal value of 1 lost 7 DB AG 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.300
 and that is very much 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.180
 and the same refuted at the same engine 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.260
 We see them for the first time the new font of Atlas in silver 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.340
 he always has 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.700
 I think the signature so late that we have set up there as there 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.470
 for the future we want the waste glass 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.250
 Atlas stays like it was in the last ten years 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.430
 So here you see a machine at the fair for the first time 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.290
 where is here shown four offices life I believe we are 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.560
 one of the first exhibitors that we ever show the MICEX yet 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.020
 open so that everyone can see what happens here with 4 4 in Serbia 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.030
 In 2012, our machines have to be equipped that way and that's one 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.219
 Giant challenge of the development department 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.430
 the new machine is developing enough for Europe and in Europe 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.409
 on the air around the clock 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.079
 as they search the police 24 points the woman
