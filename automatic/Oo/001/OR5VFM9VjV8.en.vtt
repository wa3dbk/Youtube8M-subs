to fight it you can move left to right

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.430 
to fight it you can move left to right
toward<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.370> screen<00:03:44.670> moves<00:03:44.940> over<00:03:45.510> them<00:03:45.660> come

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
toward the screen moves over them come

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.850 
toward the screen moves over them come
back<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.830> closer<00:03:47.160> will<00:03:47.460> be<00:03:47.550> going

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
back and closer will be going

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.320 

there's<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.010> key<00:03:51.190> pulse<00:03:51.670> knowing<00:03:51.940> something

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
there's the key pulse knowing something

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:02.460 
there's the key pulse knowing something
about<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.080> next<00:03:56.200> piece
