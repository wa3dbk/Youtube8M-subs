00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.730
 m times perhaps the most famous western 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.290
 So 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.790
 and he is being written by military journals. 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.430
 factory news bulletins he's main 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.449
 TV star of the tank world 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.159
 the most modern Russian tank t 90 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.369
 they are both passengers in the west often not 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.349
 remembers 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.949
 NATO experts put on 3 90 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.599
 the climate is out of date 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.599
 Is it really true? 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.539
 Russian loan yesterday 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.520
 but is it worth American roxette 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.170
 the uninitiated can 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.650
 think that this car is of different classes 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.180
 t 90 much easier for americans 47 tons 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.270
 against 64 it is much more compact 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.250
 Yes, and does not look so impressive 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.550
 however, in the global arms markets these 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.610
 cars are direct competitors 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.580
 now this is explained by their can 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.590
 reveal the potential today to evaluate 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.760
 machine protection is simple compared to 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.540
 Others can not be stored 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.760
 need to know what it is 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.089
 brahms building used 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.500
 depleted uranium 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.640
 fans 90 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.980
 built-in dynamic protection 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.360
 americans frontal armor two bronze 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.220
 proved its reliability during 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.540
 wars in iraq 90 first and 2030 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.230
 it can withstand the hit of the Soviet 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.230
 125 mm armor-piercing shells 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.810
 it does not say that we are talking about 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.530
 ammunition decommissioned as early as 70 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.060
 third years 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.799
 moreover modern 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.490
 shells share abramson then not 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.710
 fired 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 under the new rules t 90 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.259
 during the test fired 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.720
 the latest subcaliber 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.480
 taken or projectiles 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.400
 equal in efficiency and the most 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.080
 modern projectile 127 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.930
 guns this season 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990
 200 meters 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 our shells 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.930
 after that the car came under its own power 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.730
 to the observation deck 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.240
 then without repairing an abortion 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.899
 90 put at risk improved 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.170
 from grenade launchers 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.370
 The result is the same 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.870
 armor is not broken 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.890

 in iraq in 2030 Spartak and Abrams 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.079
 fought their way through progressively 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.219
 grenades and even the very first samples 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.180
 weaknesses appeared in Russia and

 electronics at the moment when the main 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.239
 engine muffles 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.430
 its easy to parasite from large-caliber 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.439
 machine gun 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.469
 only 90 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.469
 quit is under according to al tani 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.079
 t 90 even as standard 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.979
 equipped with a bucket complex 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.259
 electronic suppression that 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:46.579
 this system goes off enemy missiles 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.419

 bullet abrams from such equipment 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.379
 in the duel situation the american tank 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.879
 unlikely to be able to resist 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.640
 guided missiles t 90 launched through 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.779

 five kilometers 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.540
 accurate firing in this case 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.439
 approaching absolute 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.439
 rocket can shoot from the place and movements

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.299
 no special skills required 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.209
 to patrimony 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.009
 power guns t 90 e bronze approximately 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.279
 are equivalent 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.039
 armor penetration domestic 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.209
 projectile tungsten cores 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.839
 in no way inferior to its competitor 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.239
 American s along with the core 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.259
 from depleted uranium 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.999
 similar shells have been developed and we 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.209
 but they are extremely harmful for the crew 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.809
 their mass production was 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:38.809
 postponed for a rainy day 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.669
 he can destroy not only 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.079
 armored targets 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.199
 but as the military says there to 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.859
 dangerous manpower 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.480
 cska natalya chikov 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.319
 in the calculations 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.009
 in this for 90 significantly 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.679
 surpasses m 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.719
 ammunition of our tank includes 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.789
 fragmentation shrapnel projectile and 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:58.979
 remote undermining 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.629
 up you can blow right over your heads 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.119
 enemy soldiers 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.429
 helicopter gunship 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.429
 the Japanese have no such shells 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.680
 not without the help of the western military 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.699
 magazines 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.379
 it was believed that electronics and 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.239
 our optical devices 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.769
 i'm perfect 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.479
 actually complex management 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.509
 fire at 90 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.770
 not inferior to NATO counterparts 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.000
 moreover, this bank belongs 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 unofficial power record and 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.069
 country firing rate 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:29.800
 on one of the demonstrations 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.760
 foreign delegations 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.719
 in workers and 90 thousand 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:35.259
 64 7 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.869
 and hit hard real targets 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:39.779
 located at a distance 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.360
 two and a half kilometers 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 firing the outcome at a speed of 25 kilometers 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.550
 at one o'clock 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.610
 official record holder german 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.300
 leopard 2 in difficult conditions affects 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.749
 one goal less 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:54.799
 thanks to amp t guided missiles 

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.659
 90 has the longest hand 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.349
 easel world 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.740
 earlier variants of the t 90 yielded and abrams 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.080
 mobility 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.870
 with the advent of a thousand strong engine 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.880
 our tank is almost on par with Abrams 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.939
 therefore the most important indicator 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.399
 dad cross-country these two tanks in general 

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:14.220
 can't compare 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.620
 f at the exhibition of weapons and a half 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.219
 93 years old 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.690
 and I just fall apart 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.060
 lost caterpillars court on the usual slope 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.040
 exhibition tankodrom our tank on 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.790
 competitive tests passed 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.710
 almost 3 thousand kilometers along 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.050
 impassable malay jungle by 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.270
 off road in which took place and his 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.339
 competitors 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.389
 he showed himself brilliantly and in the course 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.069
 march in indian desert tatras fire 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.279
 exceeding 50 degrees 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.949
 an indispensable combat requirement 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.080
 technology of the future 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.800
 high informatization 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 the car 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.680
 in the near future on 3 90 will install a new 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.099
 satellite equipment 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.080
 navigation 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.240
 this way I took extra 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.419
 his last advantage over 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.199
 our hunter 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.710
 today up to 90 exceeds and 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.860
 image by most indicators 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.990
 but also correspondence competition 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.830
 finish the possibilities of them 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.479
 modernization almost exhausted 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.689
 on the battlefield soon introduced tanks in 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:13.349
 next year
