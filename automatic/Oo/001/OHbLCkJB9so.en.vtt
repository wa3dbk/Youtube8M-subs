00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
plants in they'd just die off before

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.749 
plants in they'd just die off before
winter<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.019> yeah<00:00:31.920> I'm<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.369> putting<00:00:32.730> a

lot a lot new plants in next spring new
water<00:00:36.329> lilies<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.170> these<00:00:37.350> ones<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.239> think

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
water lilies because these ones I think

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.930 
water lilies because these ones I think
might<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.690> dwarf<00:00:40.079> water<00:00:40.350> lilies<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> have

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
might be dwarf water lilies and have

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.280 
might be dwarf water lilies and have
neither<00:00:42.149> bloom<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.660> year<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.140> just

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
neither bloom this year and they just

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.040 
neither bloom this year and they just
look<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.559> bad<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> next<00:00:45.539> year<00:00:45.870> I'm

thinking about getting a a UV sterilizer

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
thinking about getting a a UV sterilizer
to<00:01:14.400> kill<00:01:14.760> off<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:14.970> yo<00:01:15.180> G<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:17.090> pull<00:01:18.090> off<00:01:18.210> some

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to kill off all yo G and pull off some

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.740 
to kill off all yo G and pull off some
the<00:01:18.450> parasites<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> things<00:01:19.470> too

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the parasites and things too

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.020 
the parasites and things too
I've<00:01:22.200> made<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.440> few<00:01:22.650> changes<00:01:22.680> around<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.820> pond

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
I've made a few changes around the pond

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.380 
I've made a few changes around the pond
edges<00:01:24.890> here<00:01:25.890> I've<00:01:26.130> planted<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.790> creepy<00:01:27.060> plant

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
edges here I've planted a creepy plant

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.220 
edges here I've planted a creepy plant
I've<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:28.080> some<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.800> one<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
I've got some there and one there and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.980 
I've got some there and one there and
it's<00:01:31.230> very<00:01:31.710> fast<00:01:32.190> growing<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.450> plan<00:01:33.720> is

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it's very fast growing and the plan is

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.170 
it's very fast growing and the plan is
it'll<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.710> take<00:01:34.860> over<00:01:35.160> this<00:01:35.280> whole<00:01:35.520> area<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it'll just take over this whole area and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420 
it'll just take over this whole area and
hopefully<00:01:36.780> can't<00:01:37.140> grow<00:01:37.440> in<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.800> pond<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
hopefully can't grow in the pond and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.140 
hopefully can't grow in the pond and
mask<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.450> edges<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.080> liner<00:01:40.790> may<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.970> some

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
mask the edges of the liner may get some

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.610 
mask the edges of the liner may get some
more<00:01:42.330> for<00:01:42.510> a<00:01:42.540> long<00:01:42.690> there<00:01:42.900> because<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.470> eggs

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
more for a long there because the eggs

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.250 
more for a long there because the eggs
are<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> way<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.460> looks<00:01:44.640> terrible<00:01:45.260> so

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
are that way now just looks terrible so

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.370 
are that way now just looks terrible so
yeah<00:01:46.860> we'll<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.250> how<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> goes

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
yeah we'll see how that goes

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
they're the only two fish I can find I

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.000 
they're the only two fish I can find I
think<00:02:38.480> all<00:02:38.690> your<00:02:38.870> harsh<00:02:39.200> have<00:02:39.500> been<00:02:39.650> eaten<00:02:39.980> by

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
think all your harsh have been eaten by

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
think all your harsh have been eaten by
a<00:02:40.160> beard<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:42.350> next<00:02:42.830> year<00:02:43.190> I'm<00:02:43.430> gonna<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:43.880> to

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
a beard so next year I'm gonna have to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.080 
a beard so next year I'm gonna have to
put<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.210> net<00:02:44.480> over<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.810> pond<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:46.760> mention

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
put a net over the pond and I mention

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.060 
put a net over the pond and I mention
it's<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.300> last<00:02:47.510> day<00:02:47.690> they<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.500> disappeared

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
it's the last day they just disappeared

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.410 
it's the last day they just disappeared
so<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.670> don't<00:02:50.510> think<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.870> cat<00:02:51.170> because<00:02:51.680> cats

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
so I don't think it's a cat because cats

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.000 
so I don't think it's a cat because cats
will<00:02:53.420> usually<00:02:53.690> kind<00:02:54.260> of<00:02:54.350> bring<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.620> onto<00:02:54.860> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
will usually kind of bring it onto the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.180 
will usually kind of bring it onto the
path<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.750> then<00:02:56.750> eat<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.470> leave<00:02:57.650> leave<00:02:58.160> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
path and then eat it and leave leave a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.920 
path and then eat it and leave leave a
skeleton<00:02:58.700> behind<00:02:58.820> of<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.240> heads<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.810> hill

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
skeleton behind of the heads of the hill

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.570 
skeleton behind of the heads of the hill
so<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:02.960> don't<00:03:03.200> think<00:03:03.440> attacked<00:03:04.070> with<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> brought

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
so I don't think attacked with a brought

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.230 
so I don't think attacked with a brought
all<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.150> fish<00:03:05.390> in<00:03:05.570> here<00:03:06.430> back<00:03:07.430> home<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.970> think

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
all the fish in here back home I think

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.540 
all the fish in here back home I think
cat<00:03:08.960> would<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.170> really<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.650> eat<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.100> yeah<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
cat would I really just eat it yeah I

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.140 
cat would I really just eat it yeah I
can't<00:03:11.180> find<00:03:11.390> any<00:03:11.570> bodies<00:03:11.960> along<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.410> path<00:03:13.150> so

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
can't find any bodies along this path so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.440 
can't find any bodies along this path so
that<00:03:14.870> leads<00:03:15.410> us<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.620> think<00:03:16.610> it<00:03:17.000> was<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.150> bird

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
that leads us to think it was a bird

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.560 
that leads us to think it was a bird
that<00:03:17.900> ate<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.140> fish<00:03:18.560> was<00:03:19.490> birds<00:03:19.760> tend<00:03:20.450> to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
that ate the fish was birds tend to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.410 
that ate the fish was birds tend to
bring<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:21.200> food<00:03:21.410> back<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.820> nest<00:03:22.970> they

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
bring the food back to the nest they

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.620 
bring the food back to the nest they
feed<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.750> babies<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:26.000> yeah<00:03:26.150> next<00:03:26.360> thing<00:03:26.570> I'm

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
feed the babies so yeah next thing I'm

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.670 
feed the babies so yeah next thing I'm
gonna<00:03:26.780> get<00:03:26.960> a<00:03:26.990> net<00:03:27.230> for<00:03:27.440> this<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:30.290> was<00:03:30.440> fine

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
gonna get a net for this and it was fine

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.530 
gonna get a net for this and it was fine
for<00:03:30.890> like<00:03:31.090> two<00:03:32.090> years

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
for like two years

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.460 
for like two years
this<00:03:32.780> pond<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.920> did<00:03:34.130> another<00:03:34.340> net<00:03:34.640> on<00:03:35.470> having

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
this pond it did another net on having

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.190 
this pond it did another net on having
had<00:03:36.620> well<00:03:37.130> I've<00:03:37.250> had<00:03:37.400> one<00:03:37.610> death<00:03:37.820> of<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.180> bird<00:03:38.390> in

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
had well I've had one death of a bird in

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.810 
had well I've had one death of a bird in
like<00:03:39.680> two<00:03:39.950> years<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:41.080> I<00:03:42.080> thought<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.610> bids

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
like two years so I thought the bids

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.330 
like two years so I thought the bids
really<00:03:44.209> weren't<00:03:44.600> really<00:03:44.959> interested<00:03:45.110> but<00:03:45.680> a

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
really weren't really interested but a

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.930 
really weren't really interested but a
heron<00:03:47.270> or<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.420> stork<00:03:47.810> might've<00:03:48.170> flew<00:03:48.350> over<00:03:48.680> and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
heron or a stork might've flew over and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.880 
heron or a stork might've flew over and
seen<00:03:49.940> them<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.480> it's<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:50.959> took<00:03:51.080> its<00:03:51.560> chance

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
seen them and it's just took its chance

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.370 
seen them and it's just took its chance
to<00:03:52.010> eat<00:03:52.160> them<00:03:52.280> all<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:53.540> yeah<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.720> only<00:03:53.959> got<00:03:54.140> two

finally thought of a way to get rid of

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.719 
finally thought of a way to get rid of
the<00:05:19.970> algin<00:05:20.390> here<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.860> algae<00:05:22.160> is<00:05:22.310> caused<00:05:22.550> by

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
the algin here the algae is caused by

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.200 
the algin here the algae is caused by
excess<00:05:23.150> nutrients<00:05:23.600> and<00:05:23.930> too<00:05:24.289> much<00:05:24.500> light<00:05:24.800> so

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
excess nutrients and too much light so

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.420 
excess nutrients and too much light so
forth<00:05:26.210> how<00:05:26.419> can<00:05:26.630> I<00:05:26.690> reduce<00:05:26.919> excess<00:05:27.919> nutrients

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
forth how can I reduce excess nutrients

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.060 
forth how can I reduce excess nutrients
and<00:05:28.580> too<00:05:28.729> much<00:05:28.880> light<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.530> I<00:05:30.530> notice<00:05:30.890> this

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
and too much light and I notice this

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.090 
and too much light and I notice this
stuff<00:05:31.370> leading<00:05:31.580> upon<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.210> other<00:05:32.390> day<00:05:32.979> so<00:05:33.979> I'm

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
stuff leading upon the other day so I'm

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.040 
stuff leading upon the other day so I'm
just<00:05:34.280> gonna<00:05:34.400> let<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:34.760> spread<00:05:35.300> most<00:05:35.660> people

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
just gonna let that spread most people

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.710 
just gonna let that spread most people
see<00:05:36.380> it<00:05:36.530> as<00:05:36.590> a<00:05:36.620> pest<00:05:37.180> some<00:05:38.180> people<00:05:38.479> love<00:05:38.690> it<00:05:40.720> but

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
I'm gonna give it a try this time I

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.570 
I'm gonna give it a try this time I
don't<00:05:45.140> usually<00:05:45.320> like<00:05:45.680> duck<00:05:45.950> weed<00:05:46.130> but<00:05:46.430> I'm

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
don't usually like duck weed but I'm

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.310 
don't usually like duck weed but I'm
just<00:05:46.789> gonna<00:05:46.910> let<00:05:47.180> it<00:05:47.210> completely<00:05:47.840> take<00:05:48.169> over

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
just gonna let it completely take over

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.460 
just gonna let it completely take over
the<00:05:48.500> pond<00:05:49.060> isn't<00:05:50.060> gonna<00:05:50.270> look<00:05:50.479> too<00:05:50.690> nice<00:05:50.930> but<00:05:51.440> I

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
think it's bad it's better than having

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.930 
think it's bad it's better than having
an<00:05:53.300> algae<00:05:53.690> infestation<00:05:54.410> so<00:05:54.620> I'm<00:05:55.580> going<00:05:55.729> to<00:05:55.760> let

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
the fish and if about 60% of the pond is

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.200 
the fish and if about 60% of the pond is
covered<00:06:21.139> then<00:06:22.039> I<00:06:22.340> didn't<00:06:22.639> think<00:06:22.819> I<00:06:22.879> should<00:06:22.909> get

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
covered then I didn't think I should get

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.749 
covered then I didn't think I should get
any<00:06:23.419> algae<00:06:23.840> problems<00:06:24.259> so<00:06:24.620> I'm<00:06:25.400> gonna<00:06:25.520> give

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
any algae problems so I'm gonna give

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.580 
any algae problems so I'm gonna give
duckweed<00:06:26.180> a<00:06:26.240> try

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
duckweed a try
