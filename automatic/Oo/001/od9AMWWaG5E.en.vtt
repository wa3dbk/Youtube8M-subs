 it is the region 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.730
 the tournament will be implemented here and not from an experienced coach who

 I believed in the functional SÃ£o Paulo championship, I asked how the 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.720
 model

 TV shows 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.050

 to the position 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.889
 I deserved it 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.889
 and it ended there

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.090
 these improvements so far 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.550
