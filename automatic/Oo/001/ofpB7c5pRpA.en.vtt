very beneficial for me to be working

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.980 
very beneficial for me to be working
with<00:01:16.010> him<00:01:16.130> overseas<00:01:16.369> it<00:01:16.970> was<00:01:17.150> really<00:01:17.360> sad<00:01:17.720> it's

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
with him overseas it was really sad it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.469 
with him overseas it was really sad it's
like<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.170> breakup<00:01:18.470> where<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.040> really<00:01:19.670> didn't

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
like a breakup where you really didn't

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.810 
like a breakup where you really didn't
want<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.690> move<00:01:20.840> on<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.470> start<00:01:22.310> dating<00:01:22.520> again

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
want to move on and start dating again

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.490 
want to move on and start dating again
that's<00:01:23.330> kind<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.570> how<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:23.720> felt<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:24.380> was

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
that's kind of how I felt so that was

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.440 
that's kind of how I felt so that was
probably<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.830> biggest<00:01:25.100> reason<00:01:25.400> why<00:01:25.910> I<00:01:25.940> wasn't

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
probably the biggest reason why I wasn't

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.920 
probably the biggest reason why I wasn't
making<00:01:26.780> more<00:01:27.290> videos<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:28.540> 2014<00:01:29.540> but<00:01:29.750> it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
making more videos in 2014 but it

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.570 
making more videos in 2014 but it
allowed<00:01:30.259> me<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.650> opportunity<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:31.340> look<00:01:31.460> at

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
allowed me the opportunity to look at

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.670 
allowed me the opportunity to look at
other<00:01:31.790> areas<00:01:32.150> of<00:01:32.300> my<00:01:32.479> business<00:01:32.930> other<00:01:33.350> things

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
that I wasn't really paying attention to
