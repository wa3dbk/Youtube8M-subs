how this game is going to work six on
six<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:59.039> one<00:01:00.000> giant<00:01:00.270> mech<00:01:00.629> or

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
six and then you have one giant mech or

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
six and then you have one giant mech or
multiple<00:01:02.100> giant<00:01:02.460> mechs<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.969> bottom<00:01:03.719> line<00:01:03.750> is

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
multiple giant mechs but bottom line is

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.950 
multiple giant mechs but bottom line is
this<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.500> there's<00:01:04.710> only<00:01:05.450> six<00:01:06.450> people<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.869> each

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this if there's only six people on each

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
this if there's only six people on each
team<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.580> Met<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.210> so

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
team then is the Met going to be so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.109 
team then is the Met going to be so
impactful<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.560> literally<00:01:10.799> wipe<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.970> an

you want to do fine but at least give us
the<00:02:07.950> option<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.520> more<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.270> game<00:02:09.509> is

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
the option for more but this game is

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.930 
the option for more but this game is
going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.140> six<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.590> six<00:02:10.830> not<00:02:11.009> only<00:02:11.250> on

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
going to be six on six not only on

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
but on the PC as well and that is just

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.700 
but on the PC as well and that is just
really<00:02:17.940> frightening<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:20.630> mean<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.320> source

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
could probably run a source engine game

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.050 
could probably run a source engine game

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
probably run it max settings at 1440p

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.430 
probably run it max settings at 1440p
and<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.600> struggle<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.170> my<00:02:43.410> current<00:02:43.740> hardware

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and not struggle on my current hardware

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.480 
and not struggle on my current hardware
but<00:02:46.440> for<00:02:46.770> some<00:02:46.950> reason<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.570> what<00:02:48.690> we<00:02:48.810> have

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
but for some reason this is what we have

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.430 
but for some reason this is what we have
whether<00:02:50.490> it's<00:02:50.730> from<00:02:51.240> lack<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.630> dedicated

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
whether it's from lack of dedicated

whether it's from lack of dedicated
servers<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.280> xbox<00:02:53.640> one<00:02:53.970> pretty<00:02:54.300> much<00:02:54.510> just

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
servers the xbox one pretty much just

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.080 
servers the xbox one pretty much just
isn't<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.200> powerful<00:02:55.500> as<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.550> thought<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:56.850> would

isn't as powerful as we thought it would
be<00:02:57.300> maybe<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.200> game<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.530> being<00:02:58.770> rushed

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
be maybe the game is being rushed

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.980 
be maybe the game is being rushed
because<00:02:59.520> they<00:02:59.730> want<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.240> out<00:03:00.330> nice<00:03:00.960> and

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
xbox one's life cycle much in the way

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.730 
xbox one's life cycle much in the way
that<00:03:06.240> gears<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.690> war<00:03:06.870> one<00:03:07.080> came<00:03:07.350> out<00:03:07.530> and

that gears of war one came out and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.790 
that gears of war one came out and
pretty<00:03:07.890> much<00:03:08.120> jump-started<00:03:09.120> 360<00:03:09.720> who<00:03:10.560> knows

pretty much jump-started 360 who knows

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.640 
pretty much jump-started 360 who knows
but<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:12.150> my<00:03:12.390> opinion<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.960> you<00:03:13.140> know<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.530> is

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
but in my opinion and you know it is

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.990 
but in my opinion and you know it is
just<00:03:13.920> my<00:03:14.490> opinion<00:03:15.110> six<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.260> six<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.770> not<00:03:17.700> enough

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
just my opinion six on six is not enough

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.960 
just my opinion six on six is not enough
it's<00:03:18.270> pretty<00:03:18.630> much<00:03:19.640> embarrassing<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> age

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
it's pretty much embarrassing in the age

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.320 
it's pretty much embarrassing in the age
of<00:03:21.120> twenty<00:03:21.420> fourteen<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:22.080> looking<00:03:22.560> for<00:03:23.330> epic

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
of twenty fourteen I'm looking for epic

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.380 
of twenty fourteen I'm looking for epic
battles<00:03:24.870> where<00:03:25.410> he'll<00:03:25.940> multiple<00:03:26.940> necks<00:03:27.180> could

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
battles where he'll multiple necks could

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.030 
battles where he'll multiple necks could
probably<00:03:27.600> be<00:03:27.780> fighting<00:03:28.200> each<00:03:28.260> other<00:03:28.440> at<00:03:28.739> us<00:03:28.890> at

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
probably be fighting each other at us at

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.500 
probably be fighting each other at us at
the<00:03:29.280> same<00:03:29.459> time<00:03:29.730> maybe<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.150> some<00:03:30.330> scenarios

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the same time maybe in some scenarios

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.960 
the same time maybe in some scenarios
but<00:03:31.040> for<00:03:32.040> what<00:03:32.160> we're<00:03:32.310> seeing<00:03:32.489> here<00:03:32.640> it's

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
but for what we're seeing here it's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.970 
but for what we're seeing here it's
going<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.150> be<00:03:33.270> nothing<00:03:33.420> but<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.959> ground<00:03:34.680> war

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
going to be nothing but a ground war

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.760 
going to be nothing but a ground war

killstreak giant mecha coming down and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.800 
killstreak giant mecha coming down and
that's<00:03:40.890> what<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> game<00:03:41.400> will<00:03:41.550> be<00:03:41.810> hopefully

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
that's what the game will be hopefully

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.760 
that's what the game will be hopefully
I'm<00:03:43.080> wrong<00:03:43.140> but<00:03:43.620> only<00:03:44.340> time<00:03:44.550> will<00:03:44.610> tell
