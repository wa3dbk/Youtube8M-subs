very often right behind its head near

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.899 
very often right behind its head near
its<00:01:43.259> ears<00:01:43.560> you'll<00:01:43.799> find<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.340> whole<00:01:44.369> line<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
its ears you'll find a whole line of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.120 
its ears you'll find a whole line of
ticks<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.250> on<00:01:47.390> this<00:01:48.390> coast<00:01:48.719> the<00:01:49.560> ticks<00:01:50.009> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
ticks and on this coast the ticks that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.380 
ticks and on this coast the ticks that
do<00:01:51.000> spread<00:01:51.329> Lyme<00:01:51.539> disease<00:01:52.310> enjoy<00:01:53.390> lizard

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
do spread Lyme disease enjoy lizard

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.200 
do spread Lyme disease enjoy lizard
blood<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> will<00:01:56.100> often<00:01:56.250> find<00:01:56.399> number

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
blood and so you will often find number

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
blood and so you will often find number
of<00:01:57.270> ticks<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.859> lizards<00:01:58.859> including<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> ones

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
on the East Coast and peep

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.720 
on the East Coast and peep
who<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.469> explored<00:02:16.469> this<00:02:16.739> time<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.609> figure

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
who have explored this time to figure

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.500 
who have explored this time to figure
out<00:02:17.909> why<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:19.349> ends<00:02:19.799> up<00:02:19.969> coming<00:02:20.969> down<00:02:21.180> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
out why and it ends up coming down to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.220 
out why and it ends up coming down to
the<00:02:21.629> presence<00:02:22.049> of<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.379> lizard<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:24.599> blood<00:02:24.959> of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the presence of this lizard the blood of

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.059 
the presence of this lizard the blood of
the<00:02:25.439> western<00:02:25.799> fence<00:02:26.010> lizard<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:27.889> poison<00:02:28.889> to

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
the western fence lizard is poison to

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.209 
the western fence lizard is poison to
the<00:02:29.939> little<00:02:30.180> spirochete<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.439> causes<00:02:31.920> Lyme

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
the little spirochete that causes Lyme

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.640 
the little spirochete that causes Lyme
disease<00:02:32.579> so<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:33.389> I'm<00:02:33.689> a<00:02:33.719> little<00:02:34.139> spirochete

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
disease so if I'm a little spirochete

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.420 
disease so if I'm a little spirochete
I'm<00:02:34.829> in<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.340> tick<00:02:35.609> if<00:02:36.329> my<00:02:36.629> tick<00:02:37.129> latches<00:02:38.129> onto<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
I'm in a tick if my tick latches onto a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.170 
I'm in a tick if my tick latches onto a
lizard<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:39.299> blood<00:02:39.629> comes<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.139> I'm<00:02:40.620> dead

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
lizard that blood comes in I'm dead

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.209 
lizard that blood comes in I'm dead
interesting<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.569> it'll<00:02:43.169> flush<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:44.159> the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
interesting so it'll flush all the

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.059 
interesting so it'll flush all the
spirochetes<00:02:44.939> out<00:02:45.329> of<00:02:45.689> the<00:02:45.780> tick<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.230> then

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
spirochetes out of the tick and then

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.399 
spirochetes out of the tick and then
that<00:02:47.389> cleantech<00:02:48.389> now<00:02:48.629> goes<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.169> another

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
that cleantech now goes on to another

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.280 
that cleantech now goes on to another
host<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.480> it's<00:02:51.480> not<00:02:51.689> going<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.900> be<00:02:51.989> spreading

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
host and it's not going to be spreading

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.729 
host and it's not going to be spreading
Lyme<00:02:52.439> disease<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:52.949> the<00:02:54.139> Western<00:02:55.139> pencil<00:02:55.439> is<00:02:55.709> a

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
Lyme disease so the Western pencil is a

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.509 
Lyme disease so the Western pencil is a
really<00:02:56.340> important<00:02:57.709> host<00:02:58.879> for<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:01.040> tix<00:03:02.040> here

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
really important host for the tix here

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.179 
really important host for the tix here
in<00:03:02.609> California<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.389> East<00:03:04.139> Coast<00:03:04.349> there

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
in California on the East Coast there

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.009 
in California on the East Coast there
are<00:03:05.310> white-footed<00:03:05.819> mice<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.719> are<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
are white-footed mice that are in the

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.629 
are white-footed mice that are in the
same<00:03:07.169> role<00:03:07.409> as<00:03:07.560> sort<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:07.829> the<00:03:07.949> secondary<00:03:08.400> host

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
same role as sort of the secondary host

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.929 
same role as sort of the secondary host
for<00:03:09.599> those<00:03:09.810> tix<00:03:10.129> the<00:03:11.129> spirochetes<00:03:11.519> live

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
for those tix the spirochetes live

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.229 
for those tix the spirochetes live
perfectly<00:03:12.389> well<00:03:12.659> in<00:03:13.969> white-footed<00:03:14.969> Mouse

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
perfectly well in white-footed Mouse

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.080 
perfectly well in white-footed Mouse
blood<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:17.519> fact<00:03:17.699> that<00:03:17.760> we've<00:03:17.939> got<00:03:18.060> all

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
blood so the fact that we've got all

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.960 
blood so the fact that we've got all
these<00:03:18.359> lizards<00:03:18.859> scurrying<00:03:19.859> around<00:03:20.009> our<00:03:20.669> coast

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
these lizards scurrying around our coast

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.929 
these lizards scurrying around our coast
here<00:03:21.299> means<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.139> our<00:03:22.319> rates<00:03:23.009> are<00:03:23.189> levels<00:03:23.759> of

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
here means that our rates are levels of

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.749 
here means that our rates are levels of
Lyme<00:03:24.780> disease<00:03:25.139> are<00:03:25.709> going<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.099> be<00:03:26.189> much<00:03:26.519> much

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:26.759 
Lyme disease are going to be much much

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.309 
Lyme disease are going to be much much
lower<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.269> we've<00:03:27.389> got<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.780> lot<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.079> be<00:03:28.290> thankful

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
lower so we've got a lot to be thankful

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.879 
lower so we've got a lot to be thankful
for<00:03:28.739> for<00:03:29.159> those<00:03:29.340> little<00:03:29.489> lizards
