of cushion for your laptop as well so
the<00:01:42.270> display<00:01:42.659> even<00:01:43.409> something<00:01:44.040> happens<00:01:44.640> you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the display even something happens you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
the display even something happens you
push<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> laptop<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:46.710> something<00:01:47.189> like

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
push on the laptop or something like

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.190 
push on the laptop or something like
that<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> your<00:01:48.270> display<00:01:48.600> touches<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that and your display touches the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.870 
that and your display touches the
keyboard<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.680> something<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.520> some<00:01:50.700> kind

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
keyboard or something you have some kind

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.100 
keyboard or something you have some kind
of<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.149> bit<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.270> cushion<00:01:51.450> protecting

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
of a little bit of cushion protecting

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.770 
of a little bit of cushion protecting
there<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:53.040> also<00:01:53.220> very<00:01:53.610> inexpensive

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
there and it's also very inexpensive

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
there and it's also very inexpensive
and<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.460> worth<00:01:56.640> having

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
and I think it's really worth having

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.959 
and I think it's really worth having
instead<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.780> carrying<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.200> little

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
instead of just carrying a little

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.160 
instead of just carrying a little
microfiber<00:01:59.969> with<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> all<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> time<00:02:00.899> like

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
microfiber with you all the time like

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.429 
microfiber with you all the time like
this<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.070> already<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.270> by<00:02:03.869> your<00:02:04.020> laptop

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
this you already have it by your laptop

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.139 
this you already have it by your laptop
protecting<00:02:05.040> your<00:02:05.159> laptop<00:02:05.490> from<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> wolves

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
protecting your laptop from the wolves
