00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
figure so we need to not only stabilize

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
figure so we need to not only stabilize
the<00:01:08.670> fabric<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:09.570> we've<00:01:09.780> done<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.260> this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the fabric which we've done with this

the fabric which we've done with this
layer<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.130> water-soluble<00:01:11.790> stabilizer<00:01:12.170> but<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
layer of water-soluble stabilizer but we

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.830 
layer of water-soluble stabilizer but we
also<00:01:13.590> need<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.040> hold<00:01:14.520> these<00:01:14.880> yoga<00:01:15.299> pants<00:01:15.689> in

stretching it out again to the distance

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.910 
stretching it out again to the distance
it<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:12.900> when<00:02:13.200> you're<00:02:13.349> wearing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920

you're<00:02:14.190> removing<00:02:14.730> those<00:02:14.850> excess<00:02:15.390> puckers<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
you're removing those excess puckers and

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.330 
you're removing those excess puckers and
you<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.800> all<00:02:17.100> nice<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.970> smooth<00:02:18.330> and

you get this all nice and smooth and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.820 
you get this all nice and smooth and
then<00:02:20.840> believe<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.020> or<00:02:22.140> not<00:02:22.230> we're<00:02:22.530> going<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
then believe it or not we're going to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.910 
then believe it or not we're going to
put<00:02:23.010> another<00:02:23.190> layer<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:24.319> stabilizer<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
put another layer of stabilizer of the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.730 
put another layer of stabilizer of the
water-soluble<00:02:26.700> adhesive<00:02:27.360> stabilizer<00:02:27.990> right

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
over the design area and I do that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.580 
over the design area and I do that
because<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.940> such<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.240> supple<00:02:33.930> fabric

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
because this is such a supple fabric

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.760 
because this is such a supple fabric
that<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.459> stitches<00:02:36.150> want<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.570> fall<00:02:37.260> right

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
that the stitches want to fall right

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.820 
that the stitches want to fall right
into<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.670> knit<00:02:38.970> itself<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.470> by<00:02:40.620> adding

into the to the knit itself so by adding
another<00:02:41.280> layer<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.760> stabilizer<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.630> lets<00:02:43.080> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
another layer of stabilizer it lets the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.199 
another layer of stabilizer it lets the
stitches<00:02:43.680> lift<00:02:43.980> above<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.550> fabric<00:02:45.060> and

which<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.140> trace<00:03:46.560> feature<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.340> will

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
which is the trace feature and that will

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.330 
which is the trace feature and that will
let<00:03:48.209> me<00:03:48.329> position<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.049> needle<00:03:49.230> at<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.010> outer

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
let me position the needle at the outer

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.970 
let me position the needle at the outer
portion<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.450> embroidery<00:03:52.049> design<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.950> I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
portion of the embroidery design so I

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.030 
portion of the embroidery design so I
can<00:03:53.250> see<00:03:53.579> if<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.329> leave<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.019> position<00:03:55.350> I

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
can see if I leave it in this position I

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.130 
can see if I leave it in this position I
don't<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.610> enough<00:03:56.850> stabilizer<00:03:57.420> there<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.110> I

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
don't have enough stabilizer there so I

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.600 
don't have enough stabilizer there so I
think<00:03:58.260> I'll<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.650> move<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.040> down<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> little

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
think I'll just move it down a little

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.250 
think I'll just move it down a little
bit<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.480> I'm<00:04:00.570> going<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.959> stitch

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
bit just so that I'm going to stitch

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.830 
bit just so that I'm going to stitch
right<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.709> stabilizer<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.690> also

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
right on this stabilizer and I can also

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.400 
right on this stabilizer and I can also
make<00:04:04.170> sure<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.610> stitch<00:04:06.090> or<00:04:06.420> trace<00:04:07.200> the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
make sure that I stitch or trace the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.740 
make sure that I stitch or trace the
design<00:04:07.590> over<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.670> far<00:04:08.940> left<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.480> hoop

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.380 
design over to the far left of the hoop
to<00:04:10.019> make<00:04:10.620> sure<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.340> also<00:04:11.579> have<00:04:11.850> stabilizer

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
to make sure that I also have stabilizer

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.720 
to make sure that I also have stabilizer
and<00:04:12.780> I'm<00:04:12.930> not<00:04:13.200> going<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.709> catch<00:04:13.950> any<00:04:14.250> portion
