that<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.299> possibly<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.829> what<00:01:56.070> we're<00:01:56.219> doing

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that we possibly can so what we're doing

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
that we possibly can so what we're doing
is<00:01:56.700> we're<00:01:56.909> measuring<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.780> height<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.200> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
clover underneath the corn we can

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.200 
clover underneath the corn we can

much nitrogen is coming to the soil

that is going to go into the corn
we'll<00:02:12.920> know<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.129> little<00:02:13.430> bit<00:02:13.610> about<00:02:13.670> how<00:02:14.270> tall

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
we'll know a little bit about how tall

we'll know a little bit about how tall
the<00:02:14.720> corn<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.200> when<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.560> starts<00:02:15.860> imposing<00:02:16.430> its

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
the corn is when it starts imposing its

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
stress on the clover one of the most

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.430 
stress on the clover one of the most

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
beneficial aspects of the clover is the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.680 
beneficial aspects of the clover is the
amount<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:21.980> organic<00:02:22.459> matter<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:23.120> puts<00:02:23.390> around

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
amount of organic matter it puts around

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.050 
amount of organic matter it puts around
the<00:02:23.810> crop<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.769> acts<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.220> mulch<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.819> keeps

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
the crop it acts like a mulch and keeps

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.380 
the crop it acts like a mulch and keeps
moisture<00:02:26.599> in<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.080> soil<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.000> also<00:02:29.000> acts<00:02:29.180> as<00:02:29.330> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
moisture in the soil and also acts as a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.009 
moisture in the soil and also acts as a
weed<00:02:29.630> suppressor<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.090> we<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> tendency<00:02:32.660> to

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
weed suppressor so we have a tendency to

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.259 
weed suppressor so we have a tendency to
have<00:02:33.110> better<00:02:33.410> control<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:33.890> weeds<00:02:34.220> even<00:02:35.180> though

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
have better control of weeds even though

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.790 
have better control of weeds even though
we<00:02:35.390> have<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.630> use<00:02:35.720> herbicides<00:02:35.959> we<00:02:36.470> still<00:02:36.709> have

we have to use herbicides we still have

we have to use herbicides we still have

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
probably can't pick up on it but there's

probably can't pick up on it but there's
all<00:02:51.829> sorts<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.250> little<00:02:52.489> insects<00:02:52.970> crawling

might invade this area down here so but

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.550 
might invade this area down here so but

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
look at that organic matter as meta

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.880 
look at that organic matter as meta
