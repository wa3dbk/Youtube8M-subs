look at these four types of drug
remember<00:00:34.910> that<00:00:35.149> a<00:00:35.180> drug<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:35.690> chemical<00:00:36.079> that

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
remember that a drug is a chemical that

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.200 
remember that a drug is a chemical that
affects<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.070> nervous<00:00:37.250> system<00:00:37.700> causing<00:00:38.149> a

change in behavior and possible

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.370 
change in behavior and possible
addiction<00:00:40.600> addiction<00:00:41.600> is<00:00:41.750> where<00:00:42.050> someone

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
addiction addiction is where someone

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.080 
addiction addiction is where someone
needs<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.770> take<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.190> drug<00:00:43.430> in<00:00:43.579> order<00:00:43.940> for

needs to take the drug in order for

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.139 
needs to take the drug in order for
their<00:00:44.210> body<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.690> work<00:00:44.899> at<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.170> normal<00:00:45.530> level

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
their body to work at a normal level

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.850 
their body to work at a normal level
firstly<00:00:47.149> then<00:00:47.329> stimulants<00:00:48.020> as<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.710> name

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
firstly then stimulants as the name

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.069 
firstly then stimulants as the name
suggests<00:00:49.329> stimulants<00:00:50.329> affect<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:50.840> put

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
suggests stimulants affect you put

suggests stimulants affect you put
speeding<00:00:51.590> up<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.890> actions

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
speeding up the actions

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.190 
speeding up the actions
remember<00:00:53.390> that<00:00:53.510> speeding<00:00:53.809> up<00:00:54.050> reactions

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
remember that speeding up reactions

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.250 
remember that speeding up reactions
means<00:00:55.100> reducing<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.850> reaction<00:00:56.300> time<00:00:56.539> which<00:00:57.079> is

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
means reducing a reaction time which is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260 
means reducing a reaction time which is
the<00:00:57.379> time<00:00:57.620> between<00:00:57.829> a<00:00:58.100> stimulus<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.910> your

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
the time between a stimulus and your

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.930 
the time between a stimulus and your
body<00:00:59.510> responding<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.350> it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
body responding to it

body responding to it
Fe<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.120> an<00:01:02.300> example<00:01:02.629> of<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.899> stimulant

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
Fe is an example of a stimulant

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.709 
Fe is an example of a stimulant
stimulants<00:01:04.670> increase<00:01:05.149> the<00:01:05.359> speed<00:01:05.569> of

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
stimulants increase the speed of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.870 
stimulants increase the speed of
reaction<00:01:06.200> by<00:01:06.649> increasing<00:01:07.279> the<00:01:07.399> amount<00:01:07.700> of

neurotransmitter released our synapse

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.580 
neurotransmitter released our synapse
this<00:01:10.729> makes<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.240> neurotransmitter<00:01:12.049> diffuse

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
this makes the neurotransmitter diffuse

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.580 
this makes the neurotransmitter diffuse
across<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.950> synaptic<00:01:14.020> reefs<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.229> speed

depressants<00:01:24.049> affect<00:01:24.380> us<00:01:24.590> by<00:01:25.009> slowing<00:01:25.369> down

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
depressants affect us by slowing down

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.319 
depressants affect us by slowing down
reactions<00:01:26.289> increasing<00:01:27.289> reaction<00:01:27.679> times

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329
