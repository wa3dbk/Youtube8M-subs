00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.949 
once I have that down I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:36.380> come<00:03:36.650> in<00:03:36.680> with<00:03:36.920> some<00:03:37.070> dimensionals<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
and come in with some dimensionals and

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.300 
and come in with some dimensionals and
I'll<00:03:39.050> add<00:03:39.260> its<00:03:39.440> dimensional<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.160> big

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
I'll add its dimensional to the big

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.730 
I'll add its dimensional to the big
flower<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:41.420> then<00:03:42.020> I'm<00:03:42.110> just<00:03:42.200> gonna<00:03:42.350> put<00:03:42.620> this

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
flower and then I'm just gonna put this

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.660 
flower and then I'm just gonna put this
one<00:03:42.800> on<00:03:42.980> there<00:03:44.650> crooked<00:03:45.680> kind<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.190> can<00:03:46.580> you

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
one on there crooked kind of can you

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.890 
one on there crooked kind of can you
office<00:03:47.000> add<00:03:47.630> another<00:03:48.110> dimensional<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.900> add

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
office add another dimensional and add

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.860 
office add another dimensional and add
this<00:03:51.080> one<00:03:51.320> on<00:03:51.470> there<00:03:52.270> like<00:03:53.270> I<00:03:53.420> said<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.690> doesn't

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
this one on there like I said it doesn't

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.000 
this one on there like I said it doesn't
have<00:03:54.050> to<00:03:54.170> be<00:03:54.260> straight<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.620> doesn't<00:03:54.770> have<00:03:54.950> to

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
have to be straight it doesn't have to

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.260 
have to be straight it doesn't have to
be<00:03:55.070> perfect<00:03:55.490> but<00:03:55.550> you<00:03:55.610> can<00:03:55.790> see<00:03:55.940> where<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.150> get

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
be perfect but you can see where you get

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.449 
be perfect but you can see where you get
a<00:03:56.300> dimensional<00:03:56.870> flower<00:03:57.080> this<00:03:57.680> technique

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
a dimensional flower this technique

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.400 
a dimensional flower this technique
would<00:03:58.580> work<00:03:58.790> with<00:03:58.970> any<00:03:59.240> of<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.780> floral<00:04:00.110> stamp

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
would work with any of the floral stamp

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.199 
would work with any of the floral stamp
sets<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.740> you<00:04:00.920> have<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.820> once<00:04:02.000> I've<00:04:02.180> done

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
sets that you have so once I've done

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.150 
sets that you have so once I've done
that<00:04:02.420> I'm<00:04:02.780> gonna<00:04:03.020> go<00:04:03.170> ahead<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.530> add<00:04:03.680> two

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
that I'm gonna go ahead and add two

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.870 
that I'm gonna go ahead and add two
dimensionals<00:04:04.820> to<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:06.770> back<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.130> this<00:04:09.070> flower

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.150 

and<00:04:14.050> then<00:04:15.050> just<00:04:15.320> add<00:04:15.470> that<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.890> front<00:04:16.040> of

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
a half inch piece I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.399 
a half inch piece I'm gonna go ahead and
slide<00:04:52.759> this<00:04:52.970> in<00:04:53.210> till<00:04:53.479> it<00:04:53.599> hits<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:54.050> back<00:04:54.169> of

the<00:04:54.470> banner<00:04:54.650> punch<00:04:55.009> and<00:04:55.400> then<00:04:55.940> make<00:04:56.120> sure<00:04:56.150> it's

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
the banner punch and then make sure it's

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.839 
the banner punch and then make sure it's
lined<00:04:56.720> up<00:04:56.900> on<00:04:57.080> biggest<00:04:57.440> two<00:04:57.590> edges<00:04:58.009> so<00:04:58.699> it's

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
lined up on biggest two edges so it's

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.240 
lined up on biggest two edges so it's
very<00:04:59.030> similar<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.479> punch<00:04:59.870> down<00:05:00.169> and<00:05:00.470> you<00:05:01.039> end

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250
