00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:08.103
Warning: Concentrated sodium hydroxide is very corrosive, wear gloves when handling it.

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:10.354
Greetings fellow nerds.

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:14.119
In a previous video i made an aluminum-air battery. 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.311
 It wasn't very good and produced very little current. 

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:20.714
In this video we're going to make a zinc-air battery.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:27.154
First we make our sodium hydroxide electrolyte by getting 150 milliliters of water 

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:31.008
 and adding to it about 50 grams of sodium hydroxide. 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.538
Stir the mixture until it dissolves. 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.054
Be careful as the solution will get very hot.

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:40.632
When it's done, set it aside and let it cool.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:44.174
While that's happening, we'll build the rest of the cell.

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:46.845
 I'm going to use this 200 milliliter beaker. 

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:51.809
For our anode, or negative electrode, we use a large sheet of zinc metal. 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.934
We originally got this sheet out of a carbon zinc battery from a previous video.

00:00:55.935 --> 00:01:00.629
For the cathode, or positive electrode we'll again be using steel wool. 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.292
Now get some wires with alligator clips and attach them to the electrode materials.

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:07.976
Get a paper towel and wrap the steel wool,

00:01:07.977 --> 00:01:10.985
 the idea is that we don't want it to touch the zinc metal. 

00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:15.071
Now get the zinc metal and wrap it over the paper towel and steel wool.

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:18.134
Push the entire assembly into the container.

00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:22.089
Make sure the wool on top is exposed so air can get in.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.167
At this point this is known as a dry charged zinc-air battery. 

00:01:26.168 --> 00:01:29.137
 It won't work until we add the electrolyte,

00:01:29.138 --> 00:01:32.209
 but it can be stored for decades like this until you need it. 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.635
To activate it, we just mix up and pour in the sodium hydroxide electrolyte.

00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:42.234
And that is a zinc air battery. Let's measure its output.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:47.322
Connecting it to the multimeter we see the voltage is around 0.84 volts. 

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:49.560
Let me measure the current. 

00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:54.860
Whoa, it's off the scale. Let me switch the multimeter to high current mode. 

00:01:54.861 --> 00:02:03.050
 Let's give it a few minutes to stabilize. The current is very good at 0.67-0.68 amps. 

00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:09.747
 This is much better than the 17 milliamps of the homemade aluminum air battery of the previous video.

00:02:09.748 --> 00:02:11.469
The reactions are similar, 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.978
 the iron is catalyzing the reaction of oxygen and water to make hydroxide 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.664
while the zinc metal reacts to make sodium zincate. 

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:24.452
What makes this battery work better is that the sodium zincate is soluble 

00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:29.181
and doesn't block the reactions like the aluminum oxide formed in the aluminum air battery. 

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.998
That's why we can get a much higher current.

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:36.075
We can't use sodium hydroxide for the aluminum air battery 

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:39.939
because aluminum metal reacts with sodium hydroxide itself to produce hydrogen. 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.003
This wastes power and renders the cell dangerous to use. 

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:48.429
 Commercial cells get around this by using better chemicals and aluminum alloys 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.476
but that's beyond the ability of most amateur chemists. 

00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:56.521
