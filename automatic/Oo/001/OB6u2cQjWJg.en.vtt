Adam and Oprah's perhaps lobbying that
the<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.829> line<00:02:54.159> was<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.730> bit<00:02:54.849> loose<00:02:55.090> and

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
the the line was a little bit loose and

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.459 
the the line was a little bit loose and
that<00:02:56.889> perhaps<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.879> race<00:02:58.060> committee<00:02:58.469> made

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
that perhaps the race committee made

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.459 
that perhaps the race committee made
some<00:02:59.829> sort<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.159> mistake<00:03:00.569> worthy<00:03:01.569> perhaps<00:03:02.199> of

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
some sort of mistake worthy perhaps of

sure pleading race officer and
confidence<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.219> going<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.459> really<00:03:09.819> wash<00:03:10.030> with

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
confidence is going to really wash with

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.319

going for the hoist certainly not just

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.649 
going for the hoist certainly not just
quickly<00:03:18.699> the<00:03:18.849> voice<00:03:19.030> but<00:03:19.269> they'll<00:03:19.389> be<00:03:19.510> just

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
quickly the voice but they'll be just

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.630 
quickly the voice but they'll be just
