articulation not bad a little ball joint

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.350 
articulation not bad a little ball joint
up<00:02:13.280> in<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.459> head<00:02:13.640> here<00:02:13.879> so<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.209> rotate

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
up in the head here so you can rotate

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.229 
up in the head here so you can rotate
that<00:02:14.840> all<00:02:15.110> kinds<00:02:15.559> of<00:02:15.620> ways<00:02:15.799> and<00:02:16.069> again<00:02:16.939> it<00:02:17.120> is

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
that all kinds of ways and again it is

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.149 
that all kinds of ways and again it is
hindered<00:02:17.629> by<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:17.870> design<00:02:18.409> of<00:02:18.439> the<00:02:18.680> figure<00:02:18.980> so

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
hindered by the design of the figure so

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.350 
hindered by the design of the figure so
that's<00:02:19.340> okay<00:02:19.760> at<00:02:19.969> least<00:02:20.150> you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
that's okay at least you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.660 
that's okay at least you
got<00:02:20.420> some<00:02:20.660> decent<00:02:20.930> movement<00:02:21.590> going<00:02:21.710> on<00:02:22.130> here

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
got some decent movement going on here

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.400 
got some decent movement going on here
at<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> shoulders<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.540> got<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.720> rotation<00:02:24.290> all

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
at the shoulders you got a rotation all

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.170 
at the shoulders you got a rotation all
the<00:02:24.470> way<00:02:24.560> around<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.430> down<00:02:25.550> some<00:02:26.030> basic

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the way around up and down some basic

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.390 
the way around up and down some basic
standard<00:02:26.870> articulation<00:02:27.500> there<00:02:27.650> same<00:02:28.190> here<00:02:28.340> at

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
standard articulation there same here at

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.420 
standard articulation there same here at
the<00:02:28.490> elbow<00:02:28.700> up<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.300> down<00:02:29.450> as<00:02:29.780> far<00:02:30.020> as<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.230> goes

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the elbow up and down as far as it goes

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.350 
the elbow up and down as far as it goes
don't<00:02:31.430> need<00:02:31.490> it<00:02:31.550> really<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.880> go<00:02:31.970> any<00:02:32.120> further

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
don't need it really to go any further

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.330 
don't need it really to go any further
than<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.570> right<00:02:32.840> rotation<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:33.980> ball

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
than that right rotation here ball

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.940 
than that right rotation here ball
joints<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.910> wrists<00:02:35.120> an<00:02:35.360> ab<00:02:35.870> crunch<00:02:36.350> check

joints in the wrists an ab crunch check

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.710 
joints in the wrists an ab crunch check
it<00:02:37.040> out<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.460> can<00:02:37.550> kind<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:37.910> lean<00:02:38.420> them<00:02:38.570> left

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
it out so you can kind of lean them left

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.210 
it out so you can kind of lean them left
and<00:02:38.900> right<00:02:38.960> whatever<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.440> want<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.680> do<00:02:39.830> and

and right whatever you want to do and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.160 
and right whatever you want to do and
then<00:02:40.430> down<00:02:40.640> here<00:02:40.880> at<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.030> hips<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.840> again

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
then down here at the hips it is again

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.290 
then down here at the hips it is again
hindered<00:02:42.680> by<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.190> way<00:02:43.430> it's<00:02:43.610> molded<00:02:44.150> and

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
hindered by the way it's molded and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.600 
hindered by the way it's molded and
design<00:02:44.600> through<00:02:45.020> here<00:02:45.200> over<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.500> hips<00:02:46.070> but

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
design through here over the hips but

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.340 
design through here over the hips but
you<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.970> kind<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.360> kick<00:02:47.630> them<00:02:47.810> out<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.170> move

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
you can kind of kick them out and move

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.860 
you can kind of kick them out and move
them<00:02:48.530> all<00:02:48.650> over<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.890> place<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.570> kind

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
them all over the place but it is kind

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.840

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
of limited and again at the knees here

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.550 
of limited and again at the knees here
that's<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.690> for<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.870> knees<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:54.050> can<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.380> see

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
that's it for the knees you can you see

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.080 
that's it for the knees you can you see
it's<00:02:54.680> hindered<00:02:54.920> right<00:02:55.070> here<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.340> back<00:02:55.550> can

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
it's hindered right here in the back can

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.090 
it's hindered right here in the back can
rotate<00:02:56.240> that<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.870> at<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.500> feet<00:02:57.680> here<00:02:57.830> there

are<00:02:58.250> little<00:02:58.550> ball<00:02:58.820> joints<00:02:59.209> in<00:02:59.330> there<00:02:59.510> and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
are little ball joints in there and

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.320 
are little ball joints in there and
again<00:03:00.020> based<00:03:00.739> on<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> design<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.520> toy<00:03:01.730> it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
again based on the design of the toy it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.570 
again based on the design of the toy it
hinders<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> lot<00:03:03.020> of<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.200> articulation<00:03:03.950> that's

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
hinders a lot of the articulation that's

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.740 
hinders a lot of the articulation that's
are<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:04.940> here's<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.209> quick<00:03:05.450> size<00:03:05.720> comparison

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
are and here's a quick size comparison

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.750 
are and here's a quick size comparison
for<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.739> check<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.040> out<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.280> here<00:03:07.459> he<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:07.640> with

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
for you check it out so here he is with

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.150 
for you check it out so here he is with
