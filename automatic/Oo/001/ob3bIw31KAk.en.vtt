00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.119
 but it's that summer time I hope that 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.920
 well we are already back to the routine at 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.650
 Cole to work but we continue 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.180
 sweetening a little bit of life every day and 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.030
 this time a delicious salad 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.830
 is going to serve us for snacks 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.960
 snacks for birthdays for any 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.340
 celebration is very simple gives you a 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.360
 original touch and sure you 're going to 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.999
 understand 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.339
 I liked it also in a sense when 

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:40.039
 that the web page in www blue dot of 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.960
 dot colors is you can catch all the 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.879
 recipes with the steps to follow 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.159
 gone without exact customers paranoia 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.109
 looking here when when with the recipe 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.539
 this time it is very simple what 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.339
 we can present like this first will warn 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.050
 with a stamp or we will also present 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.600
 in a vase as we did in the last 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.739
 time 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.269
 but that is not the link recipe for 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.370
 that you can see with a presented also 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.640
 in volume to give it a different touch 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.840
 to the table as a centerpiece 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.360
 ingredients on this occasion are very 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.159
 simple the puff pastry again you are not going to 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.930
 see a hand to make quick actions 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.430
 and you can keep it for a day to 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.940
 another without any problem provided that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.920
 You are very intrigued, well, when 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.140
 ingredients 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.170
 Look, we need a sheet of puff pastry 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.790
 refrigerated or frozen in this case I 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.439
 I have placed rectangular that is for this 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.930
 recipe well is great 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.270
 we need cheese the ideal cheese for me 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.040
 is the parmesan or one last business 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.659
 enjoy the recipe but any other 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.970
 Cheese can also serve if I like them 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.630
 the very strong flavors an egg for 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.820
 paint the dough that we are going to beat and then 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.460
 that we have the brush to paint all 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.619
 the surface and in this case apart from 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.390
 I'm going to put a little bit and now 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.670
 Provenzales in this case is a mixture 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.950
 basil oregano rosemary thyme 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.560
 puff pastry and it will improve because I love the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.780
 mix and the taste that it gives you especially 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.509
 the health the flavor in this case also 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.069
 I will accompany him with a little touch 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.860
 special italy that will also give you 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.390
 a flavor and a color in this case because 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.690
 I was carrying dry tomato and other ingredients 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.030
 that are also cute then original 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.910
 because not this time the touch 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.799
 special from italy takes the dry tomato 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.520
 black pepper down dry pepper 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.800
 olive 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.410
 basil onion good and a little salt 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.720
 Great marina will give you flavor and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.870
 also color if you like you can use 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.030
 also poppy or sesame seeds 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.380
 to give a touch also crispy and 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.840
 different 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.080
 I already have the oven preheated to more or 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.030
 minus 250 degrees because the puff pastry is 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.460
 going to do very fast and what are we going to 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.620
 to do is to extend the mass you will see 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.980
 which is quite obvious but good sometimes 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.970
 until they tell you not local is this 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.440
 recipe is so simple 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.440
 I'm going to spread the dough 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.280
 and I'm going to need a finger like in 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.230
 this case I have not caught it good to use 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 the knife but I am it is that you do it 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.790
 with a fork that overshadowed one more day 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.209
 let's click the surface of the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.769
 puff pastry because we started it because in 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.260
 this time we do not want it to go up a lot 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.409
 we're going to want it to go up a bit to 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.390
 make it look crispy but not 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.420
 we want to be very swollen as if 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.370
 outside a millefeuille 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.650
 for this recipe I will use this 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.970
 black tray from the oven because it's going to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.400
 give a little more stability but 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.230
 you have grid you have me is it 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.690
 nothing is happening either 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.840
 I'm going to paint something well with the brush if 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.159
 you do not have a brush , nothing happens, you know 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.129
 what can you do with your hand to a 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.629
 spoon or as you can if we have the 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.799
 clean hands we have to be afraid of 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.799
 use them in the kitchen 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.400
 well we painted well by all edges 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.560
 because this is going to be what is going to give 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.680
 the brightness if we leave some 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.540
 nothing will happen either but not 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.540
 it will stay bright and golden 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.290
 do not forget this 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.590
 ok now I'm put about 140 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.000
 grams of cheese but this goes according to 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.160
 look and I really like the one that does 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.770
 like so much strong prices 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.680
 it's already quite enough but you can 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.120
 put as you like do not use a 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.650
 very soft cheese because then then 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.390
 is going to stay we are going to be 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.729
 cheese formica that also give you a 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:44.659
 nice appearance 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.800
 and I think that this is enough and how 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.800
 I was going to tell you 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.170
 the Provencal herbs mix 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.170
 also to taste 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.550
 and we're going to put a little bit of 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.440
 touch of italy 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.020
 finally with a knife or with a 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.760
 short pizza we will make some strips I 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.430
 I 'm going to do it in the short sense for 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.900
 that I get more quantity more or less 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.290
 one centimeter thick with the short 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.289
 pizzas will go very well but good 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.619
 to always use so many utensils 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.490
 specials sometimes seeing also 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:30.960
 what do you do with the utensils 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.960
 normal tastes good 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.220
 more or less than a sheet mass of 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:39.060
 normal we will be about 16 or 20 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.060
 strips 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.580
 we are going to score well and we are going to put them 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.740
 in the oven for 15 more or less 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.420
 minutes until we see that the cheese 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.420
 is melted and the puff pastry is cooked 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.220
 if you put a cheese that is soft you 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.419
 you can put a little salt of this 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.280
 of flakes over or fat salt for 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.650
 that also a crispy touch if you put 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.009
 a parmesan cheese a grana padano no 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.840
 because if it's not going to be very salty 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.529
 pressure this case I will not put you 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.209
 OK 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:16.929
 perfect we go to the oven and now it 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:16.929
 show how it goes 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.999
 Well, look what he looks like, 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.649
 that is cool what you do is going to 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:28.069
 be also the lines the brands with 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:28.069
 that 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.919
 actually 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:43.339
 I'm still thinking about pizza, it's a lot 

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:43.339
 more simple 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.200
 we go over 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:54.110
 the days and let it cool down by the 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:55.490
 paper and everything completely on a 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.410
 grating 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.020
 Look at sugar makers, that 's how it looks 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.509
 our presentation of the sticks of 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.520
 cheese on the blackboard is pretty 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.650
 cool, that's why I've put it though 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.690
 I always confuse wood too 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.020
 the colors stand out more and it seems more 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.430
 appetizing that if the blackboard so that 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.620
 so bright what you have to 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.419
 to do is before using a table 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.280
 with a little bit of oil to make it 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.470
 that all that brilliance like that always 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.210
 will be of this color so interesting 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.910
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.280
 recipe this is great same I think 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.750
