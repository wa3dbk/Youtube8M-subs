00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.030
 does not exist 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.610
 question number 42 at the end of the third 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.670
 academic period the grades obtained 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.960
 by a math student are the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.650
 following first period 3.2 second 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.490
 period 4.5 and third period 3 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.800
 conscious the teacher informs that for 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.050
 pass math the average of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.500
 student in the four periods must 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 be at least 3 with 6 to get the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.360
 basic valuation and if the average 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.370
 greater than 4 the rating will be higher 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.470
 to determine the note n that the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.470
 student must take out in the room 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.260
 period to obtain a valuation 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.610
 basic must be posed and solve the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.920
 next inequality 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.070
 remember then to find the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.590
 average we must add the 4 notes of 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:15.200
 between 4 well 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:19.429
 but it's with two plus 4.5 plus three with 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.560
 seven plus the note that you should get in the 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.540
 fourth test 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.190
 and this we are going to divide between 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.710
 4 for the student to get basic 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.980
 Your note should be 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.280
 and more 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:46.420
 to 3 with 6 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:50.380
 greater than or equal to 3.6 and must be less than 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.320
 4 because because if it is higher than 4 its 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.159
 note is not going to be basic but it's going to be 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.159
 higher 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.640
 therefore the correct answer of the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.640
 to 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.500
 or not 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.500
 one
