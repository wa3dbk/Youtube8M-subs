really unique kind of environment here

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.030 
really unique kind of environment here

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
together in a formal way to do work it's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.180 
together in a formal way to do work it's
about<00:01:41.210> collaboration<00:01:41.770> usually<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> meeting

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
about collaboration usually the meeting

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.100 
about collaboration usually the meeting
might<00:01:43.400> be<00:01:43.580> with<00:01:44.000> me<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.690> have<00:01:44.810> regular

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
might be with me I like to have regular

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.930 
might be with me I like to have regular
one-on-ones<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:45.980> skip<00:01:46.190> level<00:01:46.460> one-on-ones

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
one-on-ones and skip level one-on-ones

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.900 
one-on-ones and skip level one-on-ones
but<00:01:47.900> that's<00:01:48.050> about<00:01:48.260> it<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:48.830> their<00:01:49.430> day<00:01:49.610> will<00:01:49.790> be

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
but that's about it so their day will be

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.730 
but that's about it so their day will be
going<00:01:50.150> about<00:01:50.360> doing<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.140> work<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.620> they've

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
going about doing the work that they've

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.350
