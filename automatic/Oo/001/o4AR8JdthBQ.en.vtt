00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.180 
understand right not only that Floyd can
come<00:03:27.360> forward<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.959> need<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.410> let<00:03:28.980> me<00:03:29.040> go

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
come forward if you need to let me go

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.100 
come forward if you need to let me go
backwards<00:03:29.459> when<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.910> go<00:03:30.030> sideways<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:30.780> you

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
backwards when you go sideways so you

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.720 
backwards when you go sideways so you
can't<00:03:31.350> just<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.650> one<00:03:31.680> component<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.610> a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
can't just have one component of a

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.490 
can't just have one component of a
fighter<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.239> feel<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.019> fighter<00:03:34.350> is

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
fighter and feel that this fighter is

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500 
fighter and feel that this fighter is
just<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.549> fighter<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.060> know<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.150> mean<00:03:36.330> is

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
just like the fighter you know I mean is

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.960 
just like the fighter you know I mean is

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
crazy it's ludicrous everybody dance is

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.120
