I<00:00:00.390> want<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.989> explain<00:00:01.680> something<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:02.520> my<00:00:02.700> own

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
I want to explain something of my own

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.410 
I want to explain something of my own
philosophy<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.859> get<00:00:05.009> started<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.609> and

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
philosophy to get started in this and

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.830 
philosophy to get started in this and
that<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.470> want<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.639> define<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.660> you

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
that is that I want to define for you

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.650 
that is that I want to define for you
what<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.440> thought<00:00:10.679> my<00:00:10.800> name<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.160> all<00:00:11.370> week<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.540> it

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
what I thought my name is all week so it

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.820 
what I thought my name is all week so it
might<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.110> wheat<00:00:13.559> eco<00:00:14.219> scale<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.830> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
might be the wheat eco scale and the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.540 
might be the wheat eco scale and the
logarithmic<00:00:17.340> scale<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.380> an<00:00:19.380> equal<00:00:19.980> level<00:00:20.100> 0

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
logarithmic scale so an equal level 0

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.450 
logarithmic scale so an equal level 0
there's<00:00:20.880> about<00:00:21.090> 5<00:00:21.390> billion<00:00:21.810> people<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:23.100> equal

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
there's about 5 billion people and equal

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.589 
there's about 5 billion people and equal
level<00:00:23.760> 1<00:00:23.970> there's<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.080> billion<00:00:26.150> equal<00:00:27.150> equal

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
level 1 there's a billion equal equal

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.880 
level 1 there's a billion equal equal
level<00:00:27.930> 2

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
level 2

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.120 
level 2
there's<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.340> hundred<00:00:29.730> billion<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.740> then<00:00:31.740> for

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
there's a hundred billion and then for

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.700 
there's a hundred billion and then for
the<00:00:32.189> next<00:00:32.309> level<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.149> 10<00:00:33.540> million<00:00:36.469> they<00:00:37.469> get

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the next level is 10 million they get

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.069 
the next level is 10 million they get
down<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.950> equal<00:00:38.309> W<00:00:38.489> 10<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.239> there's<00:00:39.780> one

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
down to equal W 10 and there's one

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.479 
down to equal W 10 and there's one
person<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.710> person<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.280> Sepp<00:00:42.149> Holzer<00:00:43.489> so

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
person and that person is Sepp Holzer so

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.479 
person and that person is Sepp Holzer so
now<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.989> thing<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.620> others<00:00:46.829> might<00:00:47.160> equal

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
now the thing and others might equal

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.889 
now the thing and others might equal
levels<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.030> different<00:00:48.539> people<00:00:48.629> will<00:00:48.870> have

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
levels so different people will have

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.479 
levels so different people will have
different<00:00:49.110> scales<00:00:49.649> though<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.129> somebody

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
different scales though but somebody

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
different scales though but somebody
else's<00:00:50.940> people<00:00:51.300> levels<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.780> perhaps<00:00:55.670> a<00:00:57.260> not

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
else's people levels have perhaps a not

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
else's people levels have perhaps a not
equal<00:00:58.590> level<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.250> where<00:00:59.370> people<00:00:59.609> go<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
equal level one and where people go and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.290 
equal level one and where people go and
buy<00:01:00.120> their<00:01:00.690> personal<00:01:01.050> recipe<00:01:01.230> books<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.820> an

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
buy their personal recipe books and an

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810 
buy their personal recipe books and an
equal<00:01:03.750> level<00:01:03.809> four<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.619> when<00:01:04.890> people<00:01:05.369> stop

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
equal level four is when people stop

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.310 
equal level four is when people stop
buying<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.420> us<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:08.330> post-its<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
buying for us by post-its and then I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530 
buying for us by post-its and then I
think<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.070> little<00:01:11.340> five<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
think a little five if we can see the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
think a little five if we can see the
person's<00:01:12.810> permaculture<00:01:13.140> design<00:01:13.530> course<00:01:13.760> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
person's permaculture design course and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.440 
person's permaculture design course and
even<00:01:14.880> level<00:01:15.180> seven<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:15.659> teach<00:01:15.930> their<00:01:16.409> first

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
even level seven they teach their first

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.440 
even level seven they teach their first
so<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:19.710> emails<00:01:20.130> coming<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.549> there<00:01:21.299> are

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so that's my emails coming up there are

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.320 
so that's my emails coming up there are
two<00:01:21.689> properties<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.590> scale<00:01:22.920> two

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
two properties to this scale two

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.020 
two properties to this scale two
observations<00:01:25.310> observation<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
observations observation one is is that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.420 
observations observation one is is that
wherever<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.780> person<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.950> scale<00:01:29.250> they

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
wherever a person is on this scale they

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.590 
wherever a person is on this scale they
tend<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> look<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:29.970> people<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> little<00:01:30.450> further

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
tend to look at people a little further

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
tend to look at people a little further
ahead<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.350> those<00:01:32.100> people<00:01:32.340> are

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
ahead of them and think those people are

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.389 
ahead of them and think those people are
really<00:01:32.880> cool<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.649> then<00:01:34.649> look<00:01:34.830> at<00:01:34.890> people<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
really cool and then look at people a

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.249 
really cool and then look at people a
lot<00:01:36.060> further<00:01:36.330> ahead<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.690> them<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.049> think

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
lot further ahead of them and they think

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.679 
lot further ahead of them and they think
those<00:01:37.649> people<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.100> crazy<00:01:41.119> people<00:01:42.119> behind

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
those people are crazy people behind

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.830 
those people are crazy people behind
them<00:01:43.399> those<00:01:44.399> people<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:45.090> messing<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
them those people are messing up the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.410 
them those people are messing up the
world<00:01:46.080> yes<00:01:46.439> no<00:01:47.430> matter<00:01:47.580> where<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
scale everybody behind them is messing

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.710 
scale everybody behind them is messing
things<00:01:50.550> up<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.289> I<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.490> hos<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
those two observations those two aspects

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.690 
those two observations those two aspects
forwarded<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.240> our<00:01:57.869> parent<00:01:58.289> that<00:01:58.890> really

forward if they're at level zero maybe
get<00:02:03.720> mobile<00:02:04.049> assistance<00:02:04.380> moving<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.740> level

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
get mobile assistance moving to level

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.840 
get mobile assistance moving to level
one<00:02:05.220> if<00:02:05.700> somebody's<00:02:06.590> seems<00:02:07.590> crazy<00:02:07.890> maybe
