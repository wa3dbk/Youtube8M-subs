labyrinth as you can see you have also
the<00:04:32.020> accelerometer<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.820> phone<00:04:35.060> knows<00:04:35.330> the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
the accelerometer so the phone knows the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.570 
the accelerometer so the phone knows the
position<00:04:36.200> this<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:36.950> very<00:04:37.760> useful<00:04:37.940> when<00:04:38.450> you

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580
