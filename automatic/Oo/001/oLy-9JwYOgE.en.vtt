00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
bit about how to counter the left jab a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.129 
bit about how to counter the left jab a
lot<00:00:11.220> of<00:00:11.280> time<00:00:11.460> people<00:00:12.120> will<00:00:12.389> use<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.720> jab<00:00:12.930> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
lot of time people will use that jab to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.610 
lot of time people will use that jab to
set<00:00:13.170> up<00:00:13.440> bigger<00:00:13.950> meaner<00:00:14.990> combinations<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.230> if

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
set up bigger meaner combinations and if

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.230 
set up bigger meaner combinations and if
you<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:16.890> interrupt<00:00:17.160> them<00:00:17.460> or<00:00:17.610> disrupt<00:00:18.090> them

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
you can interrupt them or disrupt them

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.480 
you can interrupt them or disrupt them
on<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:18.840> beat<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> jab

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
on the first beat the jab

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.550 
on the first beat the jab
you<00:00:20.940> can<00:00:21.090> disrupt<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.539> entire<00:00:21.930> line<00:00:22.530> of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
you can disrupt that entire line of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.290 
you can disrupt that entire line of
thought<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:23.849> to<00:00:23.910> start<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
thought so I'm going to start with the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.999 
thought so I'm going to start with the
first<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.660> it's<00:00:24.840> called<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.140> speed<00:00:25.439> bag<00:00:25.619> punch

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
first one it's called a speed bag punch

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.950 
first one it's called a speed bag punch
this<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.759> of<00:00:26.789> Eric<00:00:27.060> Paulson's<00:00:27.480> tricks<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
this is one of Eric Paulson's tricks and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.450 
this is one of Eric Paulson's tricks and
it's<00:00:28.320> again<00:00:28.529> basically<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.279> same

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it's again basically it's the same

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.890 
it's again basically it's the same
motion<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.880> use<00:00:30.089> when<00:00:30.269> you're<00:00:30.359> working<00:00:30.630> speed

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
motion you use when you're working speed

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.850 
motion you use when you're working speed
bag<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.439> dip<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.360> did<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:34.590> kind<00:00:34.740> of

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
which is a viable counter but they're

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.069 
which is a viable counter but they're
not<00:03:49.489> using<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.909> footwork<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.450> way<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.019> you

not using the footwork the way that you

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.899 
not using the footwork the way that you
use<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.349> overhand<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.980> step<00:03:52.220> on<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.400> 45

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
use the overhand is to step on that 45

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.449 
use the overhand is to step on that 45
again<00:03:53.269> okay<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:53.989> move<00:03:54.680> your<00:03:54.860> head<00:03:55.040> off<00:03:55.280> the

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
again okay and move your head off the

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.750 
again okay and move your head off the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
line of that punch that would be the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.160 
line of that punch that would be the
proper<00:03:58.760> way<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:59.000> throw<00:03:59.299> that<00:03:59.420> overhand<00:03:59.900> right

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
proper way to throw that overhand right

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.020 
proper way to throw that overhand right
as<00:04:00.379> a<00:04:00.440> counter<00:04:00.920> but<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.640> know<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:01.760> don't<00:04:01.909> want

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
to concentrate too much on that straight

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.830 
to concentrate too much on that straight
right<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.519> right<00:04:04.640> process<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.299> stay<00:04:05.569> right

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
right the right process to stay right

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.399

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
it doesn't matter I'm still in so I

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.459 
it doesn't matter I'm still in so I
guess<00:07:07.089> the<00:07:07.360> last<00:07:07.719> thing<00:07:07.960> that's<00:07:08.050> more<00:07:08.349> of<00:07:08.409> a

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:08.469 
guess the last thing that's more of a

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:11.249 
guess the last thing that's more of a
conceptual<00:07:08.919> idea<00:07:09.580> is<00:07:09.789> just<00:07:10.479> thinking<00:07:11.080> about

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:11.259 
conceptual idea is just thinking about

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:13.379 
conceptual idea is just thinking about
that<00:07:11.440> little<00:07:11.529> saying<00:07:11.949> if<00:07:12.159> they<00:07:12.729> hit<00:07:12.909> you<00:07:13.120> you

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:13.389 
that little saying if they hit you you

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:15.119 
that little saying if they hit you you
hit<00:07:13.419> them<00:07:13.659> back<00:07:13.930> and<00:07:14.229> if<00:07:14.440> they<00:07:14.560> don't<00:07:14.710> hit<00:07:14.949> you

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:15.129 
hit them back and if they don't hit you

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:17.879 
hit them back and if they don't hit you
you<00:07:15.789> hit<00:07:15.819> them<00:07:16.089> back<00:07:16.300> I'm<00:07:17.050> Brian<00:07:17.379> dr.<00:07:17.620> SiC
