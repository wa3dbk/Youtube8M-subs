00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.200

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.999
 Boxing online Monday and is oscar 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.230
 let's review what happened the end of 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:21.200
 week in costa rica a very good fight 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.600
 that did not reach its usual end 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.390
 but it was interrupted by a 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.530
 unintentional headbutt you're looking for and 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.570
 Well we are talking about the fight 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.610
 bryan vázquez against rené el chirizo 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.950
 Gonzalez Costa Rica against Nicaragua 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.650
 the superimmune interim title of the emv 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.050
 a very good fight relatively 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.630
 closed is caused in the fifth round 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.760
 a head shock starts to bleed 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.950
 profusely the Nicaraguan the referee 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.960
 Panamanian gustavo padilla call doctor 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.329
 that stops the fight they go to the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.870
 cards and win by technical decision 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.180
 majority bryan vázquez and becomes 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.219
 again instead interim super feather 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.219
 of 9 but it was a good fight 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.890
 I say if we always liked we would like 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.080
 that the fights end with nocao 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.680
 decision to 12 rounds not for this 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.410
 situation 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.630
 so it's a pity that the public is 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.750
 have been deprived of a fight that could 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.090
 it could have been an interesting fight 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.340
 not obviously when you reach the fifth 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.810
 assault then it remains that bad taste 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.729
 and the feeling that there may be a 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.190
 rematch later 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.570
 so I say at the end the goal of brief 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.760
 mbanking is lost for the title in 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.560
 property but this fight is given is given 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.250
 for the rematch because gonzález was 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.110
 fighting well baguette no doubt deserved 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.430
 the triumph but a little better but I was going 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.210
 very closed and who knows what 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.640
 could have passed in the seven rounds and one 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.259
 little more that is missing so it is so 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.780
 let's go back to the Philippines 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.310
 oscar in Manila I risk first against 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.670
 felipe salguero for the title flycatcher 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.380
 of the fib that looked good almost mere looked 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.180
 very well almost just let me select 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.300
 very good if it was the nocao in the in the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.300
 diego in the eleven but it looked very good 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.600
 dominated felipe Salguero the Mexican 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.790
 beginning to end 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.730
 I think that if not technical in the assault 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.650
 number 11 for me risk like that but I 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.390
 I think it has been one of your best 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.050
 fights because he dominated they came out that is 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.060
 A good man is a good boxer 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.190
 he knocked him down in eighth in the ninth and in 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.630
 the eleven until the habit had to 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.430
 stop the fight I think that here not 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.580
 there was great surprise I think almost mere 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.700
 It was also fighting being like 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.180
 local in your house then definitely 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.610
 it was no big surprise I think that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.340
 Unlike the fight between 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.900
 vázquez gonzález where we all expected 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.360
 a more disputed fight I think that in 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.850
 almost simple effect a comfortable 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.500
 victory as planned and 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.060
 also philippines a fight that does not 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.250
 headline but that does not interest me much to 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.430
 the Panamanians the Panamanian rafael torito 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.520
 conception fell by knockout in the second 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.190
 assault against the Philippine promise 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.709
 genesis herbania undefeated now in 23 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.780
 combats a spectacular knockout that left 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.000
 the little bull asleep in the ring 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.450
 but good health is fine day 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.450
 he came to panama 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.480
 great knockout guy let's see what happens with 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.120
 the torito conception he says he's going to 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.680
 keep on boxing but it was a nocao 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.570
 say that they scare if you are going to continue in the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.190
 boxing hopefully and it's clear that you should not 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.800
 follow 122 pounds 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.560
 I think the 122 pounds and face a 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.950
 undefeated it was too much for him to me 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.080
 look like I said before the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.730
 fight the best moment of the bull was 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.620
 precisely when faced with aj 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.590
 banal who was also an undefeated in 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.020
 philippines and surprises them with a with a 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.660
 good hand that what knocks him now 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.670
 it touched him to receive the knockout I think not 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.709
 it was time for the torito concepción 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.959
 and he was definitely out of his 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.060
 league and its weight facing doing 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.739
 they go in the 122 so I wanted to do the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.070
 small comments look for what 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.430
 important even though the knockout was 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.070
 surprising 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.739
 that is impressive is the word he 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.660
 it's okay he was just there by 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.670
 caution of the doctor and everything that does not 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.370
 I liked to look was that when the bull 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.870
 I was on the canvas and I would point it out like that or 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.800
 it's fine it 's fine that you 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.900
 discontent 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.900
 what even your rival and they talked 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.090
 much before the fight before but already 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.129
 you won and you won him already the guy is 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.620
 thrown on the floor you do not know or be in 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:37.110
 that moment served they did not know it was 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.789
 silly was fine or is there everything a lot 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.250
 people in the gym thought that the 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.409
 plane that something could have happened to him and 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.870
 I did not like it, not because I 'm Panamanian 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.569
 any diver who did that to him 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.930
 I would not like the Filipino 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:55.539
 mocked with imagine you've done it 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.610
 I say God forbid strong damage 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.070
 the Filipino would have been very bad 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.530
 we love boxing precisely 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.590
 because it's a civilized way of 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.280
 bring something medieval like this is 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.639
 confrontation between two between two 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.130
 human beings now yes yes we already fall in 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.259
 that in that mockery in that if there is not that 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.930
 that chivalry after combat 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.490
 if there is no respect for the rules 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.800
 then there is no difference between 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.830
 a street street fight and a match 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.770
 boxing I think here it happened to be vania 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.050
 by making these signs that I kill him 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.180
 you already won by knockout celebrates your 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.160
 victory let's wait and hopefully your 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.840
 rival is fine if it is not there the no 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.910
 broke no boxing rule broke 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.800
 it was a national human being rule 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.889
 human to get to the guy what 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.009
 overcome it is already celebrated with class not with 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.930
 shell will fall but good , and 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.360
 important is that it goes away it stays 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.570
 undefeated and the torito conception is fine 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.900
 of health we go to the important billboard 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.670
 search where God will participate 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.610
 wilders 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:06.910
 peter quillín with with pink gabriel and 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.240
 hop and with murat first god of wilders 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.520
 nobody guessed the place we almost hit in 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.740
 the second round because some fell two 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.850
 times in the first and it seemed but but 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.160
 It was a code I was not a boxer 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.020
 level but I say at least you endured it 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.000
 four rounds to walter that is very easy 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.860
 he was a very brave boxer 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.100
 I think walter was very measured I 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.470
 I said during the transmission and before 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.000
 the fight that I thought was going to go to 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.220
 second assault precisely because 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.990
 I think wilders is measuring is a 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.730
 little to get a little more jumps 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.840
 within your career you can not be 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.300
 blocking everyone in the first 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.950
 assault and hope that this is going to look good 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.320
 before one of the critics it is not going to 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.780
 have enough experience I think that 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.970
 that did he kept it well all of a sudden 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.250
 I was lying very strong hands but no no 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.530
 it is overwhelmed you do not go there goes the rival not 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.960
 it's going goes with everything against activities 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.730
 earlier and I think we saw things 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.860
 positive from walter like a good 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.510
 defense a good endurance because fruit trees 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.920
 he connected good hands also and I think 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.810
 that's what your corner 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.780
 I was looking for when he had to solve 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.730
 solved put pressure and pulled out the local 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.900
 just a few statements came out 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:18.240
 of leaves of the pot that is 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.070
 promoter of wyler through golden boy 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.620
 promotion they are looking for the title 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:25.110
 of the cmb that is the title that has 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.060
 vitali klitschko remember to avoid the 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.070
 click or announced that for 2015 it will 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.280
 run as president for president 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.660
 for the presidency of ukraine and that goes 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.430
 to be it is very soon you have to 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.889
 withdraw to you so be careful that 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.419
 vitaly christ already made his last fight or 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:42.990
 be that if that happens the title goes to 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:44.340
 become vacant and it is rumored that those who 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.350
 they are going to dispute this vacant title 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.810
 they would see main stage brain that in their 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.850
 last fight won him cris arreola 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.740
 against god of wilders and in those fights 

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.320
 where I'll be a big favorite again 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.000
 crowning myself I know that many wanted to see 

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.580
 wyler against one of the critics for 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.760
 crowned champion but if he can 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.760
 to crown
