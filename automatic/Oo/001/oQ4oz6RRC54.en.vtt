00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
me neither you know it's basically your

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.330 
me neither you know it's basically your
breath<00:02:17.160> going<00:02:17.520> into<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> microphone<00:02:19.220> we<00:02:20.220> have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
breath going into the microphone we have

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.400 
breath going into the microphone we have
the<00:02:20.490> pop<00:02:20.700> filter<00:02:20.880> once<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.390> say<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> B<00:02:21.990> sounds

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
the pop filter once you say the B sounds

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.410 
the pop filter once you say the B sounds
and<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.590> P<00:02:22.800> sounds<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.640> pop<00:02:23.880> filter<00:02:24.060> will

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and the P sounds the pop filter will

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and the P sounds the pop filter will
absorb<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.680> air<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.340> basically<00:02:27.440> eliminate

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
absorb the air and basically eliminate

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.309 
absorb the air and basically eliminate
that<00:02:28.700> noise<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.270> yeah<00:02:30.390> basically<00:02:30.630> I'm<00:02:31.020> close

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
that noise but yeah basically I'm close

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.140 
that noise but yeah basically I'm close
to<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> microphone<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:32.100> guys<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.520> hear<00:02:32.700> what

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
to the microphone you guys can hear what

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.790 
to the microphone you guys can hear what
the<00:02:33.270> quality<00:02:33.600> sounds<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:33.959> if<00:02:34.140> I'm<00:02:34.260> close<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
the quality sounds like if I'm close and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.710 
the quality sounds like if I'm close and
just<00:02:34.830> leaning<00:02:35.730> towards<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> mic<00:02:36.209> myself<00:02:36.569> I'm

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
just leaning towards the mic myself I'm

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.559 
just leaning towards the mic myself I'm
sitting<00:02:37.020> back<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.560> my<00:02:37.860> chair<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:40.489> the

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
sitting back in my chair like this the

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.360 
sitting back in my chair like this the
sound<00:02:42.569> quality<00:02:43.020> sounds<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:43.440> now<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.160> puck

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
sound quality sounds like now you puck

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.800 
sound quality sounds like now you puck
can<00:02:44.550> probably<00:02:44.760> hear<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> background<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
can probably hear the background of the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.660 
can probably hear the background of the
people<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.739> other<00:02:46.920> ones<00:02:47.190> because<00:02:47.519> it's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
people in the other ones because it's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.150 
people in the other ones because it's
like<00:02:47.850> every<00:02:48.239> time<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.480> do<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.720> video<00:02:48.890> they<00:02:49.890> start

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
like every time I do a video they start

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.190 
like every time I do a video they start
arguing<00:02:50.580> probably<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:51.780> I'm<00:02:51.900> not<00:02:52.019> in

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
arguing probably because I'm not in

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.949 
arguing probably because I'm not in
there<00:02:52.380> because<00:02:52.560> everyone<00:02:52.950> loves<00:02:53.250> me<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.550> yeah

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
they always make noise but I'm gonna

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
sitting back normally in my chair say if

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.860 
sitting back normally in my chair say if
I<00:02:59.190> was<00:02:59.280> doing<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.610> live<00:02:59.790> showing<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.300> guys<00:03:00.450> are

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
used in this that's my primary

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.750 
used in this that's my primary
microphone<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> this<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.280> see<00:03:05.519> you

microphone so this is you can see you

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.120 
microphone so this is you can see you
probably<00:03:05.940> can't<00:03:06.239> see<00:03:06.420> me<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.590> video<00:03:07.769> but

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130
