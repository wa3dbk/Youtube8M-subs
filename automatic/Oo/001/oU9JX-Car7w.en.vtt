 mateljan speaking 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:10.919
 the general direction 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.929
 and some buildings that we have built with their material and then 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.210
 at the bar lara believes how we have collaborated 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 in the media-tic building 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.300
 mcc in the image of 67 impacts the concello has felt fear is the third 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.300
 life-long fauci project that was the rescue to greece since I was in 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.500
 doubt that it had a design similar design of 50 years is a building of 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.710
 three floors per stairway around a fortnight of this month 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.290
 paca lacking time demands given that this label through city from the area 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.900
 on the court vázquez hernández de israel the licensed building and another 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.000
 for the end 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.150
 and sevilla through the atrium 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.410
 I was talking to the club about 20 million Peruvians, myself who 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.780
 it was a lot of money 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.780
 to see if it works very well 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.840
 i the center offers for beings of the earth the material is very green 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.240
 tonight with restriction products mining is never effective 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.830
 epilogue and that on the other would be thrown that is to say it is a recycling 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.260
 industrial ipi the reverse step buildings 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.350
 with this material that has mazzaglia spring zerocoma cimbronazo 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.230
 millimeters 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.040
 that is to say we are much less material than it is about the intercity appointment between 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.229
 different clans end of aluminum power video 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.749
 this is where we start the most interesting aspects of technology 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.110
 this is a wheel of a bicycle the center here is a central axis that 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.119
 needs connected to the state ammeter 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.970
 through this statesman up and down efe 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.040
 then we achieve what I call our dairies 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.530
 weighing between 8 and 10 kilos per square meter and if you compare 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.210
 Builders are bought 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.030
 d delirium weighing 6 175 kilos ports square meter we really are 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.539
 studying much less material 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:16.249
 this sentence since in these two weeks with a small electric motor 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:22.819
 He said that they use around 100 seats to start around 100 meters 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.879
 square these sessions of gymnastics that is needed for example for this sector 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.009
 with which we are very intense and positive 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:35.649
 i against mexiquense d very well because I have been the temperature 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:40.489
 it increases a lot if you do the mate that simply answered that you did not 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.739
 burning 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.939
 the file is not flammable 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.620
 never immortal between these materials and 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.819
 7a 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.069
 the project 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.879
 botti this experience very good 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.489
 that allows us through hero 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.700
 in that attempt to bribe to make the time that is here disappear 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.749
 when we come to areas like Spain where at the climax of this week 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 investment superior to international loans we interviewed 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.130
 develop 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.199
 systems of that entity 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.199
 pretty interesting pxndx that we put in his hands 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.069
 in which an Argentine graphic is added before the doubts when putting more 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.779
 from a campaign to the modest stoke waters 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:27.159
 in that aspect a series of human experiments the in terms of financing 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.509
 climate 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:32.799
 and with this is to say that his birth chile trichet up 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.279
 to the climate changes 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:39.799
 that is, when what really interests us is that I think you are detected by a 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.880
 small building 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.739
 we committed for now not in Barcelona 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.109
 a piñera challenge for 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.179
 the idea of ​​the word friend good friend and colleague 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.409
 the mayor 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.549
 it was the idea to pose oem 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.220
 the steel structure per hundred 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.060
 we move from concrete to steel yours is a 40% weight reduction 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.999
 and within that to 0 make a structure attraction a suspended structure 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.739
 It is also another 20% reduction in 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.129
 it started 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.319
 and these photo this was what transported we emit habit source 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.819
 let's do four times more 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.139
 efficient 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.889
 that the technical code the energy consumption in 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.499
 then mediterranean 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.610
 a week of winter 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.040
 in the lowest heating consumption 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.730
 instead the consumption of conditioned air in air movement that 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.310
 is very high what you have to attack is 80% of our consumption in the building 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.009
 what is climate 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.219
 g a climate change scenario related to exp 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.250
 min lc open produces us a 15 percent improvement poses with the lecce 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.889
 open with the non-performance f we are already 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.139
 technical code 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.509
 creating this double skin therefore 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.589
 What we do is remove all the information from this glass, we remove the 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:03.480
 blades 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.029
 we take away the screen printing we take away the intelligence the glass 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.839
 we deliver is silly or in camp david blas behind 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:14.210
 and in front we bring all these plastics these polymers 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.930
 this performance hour four meters away 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.320
 with which allows us to put here the stairs the elevators the services 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.199
 duct installations 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.029
 this leaves us the totally transparent free space 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.060
 What makes us is that we have 3 skins before 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.509
 but this skin 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.280
 What we do is that each of these cushions has an IP address 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.270
 have a small computer one for your wine the deaf platforms and they are not 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.110
 platforms 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.290
 what can you put linux language in them are open source 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.150
 and they created istas our shared patent 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.270
 it is a computer a subway 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.669
 a vox plate 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.639
 and then another fundamental part was for 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.419
 to the consortium and for rector that is not moved pd particles of fluids are 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:03.949
 basically 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.120
 the cushions have 15% solar penetration with a silkscreen or 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.159
 be that the cushion with makes grace 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.849
 already meets the technical but then so visionary utility by cuatros 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:15.849
 efficiency 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.419
 we think if we have 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.740
 air if this man has for identification to the air 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.059
 if I put particles in that air 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:27.490
 what it will generate is a new ethic created by the building 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.910
 based on nitrogen 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.910
 that will produce a sunscreen 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.300
 itself 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.770
 in the end 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.620
 it is a great machine a machine in which all of it is in balance by the 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.340
 pro of energy
