00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.700
 hi we all know how much they are 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.370
 expensive gopro accessories 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.809
 we have the possibility to carry out a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.539
 lots of things to equip ourselves to be able to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.670
 coping with all kinds of situations 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.949
 but they require a lot of pennies 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 for the accessories needed to support 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.519
 the video camera with this base 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.470
 that all of them find in the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.290
 purchase package is possible 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.469
 build a chest support that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.379
 which can be used for shooting in 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 bicycle or motorcycle are in 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.210
 those situations or for live in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.420
 road in those situations where 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.879
 application to the chest can be convenient 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.210
 to have hands free, of course 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.180
 I practiced in the base of tina 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.420
 slots in the slots using one 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.100
 then cutter the tool that tool 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.799
 which applies to the drill and which allows 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.020
 to drill and create such a thing 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.619
 out I bought for 50 cents a 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 meter 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.510
 this ribbon that the same one 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.750
 find 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.620
 in backpacks in baby carriers 50 cents per 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.960
 meter 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.070
 I would say that you can invest and a euro 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.760
 instead for this snap closure 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.280
 quick and that I mounted in this one 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.220
 position I slipped naturally into 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.260
 slits made to pass behind I have 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.740
 created a knot so he could 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.330
 of course stop for those who have 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.870
 someone at home who can help maybe 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.960
 it is better to do 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.550
 sew or glue it with a glue 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.000
 powerful on this side instead I did 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.210
 pass in the double buttonhole so that it is 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.490
 blocked and why it can be 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.100
 adjustable this for the lower part la 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.890
 part on the belly in the upper part 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.430
 instead you could do the same thing 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.200
 I had a strap at my disposal 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.090
 of the camera an old cini to the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.470
 camera that already has all of them 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:20.010
 his strippers removed from the camera is 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.910
 reported on these on these aso and not 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:28.080
 does nothing but repeat its function on 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.900
 cosimo support and this will support the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.040
 camcorder in height this other part 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.090
 4 been behind is hooked will serve to 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.220
 keep it signed in the chest and then be able to 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.540
 one can have and resume freely 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.220
 here we have already concluded the thing there 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.090
 they want ten minutes of work for one 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.360
 wall this type is really 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.959
 I believe that with written in the 50 euros one 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.790
 so original gopro bib then 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.950
 using those attacks that you 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.030
 already found in the basic packaging of 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.120
 purchase 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.950
 I just have to stick it in the base 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.300
 and how to naturally adjust too 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.550
 to orientation then according to one 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.890
 shooting slightly downwards 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.250
 I will do nothing but adjust the height in 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.680
 this way is a more parallel shot 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.720
 to my movement in this other way 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.480
 slightly upwards 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.450
 here we can indulge ourselves with one 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.569
 expense that does not reach 2 euros 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.480
 to realize something that can be 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.480
 very very useful and practical, hello everyone
