00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.350
 This is the HP Pavillion 17F 055 and D a 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.630
 17.3 inch laptop with a target core i5 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.830
 processor 8 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.060
 but makes excellent for it 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.070
 my hobby for which my work 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.330
 watch videos from multimedia in the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.160
 daily things such as experiments and 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.630
 internet as the first viewer 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.570
 material we see that it is manufactured 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.430
 made of a gray material with a wrinkle 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.600
 you can go back in a horizontal direction 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.640
 you have to hear 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.350
 does feel a bit different on you 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.880
 fingers at the bottom we see it 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.500
 question is of the same material and that 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.730
 who has got replaceable battery 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.230
 very nice to know for people who 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.390
 for example, often go on a journey 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.100
 it is 2.67 centimeters thick and three cups 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.020
 at three kilos think that perfectly suited 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.320
 is to sit on your table or desk 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.000
 put 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.710
 but a little less suitable to participate 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.140
 take on a trip and he would not just either 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.360
 fit in every bag as first and first 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.340
 look at the screen that is 17.3 inches 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.079
 screen is a fairly large screen i will 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.190
 just hold an opinion than you can 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.300
 See that he is just at the top and 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.190
 Then the she can just get a piece 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.050
 results in comparison with the format of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.010
 normal a4 cares about is nice for that 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.500
 space to work 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.399
 The screen is a glossy HD ready 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.899
 screen 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.369
 things that are beautiful, full, bright colors 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.600
 produces a little more trouble 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.880
 of reflection than, for example, a mat 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.289
 anti glare screen at the top of 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.240
 a screen the hd the those webcamming 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:12.289
 so fine for skype to the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.179
 side of the mine keyboard 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.920
 numerical portion of your duo sums in 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.329
 documents and has a 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.679
 touchpad me also that button what beautiful 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.819
 concealed in design 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.170
 but if you don't like it 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.149
 of course always a wireless or one 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.619
 to connect an old mouse to the laptop 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.060
 it also blood or via pin help thingy 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.649
 devices such as a smartphone or tablet 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.749
 or other Bluetooth wireless devices 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.609
 can always on this laptop and has one 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.229
 HDMI port, meaning an extra fine by 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.170
 could join or join if necessary 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.999
 can connect to the TV in the laptop 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.569
 we find 8 gigabyte ram which I just already 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.609
 said 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.499
 and that is quite reasonable 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.729
 for one you have this price range 

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:46.279
 make sure it doesn't matter apparently 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.259
 he is also a 500 gigabyte hard 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.029
 disk and and share video card guess that 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.799
 that has enough graphic power and for that 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:53.539
 simple games and your bus candy crush 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.549
 but not predicting as with so many 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.929
 Four hours of color does he would give you more 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.099
 want to know about this laptop or they him 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.469
 want to purchase freely 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.639
 go to laptopshop.nl point b and you can 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.789
 always stop by one of ours 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.789
 stores
