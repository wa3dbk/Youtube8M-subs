00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
down and this is a fairly new box I just

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.130 
down and this is a fairly new box I just
bought<00:00:16.590> there's<00:00:17.460> 100<00:00:17.880> cards<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.900> and

bought there's 100 cards in here and
envelopes<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> cards<00:00:20.760> look<00:00:20.880> like

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
envelopes and so the cards look like

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.150 
envelopes and so the cards look like
this<00:00:21.330> they're<00:00:23.600> just<00:00:24.600> scored<00:00:25.529> they're<00:00:25.769> kind<00:00:26.010> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
this they're just scored they're kind of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.950 
this they're just scored they're kind of
like<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.609> would<00:00:26.760> say<00:00:26.910> ten<00:00:27.119> by<00:00:27.269> seven<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.779> then

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
like I would say ten by seven and then

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.120 
like I would say ten by seven and then
you<00:00:28.050> fold<00:00:28.230> them<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.410> half<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:28.920> score

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you fold them in half this little score

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.679 
you fold them in half this little score
line<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.910> comes<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.179> envelopes<00:00:30.359> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
line and it comes with envelopes and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.569 
line and it comes with envelopes and
they're<00:00:30.840> about<00:00:31.019> 26<00:00:31.800> cents<00:00:32.009> apiece<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.399> think

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
they're about 26 cents apiece I think

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.750 
they're about 26 cents apiece I think
the<00:00:33.180> box<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.570> 100<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.989> $25.99<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:35.340> blick<00:00:35.579> right

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the box of 100 is $25.99 at blick right

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.990 
the box of 100 is $25.99 at blick right
now<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.200> and<00:00:37.200> that's<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.340> get<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.969> I

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
now that's and that's what I get so I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
now that's and that's what I get so I
get<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> hundred<00:00:39.660> cards<00:00:40.140> right<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:40.890> that

price<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.460> that's<00:00:41.940> more<00:00:42.360> convenient<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.870> think

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
price and that's more convenient I think

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750

and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> use<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.900> yardstick<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.710> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and then I like to use a yardstick and I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
and then I like to use a yardstick and I
feel<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> metal<00:01:35.729> edge<00:01:36.030> ones<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.720> can

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
feel for the metal edge ones and you can

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.399 
feel for the metal edge ones and you can
get<00:01:36.960> them<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> hardware<00:01:37.409> store<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.780> then

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
get them at the hardware store and then

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
get them at the hardware store and then
I<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.710> tear<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:43.430> now<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> might<00:01:44.790> wanna<00:01:45.030> leave

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
in the studio paintings it's about 11 by

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.920 
in the studio paintings it's about 11 by
15<00:02:01.490> it's<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.640> set<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.969> aside<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.659> I'll

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
15 it's all set that aside and then I'll

tear<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.649> one<00:02:04.920> down<00:02:05.700> even<00:02:06.149> smaller

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
tear it this one down even smaller

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.790 
tear it this one down even smaller
laughs<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.110> tear<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.410> down<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.739> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
laughs and then I tear it down just to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.170 
laughs and then I tear it down just to
make<00:02:13.830> sure<00:02:14.040> your<00:02:14.220> kid<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.640> nice<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.970> clean

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.170 
begin so you don't get smudges on your
paper<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.610> would<00:02:23.670> do<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.150> that

paper and so what I would do is that
would<00:02:24.300> fold<00:02:24.510> these<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.720> half<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.739> if<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.890> was

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
would fold these in half now if I was

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.030 
would fold these in half now if I was
going<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.310> make<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> little<00:02:26.700> travel<00:02:27.480> book

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.180 
that's pretty much how I tear down my
watercolor<00:03:03.480> paper<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:04.260> piece<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.069> have

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
watercolor paper this piece that I have

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
under here is a sheet of Aquarius which

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.770 
under here is a sheet of Aquarius which
is<00:03:08.190> very<00:03:08.489> smooth<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.360> has<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> little

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
is very smooth and has a little

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.120 
is very smooth and has a little
synthetic<00:03:09.959> content<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.769> doesn't<00:03:11.010> buckle

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
synthetic content so it doesn't buckle

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.789 
synthetic content so it doesn't buckle
so<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.730> it's<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.910> lighter<00:03:12.150> weight<00:03:12.390> paper<00:03:12.799> so

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
so and it's a lighter weight paper so

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.410 
so and it's a lighter weight paper so
it's<00:03:13.920> also<00:03:14.069> kind<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.370> fun<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.730> work<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.120> as<00:03:15.269> well

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
it's also kind of fun to work on as well

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300 
it's also kind of fun to work on as well
but<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.019> think<00:03:16.200> after<00:03:16.590> seeing<00:03:16.739> me<00:03:16.920> tear<00:03:17.130> down

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
but I think after seeing me tear down
