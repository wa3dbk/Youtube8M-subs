00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.639
 welcome to the kitchens of the world my 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 invited today is boris that you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.599
 imagine that it comes from Russia but not 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.199
 comes from russia comes from panama for this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.940
 applaud him because he's never here or 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.500
 even from Colombia but I do not say you're going 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.930
 to put it wrong and it's time to tell the truth 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.240
 only hungry and with a lot of pride 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.519
 pure race of dark resolution we are going to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.310
 make a pineapple dish pineapple rice is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.980
 typical of panama not a rice shake 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.360
 with pinion how is this line going first 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.739
 thing that people have to know in what 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.890
 that we were talking about before 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.750
 the pineapple will arrive knowing that it is ripe 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.510
 has to throw there is very agile or 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.930
 we can go working because it's going 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.930
 explaining that I have a pink color 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.469
 then I will explain why I have done this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.750
 It is important that unlike Spain 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.879
 in Latin America 'we cut the pineapple 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.900
 a very different way we take away the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.900
 that we have the top 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.810
 directly prepared to do it 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.909
 uses very little this and unlike 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.610
 that we do not cut into four parts what 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.710
 we will do is hospitalization 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.340
 because this is the part that we are going to 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.560
 use for later power 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.509
 prepare 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.040
 the shake the smoothie that we are going to make 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.780
 today he will debate that he is going to 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.180
 bring condensed milk if I do not 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.590
 I mistake milk ideal in this case 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.600
 we can also use evaporated milk 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.399
 there is no problem I have done 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.170
 evaporated that was better and all yes because 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.240
 It gives more body to the rice shake some 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.649
 type of rice or any rice you can 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.250
 use any kind of from here 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.840
 de españa.el pump to the long round in 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.369
 panama cross the cheapest the most 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.560
 cheap to beat or cheaper with 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.689
 Popular type dish has to be taken 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.979
 cheaper is sugar salt sugar sugar or 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.979
 cinnamon salt 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:08.760
 opening a problem a problem and this 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.760
 we will save it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.500
 we throw it we throw it away very well 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.780
 since that we can throw it away 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.290
 this yes this is explain well I keep it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.290
 to save 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.709
 the pineapple has a peculiarity that has 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.079
 all the eyes where they really come in 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.790
 the nutrients to the pineapple and it gives the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.739
 sweet taste you have to keep them 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.980
 exactly then we make cuts 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.290
 cross in this way to be able 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.480
 remove the eyes we give the eyes of 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.040
 panama only in any question is that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.079
 put it with water something to cook yes yes 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.849
 yes i know it was created by women 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.079
 then negotiated female you're wearing 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.480
 doing several things at once 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.150
 I put water yes for games you can put it 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.010
 up to half water in half water 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.010
 and you can also add rice 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.680
 I put the red one in cold water and without water the 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.590
 shell water what we are looking for here is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.980
 really that no no no sugars for 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.379
 cinnamon cinnamon final 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.420
 what we are looking for here is that with water 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.849
 of boiling little by little go liberating 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.579
 both the rice starch and the aroma 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.950
 and the taste of pineapple 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:33.290
 exactly glutinous and this is 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.959
 Vanilla is not going to go too 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.150
 another thing he forgives is that all this 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.930
 we take advantage so we can tell you more 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.180
 flavor to the law and smoothie to liquefied 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.620
 that we are going to make the little eyes that are 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.620
 important because he's really 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.340
 good and finally 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.290
 for when we have cold feet a 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.560
 way we do it is to cut 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.560
 pineapple 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.599
 sliced ​​Havana and in the way that 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.670
 really we cut the pineapple in 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.840
 the Central American countries consolidating 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.939
 we have the pineapple cut everything to cook 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.100
 we wait without how much time usually 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.930
 about 30 minutes we see ourselves very slow 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.509
 so that little by little they have gone away 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.160
 releasing from the good night I'm going to 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.139
 simplify the recipe so that people 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.770
 understand at home we have rice the 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.210
 water the eyes of pineapple cinnamon and vanilla 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.009
 It was all cooked for 30 minutes 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.349
 it was with this texture I do not know if here my 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.940
 camera friend can see and now we're going 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.669
 to continue to do the next step that 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.270
 right let's take all the skin 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.139
 of the pineapple we are going to extract it from the skin 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:52.720
 of the pineapple is a lie that does not understand 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:55.180
 we take this is perfect 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.190
 we also remove the cinnamon so that 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:06.100
 there are more enough 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:08.050
 in another life I was surgeon ok now what 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.330
 What we do is pass it to the glass and 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.330
 directly helping 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.249
 to give it a better touch more aaron la 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.309
 pineapple is what we are going to do is 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.930
 add a few pieces of pineapple 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:31.380
 when all 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.380
 and add milk to taste 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:37.859
 what time is it that you normally take 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.959
 this shake at home usually as 

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:43.169
 dessert that can a midday meal 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:45.110
 well 432 and sugar to taste also 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.710
 we add 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:52.160
 how many two tablespoons and a half two 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.040
 tablespoons more or less for a glass of 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.550
 rice the starch rice the digestive 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.330
 and the pineapple 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.330
 from good 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.570
 enough 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.150
 and you are going to put some decoration or something 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.130
 we can put the pieces of pineapple in the 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.210
 Corners depends as you want to decorate 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.199
 as decorated the product as the 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.530
 we will take advantage of one of the pineapples 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:33.120
