00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
not like jumping on a bike that you can

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
not like jumping on a bike that you can
you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.280> pick<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.760> 10-15<00:01:15.360> minutes<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
you know pick up in 10-15 minutes it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.120 
you know pick up in 10-15 minutes it
does<00:01:15.869> take<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> lot<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.380> time<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> lot<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
does take a lot of time a lot of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.240 
does take a lot of time a lot of
practice<00:01:18.799> essentially<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.890> comes<00:01:20.009> down<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
practice essentially it comes down to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280 
practice essentially it comes down to
two<00:01:20.520> things<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.240> accuracy<00:01:21.570> hitting<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
two things one is accuracy hitting the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.649 
two things one is accuracy hitting the
target<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> same<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.000> field<00:01:24.240> archery

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
target it's the same with field archery

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.359 
target it's the same with field archery
hitting<00:01:25.080> 50<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.590> bullseye<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.100> higher

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
hitting 50 the bullseye is a higher

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.850 
hitting 50 the bullseye is a higher
score<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.939> then<00:01:27.299> also<00:01:27.659> speed<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> faster

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
score and then also speed so the faster

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
score and then also speed so the faster
you're<00:01:29.220> riding<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:29.909> points<00:01:30.240> you'll

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
