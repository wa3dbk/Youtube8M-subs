00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 bye 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.970
 welcome to the and the last boss came out 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.930
 the thunder law 7 for this bout 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.699
 we will have the usual 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.740
 configuration of two tank bands 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.840
 three genera and five of bs 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.369
 this combat will happen on a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.410
 central platform with four 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.329
 lightning conductors that being 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.820
 close to yesterday they will be loading 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.590
 granting a specific skill and the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.050
 conduit reaches 100 the level of this 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.220
 increases and returns to zero energy but 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.830
 will make the skills of this 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.629
 conduit increase in damage and quantity the 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.820
 dynamic of this first phase is to go 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.830
 approaching the lesion to the ducts without 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.839
 get to load the whole ones because if 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.580
 is not loading any will begin to 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.730
 hurt the whole band with energy 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.320
 downloaded every month the first one we go to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.790
 explain the special abilities of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 every driver in our case 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.080
 we'll start with the eastern conduit 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 broadcast chain the island will launch a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
 lightning over the random player 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.229
 appearing a call lightning 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.119
 blurred the peculiarity of this 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.130
 attack is that players will be chained 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.290
 close so that at each jump 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 will come out a new reason why 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.080
 we should be in this quadrant 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.850
 separated from each other 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.580
 the next one is the southern conduit 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.260
 overload when stability appears a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.970
 random box will be overloaded 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.090
 increasing its size and staying 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.800
 rooted past 6 seconds over load 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.870
 it will burst creating an energy ring 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.250
 electrical around that will expand and 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.750
 stun your step 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.120
 removing damage to those players who 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.100
 scope to avoid it we have two ways 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.930
 the first is to approach the player 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.060
 affected having a safe area 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.500
 around him and another one away 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.140
 considerable amount so that we do not 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.570
 take the next one is the conduit of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.850
 west frenzied discharge by the 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.680
 which is said to conjure three downloads 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.720
 frantic that will fall to the ground in three 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.180
 random points marked with 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.310
 blue tones our task will be to avoid 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.619
 that these sparks touch the ground when not 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.600
 have a player in the area of ​​impact 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.370
 on the floor with no one inside will appear 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.770
 a pretty big called power 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.380
 uncontrolled and frenzied discharge 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.940
 will rebound to another side of this 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.110
 way if for example a download is 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.360
 leave forgotten 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.760
 bounce without stopping appearing one behind 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.709
 each bounce in addition to it the adss 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.959
 they remove enough and they should be seized 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.550
 for a tank to appear any if 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.410
 we always have a player in 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.910
 the impact zone when they appear 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.580
 we can forget about the at of this 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.010
 driver and as last the conduit of 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.750
 north static shock law will be responsible 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.450
 a player putting a blue mark 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.070
 on his head after 8 seconds 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.260
 this player will receive a large amount 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.900
 of damage divided between players who 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.730
 are around for it when the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.739
 static shock we should get together 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.010
 that player to divide his damage between 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.010
 various 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.640
 as we have commented before law 100 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.799
 It should be carried with each conduit without 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.329
 get to load it all but also 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.310
 of the special abilities of each 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.739
 one of them feel him in several 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.480
 skills in this first phase the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.549
 first most common attack will be throne 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.769
 crushing that will do it a few times 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.959
 for each quadrant hitting hard 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.659
 to the ground and leaving three damage zones 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.370
 for 45 seconds and to which only 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.739
 we will have to separate them 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.540
 the second is thunderous they did 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.030
 throw your ax in the location of a 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.620
 random player and it will remove a damage that 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.019
 It will depend on how far we are from the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.000
 zone an impact receive very close 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.480
 thundering kill any player by 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.610
 what we should only get away from this one 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.190
 as for the third skill only 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.230
 will affect the capital tanks at 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.760
 receive stability will have six 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.760
 seconds to get as far away as possible 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.310
 of legend since the damage will depend on the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.409
 that is in addition to that 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.940
 tank will receive a debut of 100% damage 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.370
 received for 30 seconds 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.560
 in short remove yourself from the zones of 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.900
 crushing throne move away from the area 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.879
 thunderous impact and change tank 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.730
 with decapitating while the tank that 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.980
 it will go away and be more possible 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.680
 once seen this we just have to go 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.150
 dealing with the above 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.510
 without getting to load at all 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.970
 driver when you say reaches 65% 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.699
 of life will jump to the middle and the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.919
 first interface that will last 45 seconds 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.810
 it will be overloaded all 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.090
 conduits and the band should be separated 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.350
 by quadrants the reason for this is that 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.240
 now it will happen the four 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.610
 skills of the four conduits one 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.680
 behind another one in this case we have a 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.990
 group of two weights and one gel in another 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.910
 group like a third group of a dps and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.070
 a heller and the fourth group of two 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.710
 tanks each will host a quadrant and 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.060
 will have to deal with all the skills 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.340
 you are separated to avoid linking 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.350
 broadcast chains get together when a 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.000
 player has overload divide the 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.400
 group with the unloading zonal 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.440
 frantic and get together with static shock 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.389
 the problem comes when we have three 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.460
 frantic downloads or static shock 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.560
 in a quadrant of two players in whose 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.930
 case they should use special abilities 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.090
 of class for example and a guard what 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.639
 dark contract receive static shock 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.050
 only a hunter with deterrence and be 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.060
 pending of the tanks when there is 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.830
 three frantic downloads in one area 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.470
 the players because a quick salt 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.600
 once the interface is finished 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.730
 what else was loaded will be 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.280
 unused and its entire quadrant with the 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.170
 electrified floor we advise that 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.150
 Always be the shaft of the chain 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.700
 of diffusion to be together 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.680
 always in the next interface now 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.840
 we will have to lower the law by being up to 30 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.810
 percent of life just going through 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.150
 three conduits for his part law will be made 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.190
 completely different skills 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.770
 the first is to invoke lightning ball 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.480
 some little elementary sparks will go 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.030
 loading to be able sanatoriums until 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.580
 die the second is the tico of 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.080
 lightning a cone-shaped zonal 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.540
 will leave the electrified soil about 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.180
 seconds and we should avoid and third 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.460
 fusion pit what will hit the tank 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.230
 and will throw it several meters back in 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.450
 this point the tanks should always 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.250
 have aleix in looking downtown since 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.140
 they are used beaten with melting slits 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.570
 looking outwards he will throw them out 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.670
 of the platform as to how to 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.920
 load them since the damage will be quite 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.990
 adjusted we should always avoid loading 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.240
 one hundred percent the conduit pulling 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.550
 Aleix and receiving a few seconds of damage 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.640
 power download 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.680
 and gaining some time of course 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.600
 we must bear in mind that at 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.280
 do this should be capped to the band 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.650
 and not hold much time since the 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.340
 band damage will be quite high by 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.660
 the rest 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.210
 we will continue loading the three 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.710
 conduits grappling with their abilities and 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.650
 in 30% we will change phase 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.060
 second 45-second interface in the 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.430
 that again be overloaded in the 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.500
 conduits now we must separate ourselves by 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.180
 the three remaining quadrants and hold 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.640
 the skills of those three ducts 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.530
 active although now we will be one more by 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.750
 quadrant all your skills will remove 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.210
 more damage than in the first interface and 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.040
 will come out more often still so should not 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.260
 be a problem for the band to finish this 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.930
 phase 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.550
 and after that it reaches the final phase in the 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.860
 that we will only have to finish with 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.510
 laws we will no longer have more skills 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.010
 conduits but I did it in gan 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.610
 skills of the previous two phases 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.830
 of phase 1 we will have thunderous and of the 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.470
 phase 2 invoke ball of lightning and 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.150
 whip of lightning in addition to it the 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.190
 tanks will receive cumulative damage from 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.590
 overwhelming power that will be changed 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.750
 when one reboots brands and the band 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.150
 you will receive from time to time while on 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.560
 violent gale what will push the 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.750
 players slowly towards a direction 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.970
 removing the damage and adding loads of 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.950
 wind as the fight progresses in this 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.620
 last phase gale foods 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.050
