never-ending quest for what you think is
perfection<00:02:55.720> see<00:02:56.720> there's<00:02:56.900> only<00:02:57.019> 360<00:02:57.829> degrees

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
perfection see there's only 360 degrees

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.360 
perfection see there's only 360 degrees
in<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.459> circle<00:02:58.569> right<00:02:59.569> but<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.620> there's<00:03:01.160> an

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
in a circle right but that there's an

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.250 
in a circle right but that there's an
illusion<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.420> they<00:03:02.599> put<00:03:02.870> out<00:03:02.989> there<00:03:03.230> that

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
illusion that they put out there that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.650 
illusion that they put out there that
makes<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.709> think<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.099> this<00:03:04.480> 666<00:03:05.480> degrees

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
makes you think that this 666 degrees

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.860 
makes you think that this 666 degrees
you<00:03:06.410> see<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.280> extra<00:03:07.760> six<00:03:08.030> degrees<00:03:08.450> is

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
you see so that extra six degrees is

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.780 
you see so that extra six degrees is
something<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.319> keep<00:03:09.530> looking<00:03:09.890> for<00:03:09.920> but<00:03:10.430> it's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
something you keep looking for but it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.849 
something you keep looking for but it's
never<00:03:11.060> there<00:03:11.329> you're<00:03:11.959> going<00:03:12.260> around<00:03:12.379> in<00:03:12.769> a

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
never there you're going around in a

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.009 
never there you're going around in a
complete<00:03:12.980> circle<00:03:13.609> which<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.879> 360<00:03:14.690> degrees

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
complete circle which is 360 degrees

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.050 
complete circle which is 360 degrees
looking<00:03:15.739> for<00:03:15.919> that<00:03:16.069> extra<00:03:16.430> six<00:03:16.700> degrees<00:03:17.030> of

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
looking for that extra six degrees of

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.050 
looking for that extra six degrees of
separation<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:18.650> know<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:19.130> that's<00:03:19.639> what<00:03:19.910> it

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
separation you know and that's what it

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.909 
separation you know and that's what it
is<00:03:20.180> six<00:03:20.510> degrees<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.930> separation<00:03:21.139> it

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
is six degrees of separation it

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.449 
is six degrees of separation it
separates<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.790> from<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.870> real<00:03:24.650> circle<00:03:25.160> and

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
separates you from the real circle and

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.400 
separates you from the real circle and
has<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.910> looking<00:03:26.269> outside<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.720> circle<00:03:27.260> for

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
has you looking outside the circle for

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.069 
has you looking outside the circle for
something<00:03:27.739> that<00:03:27.859> doesn't<00:03:28.069> even<00:03:28.310> exist<00:03:28.549> so

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
something that doesn't even exist so

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.879 
something that doesn't even exist so
this<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.290> why<00:03:30.500> we<00:03:31.310> do<00:03:31.519> things<00:03:31.819> um<00:03:32.769> when<00:03:33.769> we

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
this is why we do things um when we

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.690 
this is why we do things um when we
dissatisfied<00:03:34.639> with<00:03:34.819> ourselves<00:03:36.700> what's

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
dissatisfied with ourselves what's

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.670 
dissatisfied with ourselves what's
interesting<00:03:37.970> about<00:03:38.239> her<00:03:38.569> her<00:03:38.870> eye<00:03:39.019> operation

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
interesting about her her eye operation

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.740 
interesting about her her eye operation
is<00:03:39.859> that<00:03:39.889> it's<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.489> color<00:03:40.760> that<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.030> don't<00:03:41.239> think

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
is that it's a color that I don't think

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.110 
is that it's a color that I don't think
actually<00:03:41.930> occurs<00:03:42.290> in<00:03:42.500> nature<00:03:42.609> no<00:03:43.609> I<00:03:43.639> think<00:03:43.910> it

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
actually occurs in nature no I think it

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.750 
actually occurs in nature no I think it
was<00:03:44.239> like<00:03:44.329> a<00:03:44.500> cat<00:03:45.500> gray<00:03:45.919> or<00:03:46.220> something<00:03:46.579> look

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
was like a cat gray or something look

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.240 
was like a cat gray or something look
like<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.970> great<00:03:47.480> color<00:03:47.720> frosty<00:03:48.260> grey<00:03:49.010> yeah

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
like a great color frosty grey yeah

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.610 
like a great color frosty grey yeah
probably<00:03:49.519> not<00:03:49.750> happens<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.870> nature<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.410> see

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
probably not happens in nature and see

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.430 
probably not happens in nature and see
that's<00:03:52.280> again<00:03:52.840> artificial<00:03:53.840> what's<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.379> stop

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
that's again artificial what's to stop

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.520 
that's again artificial what's to stop
somebody<00:03:54.980> from<00:03:55.220> making<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.239> know<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:57.260> color

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
somebody from making you know the color

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.409 
somebody from making you know the color
your<00:03:57.829> shirts<00:03:58.099> and<00:03:58.310> purple<00:03:58.669> eyes<00:03:58.849> or<00:03:59.150> whatever

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
second time it's not quite right so then

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:55.769 
second time it's not quite right so then
you<00:05:54.370> get<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:54.610> third<00:05:54.879> time<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.389> fourth<00:05:55.419> time
