music elective called multi media arts

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.620 
music elective called multi media arts
I<00:00:16.379> started<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.369> incorporate<00:00:17.490> more<00:00:17.970> technology

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
I started to incorporate more technology

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.810 
I started to incorporate more technology
in<00:00:18.810> my<00:00:18.839> classroom<00:00:18.980> several<00:00:19.980> years<00:00:20.009> ago<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.609> I

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
in my classroom several years ago but I

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.450 
in my classroom several years ago but I
still<00:00:21.329> felt<00:00:21.509> it<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.810> something<00:00:21.960> missing<00:00:22.460> some

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
still felt it was something missing some

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.939 
still felt it was something missing some
way<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.669> get<00:00:24.029> current<00:00:24.960> technology<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
way to get current technology that the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.220 
way to get current technology that the
kids<00:00:26.189> use<00:00:26.340> everyday<00:00:26.669> into<00:00:27.599> their<00:00:27.750> hands<00:00:28.109> in

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
kids use everyday into their hands in

kids use everyday into their hands in
the<00:00:28.320> classroom<00:00:28.739> so<00:00:29.009> from<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.730> developed

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the classroom so from that I developed

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.630 
the classroom so from that I developed
multi<00:00:30.929> media<00:00:31.199> arts<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.369> an

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
multi media arts I think it's an

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.639 
multi media arts I think it's an
innovative<00:00:33.420> class<00:00:33.659> because<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.440> allows

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
innovative class because it allows

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
students to use their technology their

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.520 
students to use their technology their
knowledge<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> social<00:00:38.430> media<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.530> their
