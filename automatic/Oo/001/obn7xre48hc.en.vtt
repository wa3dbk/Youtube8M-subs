00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.240
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.890
 It is a gusset of the World Rubber Market Thank you to the old wisdom bag of this time 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.980
 Today's theme is here 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:17.420
 I think I will try to serve 1st serve 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:23.119
 This is the top Chinese player who has retired 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:29.119
 A little Saab way of Ow utility player also tried to thorough analysis this time 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.880
 It will be a bit more personal analysis, but the waree player is a strong service ace 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.760
 So many 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:40.079
 Although it is not, but it seems to be able to make use of the forehand characteristic of the 3rd pitch Hanchin steadily 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.550
 I put the Do that service intense service 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.860
 Such for at even this time everyone forehand of everyone in to remember serving this yc soldier 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.900
 I think I might not live 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.460
 How to serve one team face quickly 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.070
 I think that I want to I use both the waist roughly planted beside forehand but usually 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.500
 Common players and players on the day serve players 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.489
 When you say what is different? 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.970
 After all I see it and the amount of rotation is different, so it's a spin next to it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.439
 Well, it's a confusing motion or a marine player 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.280
 It is not hard to understand, but I can understand it with serve if it is sideways 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:23.390
 The amount of rotation only at basic serve is completely different 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.480
 How strength secret of the very the strong lateral rotation because what is taking out over a period of 1 day 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.940
 Though 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.720
 First First place set up at the time that set up first 2 I was good Saab one player first protege 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.730
 I will 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 When I go home 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.630
 It's like pulling behind, it's a normal serve, usually in this position 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.530
 One more day 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.260
 A little behind your left foot 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.850
 It is such feeling when doing so with pawn 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.150
 Pay attention to where the body is twisted 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.280
 School is I'm body twist 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:04.320
 But this body will come here and behind the left foot 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.319
 This is how it looks like this is a bit extreme 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.190
 From the state this body is twisted 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.420
 Issue moving relocation 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.590
 If you do so, you can apply a very strong lateral rotation . 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.030
 Well Typical amounts rotation Let's use from left from right when issuing the mouth 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.470
 Right to left 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:30.540
 Since refers to Tteyuu take a rotation well and the clinic in I left 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:35.130
 Players in one day but I've been doing until now is left from the right + 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.850
 It the power of the screw is twisting the body 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.850
 Using 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.099
 Apply using a screw twister 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.860
 The 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.190
 Ha ha ha 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.560
 Daddy 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.630
 Feelings and take-back are large for multi-players. 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.660
 It took a little larger because it has come out racket 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.310
 so 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:12.670
 While twisting the body there Rutte multiplied by the lateral rotation strongly Innovation bubble wrap in a large swing 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:17.620
 You already use the whole body 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.890
 There are a lot of small tips, but let's use the whole body of char in the pants 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.810
 I'm calling 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.060
 The weight on the ball when I use the body 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:32.520
 I think you put out an even white horizontal rotation we zone Then after all amount of rotation 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:38.160
 And now this takeback is about to do a big job behind high school now and this more to this twist 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:40.560
 It will be easier to apply power , but with a small disadvantage it's difficult to over-twist it by yourself 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.020
 Periodically by being behind 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.160
 big 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.830
 Screw day 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.830
 You may say I put out a body the previous power 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.459
 tan 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.340
 What to do first 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:12.360
 With your left foot behind you 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:17.709
 Make the body twist and hold it with two fingers 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:20.729
 Raise and take take a large reaction while taking advantage of the centrifugal force 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.729
 Boiled with electronic 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.150
 It's like this 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.110
 In this kind of feeling 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.350
 Is the while entering 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.700
 Centrifugal force 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:37.430
 Put all the weight off by complaining using 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.430
 I think I know I feel it 's placed on body weight out 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.069
 So twist it like this 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:47.659
 Weapons of Chin player of serve that end is the Tteyuu 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:52.219
 It will be in the state that the amount of rotation is more than looking very strong 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:56.210
 Stop the opponent if there is now a need to cut off the Buchi' say everyone's way 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:59.849
 Will increase opportunities to hit forehand I think you called me an alternative of the like poking 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:06.149
 The reverse is often the back type but I usually use the power of this one 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:10.610
 It is easy to be connected to the third ball forehand of the player, so it will be more deployment 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:10.610
 Please try and try what will be said 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.040
 It has been 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.810
 there were 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.949
 th 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.349
 Bach 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.500
 def 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.800
 Have 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.800
 Bie
