00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
I thought would fit the bill

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.439 
I thought would fit the bill
until<00:00:22.470> recently<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> saw<00:00:24.060> these<00:00:24.269> at

together<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.239> lightweight<00:00:39.809> they're<00:00:40.680> largely

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
together the lightweight they're largely

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.729

plastic with metal inside the headband I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.369 
plastic with metal inside the headband I
don't<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> call<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.000> flimsy<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.170> let's

don't want to call them flimsy but let's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.049 
don't want to call them flimsy but let's
just<00:00:46.559> say<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.980> I'd<00:00:47.100> hesitate<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> put<00:00:47.910> them

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
just say that I'd hesitate to put them

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.049 
just say that I'd hesitate to put them
through<00:00:48.090> any<00:00:48.570> significant<00:00:49.350> abuse<00:00:50.059> comfort

through any significant abuse comfort

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.540 
through any significant abuse comfort
was<00:00:51.210> obviously<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.840> priority<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> Sony<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.129> they

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
was obviously a priority to Sony as they

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.029 
was obviously a priority to Sony as they
have<00:00:53.730> big<00:00:54.120> ear<00:00:54.449> cups<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.989> soft<00:00:55.320> leather<00:00:55.680> pads

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
have big ear cups with soft leather pads

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.910 
have big ear cups with soft leather pads
and<00:00:56.430> even<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> headband<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> wider<00:00:58.410> than<00:00:58.559> most

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and even the headband is wider than most

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.060 
and even the headband is wider than most
and<00:00:59.280> also<00:00:59.550> decently<00:01:00.000> padded<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:01.440> combined

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and also decently padded this combined

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
and also decently padded this combined
with<00:01:02.309> how<00:01:02.460> light<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.149> are<00:01:03.300> makes<00:01:03.780> them

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
with how light they are makes them

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
with how light they are makes them
perfectly<00:01:04.470> suitable<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:05.100> wearing<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.760> long

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
perfectly suitable for wearing for long

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.990 
perfectly suitable for wearing for long
periods<00:01:06.540> without<00:01:06.810> fatigue<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.760> think<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> main

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
periods without fatigue I think the main

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.550 
periods without fatigue I think the main
selling<00:01:09.360> point<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.229> their

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
selling point for these is their

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.280 
selling point for these is their
Bluetooth<00:01:10.890> functionality<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.570> left<00:01:12.810> ear<00:01:13.049> cup

has an NFC chip to make pairing quick
with<00:01:15.900> compatible<00:01:16.500> devices<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.790> pairing<00:01:18.270> the

tedious<00:01:21.140> their<00:01:22.140> usage<00:01:22.590> range<00:01:22.860> is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
tedious their usage range is

noise cancelling I'll try to keep this

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.729 
noise cancelling I'll try to keep this
concise<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.730> works<00:04:03.330> decently<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.260> it's

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.040 
concise it works decently and it's

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
the soundstage makes them feel a bit

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.560 
the soundstage makes them feel a bit
laid-back

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
laid-back

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.360 
laid-back
while<00:05:08.570> some<00:05:08.930> headphones<00:05:09.170> make<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.040> seem<00:05:10.220> like

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
while some headphones make it seem like

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.240 
while some headphones make it seem like
vocals<00:05:10.850> are<00:05:11.030> right<00:05:11.420> in<00:05:11.570> your<00:05:11.660> face<00:05:12.050> please<00:05:12.980> put

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
vocals are right in your face please put

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.640 
vocals are right in your face please put
them<00:05:13.400> at<00:05:13.490> arm's<00:05:13.640> length<00:05:14.080> it's<00:05:15.080> not<00:05:15.290> a<00:05:15.320> bad

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
them at arm's length it's not a bad

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.190 
them at arm's length it's not a bad
thing<00:05:16.010> by<00:05:16.190> any<00:05:16.340> means<00:05:16.730> and<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.390> overall<00:05:17.870> sound

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
thing by any means and the overall sound

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.220 
thing by any means and the overall sound
signature<00:05:18.890> is<00:05:19.070> engaging<00:05:19.700> but<00:05:20.570> in<00:05:20.660> such<00:05:20.900> a<00:05:20.930> way

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
signature is engaging but in such a way

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.950 
signature is engaging but in such a way
that<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:21.620> never<00:05:21.650> becomes<00:05:22.280> fatiguing<00:05:23.000> for<00:05:23.870> the

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
that it never becomes fatiguing for the

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.990 
that it never becomes fatiguing for the
scenarios<00:05:24.500> that<00:05:24.770> people<00:05:25.130> are<00:05:25.280> likely<00:05:25.850> to<00:05:25.970> use

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
scenarios that people are likely to use

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.130 
scenarios that people are likely to use
the<00:05:26.420> zx7<00:05:27.050> 70's<00:05:27.560> and<00:05:27.740> i'd<00:05:28.130> say<00:05:28.300> they<00:05:29.300> sound<00:05:29.630> just

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
the zx7 70's and i'd say they sound just

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.550 
the zx7 70's and i'd say they sound just
right<00:05:30.460> so<00:05:31.460> overall<00:05:31.850> I<00:05:32.060> think<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.450> zx7<00:05:33.080> 70s

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
right so overall I think the zx7 70s

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.770 
right so overall I think the zx7 70s
offer<00:05:33.770> a<00:05:34.010> really<00:05:34.430> good<00:05:34.700> balance<00:05:34.910> of<00:05:35.300> features

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
offer a really good balance of features

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.500 
offer a really good balance of features
functionality<00:05:36.680> comfort<00:05:37.640> and<00:05:37.880> sound<00:05:38.240> quality

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
functionality comfort and sound quality

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.620 
functionality comfort and sound quality
now<00:05:39.500> here's<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:40.040> kicker<00:05:40.280> when<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:40.850> found<00:05:41.360> these

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
now here's the kicker when I found these

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.440 
now here's the kicker when I found these
it<00:05:41.990> was<00:05:42.140> a<00:05:42.170> bit<00:05:42.350> of<00:05:42.440> an<00:05:42.560> impulse<00:05:43.040> buy<00:05:43.430> because<00:05:44.420> I

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
it was a bit of an impulse buy because I

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.170 
it was a bit of an impulse buy because I
saw<00:05:44.780> them<00:05:45.020> at<00:05:45.200> my<00:05:45.350> local<00:05:45.770> Costco<00:05:46.280> on<00:05:46.640> sale<00:05:46.970> for

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
saw them at my local Costco on sale for

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.050 
saw them at my local Costco on sale for
only<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.450> hundred<00:05:47.540> and<00:05:47.990> fifty<00:05:48.380> bucks<00:05:48.640> that<00:05:49.640> is

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
only a hundred and fifty bucks that is

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.080 
only a hundred and fifty bucks that is
excellent<00:05:50.810> value<00:05:51.230> and<00:05:51.770> if<00:05:52.310> you're<00:05:52.820> looking

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
excellent value and if you're looking

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.659 
excellent value and if you're looking
for<00:05:53.450> headphones<00:05:53.960> like<00:05:54.260> these<00:05:54.530> I<00:05:54.830> don't<00:05:55.460> think

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
for headphones like these I don't think
