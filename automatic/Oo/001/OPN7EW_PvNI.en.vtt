 alessandro leonora my left and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.910
 silvio san giorgio and my right are 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.130
 the authors of moments a collection of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.099
 poems and paintings for the publishing house 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.690
 twenty six letters edizioni alessandro 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.900
 he is inspired by these poems 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.900
 this collection of poems in a way 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 particular 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.210
 because together with silvio 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.720
 we are writing a story that I am 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.050
 about 23 years that we don't understand 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.300
 because it's always something wrong 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.160
 then we collected the poems that 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.470
 where we send regularly when one 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.760
 he writes and we thought we would do 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:52.900
 this little volume just to have us 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.690
 something something of our together and 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.070
 as a wish to publish soon 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:03.479
 this is this story that binds us further 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:09.130
 that as relatives with the return the uncle 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:15.790
 also as friendship because between us there is 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:19.620
 a deep relationship and then there is 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.110
 was also another reason that 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.509
 remembering a game we played with a 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.829
 friend who unfortunately left us where 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.189
 we wrote a line that each for 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.189
 during adolescence it is like a 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:43.119
 game we tried silvio 1 a 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.670
 respond to the other with con delle 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.240
 poems that have drawn the same 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.149
 topic 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.609
 in fact there are also some that carry 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.969
 even the same title, however, are i 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:58.149
 our different different points of view 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:02.409
 as a generation and different as a way of 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.420
 think this the genesis of this book 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.890
 silvio sangiorgi also the author of the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.470
 paintings that are inside this one 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.360
 collection of poems as he thought of 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.220
 realize the paintings with respect to the poems 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.960
 the paintings are almost all born before 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.340
 of the poems 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.190
 my intent for a long time is always 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.290
 that of state of state to merge the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.490
 the poems squared with poems 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.740
 finally the same and therefore one are from 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.780
 compendium to the other 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:41.430
 yes the choice of these determined 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.340
 paintings are was a choice of 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.010
 therefore the subject has poetry 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.670
 made sure we chose that 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.500
 given framework as the subject 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.810
 in the subject in that case it contained 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.250
 the exact content of the poem then i 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.590
 paintings that have been chosen 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.690
 motivations is this silvio here
