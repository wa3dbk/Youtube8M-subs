we're<00:00:14.370> talking<00:00:14.549> about<00:00:15.170> HACCP<00:00:16.170> planning<00:00:16.949> which

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
we're talking about HACCP planning which

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.620 
we're talking about HACCP planning which
is<00:00:17.940> which<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.270> big<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> news<00:00:19.199> right<00:00:19.770> now

is which is big in the news right now

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.830 
is which is big in the news right now
you<00:00:21.630> know<00:00:21.720> obvious<00:00:22.590> question<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.840> HACCP

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
you know obvious question what is HACCP

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.720 
you know obvious question what is HACCP
planning<00:00:25.470> well<00:00:26.310> Steve<00:00:27.230> HACCP<00:00:28.519> planning<00:00:29.519> is

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
planning well Steve HACCP planning is

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
planning well Steve HACCP planning is
it's<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.929> principle<00:00:31.380> behind<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.009> new

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it's the principle behind the new

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.299 
it's the principle behind the new
proposed<00:00:33.149> standard<00:00:33.809> 188<00:00:34.380> Legionella

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
proposed standard 188 Legionella

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
proposed standard 188 Legionella
standard<00:00:35.670> 188<00:00:36.149> okay<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.730> basically<00:00:39.379> it

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
standard 188 okay so and basically it

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.990 
standard 188 okay so and basically it
stands<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:40.920> hazard<00:00:41.250> analysis<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.940> critical

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
stands for hazard analysis and critical

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.660 
stands for hazard analysis and critical
control<00:00:42.540> point<00:00:42.840> okay<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.219> nationally

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
control point okay it's a nationally

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.470 
control point okay it's a nationally
recognized<00:00:45.270> process<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.260> has<00:00:46.710> been<00:00:46.920> used

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
recognized process that has been used

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.990 
recognized process that has been used
for<00:00:48.480> years<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> food<00:00:49.140> industry<00:00:49.700> it<00:00:50.700> just

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
for years in the food industry it just

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.529 
for years in the food industry it just
helps<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.390> recognize<00:00:51.870> hazards<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.539> develop

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
helps you recognize hazards and develop

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.260 
helps you recognize hazards and develop
a<00:00:54.629> maintenance<00:00:55.020> program<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.239> validate<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
a maintenance program and validate that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
a maintenance program and validate that
that<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.469> these<00:00:58.680> things<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:59.160> being

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that that these things are being

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.119 
that that these things are being
implemented<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> new<00:01:01.440> ASHRAE

possibly that the ASHRAE standard will

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.179 
possibly that the ASHRAE standard will
be<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:17.610> effect<00:01:17.790> correct<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:19.470> important<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
be in effect correct it's important to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.649 
be in effect correct it's important to
have<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.500> HACCP<00:01:22.500> plan<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.460> right<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
have that HACCP plan and right it is it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
have that HACCP plan and right it is it
is<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.500> something<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.250> important<00:01:26.790> for

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
is it's something it's important for

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.460 
is it's something it's important for
building<00:01:27.090> owners<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> start<00:01:27.960> thinking<00:01:28.229> about

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
building owners to start thinking about

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
building owners to start thinking about
building<00:01:28.979> owners<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> healthcare

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
fountains anything of that nature I'm

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.340 
fountains anything of that nature I'm
it's<00:01:45.270> important<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:45.840> them<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> start

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's important for them to start

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.460 
it's important for them to start
thinking<00:01:46.590> about<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
thinking about this and

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.800 
thinking about this and
the<00:01:49.470> first<00:01:49.710> step<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.780> designate<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the first step would be to designate a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.440 
the first step would be to designate a
water<00:01:52.079> management<00:01:52.470> team<00:01:52.829> okay<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.270> that's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
water management team okay so that's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
water management team okay so that's
something<00:01:54.720> they<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.530> started

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
something they can kind of get started

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.380 
something they can kind of get started
with<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.000> who<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.470> your<00:01:58.500> plan<00:01:59.390> who

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
with and and who as you do your plan who

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.770 
with and and who as you do your plan who
should<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.810> involved<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.560> what's<00:02:01.830> involved

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
should be involved in what's involved

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.170 
should be involved in what's involved
well<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> first<00:02:03.960> step<00:02:04.289> would<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:06.000> I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
well the first step would be to as I

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.820 
well the first step would be to as I
said<00:02:06.240> designate<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> water<00:02:07.229> management<00:02:07.530> team

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
said designate a water management team

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.229 
said designate a water management team
right<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.630> couple<00:02:10.050> people<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:12.090> would<00:02:12.209> be

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
right so a couple people that would be

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.640 
right so a couple people that would be
important<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> part<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.440> team

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
important to be a part of that team

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.309 
important to be a part of that team
would<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.069> someone<00:02:14.630> someone<00:02:15.630> who<00:02:15.750> understands

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
would be someone someone who understands

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.490 
would be someone someone who understands
the<00:02:16.500> HACCP<00:02:16.910> principles<00:02:17.910> okay<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.630> somebody

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
the HACCP principles okay and somebody

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.460 
the HACCP principles okay and somebody
that<00:02:20.660> somebody<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.840> understands<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that somebody that understands the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.250 
that somebody that understands the
building<00:02:22.769> water<00:02:22.950> system<00:02:23.430> because<00:02:24.330> what's
