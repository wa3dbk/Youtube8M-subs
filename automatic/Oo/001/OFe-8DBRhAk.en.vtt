00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
pentode and triode modes pentode you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.270 
pentode and triode modes pentode you
have<00:01:11.270> more<00:01:11.480> elements<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:13.010> tubes

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
have more elements in the the tubes

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.300 
have more elements in the the tubes
working<00:01:13.820> than<00:01:14.090> in<00:01:14.300> triode<00:01:15.050> mode<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:16.160> get<00:01:16.280> a

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
working than in triode mode so you get a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.550 
working than in triode mode so you get a
little<00:01:16.430> bit<00:01:16.640> more<00:01:16.790> volume<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.110> tone<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.380> a

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
little bit more volume and the tone is a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.450 
little bit more volume and the tone is a
little<00:01:18.650> different<00:01:19.690> as<00:01:20.690> well<00:01:20.960> I'll<00:01:21.920> be<00:01:22.190> using

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
little different as well I'll be using

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.490

the<00:03:51.700> way<00:03:53.520> this<00:03:54.520> is<00:03:54.670> more<00:03:54.910> like<00:03:55.090> an<00:03:55.240> old<00:03:55.770> amp<00:03:56.770> egg

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130

in my toe knobs

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.000 
in my toe knobs
I<00:04:17.709> have<00:04:18.220> them<00:04:19.140> unlike<00:04:20.140> most<00:04:20.350> guitarists<00:04:20.950> I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
I have them unlike most guitarists I

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.700 
I have them unlike most guitarists I
don't<00:04:21.190> have<00:04:21.400> them<00:04:21.870> set<00:04:22.870> all<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.170> way<00:04:23.200> up<00:04:23.470> at

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
don't have them set all the way up at

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.640 
don't have them set all the way up at
ten<00:04:23.980> I've<00:04:24.490> got<00:04:24.760> them<00:04:24.940> set<00:04:25.180> down<00:04:25.360> at<00:04:25.600> about<00:04:25.690> six

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
ten I've got them set down at about six

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.280 
ten I've got them set down at about six
and<00:04:26.920> a<00:04:26.950> half<00:04:26.980> or<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:27.670> so<00:04:28.300> I've<00:04:28.420> rolled<00:04:28.660> off<00:04:28.930> some

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
and a half or so so I've rolled off some

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.060 
and a half or so so I've rolled off some
of<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:30.360> frequency<00:04:31.360> response<00:04:31.480> on<00:04:32.380> my<00:04:32.590> pickups

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
of the frequency response on my pickups

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.240 
of the frequency response on my pickups
you<00:04:33.340> know<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.750> think<00:04:34.930> this<00:04:35.260> amp<00:04:35.590> works<00:04:35.830> best

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
you know I think this amp works best

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.810 
you know I think this amp works best
when<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:36.940> do<00:04:37.120> that<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:39.250> it's<00:04:39.430> kind<00:04:39.550> of<00:04:39.670> nice

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
when you do that and it's kind of nice

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.580 
when you do that and it's kind of nice
it's<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.240> good<00:04:40.270> idea<00:04:40.540> really<00:04:41.050> because<00:04:41.290> this<00:04:41.410> way

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
it's a good idea really because this way

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.820 
it's a good idea really because this way
you've<00:04:41.740> got<00:04:41.950> you've<00:04:42.580> got<00:04:42.790> some<00:04:43.620> Headroom<00:04:44.620> in

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
you've got you've got some Headroom in

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.160 
you've got you've got some Headroom in
terms<00:04:45.100> of<00:04:45.400> when<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.300> need<00:04:46.510> more<00:04:46.780> bite<00:04:47.140> and

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
terms of when you need more bite and

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.700 
terms of when you need more bite and
trouble<00:04:47.800> there's<00:04:48.160> somewhere<00:04:48.490> else<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.880> go

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
trouble there's somewhere else to go

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.940 
trouble there's somewhere else to go
beyond<00:04:50.710> ten<00:04:51.870> it's<00:04:52.870> not<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.080> spinal<00:04:53.440> tap<00:04:53.590> guitar

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950

beyond ten it's not a spinal tap guitar
what<00:04:54.130> can<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.310> say<00:04:54.520> now<00:04:55.230> as<00:04:56.230> far<00:04:56.470> as<00:04:56.530> gain<00:04:57.430> levels

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
what can I say now as far as gain levels

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.710 
what can I say now as far as gain levels
go<00:04:59.010> you<00:05:00.010> can<00:05:00.160> get<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.340> good<00:05:00.970> deal<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.210> gain<00:05:01.540> out

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
go you can get a good deal of gain out

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.720 
go you can get a good deal of gain out
of<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:01.930> amp<00:05:02.140> right<00:05:02.440> now<00:05:02.590> my<00:05:02.950> blind<00:05:03.310> knobs<00:05:03.550> are

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730

of the amp right now my blind knobs are
on<00:05:03.820> seven<00:05:06.060> really<00:05:07.060> nice<00:05:07.240> clean<00:05:07.540> sound<00:05:09.360> but<00:05:10.360> if

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
on seven really nice clean sound but if
