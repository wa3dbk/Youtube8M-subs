we've all got our own ways of hooking a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.460 
we've all got our own ways of hooking a
worm<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.279> for<00:00:20.060> years<00:00:20.539> I<00:00:20.720> used<00:00:21.080> to<00:00:21.170> work<00:00:21.259> my

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
worm and for years I used to work my

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.890 
worm and for years I used to work my
worm<00:00:21.770> in<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.460> middle<00:00:22.759> or<00:00:22.939> thread<00:00:23.599> it<00:00:23.720> around

worm in the middle or thread it around
the<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.680> bend<00:00:24.919> of<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.099> hook<00:00:25.189> but<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.210> be

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
the the bend of the hook but to be

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.720 
the the bend of the hook but to be
honest<00:00:26.599> it<00:00:26.750> was<00:00:26.840> about<00:00:27.189> probably<00:00:28.189> seven<00:00:28.669> or

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
honest it was about probably seven or

honest it was about probably seven or
eight<00:00:28.820> years<00:00:29.119> ago<00:00:29.360> when<00:00:29.660> I<00:00:29.720> first<00:00:30.560> fished<00:00:30.919> with

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
eight years ago when I first fished with

eight years ago when I first fished with
Martin<00:00:31.519> bola<00:00:31.839> on<00:00:32.839> a<00:00:32.900> stretch<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.410> river

Martin bola on a stretch of the river
ooze<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.370> Martin<00:00:35.120> said<00:00:35.360> this<00:00:35.540> is<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.839> way<00:00:35.960> I

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
ooze and Martin said this is the way I

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.140 
ooze and Martin said this is the way I
hook<00:00:36.290> it<00:00:36.470> because<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:37.220> was<00:00:37.519> having<00:00:37.610> problems

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
hook it because I was having problems

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.780 
hook it because I was having problems
with<00:00:38.269> big<00:00:38.660> pull<00:00:38.930> rounds<00:00:39.470> in<00:00:39.589> not<00:00:40.160> hooking<00:00:40.550> big

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
with big pull rounds in not hooking big

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.430 
with big pull rounds in not hooking big
perch<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.720> problem<00:00:42.079> was<00:00:42.170> they<00:00:42.379> were

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
perch and the problem was they were

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.780 
perch and the problem was they were
picking<00:00:42.739> up<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.129> length<00:00:43.370> of<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.610> worm

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
picking up the length of the worm

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.210 
picking up the length of the worm
instead<00:00:44.659> of<00:00:44.780> picking<00:00:44.960> up<00:00:45.230> sucking<00:00:45.739> it<00:00:45.949> in<00:00:46.070> with

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
instead of picking up sucking it in with

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.670 
instead of picking up sucking it in with
a<00:00:46.250> hook<00:00:46.489> in<00:00:46.699> and<00:00:46.909> Martin<00:00:47.719> said<00:00:47.930> try<00:00:48.199> this<00:00:48.260> and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
a hook in and Martin said try this and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.020 
a hook in and Martin said try this and
I'll<00:00:48.860> tell<00:00:49.010> you<00:00:49.070> something<00:00:49.370> now<00:00:49.399> I<00:00:49.640> wouldn't

you're trying to achieve with the worm

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.330 
you're trying to achieve with the worm
is<00:01:04.190> if<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:04.610> can<00:01:04.820> get<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.089> juices<00:01:05.690> on<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:07.100> hook

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
is if you can get the juices on the hook

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.820 
is if you can get the juices on the hook
where<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.390> hook<00:01:08.539> in<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.840> that's<00:01:09.380> where<00:01:09.679> the

where you hook in it that's where the
perch<00:01:10.070> will<00:01:10.369> tend<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.850> attack<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.420> worm<00:01:11.600> now

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
perch will tend to attack the worm now

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.359
