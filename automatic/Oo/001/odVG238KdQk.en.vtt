00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.210 
I do do it with silk milk and that has
protein<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:58.500> I'm<00:04:58.650> gonna<00:04:58.770> try<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.040> lower

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
protein in it so I'm gonna try a lower

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.850 
protein in it so I'm gonna try a lower
dosage<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:01.640> protein<00:05:02.640> powder<00:05:02.910> um<00:05:03.420> oh<00:05:04.320> yeah
