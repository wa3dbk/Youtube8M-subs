00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
here to make the quarry box I've

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.819 
here to make the quarry box I've
forgotten<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.899> called<00:00:34.110> Hill<00:00:34.380> will

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
forgotten what it's called Hill will

we'll<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.820> second<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.050> take<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
we'll know in a second so you take a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.690 
we'll know in a second so you take a
crafting<00:00:38.129> table<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:40.739> need<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.340> do

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
crafting table and you need to just do

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.290 
crafting table and you need to just do
this<00:00:42.000> recipe<00:00:42.829> now<00:00:43.829> I'm<00:00:44.280> pretty<00:00:44.579> sure<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.120> can

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
work out where to get this star there

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
work out where to get this star there
will<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.210> links<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> description<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> way

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
okay so this is called pop quarry just a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.939 
okay so this is called pop quarry just a
quarry<00:01:02.010> okay<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> what<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.470> need<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.830> is

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
quarry okay so what you need to do is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.429 
quarry okay so what you need to do is
just<00:01:05.070> plop<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.460> down<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:06.960> pretty<00:01:07.229> open

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
just plop this down this is pretty open

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.789 
just plop this down this is pretty open
sort<00:01:07.979> right<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.229> as<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
sort right here and as you can see it

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250 
sort right here and as you can see it
marks<00:01:11.100> our<00:01:11.250> area<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> area<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
marks our area now this is the area that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.179 
marks our area now this is the area that
it's<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> mine<00:01:14.640> down<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.119> bedrock<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
it's going to mine down to bedrock and

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.679 
it's going to mine down to bedrock and
once<00:01:17.189> hits<00:01:17.400> bedrock<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.909> stops<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
once hits bedrock it stops and if it

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
once hits bedrock it stops and if it
hits<00:01:18.810> lava<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.380> stops<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.799> well<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.430> will<00:01:20.520> mine

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
hits lava it stops as well it will mine

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.539 
hits lava it stops as well it will mine
around<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.460> be

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
around it so this is what it will be

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.120 
around it so this is what it will be
digging<00:01:23.850> down<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:25.259> won't<00:01:25.470> dig<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.860> bill

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
digging down from it won't dig this bill

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.499 
digging down from it won't dig this bill
dig<00:01:26.549> these<00:01:26.939> bits<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:28.400> all<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
dig these bits here all the way down to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.499 
dig these bits here all the way down to
bedrock<00:01:30.680> okay<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.090> frame

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
bedrock okay so now we have this frame

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.999 
bedrock okay so now we have this frame
we<00:01:33.960> now<00:01:34.110> need<00:01:34.380> power

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
we now need power

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.210 
we now need power
so<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> need<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.829> two

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
so what you need to go and do is get two

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.060 
so what you need to go and do is get two
redstone<00:01:38.520> repeaters<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.630> registan<00:01:40.409> dust<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
redstone repeaters and registan dust and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
redstone repeaters and registan dust and
a<00:01:41.130> redstone<00:01:41.460> torch<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.320> what<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.439> going

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
a redstone torch and what you're going

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.410 
a redstone torch and what you're going
to<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:43.890> these<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.579> you're<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
to do with these is you're going to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810 
to do with these is you're going to
create<00:01:45.659> an<00:01:45.960> infinite<00:01:46.619> loop<00:01:46.950> which<00:01:47.399> helps

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
create an infinite loop which helps

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.649 
create an infinite loop which helps
powers<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.810> most<00:01:49.610> efficient<00:01:50.610> way<00:01:50.670> I'd

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
powers it is the most efficient way I'd

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.340 
powers it is the most efficient way I'd
say<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.380> doing<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
say of doing it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.740 
say of doing it
oops<00:01:56.320> okay<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.590> should<00:01:57.860> be<00:01:57.920> enough<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.750> two

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
oops okay that should be enough and two

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.539 
oops okay that should be enough and two
repeaters<00:02:01.270> okay<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.890> let's<00:02:03.890> have<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.220> coming

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
repeaters okay so let's have that coming

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.699 
repeaters okay so let's have that coming
off<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.700> here<00:02:05.030> uh<00:02:06.520> hang<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.610> let<00:02:07.759> me<00:02:07.790> just<00:02:08.709> think

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
off of here uh hang on let me just think

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.130 
off of here uh hang on let me just think
about<00:02:09.860> oh<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.399> always<00:02:10.640> stays<00:02:10.940> six<00:02:11.270> okay<00:02:11.959> yeah

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
about oh it always stays six okay yeah

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.430 
about oh it always stays six okay yeah
I'm<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.410> creative<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.520> know<00:02:14.110> whatever<00:02:15.110> I

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
I'm on creative so you know whatever I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.070 
I'm on creative so you know whatever I
you<00:02:15.980> can<00:02:16.220> make<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.520> small<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:17.180> it's<00:02:17.600> just

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you can make it small in this it's just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.760 
you can make it small in this it's just
a<00:02:18.230> demonstration<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:21.170> we<00:02:21.319> have<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
a demonstration right so we have the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.680 
a demonstration right so we have the
loop<00:02:22.010> now<00:02:22.610> what<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:22.880> need<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.330> activate

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
loop now what we need to do is activate

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.229 
loop now what we need to do is activate
the<00:02:23.930> loop<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.350> should<00:02:24.860> people<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:26.060> know<00:02:26.209> a

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
the loop you should people that know a

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.120 
the loop you should people that know a
bit<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.690> redstone<00:02:26.900> should<00:02:27.350> know<00:02:27.709> how<00:02:27.980> this

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
bit of redstone should know how this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.420 
bit of redstone should know how this
works<00:02:28.900> alright<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.050> we're<00:02:30.170> back<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.620> I've<00:02:31.370> got

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
works alright so we're back and I've got

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.729 
works alright so we're back and I've got
the<00:02:31.790> infinite<00:02:32.060> loop<00:02:32.209> working<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:32.810> here<00:02:33.530> you

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
the infinite loop working and here you

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.030 
the infinite loop working and here you
can<00:02:33.890> see<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.400> construction<00:02:34.730> pipes<00:02:35.500> now<00:02:36.500> I

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
can see the construction pipes now I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.640 
can see the construction pipes now I
will<00:02:38.030> fast<00:02:38.300> forward<00:02:38.569> this<00:02:38.840> because<00:02:39.170> it's<00:02:39.350> it's

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
will fast forward this because it's it's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.610 
will fast forward this because it's it's
pretty<00:02:40.040> much<00:02:40.400> what<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.450> would<00:02:41.480> expect<00:02:41.620> you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
pretty much what you would expect you

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.860 
pretty much what you would expect you
just<00:02:42.860> have<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.190> wait<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.459> all<00:02:43.850> T<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.450> go<00:02:44.600> around

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
just have to wait for all T to go around

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.729 
just have to wait for all T to go around
so<00:02:46.090> let's<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.510> wait<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:50.260> alright<00:02:51.260> okay

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
so let's just wait for that alright okay

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.650 
so let's just wait for that alright okay
so<00:02:51.769> now<00:02:52.549> we've<00:02:52.760> just<00:02:52.940> got<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.360> end<00:02:53.480> and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
so now we've just got to the end and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.140 
so now we've just got to the end and
it's<00:02:53.780> going<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.959> start<00:02:54.230> digging<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.700> second

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
it's going to start digging in a second

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.509 
it's going to start digging in a second
now<00:02:56.840> what<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.319> will<00:02:57.380> do<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:58.040> will<00:02:58.100> do<00:02:58.280> one

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
now what this will do is it will do one

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.910 
now what this will do is it will do one
block<00:02:58.790> at<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.000> time<00:02:59.410> and<00:03:00.410> then<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.829> will

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
block at a time and then it will

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.949 
block at a time and then it will
continue<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.489> zigzag<00:03:01.790> all<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.810> way<00:03:02.900> to

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
continue in a zigzag all the way to

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.289 
continue in a zigzag all the way to
there<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.920> will<00:03:03.980> go<00:03:04.160> down<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> zigzag<00:03:04.970> on<00:03:05.120> that

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
there it will go down a zigzag on that

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.009 
there it will go down a zigzag on that
side<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:06.010> now<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.100> should<00:03:07.280> begin<00:03:07.780> yeah<00:03:08.810> and

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
side and now it should begin yeah and

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.229 
side and now it should begin yeah and
now<00:03:09.170> here<00:03:09.440> we<00:03:09.470> go<00:03:09.560> we<00:03:10.220> can<00:03:10.459> go<00:03:10.670> ahead<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.120> watch

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
now here we go we can go ahead and watch

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:11.560 
now here we go we can go ahead and watch
it

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
it

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.849 
it
it<00:03:12.350> will<00:03:12.470> find<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.859> highest<00:03:13.130> block<00:03:13.609> first<00:03:14.859> as

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
it will find the highest block first as

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.170 
it will find the highest block first as
you<00:03:16.130> can<00:03:16.280> see<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.209> will<00:03:17.329> just<00:03:17.540> line<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:19.180> and

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
you can see and it will just line it and

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.229 
you can see and it will just line it and
as<00:03:20.299> you<00:03:20.450> can<00:03:20.570> see<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:21.109> just<00:03:21.590> pops<00:03:21.950> out<00:03:22.250> now<00:03:22.730> what

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
as you can see it just pops out now what

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.060 
as you can see it just pops out now what
we<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.570> do<00:03:23.780> here<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.410> we<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.370> add<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:26.329> pipe<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
we can do here is we can add a pipe and

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.509 
we can do here is we can add a pipe and
this<00:03:28.070> pipe<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:29.150> then<00:03:29.299> feed<00:03:29.600> into<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.959> chest<00:03:30.519> and

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
this pipe can then feed into a chest and

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.550 
this pipe can then feed into a chest and
then<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:31.910> chest<00:03:32.209> can<00:03:32.390> just<00:03:32.600> hold<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.989> all<00:03:33.170> so

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
then this chest can just hold it all so

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.960 
then this chest can just hold it all so
don't<00:03:33.890> worry<00:03:34.100> about<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.370> we'll<00:03:34.609> come<00:03:34.820> back

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
don't worry about that we'll come back

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.030 
don't worry about that we'll come back
to<00:03:35.060> that<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.810> what<00:03:36.109> we<00:03:36.170> need<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:36.410> do<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.920> make

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
to that so what we need to do to make

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.300 
to that so what we need to do to make
some<00:03:37.250> pipe<00:03:37.579> is<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:39.140> make<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.290> golden<00:03:39.739> pipe<00:03:40.010> which

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
some pipe is to make a golden pipe which

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.270 
some pipe is to make a golden pipe which
have<00:03:40.489> speed<00:03:40.760> up<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.000> process<00:03:41.480> we<00:03:42.380> need<00:03:42.829> two

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
have speed up the process we need two

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.809 
have speed up the process we need two
ingots

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
ingots

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.830 
ingots
and<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:47.019> piece<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.530> glass<00:03:48.359> now<00:03:49.359> this<00:03:49.569> will<00:03:49.719> make

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
and a piece of glass now this will make

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.720 
and a piece of glass now this will make
eight

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
eight

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.869 
eight
this<00:03:51.730> will<00:03:51.909> make<00:03:52.030> eight<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:54.760> pipes<00:03:56.879> like

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
this will make eight like pipes like

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.190 
this will make eight like pipes like
that<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.859> what<00:03:59.859> we<00:03:59.950> need<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.189> transport<00:04:01.200> we

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
that and what we need to transport we

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.920 
that and what we need to transport we
all<00:04:02.319> need<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.530> have<00:04:02.739> weight<00:04:03.040> on<00:04:03.219> them<00:04:03.810> we<00:04:04.810> only

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
all need to have weight on them we only

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.849 
all need to have weight on them we only
need<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.829> have<00:04:06.040> one<00:04:06.099> golden<00:04:06.849> pipe<00:04:07.060> to

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
need to have one golden pipe to

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.209 
need to have one golden pipe to
accelerate<00:04:08.859> it<00:04:09.010> through<00:04:09.159> a<00:04:09.219> pipe<00:04:09.459> system<00:04:09.760> so

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:11.219 
accelerate it through a pipe system so

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.979 
accelerate it through a pipe system so
we<00:04:12.219> need<00:04:12.519> another<00:04:12.879> piece<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.120> glass<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.930> we

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
we need another piece of glass and we

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.400 
we need another piece of glass and we
need<00:04:14.579> some<00:04:15.579> cobblestone<00:04:16.090> this<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.199> going<00:04:17.349> to

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
need some cobblestone this is going to

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.560 
need some cobblestone this is going to
make<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.530> cobblestone<00:04:18.039> pipe<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.209> is<00:04:19.299> just<00:04:19.509> a
