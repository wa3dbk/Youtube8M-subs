00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
you'll go you tit on get a bugle I don't

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.620 
you'll go you tit on get a bugle I don't
think<00:00:15.010> so<00:00:15.160> no<00:00:15.370> timeout<00:00:15.850> eight<00:00:16.090> seconds<00:00:16.510> left

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
think so no timeout eight seconds left

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.970 
think so no timeout eight seconds left
on<00:00:16.780> the<00:00:16.900> clock<00:00:17.110> they<00:00:17.260> would<00:00:17.380> had<00:00:17.530> to<00:00:17.650> get<00:00:17.830> up

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
on the clock they would had to get up

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.130 
on the clock they would had to get up
and<00:00:18.160> right<00:00:19.030> away<00:00:19.210> they<00:00:19.570> couldn't<00:00:19.870> spike

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
and right away they couldn't spike

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.440 
and right away they couldn't spike
football<00:00:20.800> because<00:00:21.430> it's<00:00:21.640> just<00:00:21.880> about<00:00:22.090> short

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
football because it's just about short

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.519 
football because it's just about short
of<00:00:22.540> the<00:00:22.600> first<00:00:22.810> down<00:00:22.900> now

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
of the first down now

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.620 
of the first down now
it<00:00:24.520> would<00:00:24.760> have<00:00:24.820> been<00:00:24.940> short<00:00:25.240> of<00:00:25.330> the<00:00:25.390> first

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
it would have been short of the first

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.080 
it would have been short of the first
down<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.740> they<00:00:26.860> would<00:00:27.070> have<00:00:27.130> had<00:00:27.189> to<00:00:27.400> spike<00:00:27.880> the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
down so they would have had to spike the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.410 
down so they would have had to spike the
football<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:29.700> they<00:00:30.700> couldn't<00:00:31.060> because<00:00:31.270> it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
football and they couldn't because it

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.210 
football and they couldn't because it
would<00:00:31.570> have<00:00:31.630> been<00:00:31.690> fourth<00:00:32.020> down<00:00:32.320> they<00:00:32.620> spiked

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
would have been fourth down they spiked

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.540 
would have been fourth down they spiked
it<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.960> get<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.320> pump<00:00:35.620> up<00:00:35.770> front<00:00:36.010> down<00:00:36.190> they

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
it they get the pump up front down they

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.890 
it they get the pump up front down they
would<00:00:36.670> have<00:00:36.760> had<00:00:36.820> to<00:00:36.879> run<00:00:37.239> their<00:00:37.420> field<00:00:37.720> goal

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
would have had to run their field goal

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.860 
would have had to run their field goal
team<00:00:38.080> onto<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:38.590> field<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:39.730> trying<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.449> hurried

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
team onto the field and trying a hurried

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.740 
team onto the field and trying a hurried
attempt<00:00:41.350> which<00:00:41.830> teams<00:00:42.129> practice<00:00:42.760> but<00:00:43.629> you

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
attempt which teams practice but you

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.399 
attempt which teams practice but you
practice<00:00:44.199> it<00:00:44.320> was<00:00:44.440> like<00:00:44.589> 12<00:00:44.949> 15<00:00:45.519> seconds<00:00:46.409> not

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
practice it was like 12 15 seconds not

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.680 
practice it was like 12 15 seconds not
eight<00:00:49.080> that<00:00:50.080> would<00:00:50.229> have<00:00:50.320> been<00:00:50.409> impossible<00:00:51.690> so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
eight that would have been impossible so

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.420 
eight that would have been impossible so
it<00:00:52.750> was<00:00:52.839> a<00:00:52.870> desperation<00:00:53.409> play<00:00:53.800> that<00:00:54.010> went<00:00:54.159> awry

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
it was a desperation play that went awry

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.640 
it was a desperation play that went awry
for<00:00:54.460> Houston<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.210> begin<00:00:55.479> with<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.470> ended

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
for Houston to begin with and it ended

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.369 
for Houston to begin with and it ended
in<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:56.890> turnover<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:58.269> David<00:00:58.629> Gerard<00:00:58.750> comes<00:00:59.229> to

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
in the turnover so David Gerard comes to

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.049 
in the turnover so David Gerard comes to
