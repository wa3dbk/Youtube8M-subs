I don't trust companies you just never
know<00:00:55.070> they<00:00:55.280> might<00:00:55.430> contain<00:00:55.760> microchips<00:00:56.480> I

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
know they might contain microchips I

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.069 
know they might contain microchips I
made<00:00:57.320> about<00:00:58.270> well<00:00:59.270> if<00:00:59.390> you<00:00:59.480> don't<00:00:59.660> count<00:00:59.809> the

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
made about well if you don't count the

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.139 
made about well if you don't count the
short<00:01:00.379> 30-second<00:01:01.160> ones<00:01:01.370> because<00:01:01.609> I<00:01:01.730> did<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> lot

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
short 30-second ones because I did a lot

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.520 
short 30-second ones because I did a lot
of<00:01:02.180> series<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:02.899> public<00:01:03.199> service

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
of series of public service

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.730 
of series of public service
announcements<00:01:03.770> that<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.670> did<00:01:04.850> about<00:01:05.740> seven

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740

films

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
films

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.330 
films
I<00:01:07.880> guess<00:01:08.090> them<00:01:08.510> I<00:01:08.750> think<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.320> maybe<00:01:10.130> my

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
I guess them I think this is maybe my

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.270 
I guess them I think this is maybe my
seventh<00:01:10.760> film<00:01:11.000> here<00:01:11.450> of<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.840> short<00:01:12.350> theatrical

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
seventh film here of a short theatrical

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.700 
seventh film here of a short theatrical
short<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.670> I've<00:01:13.790> done<00:01:13.970> quite<00:01:14.270> a<00:01:15.229> lot<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.560> it's

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
short and I've done quite a lot and it's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.179 
short and I've done quite a lot and it's
so<00:01:15.799> really<00:01:16.100> over<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.400> past<00:01:16.900> several<00:01:17.900> decades

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
so really over the past several decades

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.550 
so really over the past several decades
so<00:01:19.189> I<00:01:19.549> haven't<00:01:19.850> always<00:01:20.119> been<00:01:20.270> working<00:01:21.229> here

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
so I haven't always been working here

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.240 
so I haven't always been working here
but<00:01:22.040> maybe<00:01:22.790> about<00:01:23.090> half<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.420> my<00:01:23.570> working<00:01:23.840> life

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
but maybe about half of my working life

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.340 
but maybe about half of my working life
has<00:01:25.250> been<00:01:25.430> here<00:01:25.640> now<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.299> generally<00:01:27.200> work

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
has been here now I generally work

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.260 
has been here now I generally work
exclusively<00:01:27.650> in<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.310> computer<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.240> have

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
exclusively in the computer and I have

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.810 
exclusively in the computer and I have
for<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.750> past<00:01:29.990> four<00:01:30.650> films<00:01:31.009> or<00:01:31.490> something

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
for the past four films or something

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.749 
for the past four films or something
anyways<00:01:32.119> for<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.390> past<00:01:32.630> ten<00:01:33.049> years<00:01:33.079> let's<00:01:33.590> say

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
anyways for the past ten years let's say

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.609 
anyways for the past ten years let's say
so<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:34.790> you<00:01:35.600> know<00:01:35.630> it<00:01:35.869> might<00:01:36.079> use<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.290> different

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
so I you know it might use a different

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.340 
so I you know it might use a different
program<00:01:37.100> for<00:01:37.430> different<00:01:37.820> projects<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:39.140> just

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
program for different projects it just

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.530 
program for different projects it just
allows<00:01:39.650> me<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.009> experiment<00:01:40.430> more<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.360> have

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
allows me to experiment more and have

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.389 
allows me to experiment more and have
more<00:01:41.750> flexibility<00:01:42.409> in<00:01:42.560> terms<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.070> look<00:01:43.250> of

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
more flexibility in terms of the look of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.030 
more flexibility in terms of the look of
it<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:43.790> not<00:01:44.479> be<00:01:44.689> locked<00:01:44.840> into<00:01:45.140> things<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.590> you

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
it and not be locked into things and you

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.200 
it and not be locked into things and you
know<00:01:46.159> until<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.000> very<00:01:47.030> end<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.630> film

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
know until the very end of the film

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.630 
know until the very end of the film
so<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:48.690> like<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.740> working<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.190> computer

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so I like I like working the computer

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.080 
so I like I like working the computer
and<00:01:50.820> I've<00:01:51.330> been<00:01:51.570> used<00:01:51.780> um<00:01:52.500> toon<00:01:53.310> boom<00:01:53.490> harmony

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and I've been used um toon boom harmony

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.300 
and I've been used um toon boom harmony
that<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:54.870> a<00:01:54.900> natural<00:01:55.320> progression<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that was a natural progression because I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.070 
that was a natural progression because I
originally<00:01:56.820> started<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.210> Toon<00:01:57.480> Boom<00:01:57.510> studio

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
originally started with Toon Boom studio

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.560 
originally started with Toon Boom studio
and<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.650> was<00:01:58.830> it's<00:01:59.490> not<00:01:59.760> really<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> same

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and that was it's not really the same

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.000 
and that was it's not really the same
program<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.170> all<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.500> still<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
program at all but still it's a

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.580 
program at all but still it's a
vector-based<00:02:02.340> program<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.300> like<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:04.050> but

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
vector-based program and I like that but

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.270 
vector-based program and I like that but
I<00:02:04.650> also<00:02:04.830> have<00:02:05.270> I'm<00:02:06.270> always<00:02:06.830> looking<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I also have I'm always looking to the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.570 
I also have I'm always looking to the
next<00:02:08.399> project<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.179> hope<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:10.259> use<00:02:10.470> TV<00:02:11.160> paint

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
next project and I hope to use TV paint

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.770 
next project and I hope to use TV paint
which<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.000> totally<00:02:12.510> different<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.110> which<00:02:14.780> I

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
which is totally different and which I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.770 
which is totally different and which I
think<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:17.220> some<00:02:17.430> extent<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.120> software<00:02:18.570> does

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
think to some extent the software does

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.270 
think to some extent the software does
shape<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.290> bit<00:02:19.470> what<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.920> end<00:02:20.100> up<00:02:20.660> creating

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
shape a bit what you end up creating

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.710 
shape a bit what you end up creating
just<00:02:23.280> because<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.790> what's<00:02:24.060> easy<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.570> what's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
just because of what's easy and what's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.070 
just because of what's easy and what's
natural<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.290> do<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.860> software<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.150> I'm

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
natural to do in the software and so I'm

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.229 
natural to do in the software and so I'm
TV<00:02:28.800> paint<00:02:29.070> being<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.489> different<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.910> think<00:02:30.120> it

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
TV paint being so different I think it

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.380 
TV paint being so different I think it
would<00:02:30.390> be<00:02:30.770> really<00:02:31.770> nice<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.520> used<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.880> work

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
would be really nice and I used to work

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.410 
would be really nice and I used to work
with<00:02:33.420> amigas<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.530> long<00:02:34.709> time<00:02:34.920> ago<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.459> TV<00:02:36.120> paint

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
with amigas a long time ago and TV paint

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.930 
with amigas a long time ago and TV paint
reminds<00:02:36.900> me<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.340> program<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.430> used<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
reminds me of program I used in the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.590 
reminds me of program I used in the
Amiga<00:02:39.390> which<00:02:40.310> it's<00:02:41.310> very<00:02:41.580> anyways<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.570> just

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
Amiga which it's very anyways it just

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.560 
Amiga which it's very anyways it just
seems<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.110> it's<00:02:43.470> got<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> lot<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.570> wonderful

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
seems like it's got a lot of wonderful

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.380 
seems like it's got a lot of wonderful
brushes<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.380> I'm<00:02:46.470> dying<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.190> try<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:48.000> pug

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
brushes that I'm dying to try this pug

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.009 
brushes that I'm dying to try this pug
is<00:02:48.570> made<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.959> real<00:02:49.580> pug<00:02:50.580> dog<00:02:50.940> fur<00:02:51.720> texture<00:02:52.260> and

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
is made of real pug dog fur texture and

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.350 
is made of real pug dog fur texture and
I'm<00:02:55.019> using<00:02:55.290> these<00:02:55.500> texture<00:02:56.010> films<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.760> I'm

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
I'm using these texture films and I'm

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.830 
I'm using these texture films and I'm
using<00:02:57.840> realize<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.340> this<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.660> was

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
using realize and this here this was

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.740 
using realize and this here this was
this<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.380> where<00:03:01.799> he's<00:03:01.980> doing<00:03:02.160> origami<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:03.239> need

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
this is where he's doing origami I need

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.229 
this is where he's doing origami I need
to<00:03:03.870> calm<00:03:04.080> myself<00:03:04.320> except<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:05.940> or

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
to calm myself except for that I have or

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.000 
to calm myself except for that I have or
again<00:03:06.720> that's<00:03:07.530> right

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
again that's right

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.350 
again that's right
I'm<00:03:08.400> rig<00:03:09.030> Annie<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.160> paper<00:03:11.340> sound<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:12.209> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
I'm rig Annie just the paper sound in it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.270 
I'm rig Annie just the paper sound in it
Erol<00:03:13.230> axis<00:03:13.739> me<00:03:14.239> keeps<00:03:15.239> me<00:03:15.330> focused<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
Erol axis me keeps me focused and so I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.210 
Erol axis me keeps me focused and so I
did<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.570> origami<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.290> photograph<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
did do the origami and photograph it and

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.050 
did do the origami and photograph it and
cut<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.430> out<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.540> he's<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
cut it out so he's and so the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.850 
cut it out so he's and so the
backgrounds<00:03:24.660> also<00:03:25.019> incorporates<00:03:25.680> some

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
backgrounds also incorporates some

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.360 
backgrounds also incorporates some
photographic<00:03:26.370> elements<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.870> it's<00:03:28.370> it's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
photographic elements but it's it's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.650 
photographic elements but it's it's
definitely<00:03:30.000> there's<00:03:30.180> an<00:03:30.269> outline<00:03:30.630> around

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
definitely there's an outline around

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.190 
definitely there's an outline around
everything<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.380> definitely<00:03:31.920> cartoon<00:03:32.400> drawing

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
everything is definitely cartoon drawing

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.319 
everything is definitely cartoon drawing
it's<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.350> little<00:03:34.560> bit<00:03:34.709> finicky<00:03:34.980> because<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
it's a little bit finicky because the

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.630 
it's a little bit finicky because the
texture<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.079> want<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.829> follow<00:03:38.190> the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
texture you want it to follow the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.020 
texture you want it to follow the
animation<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:40.560> found<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:41.400> first<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.730> was<00:03:41.850> very

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
animation I found at first I was very

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.449 
animation I found at first I was very
concerned<00:03:42.510> with<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.320> texture<00:03:43.799> moving<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.370> a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
concerned with the texture moving in a

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.370 
concerned with the texture moving in a
way<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.670> didn't<00:03:45.060> want<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.510> inside<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
way I didn't want to inside of the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.250 
way I didn't want to inside of the
animated<00:03:46.799> shape<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.430> then<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.170> kind<00:03:49.170> of

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
animated shape and then I kind of

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.780 
animated shape and then I kind of
relaxed<00:03:49.620> with<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> bit<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.430> although<00:03:50.579> it

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
relaxed with it a bit and although it

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.509 
relaxed with it a bit and although it
has<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.239> be<00:03:51.360> fussed<00:03:51.660> with<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.200> little<00:03:52.920> bit<00:03:53.100> it

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
has to be fussed with a little bit it

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.920 
has to be fussed with a little bit it
actually<00:03:53.820> when<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.239> just<00:03:54.510> see<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.780> whole

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
actually when you just see the whole

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.319 
actually when you just see the whole
thing<00:03:54.959> going<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.590> don't<00:03:55.799> really<00:03:56.190> stare<00:03:57.180> at

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
thing going you don't really stare at

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:57.990 
thing going you don't really stare at
that<00:03:57.510> like

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
that like

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.760 
that like
you<00:03:58.450> know<00:03:58.570> there's<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:58.840> tendency<00:03:59.290> when<00:03:59.320> you're

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
you know there's a tendency when you're

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.530 
you know there's a tendency when you're
animating<00:04:00.070> things<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.580> stare<00:04:00.910> at<00:04:01.030> little<00:04:01.270> tiny

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
animating things to stare at little tiny

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.300 
animating things to stare at little tiny
details<00:04:02.080> and<00:04:02.350> say<00:04:02.530> gee<00:04:02.740> I<00:04:02.770> don't<00:04:02.950> know<00:04:03.100> if<00:04:03.220> I

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
details and say gee I don't know if I

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.830 
details and say gee I don't know if I
like<00:04:03.490> how<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.910> little<00:04:04.120> thing<00:04:04.450> that's<00:04:04.630> going

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
like how that little thing that's going

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.030 
like how that little thing that's going
like<00:04:04.990> this<00:04:05.170> but<00:04:06.630> eventually<00:04:07.630> kind<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.410> relax

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
like this but eventually kind of relax

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.860 
like this but eventually kind of relax
and<00:04:09.310> figure<00:04:10.030> well<00:04:10.210> if<00:04:10.300> anybody's<00:04:10.690> watching

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870

that<00:04:11.350> you're<00:04:11.980> in<00:04:12.070> trouble<00:04:13.050> I<00:04:14.050> guess<00:04:14.350> is

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
that you're in trouble I guess is

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.229 
that you're in trouble I guess is
satisfying<00:04:15.070> neither<00:04:15.310> if<00:04:15.580> it<00:04:15.730> has<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.910> lot<00:04:16.209> of

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
satisfying neither if it has a lot of

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.300 
satisfying neither if it has a lot of
success<00:04:16.750> or<00:04:17.019> it's<00:04:17.200> being<00:04:17.500> used<00:04:17.799> extensively

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
success or it's being used extensively

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.700 
success or it's being used extensively
or<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:19.420> really<00:04:20.940> entertains<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.480> in<00:04:23.350> some

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
or it just really entertains and in some

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.220 
or it just really entertains and in some
way<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.100> guess<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.360> tenor<00:04:25.750> tale<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.140> Cinderella
