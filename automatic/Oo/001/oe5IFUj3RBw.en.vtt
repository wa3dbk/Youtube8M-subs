00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.230
 welcome dear friend 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.480
 Teamspeak fanatic is my name 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.420
 mathias or mad max and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.540
 Today I show you my fourth theme 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.940
 from the tutorial which yes of course 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.830
 on the sponsor boards of sport.de 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.230
 should be able to find it today 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.380
 that members may move guests so 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.130
 it's a bit more about the today 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.929
 rights within teamspeak will be there 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.030
 then juggle with the numbers 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.140
 have to 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.910
 of course, I'm going to attack again 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.860
 back to my server I also in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.280
 my film the first rockets used 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.440
 have 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.000
 I want to say that you have to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.410
 times on settings options 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 Applications that progress 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.690
 activate legal system here 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.379
 So old research applications 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 legal system 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.030
 otherwise it will not look right 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.859
 Well, now we have one here 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.329
 of course I have a few groups 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.930
 last time so decorated 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.540
 Just watch the previous tutorials 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.500
 we work with the 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.439
 member group or normal 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:17.310
 they can even rename shortly 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:20.729
 so call the same with member as close 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.119
 add to lustenau people and the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.689
 our guests should also be the guest 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.270
 you would not be so irritated 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.490
 so they are supposed to do this 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.759
 channel can pull however have 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.619
 Of course you do not feel like it when you have yours 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.869
 35 members have that the edmonds 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.930
 can therefore move through the area 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.100
 we will be limited to one goal 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.780
 limited set that only 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.060
 some people can pull 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.810
 so what we first our filter above 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.600
 write what are english words for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.630
 move and so here we have 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.799
 under the one knows the power around one 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.690
 to move clients 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.000
 we are dealing with today 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.940
 that's just like all other rights 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.200
 like the integer rights so the the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.280
 underlined 1 1 a number with a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.590
 other is compared 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.200
 and then it's checked behind this 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.340
 explain because enough rights has sounded 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.050
 is pretty complicated though 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.750
 actually we just have it 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.239
 namely the actual power this 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.790
 owns the explanatory and the power one 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.850
 needed to move the client 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.850
 and if that top number the power the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.340
 he owns higher or equal to that 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.880
 number that is needed then he can 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.890
 move this 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.780
 So what do we want to look at first 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.540
 in our edmonds they have one 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.769
 power and a stupid build of 75 can 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.819
 So they push each other though 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.880
 you do not want that corner to 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.220
 can push you as super edmond 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.420
 writes in level 74 if he does not 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.160
 now wanted each other 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.180
 can then push then made a 74 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.250
 and 75 purely that's I think quite 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.500
 logical and not difficult 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.360
 So understand ours 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.549
 members who should not have 75 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.290
 otherwise you can pull everyone but in the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:16.549
 Ultimately, a number between 73 because the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:22.769
 servers will probably have 74 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:24.900
 So now 73 and 50 say so 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.100
 we build a 250 1 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.739
 now this can be a member 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.420
 pull another member because the number pi 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:39.630
 power 50 is equal to the number of these 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.450
 So if that needs it now here 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.150
 does that work ? 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.239
 if the two members are ag 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.629
 let's write 49 rhine can 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.180
 member still a guest pull where I once 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:58.610
 25 power, however, does not need more 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.610
 a member for which you need 50 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.030
 anyway not 74 and you also have great 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.859
 75 not so easy does it 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.030
 Actually, there I have it too 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.060
 already in my first video actually 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.829
 I'm approached quite as much detail 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.090
 the same for everything else to consider 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.039
 for example kick rights you can 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.840
 adjust that the members were guests 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.180
 then you have to kick here 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.320
 actually moment you need 25 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.590
 to kick a guest 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.050
 we say 25 now can members 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.530
 guests do not kick others 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.720
 members and also no servers about 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.130
 The same can now be done for trains 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.199
 set when in here mean 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.840
 to ban clients 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.620
 then you would then have a number 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.780
 reinschreiben 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.750
 but I think it's all pretty 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.800
 self-explanatory I believe now 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.870
 I next only once again 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.400
 video about how to submit as 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.740
 right system is actually set up 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.910
 has just been said here about because ii 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.659
 for integer or b understand that same 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:07.099
 again did not happen, I did not 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:09.830
 Look out of your head for a moment 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.870
 that means exactly that 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.400
 I'll explain something about that 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.919
 so he gets the whole system a little better 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.169
 understands so I am happy as always 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.020
 about feedback if you have any 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.360
 have questions or comments or even 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:31.860
 Desired topics writes me so far on 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:32.970
 best of all et mat de I come only 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.889
 get in one day and become one 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.990
 of course also answer if you 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.970
 ask or have problems especially 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.460
 the theme comes over, I can give you that 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.639
 also like about teamviewer then for you 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.349
 set up is not an issue I think so 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.780
 I can but even as wheels 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.180
 pretty helpful to describe 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.470
 so thanks for watching 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.350
 Of course I am happy about an abo 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.889
 very much like to see you then too 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.889
 next video
