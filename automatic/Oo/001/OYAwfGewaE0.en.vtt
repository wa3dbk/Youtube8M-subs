can get past it actually guess you can't
really<00:03:22.660> quickly<00:03:23.590> Billy<00:03:23.829> get<00:03:24.010> past<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.370> um<00:03:24.640> oh

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
really quickly Billy get past that um oh

my<00:03:27.579> god<00:03:27.760> really<00:03:29.190> Chum<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.480> again<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:31.989> more

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
my god really Chum so again this is more

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.620 
my god really Chum so again this is more
thing<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.799> timing<00:03:33.310> obviously<00:03:33.489> if<00:03:34.450> you'd<00:03:34.540> all

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
thing of timing obviously if you'd all

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.479 
thing of timing obviously if you'd all
the<00:03:34.750> crap<00:03:34.959> computer<00:03:35.260> like<00:03:35.530> mine<00:03:35.739> you<00:03:36.370> should

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
the crap computer like mine you should

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.460 
the crap computer like mine you should
be<00:03:36.549> able<00:03:36.609> to<00:03:36.760> do<00:03:36.819> this<00:03:36.940> with<00:03:37.120> no<00:03:37.299> no<00:03:37.900> problem<00:03:38.260> or

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
be able to do this with no no problem or

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.800 
be able to do this with no no problem or
maybe<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:39.370> get<00:03:39.669> a<00:03:39.700> new<00:03:39.819> space<00:03:40.060> box<00:03:40.329> is<00:03:40.660> my

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
maybe I just get a new space box is my

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.259 
maybe I just get a new space box is my
space<00:03:40.989> Lord<00:03:41.639> so<00:03:42.639> this<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:42.970> more<00:03:43.150> about

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
space Lord so this is more about

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.479 
space Lord so this is more about
timing<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:44.340> think<00:03:45.340> Oh<00:03:46.200> gets<00:03:47.200> do<00:03:47.410> this<00:03:47.560> it's<00:03:48.400> a

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
timing I think Oh gets do this it's a

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.180 
timing I think Oh gets do this it's a
lot<00:03:48.639> easier<00:03:48.700> in<00:03:49.120> Minecraft<00:03:49.660> because<00:03:50.079> uh<00:03:50.190> the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
lot easier in Minecraft because uh the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.599 
lot easier in Minecraft because uh the
water<00:03:51.519> is<00:03:51.760> different<00:03:53.010> or<00:03:54.010> as<00:03:54.130> soon<00:03:54.310> as<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.519> get

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
water is different or as soon as you get

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.220 
water is different or as soon as you get
up<00:03:54.669> here<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.090> switch<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:55.989> should<00:03:56.139> go<00:03:56.200> down

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
up here you switch and it should go down

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.170 
up here you switch and it should go down
the<00:03:56.440> middle<00:03:56.620> now<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.220> well<00:03:57.760> it's<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
the middle now and well it's like the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.420 
the middle now and well it's like the
first<00:03:58.359> optical<00:03:58.810> actually<00:03:59.109> did<00:03:59.430> that's

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
first optical actually did that's

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.409 
first optical actually did that's
amazing<00:04:00.730> uh<00:04:01.720> keep<00:04:02.230> going<00:04:02.530> here<00:04:02.799> oh<00:04:02.980> god<00:04:03.849> I<00:04:04.060> did

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
amazing uh keep going here oh god I did

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.699 
amazing uh keep going here oh god I did
not<00:04:04.510> realize<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.780> was<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.019> big<00:04:05.230> good<00:04:05.380> jump

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
not realize it was that big good jump

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.659

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.439 
and is overall general idea very very
cool<00:04:31.410> okay<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.400> looks<00:04:33.460> like<00:04:33.639> a<00:04:33.729> magical<00:04:34.180> run

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
cool okay so it looks like a magical run

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.300 
cool okay so it looks like a magical run
so

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.950 

and<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:40.090> was<00:04:40.180> actually<00:04:40.360> quite<00:04:40.630> easy<00:04:41.490> okay

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
and that was actually quite easy okay

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.040 
and that was actually quite easy okay
and<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:45.280> cannot<00:04:45.580> jump<00:04:45.850> again<00:04:46.090> so<00:04:46.330> yeah<00:04:46.900> my

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
and I cannot jump again so yeah my

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.140 
and I cannot jump again so yeah my
jumping<00:04:47.380> skills<00:04:47.590> are<00:04:47.770> just<00:04:47.950> horrible<00:04:48.190> so<00:04:49.120> I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
jumping skills are just horrible so I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.560 
jumping skills are just horrible so I
can't<00:04:49.930> do<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.260> for<00:04:50.650> crap<00:04:51.010> but<00:04:51.480> hopefully<00:04:52.480> you

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.660 
can't do that for crap but hopefully you
guys<00:04:52.720> can<00:04:52.900> if<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.890> have<00:04:53.980> better<00:04:54.190> or<00:04:54.460> at<00:04:54.520> least

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
guys can if you have better or at least

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.580 
guys can if you have better or at least
a<00:04:54.850> good<00:04:55.270> computer<00:04:55.570> fair<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:56.050> me<00:04:56.170> and<00:04:56.200> there's

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
a good computer fair to me and there's

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.840 
a good computer fair to me and there's
time<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:58.210> how'd<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.360> do<00:04:58.950> go<00:04:59.950> back<00:05:00.100> up<00:05:00.250> here<00:05:00.640> and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
time so how'd I do go back up here and

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.240 
time so how'd I do go back up here and
let's<00:05:00.970> check<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.690> time<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.170> took<00:05:05.380> me<00:05:05.620> two

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
let's check the time so that took me two

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.700 
let's check the time so that took me two
minutes<00:05:06.430> three<00:05:06.850> minutes<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.870> two<00:05:08.110> seconds<00:05:08.500> I

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
minutes three minutes and two seconds I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.920 
minutes three minutes and two seconds I
guess<00:05:09.430> I<00:05:09.580> did<00:05:09.730> good<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.240> skipped<00:05:10.600> like<00:05:10.720> half

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
guess I did good I skipped like half

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.500 
guess I did good I skipped like half
obstacles<00:05:11.530> so<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.740> can't<00:05:11.950> say<00:05:12.510> yeah

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
obstacles so you can't say yeah

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.060
