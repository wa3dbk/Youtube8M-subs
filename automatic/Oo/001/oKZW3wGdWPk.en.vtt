00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.280
 My name is ZoÃ©, I'm 9, did firefighters exist among the Gauls? 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.720
 Hello Zoe! Super drawing with lots of colors! 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:22.480
 A drawing that represents a mustachioed Gaul with his princess who has a pretty pink dress 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:31.780
 and on the other side a king dressed in green and ... a wicked! A bad guy with a hat on his head 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.780
 and with wicked eyebrows! 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.260
 No, at the time of the Gauls there were no firefighters as such, we can assume 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.000
 that there were some people who were watching in the evening as for the Egyptians or the Greeks 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.210
 when a fire broke out but we did not find any trace of specialized people 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.690
 to extinguish fires as was the case with the Romans for example. 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.100
 At the time of the Romans there were, indeed, kinds of soldiers patrolling 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.320
 at night and that in addition to doing rounds to ensure safety could fight 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.720
 against fires. Not only using buckets and water, but also using 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.390
 large syringes and mechanical pumps that could extinguish 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.560
 some fires. However the houses being wooden at that time, the cities were burning 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.450
 easily and then it was not unusual to have to destroy a house eaten by 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.060
 the flames to prevent fire spreading to other homes. If the vigilantes 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.270
 were equipped with axes, we even sometimes used catapults to destroy them 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.880
 ! That's where the name comes from 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.220
 "Firefighter" since the work of undermining is destroying, for example, 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.440
 a building. Firefighters could destroy a building to save 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.650
 others! 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.340
 As the years go by the operation of the pumps and the organization of the firefighters 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.659
 has improved but during the fall of the Roman Empire much knowledge is 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.810
 are lost and it seems that the Gauls have not been able, either for lack of means, or 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.580
 because they did not know how to do, reorganize a fire brigade. 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.060
 Our ancestors have had to gradually put men in place to fight against 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.640
 the fire, for example Charlemagne attempts in the ninth century to set up watchmen of 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.619
 night, but it will not last long. During these periods it is especially the monks who 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.019
 are responsible for fighting fires. In a previous episode we touched 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.799
 the creation of the police and I told you about Louis IX who created the watch 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:23.379
 royal. Well he had also created another watch in 1254: the bourgeois lookout 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.389
 which consisted of building and craft employees who were struggling 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.019
 against fires. Subsequently the organizations of fight against fire 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.590
 continue and in 1672 the first fire hose is created which provokes a beautiful 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.269
 little revolution. However, it is necessary to wait until 1802 for the term "fireman" to see 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.840
 the day, because until now it is only watchmen or soldiers. 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.159
 Today firefighters have evolved and with the evolution of our society 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.309
 and from our cities fires represent a small part of their intervention. If you 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:57.019
 liked this episode do not hesitate to talk to your potos and tell them to send me 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.800
 their question, with the agreement of their parents of course, on the address notabenequestion@gmail.com 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.600
 They take a microphone, they register and I will try to answer their question as I do for 2 months! 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.440
 ! See you !
