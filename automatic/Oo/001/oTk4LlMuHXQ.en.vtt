probably<00:03:38.569> this<00:03:39.109> way<00:03:39.319> huh<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.829> guess<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.489> swords

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
probably this way huh I guess the swords

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.000 
probably this way huh I guess the swords
holding<00:03:41.209> like<00:03:41.359> this<00:03:41.389> with<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.139> hook<00:03:42.560> coming

holding like this with the hook coming
out<00:03:43.160> maybe<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.670> gives<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.120> sword<00:03:44.420> part<00:03:44.690> that

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
out maybe that gives the sword part that

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.360 
out maybe that gives the sword part that
way<00:03:45.200> looks<00:03:45.440> more<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.799> you're<00:03:45.980> chopping
