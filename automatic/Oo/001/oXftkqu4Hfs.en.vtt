Hey, Austin Smith here and welcome to Focus on Species.
Today, we'll be meeting the regal horned lizard,

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.730
an animal that actually shoots blood out of
its eyes to defend itself. Right now, I'm

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.400
standing in the Sonoran Desert of southern
Arizona. It's in habitat like this, covered

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.630
in desert vegetation, such as Saguaro cactus
and mesquite, where we'll find the regal horned

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.910
lizard. The regal horned lizard is one of
eight species of horned lizard native to the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.529
United States. It has a distinctive crown
or horns radiating around the back of its

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.020
head, which gives the animal its name. This
arrangement of the horns allows it to be distinguished

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.720
from other species of horned lizards. Commonly
known as horny toads, the horned lizards have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.620
a blunt snout similar to a toad or a frog,
the origin of this deceiving nickname. Its

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.920
flat disc like torso allows the lizard to
seem flush with the ground. Its body is covered

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.410
in a variety of scales, including several
spikes, and it carries a stubby tail. All

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.240
of these features give the horned lizard a
unique appearance among reptiles. Its body

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.140
shape and color, which matches the soil on
which the animal lives, allows it to blend

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.850
into its environment to remain unnoticeable
by potential predators from above. The regal

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.600
horned lizard can be found in central and
southeastern Arizona, as well as parts of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.249
northwestern Mexico in Sonora and Sinaloa,
It makes its home primarily in the upland

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:29.569
Sonoran Desert, as well as desert scrubland
in the western Chihuahuan Desert. The species

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.159
is often found basking in the sun to warm
its body throughout the year and on cooler

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.229
winter days it digs hole in the ground for
shelter. During the summertime regal horned

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.170
lizards can lay over 30 eggs in a nest excavated
in the desert terrain that consists of a tunnel

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.189
traveling about 12 to 14 inches into the ground
.The lizard has a very specialized diet, feeding

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.600
almost exclusively on a specific insect, the
Maricopa harvester ant. Anyone who has hiked

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.090
through the Sonoran Desert is familiar with
the sight of a harvester ant colony, a large

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.670
living cluster of diligently working insects,
spreading out in lineal streams to scavenge

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.970
or harvest seeds, cactus fruit, and other
plant material to provide sustenance to the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.480
colony. When an intruder is detected near
the colony, harvester ants swarm the unwanted

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.590
guest and deliver stinging bites with their
mandibles. Their venom is believed to be the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.590
most toxic insect venom in the world, over
20 times more potent than a honey bee sting.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.849
Most animals are soon driven off or killed
by the defensive attacks, but the regal horned

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.159
lizard’s scaly armor offers protection as
it gulps down hundreds of the ants at a time.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.909
The regal horned lizard is dependent on harvester
ants as they make up about 90 percent of its

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:53.000
diet. The lizard uses its sticky tongue to
snatch up ants and its powerful jaws instantly

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.030
crush the insects. When a coyote or other
potential predator tries to make prey of the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.299
regal horned lizard itself, this reptile species
has a very unique ability at its disposal

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.980
to protect itself. Aside from its protective
armor, the regal horned lizard can squirt

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.620
small amount of blood from its eyes. The blood
usually alarms the attacker and allows the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.090
lizard to scamper away. I’ve linked a National
Geographic video in the description below

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.629
which displays this amazing behavior. Be sure
to check it out.
