they<00:00:57.809> changed<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.879> three-position

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
they changed it from the three-position

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.310 
they changed it from the three-position
system<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> little<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:01.020> flaky

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
system because it was a little bit flaky

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.009 
system because it was a little bit flaky
how<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.770> came<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> revision<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
how it came on to a revision to which is

see<00:01:51.960> cuz<00:01:52.350> cameras<00:01:52.890> probably<00:01:53.009> too<00:01:53.250> zoomed<00:01:53.399> out

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
see cuz cameras probably too zoomed out

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.120 
see cuz cameras probably too zoomed out
is<00:01:53.820> actually<00:01:54.060> glow-in-the-dark<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.979> is

is actually glow-in-the-dark and this is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.149 
is actually glow-in-the-dark and this is
back<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> three<00:01:56.939> position<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.829> goes<00:01:58.950> back

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
back to a three position so it goes back

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
back to a three position so it goes back
to<00:01:59.460> medium<00:02:00.329> which<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> can't<00:02:01.170> tell

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to medium which if you can can't tell

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
to medium which if you can can't tell
that's<00:02:01.680> slightly<00:02:01.979> brighter<00:02:02.340> than<00:02:02.549> my<00:02:02.729> medium

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that's slightly brighter than my medium

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.889 
that's slightly brighter than my medium
here<00:02:04.040> there's<00:02:05.040> my<00:02:05.280> medium<00:02:05.729> there's<00:02:06.630> new

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
here there's my medium there's new

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.040 
here there's my medium there's new
medium<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.710> wider<00:02:08.039> whiter<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.810> brighter

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
medium so it's wider whiter and brighter

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.400 
medium so it's wider whiter and brighter
and<00:02:11.270> then<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> goes<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.540> low<00:02:12.930> which

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and then it goes to low which

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.440 
and then it goes to low which
is<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.820> decent<00:02:15.000> low<00:02:15.300> it's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
is actually a decent low it's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.270 
is actually a decent low it's
one-and-a-half<00:02:15.930> lumens<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.620> low<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.130> that's

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
one-and-a-half lumens on low so that's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280 
one-and-a-half lumens on low so that's
still<00:02:17.490> great<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:17.940> reading<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.240> light<00:02:18.420> reading

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
still great for reading a light reading

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.830 
still great for reading a light reading
a<00:02:19.380> map<00:02:19.590> or<00:02:19.860> something<00:02:19.890> it's<00:02:20.480> super<00:02:21.480> even

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
a map or something it's super even

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.130 
a map or something it's super even
there's<00:02:22.020> no<00:02:22.170> bright<00:02:22.950> spots<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.140> then

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
there's no bright spots on it and then

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.810 
there's no bright spots on it and then
it<00:02:25.260> goes<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.770> 138<00:02:26.730> lumens<00:02:27.330> for<00:02:27.510> 70<00:02:28.410> minutes

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
it goes to 138 lumens for 70 minutes

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.750 
it goes to 138 lumens for 70 minutes
bright<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.780> that's<00:02:30.990> just<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.830> was<00:02:32.370> pointing

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
or copper they saw pure copper one over

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.540 
or copper they saw pure copper one over
to<00:04:52.789> the<00:04:53.120> new<00:04:53.389> rev3<00:04:53.960> so<00:04:54.889> don't<00:04:55.039> bother<00:04:55.189> there

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
to the new rev3 so don't bother there

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.519 
to the new rev3 so don't bother there
was<00:04:55.759> a<00:04:55.789> rep<00:04:56.120> two<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.479> a<00:04:56.509> half<00:04:56.689> which<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.259> have

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
was a rep two and a half which I have

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.379 
was a rep two and a half which I have
bought<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.069> lost<00:04:58.460> because<00:04:58.729> they're<00:04:59.090> really

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
bought and lost because they're really

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.640 
bought and lost because they're really
small<00:04:59.779> and<00:04:59.960> I<00:04:59.990> don't<00:05:00.050> know<00:05:00.199> where<00:05:00.349> it<00:05:00.409> is<00:05:00.500> it's

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
small and I don't know where it is it's

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.920 
small and I don't know where it is it's
in<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:00.919> case<00:05:01.159> came<00:05:02.060> in<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.240> same<00:05:02.389> case<00:05:02.689> and

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
in this case came in the same case and

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.459 
in this case came in the same case and
somewhere<00:05:04.029> somewhere<00:05:05.029> else<00:05:05.240> that<00:05:05.659> came<00:05:06.169> on

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
somewhere somewhere else that came on

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.010 
somewhere somewhere else that came on
low<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.250> then<00:05:08.060> went<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.360> high<00:05:08.569> so<00:05:08.900> they

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
low and then went to high so they

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.279 
low and then went to high so they
basically<00:05:09.229> took<00:05:09.529> this<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:09.979> just<00:05:10.099> reversed<00:05:10.430> it

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
basically took this and just reversed it

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.409 
basically took this and just reversed it
so<00:05:12.289> didn't<00:05:12.949> actually<00:05:13.430> improve<00:05:13.789> anything<00:05:14.120> as

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
so didn't actually improve anything as

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.269 
so didn't actually improve anything as
far<00:05:14.569> as<00:05:14.629> my<00:05:15.229> situation<00:05:15.830> where<00:05:15.919> I<00:05:15.979> wanted<00:05:16.189> a
