00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.170
 and well, welcome here 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.420
 new video, well, I bring you one 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.590
 time more gameplay of revolution and good 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.330
 Well to see is about the new 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.189
 skins that said raise yesterday 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.740
 but I did not upload it because it was good 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.300
 some other plans and I was also 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.640
 looking for a little more information 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.500
 about it this is not good cannes 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.769
 details what has been my birth with 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.510
 the link chakra or the union or the chakra 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.879
 the program as you wish mo mention 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.400
 and well it is that there is something important 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.140
 we already know that good in the scan is not what 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.360
 I noticed very well it was already marked that it is the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.399
 true awakening of minato I do not know if 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.960
 it will be a new version or it will be the 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.820
 version that we already know before without 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.920
 However, well, it's important 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.079
 emphasize that good is going to be an awakening 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.629
 ok now another important thing is that 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.129
 well we already know that the specials in 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.140
 teams are something important in this 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.420
 game and good is something we can see 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.280
 clearly in this game as good is going 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.280
 to have a special between naruto and me 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.399
 born now another important thing is what 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.800
 that seems the last image of this pack 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.420
 and is that good agrees with what 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.159
 is the portal 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.159
 of what is being a volume of 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.680
 manga 67 if I'm not wrong and what 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.930
 this cover is being indicates a 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.330
 special or rather you see the special 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.340
 a ras have double between what is my 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.440
 born and naruto but what you have to 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.869
 highlight is that this special is what 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.570
 apply to what is death has already 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.220
 become chiriquÃ­ of you be 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.960
 then we do not know if the arch of the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.750
 history will cover up to this moment 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.580
 which should in fact by simple by 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.880
 the simple fact that I was born is with 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.039
 the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.159
 with the cure chakra ma would indicate that 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.450
 the story of getting to that point 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.119
 then in this way we do not know 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.530
 really up to what then how far 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.060
 will cover what is the star 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.920
 revolution and many people are 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.750
 asking if they are going to include the were going to 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.850
 include it as part of the story or 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.500
 they're going to leave it for some other game the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.240
 truth is that something important is something 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.130
 that has not caught my attention and not what 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.090
 had taken a lot into account because of 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.770
 how good I already know the story 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.179
 really, after all, what 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 I finished important is the is the 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.069
 combat but if you had not thought this 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.950
 last is cannes to which I refer in the 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.020
 which can be taken as a special xo 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.480
 it could be the special on the cover 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.090
 that apply to what is this sudden 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.430
 if you want to call it like that then good 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.440
 people because these are the scans and more than 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.730
 nothing by how he mentioned them more than the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.870
 fact of the scans this the fact of 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.340
 know how far the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.740
 history that's why it had not gone up 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 I did not know what it was because these are 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.640
 cannes that came out yesterday because I 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.350
 I focused a little bit more on how they were doing 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.150
 handling the fact of the story I do not know 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.220
 if they were going to go by or on the other hand or 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.780
 they were simply going to deliver us what 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.150
 that was going to be up that part of the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.010
 history not then well now that 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.420
 people leave me here the tasks you 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.790
 what do you think is not simply a 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.320
 coincidence of the special will be the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.660
 completion perhaps of the special between 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.010
 both of which is what you think 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.160
 let's finish with what has been 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.780
 because the history until that part is us 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.240
 so we would have maybe what would be a 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.100
 voice faith will probably not be a voice 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.380
 faith in rules and consequences of 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.330
 buttons and others but maybe but 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.100
 time would be like the one that in strong 2 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.900
 which is when you are in the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.790
 lair of the last what is not a voice 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.060
 faith as such because there is no boss like that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.410
 huge as as susan or in addition without 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.510
 However we can find that good 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.520
 the voice faith things that was pretty 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.890
 good because not the fact of making a well 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.600
 then for a people then do not forget 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.070
 leave your like if you liked sharing it 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.440
 with your friends and as I say you can 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.300
 comment here that you think not you 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.920
 what they think is a coincidence we get 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.960
 well maybe a story a little bit more 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.520
 long in the largest of the manga is a 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.900
 people, so here I say goodbye, see you 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.900
 the next and bye
