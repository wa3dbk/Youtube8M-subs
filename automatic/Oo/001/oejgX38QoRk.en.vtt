00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.950 
killed one just before that so it was
nearly<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.970> whole<00:01:36.150> well<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> whole

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
nearly the whole well it was a whole

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.499 
nearly the whole well it was a whole
team<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.380> about<00:01:37.650> five<00:01:38.130> seconds<00:01:38.670> which<00:01:39.299> was

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
team in about five seconds which was

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.980 
team in about five seconds which was
pretty<00:01:39.960> epic<00:01:40.530> oh<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:44.299> quads<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.509> always<00:01:45.780> good

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
pretty epic oh and quads are always good

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.899 
pretty epic oh and quads are always good
triples<00:01:46.500> are<00:01:46.560> nice<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:46.950> pods<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.369> amazing

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
triples are nice but pods are amazing

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.940 
triples are nice but pods are amazing
and<00:01:48.060> don't<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:48.960> many<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.229> them<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.560> that'll

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and don't get many of them and that'll

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.179 
and don't get many of them and that'll
help<00:01:50.159> towards<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.290> double<00:01:52.290> kills<00:01:52.560> or<00:01:52.829> more

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
help towards the double kills or more

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.789 
help towards the double kills or more
with<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.090> need<00:01:54.180> 25<00:01:54.810> frags<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.500> maybe

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
with I think you need 25 frags or maybe

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.850 
with I think you need 25 frags or maybe
it<00:01:56.460> goes<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> 50<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.329> get<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> emblem<00:01:57.899> not

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it goes up to 50 to get the emblem not

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.020 
it goes up to 50 to get the emblem not
entirely<00:01:59.189> sure<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.430> I've<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.820> really<00:01:59.939> been

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
entirely sure but I've not really been

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.270 
entirely sure but I've not really been
focusing<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.469> titles<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.920> emblems<00:02:02.009> which

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
focusing on the titles and emblems which

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190 
focusing on the titles and emblems which
I<00:02:02.700> should<00:02:03.030> do<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> should<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:03.990> for

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
I should do really I should be going for

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.530 
I should do really I should be going for
the<00:02:04.259> stealth<00:02:04.530> bomber<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.979> which<00:02:05.700> will<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.060> god

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the stealth bomber one which will be god

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.479 
the stealth bomber one which will be god
that<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.960> easy<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.380> ground<00:02:07.950> war<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.399> I'll

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
that was so easy on ground war so I'll

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.680 
that was so easy on ground war so I'll
probably<00:02:08.610> start<00:02:08.910> playing<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.149> bit<00:02:09.270> more<00:02:09.450> ground

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
probably start playing a bit more ground

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.479 
probably start playing a bit more ground
