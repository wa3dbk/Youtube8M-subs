00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hello everyone in this video I want 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.510
 talk about the knife at the sight of which 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.059
 Immediately a lot of questions arise but 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.700
 unfortunately most likely most of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.250
 they will remain unanswered because 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.699
 what is at the moment as far as me 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.630
 known soda company has already stopped 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.080
 release of this model 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 this model is called switch 2 and here 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.710
 despite the enormous potential of this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:41.250
 design to be misunderstood it's like 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.520
 doesn't make this knife less unusual and in 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 some kind of interesting little bit 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.180
 looking back and analyzing 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.050
 what's happening in particular is the development 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.949
 sog firms in recent years i 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.729
 to a large extent, not surprised that such 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.530
 the model was born just recently 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.340
 this is such a period 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.659
 Well, as I see the period of searching for myself 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.580
 for the company sog they certainly have 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.619
 some cult models that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.650
 produced more than one decade but 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.520
 nevertheless they certainly understand that 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.369
 need to move somewhere further and somehow 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.630
 evolve and all this leads to 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:37.290
 the emergence of such here 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.600
 experimental knives this here that is 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.369
 this model is called switch 2 was still 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.880
 will help 1 cm3 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.820
 it was all a pure experiment 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 because 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.540
 I don't know, looking at this knife, I can't 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.510
 imagine that he will become some 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.380
 icon but still they are numbered 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:06.020
 some kind of new 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.899
 the soil well and most likely this knife and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.300
 all the same 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.280
 such not acquired so mad 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.930
 no one’s fame 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.660
 Liked but when I saw him in 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.590
 first time he is somehow so strong 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.570
 hooked me up and I just realized that 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.380
 There is nothing in the market 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.290
 like anything like that, I mean 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.190
 following concept concept 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:40.340
 thick metal plate full tank 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.290
 which so stochena on the one hand 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.420
 in such a crazy vorne cliff 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.769
 one-sided and this plate 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.320
 just take and 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.560
 and you start to cut something honestly 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.680
 saying when I saw him in the pictures before 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.150
 of how he got into my hands about 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.519
 My only thoughts about this knives were 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.100
 in terms of some knife fighting and 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.870
 self defense 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.280
 because well I just saw this one 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.190
 Here is the thing that fits in my palm and here 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.030
 bulges so here 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:23.530
 subtle remaining really so it 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.530
 and there is a thin thin tip here 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.900
 the descent is one-sided here but 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.470
 interesting carts themselves are made 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.540
 symmetrically i.e. 50 to 50 of 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:44.410
 the knife is very thin at about 0 3 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:46.540
 a millimeter false is not sharpened but he can 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.299
 be sharpened if desired 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.700
 here is such a powerful notch and not 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.760
 I still think that this knife can 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.799
 apply for some some 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.599
 knife fight styles in particular here 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.750
 some kind of filipino knife fight 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.880
 where such deep is required 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.680
 deep grip on the knife with long overhang 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.879
 thumb over here on these 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.579
 notches and exactly the same with reverse grip 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:20.889
 reverse grip he sits in his hand just 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:23.650
 awesome just gorgeous but what 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.250
 specifically I did not like it here 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.060
 this one is the corner with a hole for the lanyard 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.060
 I am more used to hold knives 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.460
 some just such a pistol and salad 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.260
 and fencing then there is this one corner 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.690
 he immediately sticks in here perfectly 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.990
 impossible this one needs to be kept 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.520
 tight in the other side then when i eat 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.130
 played around and thoughts of his self defense to us 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.450
 some fantasies have passed, I realized that 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.620
 such a grip 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:59.500
 he means and some work these 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.290
 the knife is very finely reduced in principle such 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.060
 height monthly geometry is sometimes very 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.100
 demand besides pay 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.830
 attention from which side is made here 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:14.110
 this descent that's all 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:16.930
 done right handed that is with this knife 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:24.130
 here 's something to cut open there 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:27.100
 it will be extremely convenient on the knife 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.940
 pretty simple but i like that 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.370
 here is the approach to big where itself is made full 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.080
 the contour of the knife and it can be one hundred percent 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:41.200
 clearly sit here close with this here 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.600
 hlyastiky absolutely nothing here 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.979
 rattles no noise does not hang out 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.600
 that is, you need good 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:54.280
 a little bit saved definitely right here 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.680
 here on this clip here is no 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.419
 klokov nothing such that there is such here 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.419
 clip. with the inscription sol 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.460
 the knife itself has a very thin profile 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:11.840
 that is, the thickness of this plate is 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:15.650
 3.85 millimeter nakladochka here from g10 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.820
 and here he stopped in the area of ​​the hilt gave me 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:22.700
 exactly one centimeter meaning it is very 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:31.640
 thin knife that will fit for 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:33.560
 some kind of hidden wearing in general i am not 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.720
 I think that at one time in general the company 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.750
 sugoi gave some definition of it 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.670
 the knife for what it is made like and what is it 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.540
 there is like everyone somehow for yourself already 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.540
 must understand this 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.920
 but after looking at it in my hands 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.630
 I think everyone can 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.720
 interpret it like that and 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.690
 Well, that's something that is definitely correct 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:03.220
 won't be here 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:04.970
 steel on the knife aus-8 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:09.760
 here he is done 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.760
 taiwan here 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:17.720
 and I don't even know what else to say but this 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.400
 just just pour schA and squeezed that 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.410
 I just want to take it in my hands 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:27.890
 somehow support well so at least 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:30.800
 was with me very interesting interesting 

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:34.940
 experiment i actually am probably and 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.270
 I did not expect the company juice drove this 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:42.380
 knife to the masses that is but as an experiment 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:44.810
 who got into my hands this is this 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:49.150
 certainly extremely 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:52.250
 some interesting and rewarding experience all 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.010
 I hope you were interested, thank you for 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.250
 view bye 

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.250
 bye Bye
