00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 now is philippe kirsch america our design is a speaker to 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.430
 terrible 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.680
 how basically the following works we have here 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.009
 sources hate prioritized with high tension this appetite and 20 30 thousand goals 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.779
 we apae it is convenient that it crosses that voltaic arc varying 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.170
 this current according to the soldier audio input we can 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.969
 expand when comic air fell so we hear the game we hear the sound 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.680
 here we use some filters to wake up at low frequencies because 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.720
 it's a target 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.720
 when the very low frequency Eduardo could not 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.130
 we keep getting extinguished until the sea the distortion is very high 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.630
 and is not applied in this case it is applied as 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.800
 these highs 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.900
 in case 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.070
 Ah it is likely that traffickers 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.270
 great d 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.270
 it is likely that it is burns focused nba 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.220
 with this speech he speaks best of five reservations 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.110
 is 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.600
 I will talk about election he has an ability to play audio 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.120
 the high-frequency series in better definition has capacity has been revised 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.090
 in high definition why 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.570
 it is the bow itself that referee will whistle 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.880
 on duty it has a very small base 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.490
 so it has a very low energy they allow a transient response 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.770
 much better 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.550
 that's it he can do nothing alone 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.960
 He gets better definition. 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.400
 aims to give a general idea of ​​the operation when entering we have 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 some filters steve the movie is a 40 order movie 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.650
 he 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 all frequencies below 1 that die 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.200
 ah after that filter has a modulation step it compares the signal of the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.880
 I enter a wave that angola 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.920
 results in a pwm signal 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.370
 or a frequency sign of fiction 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.040
 however the average signal value 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.149
 It's this one 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.609
 this we already come with that agent havemos pt controlled was deck that is a 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.729
 amplifier of street concrete criciúma pain of television 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:18.539
 Portuguese 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.539
 in case anyone who is using their transformer lift arrest 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:26.819
 xavi ando elena son in the frequency days 50 kilometers later he chose me 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.959
 and changed side with endings of 1 to 20 kilometers 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.700
 is all its variation in the intensity of the arc then variation in intensity 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.249
 temperature 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.459
 in the bow he resisted the afternoon to contract 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.409
 fled the sound zones 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.379
 /P 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.379
 the law is clear 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.449
 stay here 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.669
