00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
considering they start Oh in three they

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.850 
considering they start Oh in three they
win

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
win

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.380

four<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.160> row<00:02:14.190> we're<00:02:14.820> thinking<00:02:15.180> maybe

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
four in a row we're thinking maybe

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.230 
four in a row we're thinking maybe
playoff<00:02:15.960> push<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.770> crazy<00:02:17.340> AFC<00:02:18.000> West

and<00:02:18.480> then<00:02:18.600> they've<00:02:18.810> lost<00:02:18.990> five<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.440> six<00:02:19.650> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
and then they've lost five of six I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.370 
and then they've lost five of six I
think<00:02:20.400> always<00:02:20.670> with<00:02:21.570> all<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.840> these<00:02:21.930> coaches
