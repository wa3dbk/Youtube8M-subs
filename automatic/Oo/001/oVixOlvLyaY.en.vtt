00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:50.430 
speculation and how exactly the ak-47
might<00:00:47.350> be<00:00:47.559> in<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.799> game<00:00:47.979> right<00:00:48.760> now<00:00:49.119> so<00:00:49.750> in

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
zombies actually the new descent zombies

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.109 
zombies actually the new descent zombies
actually<00:00:56.619> starts<00:00:56.979> you<00:00:57.460> can<00:00:57.610> see<00:00:57.760> right<00:00:57.939> here

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
actually starts you can see right here

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.259 
actually starts you can see right here
the<00:00:58.269> ak-47<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.379> clearly<00:00:59.830> being<00:01:00.189> held<00:01:00.460> by<00:01:01.210> this

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
the ak-47 is clearly being held by this

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.910 
the ak-47 is clearly being held by this
guy<00:01:01.659> that<00:01:01.989> thing<00:01:02.140> his<00:01:02.229> name<00:01:02.379> is<00:01:02.500> Decker<00:01:02.739> he's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
guy that thing his name is Decker he's

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.670 
guy that thing his name is Decker he's
clearly<00:01:03.280> holding<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.909> ak-47<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:05.049> they

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
clearly holding the ak-47 and they

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.380 
clearly holding the ak-47 and they
wouldn't<00:01:06.040> just<00:01:06.189> put<00:01:06.700> that<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.150> game

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
wouldn't just put that in the game

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.539 
wouldn't just put that in the game
before<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.990> thing<00:01:08.439> is<00:01:08.619> out<00:01:08.890> like<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.250> makes<00:01:09.430> no

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
before the thing is out like it makes no

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.030 
before the thing is out like it makes no
sense<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:10.479> put<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.960> cutscene<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.830> game

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
sense to put that cutscene in the game

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.640 
sense to put that cutscene in the game
before<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.240> gun<00:01:13.390> is<00:01:13.540> actually<00:01:13.689> in<00:01:14.049> so<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.290> have

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
before the gun is actually in so I have

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.700 
before the gun is actually in so I have
a<00:01:14.680> theory<00:01:15.009> I<00:01:15.130> have<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.430> theory<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.210> somehow<00:01:17.140> in

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
a theory I have a theory that somehow in

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.430 
a theory I have a theory that somehow in
the<00:01:18.310> new<00:01:18.460> EXO<00:01:18.790> zombies<00:01:18.820> map<00:01:19.300> descent<00:01:19.810> the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
the new EXO zombies map descent the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.910 
the new EXO zombies map descent the
ak-47<00:01:21.250> is<00:01:21.850> in<00:01:22.390> there<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.840> my<00:01:22.990> guess<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:23.560> once

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
ak-47 is in there and my guess is once

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.070 
ak-47 is in there and my guess is once
you<00:01:24.070> complete<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.670> easter<00:01:25.090> egg<00:01:25.240> they<00:01:25.900> will

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
you complete the easter egg they will

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.200 
you complete the easter egg they will
give<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.500> ak-47<00:01:26.980> I<00:01:27.550> may<00:01:27.700> be<00:01:27.760> wrong<00:01:28.000> about

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
give you the ak-47 I may be wrong about

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.050 
give you the ak-47 I may be wrong about
this<00:01:28.450> maybe<00:01:28.690> completely<00:01:29.200> wrong<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.880> then

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
this maybe completely wrong but then

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.210 
this maybe completely wrong but then
again<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.600> may<00:01:32.170> be<00:01:32.230> right<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.560> I<00:01:32.710> really<00:01:33.010> don't

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
again I may be right and I really don't

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.760 
again I may be right and I really don't
think<00:01:33.340> they<00:01:33.730> would<00:01:33.850> just<00:01:33.880> add<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.210> random<00:01:34.770> ak-47

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
think they would just add a random ak-47

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.160 
think they would just add a random ak-47
cutscene<00:01:36.310> into<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.300> zombies<00:01:37.659> map<00:01:37.810> if<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
cutscene into the zombies map if the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.399 
cutscene into the zombies map if the
ak-47<00:01:38.680> wasn't<00:01:39.400> somehow<00:01:39.700> obtainable<00:01:40.420> in<00:01:40.750> the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
ak-47 wasn't somehow obtainable in the

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.800 
ak-47 wasn't somehow obtainable in the
zombies<00:01:41.830> map<00:01:42.010> so<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.729> lot<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.180> things<00:01:43.360> could<00:01:43.600> go

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
zombies map so a lot of things could go

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.840 
zombies map so a lot of things could go
on<00:01:43.990> here<00:01:44.260> if<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.590> ak-47<00:01:45.010> is<00:01:45.370> actually<00:01:45.729> in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
on here if the ak-47 is actually in

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.910 
on here if the ak-47 is actually in
zombies<00:01:46.270> if<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:46.720> then<00:01:47.350> there<00:01:47.590> we<00:01:47.710> go<00:01:47.800> we

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
zombies if it is then there we go we

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.440 
zombies if it is then there we go we
have<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.190> exact<00:01:48.580> gun<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.090> we're<00:01:49.180> gonna<00:01:49.270> get

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
have the exact gun that we're gonna get

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.390 
have the exact gun that we're gonna get
from<00:01:49.600> multiplayer<00:01:50.050> very<00:01:50.290> soon<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:50.890> we're

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
from multiplayer very soon and we're

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.980 
from multiplayer very soon and we're
