 Hello everyone, Mike Denver today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.140
 I'll tell you how to make beautiful eyes 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.780
 surely many have seen on different sites 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.910
 or in magazines that the eyes are very 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.300
 expressive and vibrant done this 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.609
 just all we will do in 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.119
 the lightroom program can be done and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.779
 Photoshop but lightroom I think it will be 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.849
 most easier optimal and so for 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.360
 example, I chose photos like this 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.030
 here is a girl who is in the snow 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:40.219
 let's take her and take two closer to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.539
 pick one brush 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:48.780
 set up the brush like this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.829
 settings can now tell more 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.020
 in detail what's what is the general pace 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.090
 if we want to make it colder 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.719
 eye color then move to left scales 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.290
 warmer right exposure we 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.939
 leaving the center in contrast with the color 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 shadows and everything else 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.060
 Move right can play with 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.560
 settings to make it the most 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.650
 perfect for your photo but i 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 chose something like that in general, choose a brush 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.659
 push the center to the center of the eye and start 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:33.770
 encircling the eye itself here in its outlines and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.770
 see that it turns blue and 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.640
 neighbour 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.170
 and edging now choose the second eye 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:52.190
 select again brush select center 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:58.270
 eyes and also circling the entire eye 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:00.159
 to make it all the most evenly all 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.240
 we remove the brush 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:09.350
 we move away the photo here such turned out 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:13.430
 drop eyes can change everything like 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.519
 I said let your taste 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.400
 compare what was and what became here 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:23.090
 such eyes have become such 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.880
 and that's all I said it very much 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.130
