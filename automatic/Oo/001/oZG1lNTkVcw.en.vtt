00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:15.020 

and<00:04:07.790> that's<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.909> for<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.150> sounds<00:04:13.819> now<00:04:14.819> these

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.300 
they actually first used tative Cobra
and<00:05:58.470> chaser<00:05:58.770> bat<00:06:00.410> though<00:06:01.410> I<00:06:01.440> guess<00:06:01.680> we<00:06:01.889> look<00:06:02.130> at

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
and chaser bat though I guess we look at

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.010 
and chaser bat though I guess we look at
this<00:06:02.550> is<00:06:02.729> one<00:06:03.000> that<00:06:03.120> probably<00:06:03.330> fed<00:06:03.570> said<00:06:03.720> most

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
this is one that probably fed said most

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.680 
this is one that probably fed said most
because<00:06:04.919> of<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.340> wing<00:06:05.520> design<00:06:05.820> that<00:06:06.000> fits<00:06:06.300> his

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
because of the wing design that fits his

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.070 
because of the wing design that fits his
symbol<00:06:07.620> as<00:06:08.400> well<00:06:08.610> as<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:08.910> purple<00:06:09.660> windshields

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
symbol as well as the purple windshields

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.460 
symbol as well as the purple windshields
the<00:06:10.139> mat<00:06:10.320> his<00:06:10.590> color<00:06:11.039> purple<00:06:12.110> another<00:06:13.110> purple

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
the mat his color purple another purple

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.650 
the mat his color purple another purple
that<00:06:13.620> is<00:06:13.800> all<00:06:14.160> over<00:06:14.430> his<00:06:14.550> body

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.809 

if<00:06:19.660> you<00:06:20.410> want<00:06:20.590> to<00:06:20.770> you<00:06:20.919> can't<00:06:21.160> take<00:06:21.370> these<00:06:21.550> and

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
if you want to you can't take these and

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.339 
if you want to you can't take these and
use<00:06:22.030> them<00:06:22.210> with<00:06:22.419> the<00:06:22.660> ship<00:06:22.900> cardholder<00:06:25.349> since

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
use them with the ship cardholder since

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:42.629 
use them with the ship cardholder since
there<00:06:26.530> are<00:06:26.590> three<00:06:26.800> of<00:06:26.889> them<00:06:41.039> so<00:06:42.039> overall<00:06:42.460> this

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
there are three of them so overall this

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.490 
there are three of them so overall this
is<00:06:42.699> a<00:06:42.819> nice<00:06:42.970> set<00:06:43.240> but<00:06:43.599> it's<00:06:43.840> one<00:06:44.080> that<00:06:44.110> I<00:06:44.319> can

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
is a nice set but it's one that I can

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.680 
is a nice set but it's one that I can
only<00:06:44.740> recommend<00:06:44.889> if<00:06:45.460> you're<00:06:46.030> going<00:06:46.300> to<00:06:46.389> be

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
only recommend if you're going to be

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.270 
only recommend if you're going to be
getting<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:47.410> right<00:06:48.220> gunner<00:06:48.460> as<00:06:48.610> well<00:06:49.110> is

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
getting the right gunner as well is

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.909 
getting the right gunner as well is
because<00:06:52.080> these<00:06:53.080> are<00:06:53.349> specifically<00:06:53.800> designed

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
because these are specifically designed

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:59.040 
because these are specifically designed
for<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.669> break<00:06:54.909> gunner<00:06:55.199> and<00:06:57.270> as<00:06:58.270> I<00:06:58.330> have<00:06:59.020> shown

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
for the break gunner and as I have shown

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.010 
for the break gunner and as I have shown
in<00:06:59.409> my<00:06:59.560> break<00:07:00.099> and<00:07:00.280> review<00:07:00.699> these<00:07:01.569> all<00:07:01.840> make

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
in my break and review these all make

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.020 
in my break and review these all make
the<00:07:02.139> same<00:07:02.169> sound<00:07:02.620> and<00:07:02.860> they<00:07:03.159> don't<00:07:03.190> prop<00:07:03.849> they

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
the same sound and they don't prop they

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.950 
the same sound and they don't prop they
aren't<00:07:04.270> properly<00:07:04.720> read<00:07:05.169> by<00:07:05.500> it<00:07:06.630> the<00:07:07.630> drive

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
aren't properly read by it the drive

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.330 
aren't properly read by it the drive
driver<00:07:08.229> it<00:07:08.349> gives<00:07:08.560> more<00:07:08.740> of<00:07:08.860> an<00:07:08.919> error<00:07:09.130> sound

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
driver it gives more of an error sound

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.899 
driver it gives more of an error sound
it<00:07:09.490> doesn't<00:07:09.789> recognize<00:07:10.539> doesn't<00:07:11.199> quite

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909 
it doesn't recognize doesn't quite

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:17.460 
it doesn't recognize doesn't quite
recognize<00:07:12.909> them<00:07:13.120> by<00:07:13.300> name<00:07:13.599> and<00:07:16.050> that's<00:07:17.050> partly

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
recognize them by name and that's partly

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.749 
recognize them by name and that's partly
not<00:07:17.710> to<00:07:17.830> spoil<00:07:18.069> them<00:07:18.190> but<00:07:18.370> also<00:07:18.520> partly

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 
not to spoil them but also partly

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:23.879 
not to spoil them but also partly
because<00:07:19.000> they<00:07:19.210> belong<00:07:19.479> to<00:07:19.509> a<00:07:19.719> villain<00:07:22.889> that

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:23.889 
because they belong to a villain that

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:26.930 
because they belong to a villain that
being<00:07:24.099> said<00:07:24.250> these<00:07:24.460> are<00:07:24.490> very<00:07:25.330> nice<00:07:25.509> design<00:07:25.930> it

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
being said these are very nice design it

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.140 
being said these are very nice design it
is<00:07:27.940> definitely<00:07:28.690> cool<00:07:28.990> they're<00:07:29.349> taking<00:07:29.710> this

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
is definitely cool they're taking this

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.839 
is definitely cool they're taking this
shared<00:07:31.150> base<00:07:31.539> design<00:07:32.050> and<00:07:32.740> then<00:07:32.919> Moff<00:07:33.580> eyeing

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:33.849 
shared base design and then Moff eyeing

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.270 
shared base design and then Moff eyeing
them<00:07:34.060> into<00:07:34.570> these<00:07:34.659> three<00:07:35.380> quite<00:07:35.800> different

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 
them into these three quite different

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.180 
them into these three quite different
cars<00:07:37.770> and<00:07:39.180> these<00:07:40.180> two<00:07:40.449> like<00:07:40.900> I<00:07:40.930> said<00:07:41.169> in<00:07:42.130> my

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.190 
cars and these two like I said in my

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.580 
cars and these two like I said in my
opinion<00:07:42.550> do<00:07:42.909> a<00:07:42.940> better<00:07:43.449> job<00:07:43.570> at<00:07:44.020> their<00:07:44.259> designs

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:44.590 
opinion do a better job at their designs

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.290 
opinion do a better job at their designs
then<00:07:45.039> case<00:07:45.400> your<00:07:45.550> bat<00:07:45.729> does<00:07:47.520> so<00:07:48.520> if<00:07:48.969> you're

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.300 
then case your bat does so if you're

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.580 
then case your bat does so if you're
getting<00:07:49.449> the<00:07:49.569> break<00:07:49.750> gutter<00:07:49.960> I<00:07:50.139> can<00:07:50.440> then

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.590 
getting the break gutter I can then

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:58.290 
getting the break gutter I can then
