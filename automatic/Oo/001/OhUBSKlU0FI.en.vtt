doesn't necessarily have an affinity
towards<00:02:03.750> maybe<00:02:04.350> some<00:02:04.560> BMC's<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.299> know

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
towards maybe some BMC's but you know

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.850 
towards maybe some BMC's but you know
has<00:02:06.600> dabbled<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.140> few<00:02:07.290> beers<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
has dabbled in a few beers here and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.410 
has dabbled in a few beers here and
there<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.160> really

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
there and really

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.850 
there and really
hasn't<00:02:08.630> had<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.780> luck<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.349> finding<00:02:09.679> one<00:02:09.770> they

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
hasn't had a luck and finding one they

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.170 
hasn't had a luck and finding one they
really<00:02:09.890> like<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.310> think<00:02:10.550> this<00:02:10.729> might<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:10.970> one

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
really like I think this might be one

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.479 
really like I think this might be one
that<00:02:11.209> they<00:02:11.390> could<00:02:11.569> try<00:02:11.750> because<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:13.099> like<00:02:13.340> they

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
that they could try because it like they

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.699 
that they could try because it like they
said<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.880> has<00:02:14.239> no<00:02:14.480> aftertaste<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.500> really

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
said it has no aftertaste and it really

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.830 
said it has no aftertaste and it really
does<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.280> kind<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.730> swagger<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.569> that

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
does have kind of a swagger to it that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.949 
does have kind of a swagger to it that
leaves<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.920> unto<00:02:19.250> itself<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.819> mean<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.780> is

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
leaves it unto itself I mean it this is

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.320 
leaves it unto itself I mean it this is
a<00:02:21.170> high<00:02:21.709> quality<00:02:21.770> beer<00:02:22.370> but<00:02:22.700> at<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.849> same<00:02:23.120> time

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
a high quality beer but at the same time

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.390 
a high quality beer but at the same time
it<00:02:23.540> doesn't<00:02:23.569> have<00:02:24.500> an<00:02:24.680> aftertaste<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.250> a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
it doesn't have an aftertaste that a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.550 
it doesn't have an aftertaste that a
beer<00:02:25.700> would<00:02:25.910> have<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.959> think<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.410> is

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
beer would have so I think this is

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.780 
beer would have so I think this is
something<00:02:27.739> that<00:02:27.890> could<00:02:28.190> really<00:02:28.430> open<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
something that could really open the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.880 
something that could really open the
eyes<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.300> someone<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.380> looking<00:02:30.739> for

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
eyes of someone that just is looking for

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.070 
eyes of someone that just is looking for
that<00:02:31.010> right<00:02:31.520> beer<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.060> kind<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.569> hook<00:02:32.840> them

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
that right beer to kind of hook them

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.040 
that right beer to kind of hook them
okay<00:02:34.010> Adam<00:02:34.640> I'm<00:02:34.730> looking<00:02:35.060> back<00:02:35.269> into<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.720> BBA

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.520 
vault I don't know if you can remember
but<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.450> think<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.720> would<00:02:38.810> take<00:02:39.050> taddy

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530

but do you think you would take taddy
porter<00:02:39.860> or<00:02:40.600> samuel<00:02:41.600> Smith's<00:02:41.870> Imperial<00:02:42.500> Stout

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
porter or samuel Smith's Imperial Stout

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.100 
porter or samuel Smith's Imperial Stout
I<00:02:43.100> think<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.000> would<00:02:44.120> take<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.390> Imperial<00:02:44.900> Stout

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
I think I would take the Imperial Stout

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.580 
I think I would take the Imperial Stout
again<00:02:46.010> because<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.060> like<00:02:47.810> what<00:02:48.049> Scott<00:02:48.350> was

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
again because I like what Scott was

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.009 
again because I like what Scott was
saying<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.459> they're<00:02:49.670> there<00:02:50.000> isn't<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.510> lot<00:02:50.720> of

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
saying that they're there isn't a lot of

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.020 
saying that they're there isn't a lot of
that<00:02:51.500> lingering<00:02:51.890> finish<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.549> and<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.790> almost

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that lingering finish to it and I almost

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.300 
that lingering finish to it and I almost
like<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.600> I<00:02:53.630> like<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.410> flavor<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:55.100> kind

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
like that I like that flavor that kind

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.920 
like that I like that flavor that kind
of<00:02:55.340> lingers<00:02:55.670> that's<00:02:55.910> what<00:02:56.150> makes<00:02:56.390> me<00:02:56.510> drink

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
of lingers that's what makes me drink

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.680 
of lingers that's what makes me drink
more<00:02:57.230> beer<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.000> coding<00:02:59.510> and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
more beer is that that that coding and

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.410 
more beer is that that that coding and
that<00:02:59.810> nice<00:02:59.989> flavor<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:01.459> doesn't<00:03:01.880> have<00:03:02.060> it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
that nice flavor it doesn't have it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.120 
that nice flavor it doesn't have it
doesn't<00:03:03.049> have<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.230> really<00:03:03.680> kind<00:03:03.980> of

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
doesn't have that really kind of

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.090 
doesn't have that really kind of
creaminess<00:03:04.549> that<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.959> your<00:03:06.440> typical<00:03:06.769> stat

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
creaminess that that your typical stat

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.509 
creaminess that that your typical stat
would<00:03:07.400> have<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.930> high<00:03:09.110> flavored<00:03:09.950> beer<00:03:10.220> too

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
would have it's a high flavored beer too

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.060 
would have it's a high flavored beer too
it's<00:03:10.700> gotten<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.180> drinks<00:03:11.840> very<00:03:12.080> well<00:03:12.380> goes

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
it's gotten it drinks very well goes

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.819 
it's gotten it drinks very well goes
down<00:03:13.280> very<00:03:13.489> smoothly<00:03:14.000> but<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.720> think<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.140> for<00:03:15.739> me

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
down very smoothly but I think it for me

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.160 
down very smoothly but I think it for me
it's<00:03:15.980> lacking<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.489> rating<00:03:17.390> I'm<00:03:17.900> gonna<00:03:18.019> give

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's lacking that rating I'm gonna give

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.229 
it's lacking that rating I'm gonna give
it<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.290> seven<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.859> seven<00:03:19.720> Joe<00:03:20.720> me<00:03:22.120> would<00:03:23.120> you
