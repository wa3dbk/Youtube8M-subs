 cff vehicles are modernized and 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.219
 maintained whose workshops 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.440
 yverdon baths 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.119
 this includes maintenance the handing over 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.109
 condition of certain components as well as the 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.070
 modernization of whole vehicles 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.779
 the focus is not just on the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.249
 profitability on customer comfort 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.130
 but also on efficiency 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.390
 energy 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.550
 the cff make sure that the vehicles 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.570
 leaving the industrial workshops are 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.570
 less energy hungry

 winston of netizens and mister mystery 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.920
 all the components of the r and 460 have 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 been dismantled those who can be 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.760
 reused were subjected to a revision 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.260
 the others were replaced by 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.880
 new components such as the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.420
 traction current converter and 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.420
 the compressor 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.090
 in addition the crate of the locomotive has 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.450
 been fully refurbished and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 repainted 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.780
 for the modernization of the locomotive 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.280
 red r and 460 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.009
 we worked for about a 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.990
 year on a prototype the cff invest 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.940
 230 million francs to modernize 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.320
 119 locomotive who can then 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.240
 circulated for twenty years 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.649
 additional is way more 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.049
 energy efficient now the 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.970
 distance traveled each day paris 119 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.789
 locomotive would make two 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.340
 time and a half around the earth 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.390
 520 employees 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.600

 baths 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.200
 they are divided into two teams and 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.209
 has 25 different trades 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.239
 the workshops were built for the 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.120
 moon yverdon-les-bains had to sign in 1855 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.310
 they were taken over by the cff in 1905 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.310
 since they have been constantly modernized 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.230
 the hall in which the 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.360
 traction motors has recently been 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.549
 restructured whether it's hardware 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.079
 rolling new modernize maintenance 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.720
 must respect the schedule by 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.890
 2025 the cff will therefore invest more than one 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.299
 billion francs in 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.340

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.610
 of yverdon baths is representative of 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.160
 its investments the equipment 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.440
 70 tons which cost 4.6 million 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.330

 the various industrial workshops in the 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.580
 baths are of utmost importance 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.630
 for the region the modernization of the r 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.230
 and 460 alone 60 posts 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.300
 working for the next nine years 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.410
 our motto look to the future does not 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.270
 not remain a dead letter 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.040
 witness the work 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.690
 Expansion of the site planned during the course 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.160
 coming years to be able to 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.959
 welcome the new big trains 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.370

 we train 40 apprentices every year 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.590
 the profession of automation or 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.180
 polymechanic one of the big 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.700
 particularities of industrial workshops 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.220
 and can be raised or high school 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.840
 whole decomposition the icn are 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.320
 currently subject to the 3-year revision 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.209
 et al 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.160
 during this major review 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.239
 some technical components are 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.190
 fully refurbished 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.510

 seat coverings as well as 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.260
 telephone network equipment 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.380
 3g mobile improves the comfort of the 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.760
 customers will pass through 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.530
 workshops in 2014 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.630
 six of them will be subject to a 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.310
 review a s is at a revision 3 when 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.510
 of the revision a the bogies and the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.880
 other technical opponents are 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.830
 replaced a necessary operation after 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.340
 have traveled the distance of 1.2 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.530
 million kilometers as part of 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.060
 revision 3 the space reserved for 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.580
 customers and equipped with new coatings 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.200
 of seats is new carpet the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.479
 revision 3 is carried out as soon as the 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.600
 train traveled the distance of 4.8 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.550
 millions of km during true vision 3 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.320
 the entire composition and repainted 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.550
 in order to refurbish the train for 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.690
 the next 10 to 15 years 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.700
 this work in the industrial workshops 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.479
 from yverdon baths for three years 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:14.050
 I followed the training of mechanic 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:16.450
 I work on the bogie cmdt r610 of 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.710
 domino flirt is from gtv 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.170
 I am therefore able 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.050
 to completely dismantle the bogies 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.730
 including frames one proceeds then to 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.160
 their reassembly using elements 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.030
 new and revised and rigorous control 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.560
 of quality and finally it's in 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.420
 the various industrial workshops back the 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.950
 baths that advertising locomotives 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.950
 get their beautiful envelope color
