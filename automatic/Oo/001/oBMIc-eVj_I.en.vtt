good it was best as a mixer more than
anything<00:01:13.409> else<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> didn't<00:01:14.340> taste<00:01:14.490> like

anything else and didn't taste like

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.179 
anything else and didn't taste like
ginger<00:01:14.780> this<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> other<00:01:16.229> hand<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:17.040> very

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
ginger this on the other hand is a very

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.730 
ginger this on the other hand is a very
accurate<00:01:17.820> ginger<00:01:18.420> flavor<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> nice<00:01:19.350> light

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740

lemon<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> background<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
lemon in the background and I think that

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
lemon in the background and I think that
if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> ginger<00:01:23.970> fan<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.900> need<00:01:25.080> to
