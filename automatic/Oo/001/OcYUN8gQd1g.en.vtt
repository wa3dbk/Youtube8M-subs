00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.570
 have a nice day everyone 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.439
 easy 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.619
 on becoming I want to talk about how 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.869
 works 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:26.960
 car key chip know that here such 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:33.470
 keys are called keys inside 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:39.530
 There is a battery here and it seems to be 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.430
 is our safety device 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.280
 the car 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.040
 so how does this key after all 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.750
 he has no contact outside 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.420
 groups 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:55.699
 no let's say other devices where 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.359
 lean either somewhere here you see 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.079
 there is no analysis either 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.229
 contact groups how does it work then 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:09.410
 thanks to what it protects 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:15.940
 car and why is it called 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:17.899
 chip key everything is just this chip key 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.860
 interacts with emily laser 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:28.040
 cars that is the key is located 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:35.299
 specific code that is wired to this chip 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:37.750
 key using a tablet using here 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.509
 This battery is inserted inside 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.100
 he interacts with immobilizer 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:50.060
 cars belozir cars this is 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.649
 the thing is a device that opens 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.079
 chain and vehicle specific chains 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:00.130
 there are immobilizers that open 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.799
 yourself inside the device 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:08.149
 ignition some circuits 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:12.260
 immobilizers that open say 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.120
 so gasoline supply i.e. opens 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.430
 chain 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.010
 gasoline pumps there are also chains that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.010
 more complex ie he is a blogger who 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.140
 more complex do not open its fuel pump 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.100
 and 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.390
 other cycles what happens in general when 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.160
 we insert the chip key in the key 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.780
 well 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:44.750
 when we put the chip-key keyhole 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:47.850
 the chip itself sends a signal 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.250
 immobilizer that he would like his that is, 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.000
 When this is the case here we see 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.730
 there is food that is to 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.160
 immobilizers a certain thing happens 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.120
 voltage that begins to interrogate 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.400
 this chip key chip key is your time 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.340
 meets immobilizer here with 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.800
 special code that have a layer and that is 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:18.330
 thanks to this we can run 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:21.060
 the car and we run 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.510
 car without it 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.050
 car key type you won't even get 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.290
 if you don't mean if you don't 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.340
 what car thief you can't 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.590
 start, that is, if you shove it 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.570
 duplicate only this one here is the key blade 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.780
 without this device 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.380
 the car will not be able 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.890
 car and ask for this answer key not 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.090
 will be 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.230
 the circuits will remain open i.e. 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.519
 cars won't start 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:05.209
 that is, in any case, you need this one 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:08.720
 most part exactly have a key meaning 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.340
 work is very simple 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.190
 everyone probably knows that such here 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.200
 buttons on the intercom 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.169
 when we come home we put 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.990
 this button to a specific nest 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:27.540
 intercom intercom reads this button and 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.120
 does it open to us including absolutely 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.050
 well, if you exaggerate almost such 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.840
 same device 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.900
 that is, bring the key to them belozir 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.990
 unlocks 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.520
 what and how was the car started 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:48.270
 just like on the door we bring 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:52.320
 unlock the lock open beret here 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.780
 such a light article on chip 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.650
 car key 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.880
 here it was helpful for you on this 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.880
