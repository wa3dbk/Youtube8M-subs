like<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.260> major<00:04:23.890> lines<00:04:24.430> go<00:04:24.970> away<00:04:25.890> but<00:04:26.890> what

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
like this major lines go away but what

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.390 
like this major lines go away but what
it<00:04:27.220> is<00:04:27.460> it's<00:04:28.420> like<00:04:29.100> using<00:04:30.420> light<00:04:31.420> and<00:04:32.130> it's<00:04:33.130> an

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
it is it's like using light and it's an

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.890 
it is it's like using light and it's an
optical<00:04:33.820> illusion<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.980> makes<00:04:36.520> your<00:04:36.820> skin<00:04:36.900> see

optical illusion it makes your skin see

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.920 
optical illusion it makes your skin see
I<00:04:38.280> guess<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.730> I<00:04:40.090> don't<00:04:40.630> know

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
I guess it I don't know

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.300 
I guess it I don't know
heck<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.320> don't<00:04:41.530> know<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.740> does<00:04:41.920> I<00:04:42.070> don't<00:04:42.160> know

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
heck I don't know it does I don't know

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.540 
heck I don't know it does I don't know
if<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.490> reflects<00:04:42.940> light<00:04:43.140> absorbs<00:04:44.140> light<00:04:44.550> or

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
if it reflects light absorbs light or

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.240 
if it reflects light absorbs light or
what<00:04:46.170> but<00:04:47.170> I'm<00:04:47.590> just<00:04:47.710> going<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:47.920> kind<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.130> move

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
what but I'm just going to kind of move

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.710 
what but I'm just going to kind of move
around<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:48.790> can<00:04:48.910> see<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.300> different

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
around so you can see the different

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.060 
around so you can see the different
angles<00:04:50.140> that<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.010> lines<00:04:51.280> are<00:04:51.580> still<00:04:52.090> there<00:04:52.360> of

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
angles that the lines are still there of

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.160 
angles that the lines are still there of
course<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.460> wish<00:04:55.450> they<00:04:55.600> weren't<00:04:55.750> but<00:04:55.900> they<00:04:55.960> are

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
course I wish they weren't but they are

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.920 
course I wish they weren't but they are
but<00:04:56.920> when<00:04:57.100> you<00:04:57.250> just<00:04:57.280> look<00:04:57.760> look<00:04:58.360> at<00:04:58.510> them

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930
