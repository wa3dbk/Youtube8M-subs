00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
totally broken and i will see if i can

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.979 
totally broken and i will see if i can
recover<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.370> memory<00:03:11.670> card<00:03:12.030> because<00:03:12.690> we<00:03:12.870> have

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
recover the memory card because we have

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.479 
recover the memory card because we have
started<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.410> front<00:03:13.620> facing<00:03:13.950> camera<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.370> i

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
started the front facing camera and i

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.640 
started the front facing camera and i
want<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:14.940> what<00:03:15.239> happened<00:03:15.720> but<00:03:16.170> yeah<00:03:16.320> i

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
want to see what happened but yeah i

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.530 
want to see what happened but yeah i
guess<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.280> may<00:03:17.489> be<00:03:17.549> has<00:03:17.820> recorded<00:03:18.329> to<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
guess it may be has recorded to the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.300 
guess it may be has recorded to the
internal<00:03:18.780> memory<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.440> then<00:03:19.590> yeah<00:03:19.829> it's<00:03:20.070> gone

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
internal memory and then yeah it's gone

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.460 
internal memory and then yeah it's gone
but<00:03:20.910> here<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.150> see<00:03:21.420> some<00:03:21.450> party<00:03:22.200> from<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
but here you can see some party from the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.860 
but here you can see some party from the
screen<00:03:22.829> digitizer<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.630> how<00:03:24.720> it

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
screen digitizer and this is how it

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.420

probably the best thing we could have

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.330 
probably the best thing we could have
done<00:03:27.900> with<00:03:28.230> those<00:03:28.380> iphone<00:03:28.739> clones<00:03:29.040> because
