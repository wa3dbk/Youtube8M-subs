00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
battleship and like a like a boat like a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.940 
battleship and like a like a boat like a
spaceship<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:15.360> could<00:01:16.350> even<00:01:16.439> almost<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:16.920> like

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
spaceship I could even almost look like

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.260 
spaceship I could even almost look like
it<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> rudder<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:17.939> even<00:01:18.180> though

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
it as a rudder down there even though

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.450 
it as a rudder down there even though
that's<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.930> rudder<00:01:19.140> obviously<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:21.409> yeah

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
that's not a rudder obviously but yeah

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.899 
that's not a rudder obviously but yeah
it's<00:01:23.460> about<00:01:23.970> three<00:01:24.390> feet<00:01:25.020> long<00:01:25.640> roughly<00:01:26.640> maybe

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it's about three feet long roughly maybe

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.480 
it's about three feet long roughly maybe
a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:27.900> about<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
a little a little more about I think the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.190 
a little a little more about I think the
three<00:01:29.700> foot<00:01:29.939> mark<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.329> right<00:01:30.630> about<00:01:30.869> right

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
three foot mark is right about right

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.060 
three foot mark is right about right
about<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:32.869> it's<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.530> half<00:01:34.770> feet

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
about there it's one and a half feet

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.270 
about there it's one and a half feet
tall<00:01:35.930> compared<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> everything<00:01:37.229> else<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.799> in

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
tall compared to everything else and in

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.060 
tall compared to everything else and in
my<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.970> dorm<00:01:39.210> room<00:01:39.390> thanks<00:01:39.900> dream<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.680> met<00:01:40.890> see

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
make any sense at all because I was

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.980 
make any sense at all because I was
pretty<00:02:17.670> sure<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.000> bridge<00:02:18.150> was<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:20.990> there's

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
pretty sure the bridge was here there's

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.190 
pretty sure the bridge was here there's
some<00:02:22.140> coloration<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.100> spire<00:02:23.880> we're<00:02:24.270> due<00:02:25.170> to

some coloration the spire we're due to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.510 
some coloration the spire we're due to
was<00:02:25.590> killed<00:02:26.630> sad<00:02:27.630> because<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.890> again<00:02:29.100> totally

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
was killed sad because and again totally

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.680 
was killed sad because and again totally
should<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.730> died<00:02:29.940> there<00:02:30.180> because<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.510> sees

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
should have died there because it sees
