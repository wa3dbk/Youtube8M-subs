than C 2 or see what I mean of course

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.760 
than C 2 or see what I mean of course
and<00:00:39.860> 7<00:00:40.860> grams<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.550> not<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> big<00:00:42.239> deal<00:00:42.390> really

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
and 7 grams and not a big deal really

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.069

you<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.689> snapdragon<00:01:43.200> 801<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:44.100> don't<00:01:44.759> really

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
you get snapdragon 801 I don't really

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.889 
you get snapdragon 801 I don't really
think<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.479> make<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> difference

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
think that's gonna make a difference

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.749 
think that's gonna make a difference
still<00:01:46.560> same<00:01:46.829> cpu<00:01:47.430> speed<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.180> GPU<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> mean

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
still same cpu speed and GPU so I mean

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.190 
still same cpu speed and GPU so I mean
the<00:01:50.850> key<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.540> would<00:01:51.780> say<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the key thing here I would say is to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.719 
the key thing here I would say is to
display<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.979> also<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:53.549> bit

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
display and also that it's a little bit

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.990 
display and also that it's a little bit
bigger<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.960> want<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.670> also<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
bigger if you want that you get also to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
bigger if you want that you get also to
200<00:01:57.750> million<00:01:58.140> extra<00:01:58.530> hour<00:01:58.710> battery<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.369> it's

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
200 million extra hour battery but it's

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.950 
200 million extra hour battery but it's
a<00:01:59.670> little<00:01:59.820> bit<00:01:59.909> bigger<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.540> could<00:02:00.750> stop

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
a little bit bigger so they could stop

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.080 
a little bit bigger so they could stop
in<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> little<00:02:01.350> bit<00:02:01.439> more<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.890> overall<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.000> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
in a little bit more but overall if you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.160 
in a little bit more but overall if you
have<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> sea<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:04.430> you<00:02:05.430> should<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:06.299> operate

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
have the sea to you should not operate

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.219 
have the sea to you should not operate
it<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.979> if<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> see<00:02:08.640> one

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
it or if you see one

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.869 
it or if you see one
total<00:02:09.769> all<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.039> top<00:02:10.220> rate<00:02:10.399> if<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.580> aren't

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
total all the top rate if you aren't

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.420 
total all the top rate if you aren't
like<00:02:11.060> Bill<00:02:11.360> Gates<00:02:11.390> or<00:02:11.780> something<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.430> you

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
like Bill Gates or something and you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.509 
like Bill Gates or something and you
shouldn't<00:02:13.730> here<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.269> we<00:02:14.390> do<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.659> a<00:02:14.690> Z<00:02:15.019> 2<00:02:15.519> maybe

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
shouldn't here if we do have a Z 2 maybe

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.030 
shouldn't here if we do have a Z 2 maybe
how<00:02:16.760> slightly<00:02:17.540> changing<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.590> sign<00:02:18.799> I'll

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
how slightly changing the sign I'll

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.759 
how slightly changing the sign I'll
think<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.290> mean<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> little<00:02:21.680> bit

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
think so but I mean it's a little bit

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.130 
think so but I mean it's a little bit
bigger<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.209> it's<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.299> little<00:02:23.420> bit<00:02:23.510> different<00:02:23.900> in

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
bigger so it's a little bit different in

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.100 
bigger so it's a little bit different in
that<00:02:24.200> little<00:02:24.680> area<00:02:25.390> but<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.569> regression<00:02:26.989> and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
that little area but and regression and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.500 
that little area but and regression and
all<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.410> should<00:02:27.860> really<00:02:28.459> really<00:02:28.640> be<00:02:28.790> kind<00:02:29.420> of

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
all that should really really be kind of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.780 
all that should really really be kind of
like<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.810> same<00:02:31.599> let's<00:02:32.599> see<00:02:32.720> here<00:02:33.019> do<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:33.590> have

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
like the same let's see here do we have

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.030 
like the same let's see here do we have
I<00:02:34.790> mean<00:02:35.420> there's<00:02:35.599> super<00:02:35.959> super<00:02:36.230> identical<00:02:36.769> the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
I mean there's super super identical the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.890 
I mean there's super super identical the
super<00:02:37.370> super<00:02:37.670> identical<00:02:38.120> buffa<00:02:38.450> big<00:02:38.659> fat

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
super super identical buffa big fat

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.000 
super super identical buffa big fat
places<00:02:39.799> at<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.579> bottom<00:02:41.090> where<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.470> just<00:02:42.799> have

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
places at the bottom where you just have

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.720 
places at the bottom where you just have
a<00:02:43.069> dark<00:02:43.519> thing<00:02:44.120> both<00:02:45.049> big<00:02:45.590> fat<00:02:45.890> borders<00:02:46.459> I

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
a dark thing both big fat borders I

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.830 
a dark thing both big fat borders I
don't<00:02:47.629> really<00:02:47.750> know<00:02:47.989> why<00:02:49.060> honestly<00:02:50.060> they

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
don't really know why honestly they

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.000 
don't really know why honestly they
probably<00:02:50.870> think<00:02:51.349> it<00:02:51.470> looks<00:02:51.620> sexy<00:02:51.950> or

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
probably think it looks sexy or

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.250 
probably think it looks sexy or
something<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:53.390> looks<00:02:53.569> pretty<00:02:53.660> sexy<00:02:54.109> on<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
something it looks pretty sexy on the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.470 
something it looks pretty sexy on the
back<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.950> would<00:02:55.430> say<00:02:55.640> actually<00:02:55.790> we<00:02:56.060> think<00:02:56.299> the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
back I would say actually we think the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.479 
back I would say actually we think the
glass<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.959> everything<00:02:57.379> and<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.920> do<00:02:58.250> enjoy

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
glass and everything and I do enjoy

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.319 
glass and everything and I do enjoy
bigger<00:02:58.970> displace<00:02:59.829> but<00:03:00.829> overall<00:03:01.160> it's<00:03:01.640> really

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
bigger displace but overall it's really

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.870 
bigger displace but overall it's really
too<00:03:02.629> random<00:03:03.620> update<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.250> yeah<00:03:05.060> he's<00:03:05.690> up
