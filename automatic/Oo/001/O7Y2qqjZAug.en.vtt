rotation anti rotation if you've seen
maximum<00:00:35.250> ability<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.700> you've<00:00:36.090> read<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> lot<00:00:36.540> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
maximum ability or you've read a lot of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
maximum ability or you've read a lot of
stuff<00:00:36.930> by<00:00:37.230> great<00:00:38.219> cook<00:00:38.550> or<00:00:39.360> Mike<00:00:39.989> Boyle<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.559> you

stuff by great cook or Mike Boyle or you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.139 
stuff by great cook or Mike Boyle or you
follow<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> joint<00:00:41.340> by<00:00:41.460> joint<00:00:41.489> concept

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
follow that joint by joint concept

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.360 
follow that joint by joint concept
you'll<00:00:42.270> see<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.600> most<00:00:43.050> joints<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.010> need

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you'll see that most joints have a need

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.240 
you'll see that most joints have a need
for<00:00:44.910> either<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.719> mobility<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.680> more

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
for either more mobility or more

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.819 
for either more mobility or more
stability<00:00:48.000> today<00:00:48.960> we're<00:00:49.170> talking<00:00:49.320> mostly

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
stability today we're talking mostly

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
stability today we're talking mostly
about<00:00:49.920> core<00:00:50.430> training<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.120> specifically

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
about core training and specifically

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.240 
about core training and specifically
around<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> low<00:00:52.230> back<00:00:52.500> we're<00:00:52.949> talking<00:00:52.980> about

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
around the low back we're talking about

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.610 
around the low back we're talking about
stability<00:00:54.000> again<00:00:54.629> stability<00:00:55.079> means<00:00:55.320> not

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
stability again stability means not

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
stability again stability means not
moving<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> presence<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.239> potential

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
moving in the presence of potential

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.869 
moving in the presence of potential
change<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> means<00:00:58.260> you're<00:00:58.379> resisting<00:00:58.980> motion

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
change it means you're resisting motion

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
change it means you're resisting motion

your hips and your thoracic spine your
upper<00:01:05.189> back<00:01:05.400> are<00:01:05.760> built<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.689> move<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
upper back are built to move and you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.289 
upper back are built to move and you
want<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> train<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.310> more<00:01:08.700> mobility

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
want to train them to have more mobility

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.120 
want to train them to have more mobility
I<00:01:09.900> want<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.260> lots<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.530> hip<00:01:10.680> mobility<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
I want to have lots of hip mobility I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.600 
I want to have lots of hip mobility I
want<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.520> more<00:01:12.500> thoracic<00:01:13.500> extension<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
want to have more thoracic extension and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.740 
want to have more thoracic extension and
more<00:01:15.090> thoracic<00:01:15.720> rotation<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.570> you're<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
more thoracic rotation so if you're a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
more thoracic rotation so if you're a
person<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> has<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.439> tight<00:01:19.680> hips<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
very tight up and back you're all

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130 
very tight up and back you're all
rounded<00:01:23.070> over<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.270> rotate<00:01:24.570> very

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
rounded over or you don't rotate very

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 
rounded over or you don't rotate very
well<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:26.430> training<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.880> core<00:01:27.030> stability

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
well then training for core stability

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.520 
well then training for core stability
can<00:01:27.509> actually<00:01:27.720> help<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.549> help<00:01:29.549> those

can actually help you help those

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.149 
can actually help you help those
mobilizations<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.590> those<00:01:31.770> stretches<00:01:32.040> that

lack<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.020> stability<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.040> build<00:01:50.220> up

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
lack of stability so if you can build up

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.249 
lack of stability so if you can build up
more<00:01:50.520> stability<00:01:50.820> you're<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.659> likely<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
more stability you're more likely to

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.859 
more stability you're more likely to
stay<00:01:52.680> mobile<00:01:53.340> where<00:01:54.000> you're<00:01:54.149> supposed<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> be

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
stay mobile where you're supposed to be

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.850 
stay mobile where you're supposed to be
mobile<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> way<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.240> Train

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860

all<00:02:15.890> kneeling<00:02:16.640> anti-rotation<00:02:17.540> press<00:02:18.110> you

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
all kneeling anti-rotation press you

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.140 
all kneeling anti-rotation press you
basically<00:02:19.069> get<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.580> little<00:02:19.790> tension<00:02:19.940> on<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
basically get a little tension on the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.430 
basically get a little tension on the
band<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.540> hold<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> right<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.080> front<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.380> you

resisting<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.730> rotation<00:02:25.730> okay<00:02:26.270> so<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.110> number

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
resisting that rotation okay so I number

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.340 
resisting that rotation okay so I number
one<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.640> start<00:02:28.880> here<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.360> like<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.020> hold

one I also like to do inside leg down

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.720 
one I also like to do inside leg down
okay<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.620> if<00:03:06.739> I'm<00:03:06.860> tall<00:03:07.100> kneeling<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:07.610> like

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
okay so if I'm tall kneeling just like

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.430 
okay so if I'm tall kneeling just like
this<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.150> would<00:03:08.420> just<00:03:08.450> step<00:03:08.810> forward<00:03:08.840> until<00:03:09.350> I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
this I would just step forward until I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.410 
this I would just step forward until I
have<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.620> vertical<00:03:09.890> shin<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:11.060> then<00:03:11.180> again

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
have a vertical shin and then again

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.610 
have a vertical shin and then again
holds<00:03:12.019> my<00:03:12.170> chest

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
holds my chest

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.880 
holds my chest
and<00:03:12.830> I<00:03:13.580> would<00:03:13.880> pull<00:03:14.090> right<00:03:14.239> here<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:16.790> also<00:03:17.030> I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
and I would pull right here then also I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.300 
and I would pull right here then also I
like<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.010> have<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.250> band<00:03:19.459> above<00:03:19.850> my<00:03:20.030> hands<00:03:20.450> so

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
like to have the band above my hands so

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.680 
like to have the band above my hands so
another<00:03:22.310> variation<00:03:22.610> is<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.910> do<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.180> standing

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
another variation is to do it standing

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.440 
another variation is to do it standing
so<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.140> usually<00:03:24.290> raise<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.860> band<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:26.329> then

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
so I usually raise the band and then

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.150 
so I usually raise the band and then
again<00:03:26.630> same<00:03:26.840> thing<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:27.350> can<00:03:27.620> do<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:27.769> little<00:03:28.040> bit

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
again same thing I can do a little bit

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.430 
again same thing I can do a little bit
of<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:29.000> know<00:03:29.060> maybe<00:03:29.239> like<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.480> 1/8<00:03:29.959> squat

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
of a you know maybe like a 1/8 squat

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.890 
of a you know maybe like a 1/8 squat
knees<00:03:30.739> out<00:03:30.980> good<00:03:31.280> posture<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:31.970> then<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.600> press

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
knees out good posture and then I press

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.479 
knees out good posture and then I press
the<00:03:33.019> band<00:03:33.140> right<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.410> front<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.680> me<00:03:33.799> hold<00:03:34.400> that

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
the band right in front of me hold that

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.210 
the band right in front of me hold that
position<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.120> then<00:03:35.329> again<00:03:35.570> always<00:03:36.500> on<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
position and then again always on the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.699 
position and then again always on the
other<00:03:37.370> side<00:03:37.840> whichever<00:03:38.840> side<00:03:39.200> tends<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.620> be

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
other side whichever side tends to be

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.770 
other side whichever side tends to be
the<00:03:39.829> hardest<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.820> side<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.269> do<00:03:41.329> first

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
the hardest is the side that I do first

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.840 
the hardest is the side that I do first
and<00:03:42.079> then<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.350> usually<00:03:42.500> match<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.220> time<00:03:43.430> on<00:03:43.700> the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
and then I usually match the time on the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.210 
and then I usually match the time on the
other<00:03:43.880> side<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.390> if<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.570> can<00:03:44.720> do<00:03:44.980> excuse<00:03:45.980> me<00:03:46.100> if<00:03:46.160> I

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
other side so if I can do excuse me if I

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.770 
other side so if I can do excuse me if I
can<00:03:46.370> do<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.489> minute<00:03:46.850> on<00:03:46.940> one<00:03:47.090> side<00:03:47.299> only<00:03:47.329> 40

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
can do a minute on one side only 40

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.509 
can do a minute on one side only 40
seconds<00:03:48.049> on<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.200> other<00:03:48.290> side<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.769> do<00:03:49.070> 40

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
seconds on the other side I do 40

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.280 
seconds on the other side I do 40
seconds<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.000> then<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.180> match<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.690> 40<00:03:50.930> seconds

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
seconds and then I match the 40 seconds

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.800 
seconds and then I match the 40 seconds
on<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.829> other<00:03:52.010> side<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.310> try<00:03:52.609> to<00:03:52.670> even<00:03:53.090> up<00:03:53.239> that

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
on the other side I try to even up that

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.490 
on the other side I try to even up that
strength<00:03:54.440> imbalance<00:03:55.220> or<00:03:55.370> asymmetry<00:03:56.299> okay<00:03:57.049> so

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
strength imbalance or asymmetry okay so

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.509 
strength imbalance or asymmetry okay so
that's<00:03:57.620> kind<00:03:57.769> of<00:03:57.829> your<00:03:57.920> level<00:03:58.310> one

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
that's kind of your level one

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.699 
that's kind of your level one
anti-rotation<00:03:59.269> movements<00:03:59.930> your<00:04:00.380> training

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
anti-rotation movements your training

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.410 
anti-rotation movements your training
all<00:04:00.920> those<00:04:01.160> muscles<00:04:01.519> in<00:04:01.640> your<00:04:01.700> core<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.180> also

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
all those muscles in your core and also

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.090 
all those muscles in your core and also
training<00:04:02.660> all<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:02.959> your<00:04:03.260> internal<00:04:04.010> and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
training all of your internal and

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.449 
training all of your internal and
external<00:04:04.280> rotators<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.600> your<00:04:06.049> hip<00:04:06.320> so<00:04:06.859> there's

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
external rotators of your hip so there's

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.340 
external rotators of your hip so there's
a<00:04:07.519> great<00:04:07.760> way<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:07.940> do<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.480> do<00:04:08.630> abs<00:04:08.870> without

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
a great way to do to do abs without

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.170 
a great way to do to do abs without
looking<00:04:09.650> like<00:04:09.680> you're<00:04:09.920> doing<00:04:10.250> abs<00:04:10.519> if<00:04:11.000> you're

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
looking like you're doing abs if you're

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.930 
looking like you're doing abs if you're
a<00:04:11.239> person<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:11.600> likes<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.870> do<00:04:12.049> abs<00:04:12.260> but<00:04:13.010> the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
a person that likes to do abs but the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.830 
a person that likes to do abs but the
other<00:04:14.120> way<00:04:14.299> that<00:04:14.510> I<00:04:14.540> like<00:04:16.660> very<00:04:17.660> similar

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
other way that I like very similar

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.420 
other way that I like very similar
it's<00:04:19.290> here<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.810> decide<00:04:22.200> I'm<00:04:22.860> not<00:04:22.919> really

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
it's here so I decide I'm not really

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.350 
it's here so I decide I'm not really
moving<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:24.120> whole<00:04:24.720> lot<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.760> have<00:04:26.760> my<00:04:26.910> shoulders

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
moving a whole lot I have my shoulders

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.810 
moving a whole lot I have my shoulders
or<00:04:27.570> at<00:04:27.690> my<00:04:27.980> in<00:04:28.980> my<00:04:29.160> trunk<00:04:29.460> I'm<00:04:29.610> not<00:04:29.700> really

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
or at my in my trunk I'm not really

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.700 
or at my in my trunk I'm not really
rotating<00:04:30.360> I'm<00:04:30.630> just<00:04:30.810> getting<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.139> load<00:04:31.350> off<00:04:31.590> to

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
rotating I'm just getting a load off to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.159 
rotating I'm just getting a load off to
the<00:04:31.800> side<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.910> getting<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.240> load<00:04:33.419> off<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:34.050> the

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
the side and getting a load off to the

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.810 
the side and getting a load off to the
other<00:04:34.290> side<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:35.280> want<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.490> make<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.760> a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
other side you want to make that a

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.140 
other side you want to make that a
little<00:04:35.970> bit<00:04:36.150> harder<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:37.650> can<00:04:37.770> add<00:04:38.090> if<00:04:39.090> you

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
little bit harder you can add if you

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.450 
little bit harder you can add if you
have<00:04:39.450> one<00:04:39.600> of<00:04:39.690> these<00:04:39.750> fancy<00:04:40.200> B<00:04:40.500> handles<00:04:40.950> you

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
have one of these fancy B handles you

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.590 
have one of these fancy B handles you
can<00:04:41.810> make<00:04:42.810> that<00:04:43.669> make<00:04:44.669> that<00:04:44.850> moment<00:04:45.120> arm<00:04:45.419> a

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
can make that make that moment arm a

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.690 
can make that make that moment arm a
little<00:04:45.900> bit<00:04:45.990> longer<00:04:46.250> which<00:04:47.250> makes<00:04:47.520> your

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
little bit longer which makes your

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.650 
little bit longer which makes your
leverage<00:04:49.040> more<00:04:50.040> poor<00:04:50.430> which<00:04:51.090> makes<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.479> a<00:04:51.540> lot

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
leverage more poor which makes it a lot

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.909 
leverage more poor which makes it a lot
harder<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.500> I<00:04:52.620> can't<00:04:52.860> quite<00:04:53.040> go<00:04:53.190> as<00:04:53.340> far<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.800> I

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
harder so I can't quite go as far and I

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.080 
harder so I can't quite go as far and I
can't<00:04:56.130> quite<00:04:56.220> go<00:04:56.430> as<00:04:56.460> far<00:04:56.700> on<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.820> other<00:04:56.850> side

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
can't quite go as far on the other side

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.420 
can't quite go as far on the other side
too<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.510> actually<00:04:57.960> like<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.650> better

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
too I actually like that better

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.300 
too I actually like that better
I<00:04:59.460> like<00:05:00.389> making<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:00.990> heavier<00:05:01.350> by<00:05:01.590> using<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.190> V

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
I like making it heavier by using the V

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.790 
I like making it heavier by using the V
handle<00:05:02.669> because<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.270> makes<00:05:03.479> your<00:05:03.630> motion<00:05:04.139> very

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
handle because it makes your motion very

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.100 
handle because it makes your motion very
small<00:05:05.190> side<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.700> side<00:05:05.940> if<00:05:06.510> it's<00:05:06.690> very<00:05:06.840> light

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
small side to side if it's very light

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.930 
small side to side if it's very light
then<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.740> go<00:05:07.860> way<00:05:08.010> over<00:05:08.220> here<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.639> I'm<00:05:08.760> more

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
then I go way over here and I'm more

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.969 
then I go way over here and I'm more
likely<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.270> chase<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.870> weight<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.290> rotate<00:05:10.889> it

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
likely to chase the weight and rotate it

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.890 
likely to chase the weight and rotate it
a<00:05:11.070> lot<00:05:11.370> instead<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.240> just<00:05:12.330> doing<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.570> very<00:05:12.690> small

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
a lot instead of just doing a very small

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.930 
a lot instead of just doing a very small
motion<00:05:13.260> staying<00:05:13.770> very<00:05:13.919> stable<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.700> I'm<00:05:14.790> not

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
motion staying very stable and I'm not

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.820 
motion staying very stable and I'm not
really<00:05:15.120> getting<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.479> lot<00:05:15.510> of<00:05:15.750> emotion<00:05:16.229> so<00:05:16.590> I

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830

and my shoulders are facing the same
direction<00:06:35.369> here<00:06:37.020> there<00:06:38.020> and<00:06:38.619> ask<00:06:38.740> me<00:06:38.889> more<00:06:39.009> a

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
direction here there and ask me more a

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:40.049 
direction here there and ask me more a
couple<00:06:39.339> with<00:06:39.459> it<00:06:39.520> you<00:06:39.610> can<00:06:39.729> start<00:06:39.909> to<00:06:39.969> go

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:40.059 
couple with it you can start to go

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:41.489 
couple with it you can start to go
faster<00:06:40.209> and<00:06:40.419> faster<00:06:40.509> faster<00:06:41.080> it<00:06:41.169> turns<00:06:41.379> into

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:41.499 
faster and faster faster it turns into

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:49.170 
faster and faster faster it turns into
more<00:06:41.559> athletic<00:06:42.129> movement<00:06:42.490> so<00:06:42.699> I'm<00:06:42.789> here<00:06:48.180> and

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
more athletic movement so I'm here and

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.679 
more athletic movement so I'm here and
then<00:06:49.389> also<00:06:50.369> with<00:06:51.369> that<00:06:51.639> you<00:06:52.119> can<00:06:52.360> add

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:52.689 
then also with that you can add

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:55.230 
then also with that you can add
resistance<00:06:53.259> and<00:06:53.499> add<00:06:53.709> the<00:06:54.520> V<00:06:54.699> handle<00:06:55.119> which

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
resistance and add the V handle which

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:03.719 
resistance and add the V handle which
makes<00:06:55.270> it<00:06:55.629> significantly<00:06:56.589> harder<00:07:02.490> come<00:07:03.490> here

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
makes it significantly harder come here

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.049 
makes it significantly harder come here
when<00:07:04.330> I<00:07:04.360> have<00:07:04.509> to<00:07:04.629> be<00:07:04.839> handle<00:07:05.819> again<00:07:06.819> the

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:07.059 
when I have to be handle again the

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.989 
when I have to be handle again the
entire<00:07:07.360> handle<00:07:07.869> will<00:07:07.959> be<00:07:07.990> behind<00:07:08.529> me<00:07:08.680> I'll<00:07:09.369> be

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:09.999 
entire handle will be behind me I'll be

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:11.699 
entire handle will be behind me I'll be
standing<00:07:10.149> tall<00:07:10.330> both<00:07:10.719> feet<00:07:10.990> facing<00:07:11.499> one<00:07:11.680> way

standing tall both feet facing one way

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:17.279
