00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.290 

my<00:00:00.659> first<00:00:00.930> impression<00:00:01.410> of<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.620> v1<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.210> that<00:00:03.210> it

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
my first impression of the v1 is that it

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.590 
my first impression of the v1 is that it
is<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.449> capable<00:00:03.990> little<00:00:04.259> camera<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:05.060> have<00:00:06.060> only

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
is a capable little camera I have only

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.220 
is a capable little camera I have only
the<00:00:07.350> kit<00:00:07.560> lens<00:00:07.589> so<00:00:08.250> far<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.110> ten<00:00:10.110> to

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the kit lens so far it is the ten to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.259 
the kit lens so far it is the ten to
thirty<00:00:10.440> which<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.700> 35<00:00:12.059> millimeter

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
thirty which is the 35 millimeter

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.210 
thirty which is the 35 millimeter
equivalent<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:14.160> 27<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.059> 81<00:00:15.650> and<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.980> have

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
equivalent of about 27 to 81 and I have

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.859 
equivalent of about 27 to 81 and I have
the<00:00:17.640> speed<00:00:18.150> light<00:00:18.330> which<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> SB<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.130> five

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
the speed light which is the SB and five

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.450 
the speed light which is the SB and five
this<00:00:21.869> speed<00:00:22.199> light<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.619> really<00:00:22.949> nice<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.340> have

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
this speed light is really nice to have

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.429 
this speed light is really nice to have
with<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> v1<00:00:24.150> because<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.840> body<00:00:25.019> itself

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
with the v1 because the body itself

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.269 
with the v1 because the body itself
lacks<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.789> onboard<00:00:27.390> flash<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> kind<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
lacks and onboard flash so you kind of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.240 
lacks and onboard flash so you kind of
need<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.840> this<00:00:30.840> little<00:00:31.019> flash<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.590> powered

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
need this this little flash is powered

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.360 
need this this little flash is powered
from<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> camera's<00:00:33.239> battery<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.040> well<00:00:35.040> it's

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
from the camera's battery and well it's

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.400 
from the camera's battery and well it's
definitely<00:00:35.670> proof<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.329> big<00:00:36.690> things<00:00:36.719> can

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
definitely proof that big things can

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
definitely proof that big things can
come<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.829> small<00:00:37.860> packages<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.270> ton<00:00:40.110> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
come in small packages because a ton of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.780 
come in small packages because a ton of
light<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.890> come<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.309> flash<00:00:41.579> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
light can come out of this flash it's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.430 
light can come out of this flash it's
kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.000> amazing<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> I've<00:00:44.910> used<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.260> camera

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
kind of amazing so I've used the camera

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.369 
kind of amazing so I've used the camera
quite<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:47.010> I've<00:00:47.670> used<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.149> around<00:00:48.539> town<00:00:48.780> but

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
quite a bit I've used it around town but

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.830 
quite a bit I've used it around town but
I've<00:00:49.739> also<00:00:49.980> used<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.820> some<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.390> serious

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I've also used it for some more serious

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
I've also used it for some more serious
stuff<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.739> took<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> Grand

Canyon and I used it for some landscapes
and<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.390> also<00:00:57.719> used<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.770> studio<00:00:59.690> like<00:01:00.690> I

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
said before all's well I found it to be

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
said before all's well I found it to be
quite<00:01:04.979> responsive<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:06.600> it's

quite responsive and really it's
exceeded<00:01:07.140> my<00:01:07.229> expectations<00:01:08.900> responsiveness

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
exceeded my expectations responsiveness

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.889 

I<00:01:50.039> used<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> camera<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.210> aperture<00:01:51.659> priority

I used the camera in aperture priority
when<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.039> canyon<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.610> usually

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

studio<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.910> had<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.870> speed<00:02:13.380> light<00:02:13.910> SPM<00:02:14.910> 5<00:02:15.120> on

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
studio I had the speed light SPM 5 on

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.380 
studio I had the speed light SPM 5 on
manual<00:02:16.440> output<00:02:16.830> which<00:02:17.250> optically<00:02:17.940> triggered

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
manual output which optically triggered

Turner<00:04:20.819> of<00:04:20.879> the<00:04:21.000> body<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.660> can<00:04:21.690> see<00:04:22.019> it's

pretty<00:04:22.470> it's<00:04:23.250> pretty<00:04:23.360> spare<00:04:24.770> um<00:04:25.849> some<00:04:26.849> people

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879 
pretty it's pretty spare um some people

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.029 
pretty it's pretty spare um some people
say<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.270> price<00:04:27.449> is<00:04:27.569> too<00:04:27.750> high<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.289> the

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
say the price is too high and the

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.890 
say the price is too high and the
biggest<00:04:29.490> criticism<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.120> think<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.479> that<00:04:30.509> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
biggest criticism I think is that the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.420 
biggest criticism I think is that the
sensor<00:04:31.590> isn't<00:04:31.800> big<00:04:32.129> enough

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
sensor isn't big enough

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.390 
sensor isn't big enough
now<00:04:33.389> I'm<00:04:33.690> getting<00:04:34.110> crisp<00:04:34.620> images<00:04:35.099> and<00:04:35.280> low

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
now I'm getting crisp images and low

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.999 
now I'm getting crisp images and low
light<00:04:35.669> at<00:04:35.940> high<00:04:36.270> ISO<00:04:36.449> with<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.080> camera<00:04:37.470> so<00:04:37.770> I

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
light at high ISO with the camera so I

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.800 
light at high ISO with the camera so I
don't<00:04:38.580> know<00:04:38.639> it<00:04:38.789> seems<00:04:39.000> like<00:04:39.090> technology<00:04:39.690> is

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
don't know it seems like technology is

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.540 
don't know it seems like technology is
getting<00:04:40.050> past<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.470> days<00:04:40.650> when<00:04:40.979> a<00:04:41.009> smaller

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
getting past the days when a smaller

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.839 
getting past the days when a smaller
sensor<00:04:42.030> meant<00:04:42.389> much<00:04:42.690> higher<00:04:43.460> noise<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.819> your
