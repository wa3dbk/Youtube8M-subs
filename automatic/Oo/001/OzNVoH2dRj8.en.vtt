that up a little bit and I always seem

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.260 
that up a little bit and I always seem
to<00:01:48.650> miss<00:01:48.890> something<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.340> know<00:01:49.399> there's<00:01:50.090> been<00:01:50.210> a

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
to miss something I know there's been a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.810 
to miss something I know there's been a
few<00:01:50.450> videos<00:01:50.810> where<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.170> miss<00:01:51.409> something<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.930> I

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
few videos where I miss something and I

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.249 
few videos where I miss something and I
guess<00:01:55.820> that<00:01:55.850> could<00:01:56.180> happen<00:01:56.390> we<00:01:56.659> are<00:01:56.780> all<00:01:56.930> human

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
guess that could happen we are all human

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.460 
guess that could happen we are all human
are<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.470> no<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.810> know<00:01:59.899> by<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.140> end<00:02:00.350> I

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
are we no and you know by the end I

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.539 
are we no and you know by the end I
probably<00:02:00.649> eat<00:02:00.829> them<00:02:00.979> all<00:02:01.070> anyway<00:02:01.220> at<00:02:01.490> some

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
probably eat them all anyway at some

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.359 
probably eat them all anyway at some
point<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.590> did<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:04.340> miss<00:02:04.549> any<00:02:04.729> flavors<00:02:06.219> does<00:02:07.219> it

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
point so did I miss any flavors does it
