00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
not dead it's it's pretty obvious why

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.010 
not dead it's it's pretty obvious why
she's<00:00:56.640> not<00:00:56.789> dead<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.449> there's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
she's not dead because there's a lot of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.810 
she's not dead because there's a lot of
mysteries<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.559> things<00:00:59.039> behind<00:00:59.370> injury<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
mysteries and things behind injury that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.549 
mysteries and things behind injury that
we<00:00:59.879> still<00:01:00.090> need<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.449> more<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:00.690> but

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we still need to know more about but

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.619 
we still need to know more about but
anyways<00:01:02.160> besides<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:03.000> okay<00:01:03.329> let's<00:01:03.510> talk

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
anyways besides that okay let's talk

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.179 
anyways besides that okay let's talk
about<00:01:03.690> exactly<00:01:04.049> what<00:01:04.409> would<00:01:04.500> happen<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:04.920> inju

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
about exactly what would happen if inju

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
about exactly what would happen if inju
does<00:01:05.460> live<00:01:05.760> okay<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.390> engine<00:01:06.689> does<00:01:06.840> live<00:01:07.049> most

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
does live okay if engine does live most

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
does live okay if engine does live most
likely<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> professor<00:01:08.159> knows<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.580> injury

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
likely the professor knows that injury

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
likely the professor knows that injury
most<00:01:08.970> likely<00:01:09.060> either<00:01:09.360> turned<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> gotcha

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
most likely either turned into a gotcha

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.260 
most likely either turned into a gotcha
or<00:01:10.799> she<00:01:11.040> will<00:01:11.189> survive<00:01:11.460> from<00:01:11.790> turning<00:01:12.090> into<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
or she will survive from turning into a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.640 
or she will survive from turning into a
grocery<00:01:12.420> after<00:01:12.810> fifty<00:01:13.049> percent<00:01:13.290> maybe<00:01:13.439> she'll

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
grocery after fifty percent maybe she'll

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
grocery after fifty percent maybe she'll
be<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> special<00:01:14.220> type<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> cursed<00:01:14.790> child<00:01:15.030> either

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
be a special type of cursed child either

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.630

as I said you could not possibly be dead

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
as I said you could not possibly be dead
in<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.860> episode<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.640> Tina<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.030> scared

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
in this episode we see Tina a scared

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.700 
in this episode we see Tina a scared
little<00:01:36.630> cursed<00:01:36.990> child<00:01:37.170> girl<00:01:37.470> she's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
little cursed child girl she's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.020 
little cursed child girl she's
technically<00:01:38.070> still<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> little<00:01:38.490> girl<00:01:38.729> that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
technically still a little girl that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.640 
technically still a little girl that
could<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.509> kill<00:01:39.840> someone<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.170> he<00:01:40.409> saw<00:01:40.590> her

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
could not kill someone like he saw her

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
could not kill someone like he saw her
in<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.009> episode<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> regular<00:01:42.329> human

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
in this episode and was a regular human

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.960 
in this episode and was a regular human
so<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.439> I'm<00:01:43.530> getting<00:01:43.829> at<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.340> highly<00:01:44.729> doubt

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so what I'm getting at is I highly doubt

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.700 
so what I'm getting at is I highly doubt
Tina<00:01:45.299> could<00:01:45.540> come<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.930> terms<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.290> killing

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
Tina could come to terms with killing

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.090 
Tina could come to terms with killing
someone

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
someone

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.530 
someone
it<00:01:47.280> looks<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.549> she<00:01:47.759> could<00:01:47.880> mortally<00:01:48.299> wound

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it looks like she could mortally wound

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.940 
it looks like she could mortally wound
and<00:01:48.810> juice<00:01:48.960> since<00:01:49.200> she<00:01:49.290> knows<00:01:49.409> she's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> cursed

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and juice since she knows she's a cursed

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.389 
and juice since she knows she's a cursed
child

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
child

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429 
child
I<00:01:50.490> highly<00:01:51.060> doubt<00:01:51.090> Tina<00:01:51.570> actually<00:01:52.079> killed<00:01:52.290> in

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
I highly doubt Tina actually killed in

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.690 
I highly doubt Tina actually killed in
juice<00:01:52.590> oh<00:01:52.710> there's<00:01:52.890> another<00:01:53.040> reason<00:01:53.369> actually
