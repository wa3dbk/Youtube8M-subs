attached<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.390> fence<00:01:24.810> post<00:01:25.460> twist<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.580> into<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
attached to a fence post twist it into a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
attached to a fence post twist it into a
shape<00:01:27.060> such<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.720> stand<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
shape such that it can stand up just

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.560 
shape such that it can stand up just
like<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> tripod<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.329> really

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
like a tripod so this is really

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.850 
like a tripod so this is really
versatile<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> lot<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
versatile you can actually do a lot of

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.380 
versatile you can actually do a lot of
things<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.970> nice<00:01:33.150> thing<00:01:33.329> about

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
things with this the nice thing about

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.120 
things with this the nice thing about
these<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.930> they're<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.380> durable<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
these is that they're very durable the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.670 
these is that they're very durable the
very<00:01:35.729> nice<00:01:35.939> build<00:01:36.210> quality<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.350> example

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
very nice build quality so for example

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
very nice build quality so for example
on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> head<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.850> feels<00:01:39.570> like

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
on the head here these are feels like

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.940 
on the head here these are feels like
they're<00:01:40.049> machined<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:42.229> pretty<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.530> think

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
they're machined out of pretty I think

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.609 
they're machined out of pretty I think
it's<00:01:44.100> aluminum<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.540> very<00:01:45.840> solid

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it's aluminum so it's it's very solid

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.109

it<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:26.040> know<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.340> think<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:26.670> going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.819> work

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
it you know I think it's going to work

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.400 
it you know I think it's going to work
with<00:03:27.120> pretty<00:03:27.329> much<00:03:27.480> any<00:03:27.720> any<00:03:28.560> phone<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:30.380> what<00:03:31.380> I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
with pretty much any any phone so what I

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.050 
with pretty much any any phone so what I
found<00:03:31.769> most<00:03:32.010> useful<00:03:32.160> about<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.730> Q<00:03:33.000> stand

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
found most useful about the Q stand

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.360 
found most useful about the Q stand
versus<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.049> tripod<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.889> Q<00:03:35.100> stand<00:03:37.370> not

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
versus the tripod is the Q stand not

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.460 
versus the tripod is the Q stand not
only<00:03:38.579> for<00:03:38.760> holding<00:03:39.030> your<00:03:39.120> phone<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.600> mounting

it<00:03:40.560> pretty<00:03:40.829> much<00:03:40.950> anywhere<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
it pretty much anywhere and you can you

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.660 
it pretty much anywhere and you can you
know<00:03:42.630> mount<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.170> again<00:03:43.769> fence<00:03:44.069> posts<00:03:44.549> you

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
know mount it to again fence posts you

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.160 
know mount it to again fence posts you
can<00:03:44.700> amount<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.389> tree<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.870> could<00:03:46.019> mount

can amount it to a tree you could mount

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.800 
can amount it to a tree you could mount

and then I attached the stand to the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.980 
and then I attached the stand to the
quarter<00:04:42.689> twenty<00:04:43.110> thread<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:44.280> comes<00:04:44.550> on<00:04:44.729> the

twisty part here of the Q stand just
attach<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.289> then<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.680> could<00:04:49.830> use<00:04:49.860> this

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
attach that and then I could use this

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.179 
attach that and then I could use this
twisty<00:04:50.520> part<00:04:50.759> to<00:04:51.030> attach<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.409> a<00:04:52.439> microphone

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
twisty part to attach it to a microphone

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.459 
twisty part to attach it to a microphone
stand<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.819> mount<00:04:54.389> my<00:04:54.539> microphone<00:04:55.110> right<00:04:55.439> up

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
stand and mount my microphone right up

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.740 
stand and mount my microphone right up
near<00:04:56.009> my<00:04:56.189> talent<00:04:56.610> just<00:04:56.639> outside<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.509> frame

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
near my talent just outside of the frame

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.409 
near my talent just outside of the frame
so<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:58.259> find<00:04:59.159> it<00:04:59.250> actually<00:04:59.370> super<00:04:59.940> helpful<00:05:00.270> for

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419

so I find it actually super helpful for
that<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:00.840> really<00:05:01.139> liked<00:05:01.289> it<00:05:01.319> the<00:05:01.620> twisty<00:05:01.979> part

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
that and really liked it the twisty part

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.119 
that and really liked it the twisty part
is<00:05:02.400> actually<00:05:02.819> also<00:05:02.969> a<00:05:03.120> really<00:05:03.800> pretty<00:05:04.800> unique

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
is actually also a really pretty unique

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.320
