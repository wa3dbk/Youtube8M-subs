to instruct this turbo installed so for

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.410 
to instruct this turbo installed so for
that<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.469> need<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> go<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.219> local<00:00:35.850> disk<00:00:36.000> C

now press okay yeah this was for your
propanil<00:03:11.319> of<00:03:11.470> your<00:03:11.680> C++<00:03:12.040> for<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.670> first<00:03:12.910> time

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
propanil of your C++ for the first time

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.260 
propanil of your C++ for the first time
yeah<00:03:13.270> now<00:03:14.200> what<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.530> would<00:03:14.920> like<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.459> do<00:03:16.090> is

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
yeah now what I would like you to do is

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.410 
yeah now what I would like you to do is
instead<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.350> typing<00:03:17.739> all<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:18.310> code<00:03:19.120> and

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
instead of typing all this code and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.590 
instead of typing all this code and
whenever<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.590> open<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.340> C++<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.209> can<00:03:22.360> mount

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
whenever you open the C++ you can mount

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.090 
whenever you open the C++ you can mount
all<00:03:22.900> these<00:03:23.530> code<00:03:23.800> or<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.330> your<00:03:25.690> C++

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
all these code or so that your C++

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.430 
all these code or so that your C++
automatically<00:03:27.100> gets<00:03:27.370> these<00:03:28.030> code<00:03:28.360> DOSBox<00:03:29.140> get

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
automatically gets these code DOSBox get

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.420 
automatically gets these code DOSBox get
all<00:03:29.830> these<00:03:30.370> codes<00:03:30.780> when<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.870> click<00:03:32.080> it

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
all these codes when you click it

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.590 
all these codes when you click it
automatically<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:33.700> for<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.239> need<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.390> go

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
automatically so for that you need to go

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.800 
automatically so for that you need to go
to<00:03:34.660> your<00:03:34.870> start<00:03:35.650> then<00:03:36.550> all<00:03:36.790> programs<00:03:36.940> then<00:03:37.630> you

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
to your start then all programs then you

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.259 
to your start then all programs then you
will<00:03:38.380> see<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.800> new<00:03:38.980> list<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.670> programs<00:03:40.030> yeah

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
will see the new list of programs yeah

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.110 
will see the new list of programs yeah
that<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.630> there's<00:03:40.900> DOSBox<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:42.519> need<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.790> open

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
that is there's DOSBox you need to open

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.440 
that is there's DOSBox you need to open
it<00:03:43.980> after<00:03:44.980> opening<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:46.000> need<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.239> go<00:03:46.390> to

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
it after opening you need to go to

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.100 
it after opening you need to go to
options<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:48.069> options<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:49.000> first<00:03:49.300> one<00:03:49.569> that<00:03:49.930> is

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
options in options the first one that is

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.729 
options in options the first one that is
DOSBox<00:03:50.850> 0.74<00:03:51.850> click<00:03:52.390> on<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.690> then<00:03:53.500> press

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
DOSBox 0.74 click on that then press

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.440 
DOSBox 0.74 click on that then press
control<00:03:54.310> end

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
control end

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.960

you<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:56.050> put<00:03:56.709> your<00:03:56.890> mount<00:03:57.160> lines<00:03:57.459> here<00:03:57.730> yeah

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
you can put your mount lines here yeah

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.400 
you can put your mount lines here yeah
yeah<00:03:58.450> over<00:03:59.110> here

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
don't have to type type the codes just

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.219 
don't have to type type the codes just
see<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.479> I<00:04:51.689> click<00:04:52.650> DOSBox<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.960> magically
