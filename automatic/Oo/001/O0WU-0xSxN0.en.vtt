00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.090
 hello to everyone I'm betty and 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.450
 welcome once again to my channel os 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.700
 I bring the winner of the sixth challenge of 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.439
 48 hours black ops 2 and good the winner 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.480
 he has been hector I do not know how he will want me to 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.570
 call because your goal that is sector 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.630
 but they have always compressed and good here 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.489
 you have your game the truth that I have 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.440
 to say that there have been many trolls 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.620
 on twitter because I asked when 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.960
 You are telling me 6 20 25 30 35 and of course 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.730
 yes, I was telling him, but for 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.510
 make sure next time until I 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.000
 do not watch the video I will not say low scores 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.760
 It takes someone because if not here it is not 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.550
 can anyone trust anything and good and the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.350
 truth is that it is in the largest 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.160
 score that has arrived that are 23 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.560
 low 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.180
 and the truth that I was surprised that the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.180
 people did so much because I for more 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.800
 that proved this challenge was very difficult 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.950
 but for the fact that fuck 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.900
 laos with nova in this game but good 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.170
 here the winner of this week has gotten 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.720
 in your channel and well do not upload many 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.250
 videos but the ones that add the last 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.740
 episode that has that is called mini that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.150
 makes episodes in plan with the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.570
 sniper 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.180
 and you last the last one lasts a little hard 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.080
 minute but I advise you to see it because 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.140
 have is not a person who has 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.180
 standards but has shots really 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.940
 good in plan shoot the shield and kill 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.370
 someone throws the c4 shoot at c4 and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.520
 let someone die and the truth is that they are 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.610
 it's a different episode than what 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.830
 I usually see is older and has me 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.330
 called attention and not because 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.100
 have to promote not because you have 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.840
 won is that it really has impressed me 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.020
 an episode like that not that long ago 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.229
 that I did not see anyone vary in the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.850
 episodes so good to look at this 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.960
 triple hit that is made that I believe 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.880
 that all the time been pointing to that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.470
 more expensive had and killed the one behind and 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.450
 well, that's how the cars go in this 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.420
 game so good and good and also 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.070
 It has a mount which is so 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.170
 seen in the description about to leave 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.330
 and so good if you want to follow your 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.890
 channel the channel will be the description and 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.000
 if you want to wait for the montage that I 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.160
 I think it's going to look good because 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.350
 the minis he already has 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.770
 I was shocked and I did not roll up 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.840
 more going through your channel and stay tuned 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.790

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.500
