00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.929 

let's<00:00:01.530> do<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.709> practice<00:00:01.979> problem<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.639> see<00:00:02.790> how

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
let's do a practice problem to see how

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.720 
let's do a practice problem to see how
well<00:00:03.120> we<00:00:03.330> understand<00:00:04.040> when<00:00:05.040> torque<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.520> bigger

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
well we understand when torque of bigger

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.909 
well we understand when torque of bigger
and<00:00:05.940> when<00:00:06.029> it's<00:00:06.150> small<00:00:06.420> let's<00:00:07.290> imagine<00:00:07.500> again

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
and when it's small let's imagine again

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.080 
and when it's small let's imagine again
we're<00:00:08.069> going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.370> pulling<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:08.790> our<00:00:08.880> wrench

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
we're going to be pulling on our wrench

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.180 
we're going to be pulling on our wrench
and<00:00:09.360> trying<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.780> turn<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> bolt<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:11.040> have<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and trying to turn a bolt we have a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.830 
and trying to turn a bolt we have a
certain<00:00:11.580> amount<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.880> force<00:00:12.120> F<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.660> we're

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
certain amount of force F that we're

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.259 
certain amount of force F that we're
able<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.139> muster<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.759> we're<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.059> try<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
able to muster and we're going to try to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.330 
able to muster and we're going to try to
use<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.990> force<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.500> various<00:00:16.859> ways<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
use that force in various ways to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.640 
use that force in various ways to
maximize<00:00:17.520> our<00:00:18.029> torque<00:00:18.330> now<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.260> all<00:00:19.439> know<00:00:19.470> that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
maximize our torque now we all know that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.290 
maximize our torque now we all know that
if<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.130> want<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.460> pull<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.820> wrench<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
if you want to pull on a wrench the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880 
if you want to pull on a wrench the
Basques<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.990> would<00:00:22.140> pull<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> end<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
Basques you would pull at the end of the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.620 
Basques you would pull at the end of the
wrench<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.400> some<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.789> us<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.119> even<00:00:24.359> had<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
wrench but some of us have even had the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.839 
wrench but some of us have even had the
experience<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.260> trying<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.920> take<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.340> piece<00:00:26.820> of

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
experience of trying to take a piece of

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.609 
experience of trying to take a piece of
pipe<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.510> throw<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.869> over<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> handle<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
pipe and throw it over the handle of the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.589 
pipe and throw it over the handle of the
wrench<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.460> extend<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.119> length<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
wrench so as to extend the length of the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.830 
wrench so as to extend the length of the
wrench<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.800> has<00:00:32.309> been<00:00:32.570> you<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.750> all

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
wrench and that has been you know we all

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.060 
wrench and that has been you know we all
know<00:00:34.050> that's<00:00:34.230> kind<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.440> useful<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:34.829> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
know that's kind of useful because it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130 
know that's kind of useful because it
gives<00:00:35.280> us<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> little<00:00:35.579> more<00:00:35.760> leverage<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.989> let's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
gives us a little more leverage so let's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750 
gives us a little more leverage so let's
try<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> compare<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> torques<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.489> these

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
try to compare the torques of these

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.740 
try to compare the torques of these
various<00:00:39.210> scenarios<00:00:41.329> remember<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.450> torque

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
various scenarios remember that torque

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.380 
various scenarios remember that torque
is<00:00:42.930> given<00:00:43.230> by<00:00:43.469> r<00:00:43.739> times<00:00:44.219> f<00:00:44.489> times<00:00:44.879> sine<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
is given by r times f times sine of the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
is given by r times f times sine of the
angle<00:00:45.420> between<00:00:45.809> those<00:00:46.140> two<00:00:46.289> vectors<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
angle between those two vectors and we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
angle between those two vectors and we
know<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> same<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.600> four

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
know that if is the same in this four

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350 
know that if is the same in this four
sets<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> examples<00:00:50.190> yours<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.059> we're<00:00:51.239> really

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
sets of examples yours so we're really

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.700 
sets of examples yours so we're really
considering<00:00:51.989> our<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.070> sine<00:00:53.340> function

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
considering our and the sine function

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
considering our and the sine function
the<00:00:55.710> smallest<00:00:56.160> torque<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.670> any<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> these

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the smallest torque in any of these

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.229 
the smallest torque in any of these
cases<00:00:57.390> will<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:57.989> B<00:00:58.379> because<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.609> happening

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cases will be B because it's happening

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880 
cases will be B because it's happening
at<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> distance<00:01:00.690> R<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.289> length<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> wrench

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
at a distance R the length of the wrench

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.579 
at a distance R the length of the wrench
and<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:03.090> angle<00:01:03.449> between<00:01:03.570> R<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:03.989> F<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.379> less

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and the angle between R and F is less

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.230 
and the angle between R and F is less
than<00:01:04.769> 90<00:01:05.010> degrees<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> sine<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> angle

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
than 90 degrees so the sine of the angle

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
than 90 degrees so the sine of the angle
will<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.630> less<00:01:06.810> than<00:01:06.990> 1<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.070> to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
will be less than 1 so that's going to

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.420 
will be less than 1 so that's going to
be<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> smallest<00:01:08.549> torque<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.710> next<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.189> which

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
be the smallest torque the next to which

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
be the smallest torque the next to which
are<00:01:11.580> equivalent<00:01:11.790> actually<00:01:12.720> equal<00:01:13.020> in

are equivalent actually equal in

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.999 
are equivalent actually equal in
magnitude<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.310> D<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.700> both<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.720> D<00:01:16.110> the

wrench it's not adding extra extra any
extra<00:01:39.000> length<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.920> doesn't<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:41.280> help

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
extra length so it doesn't actually help

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.230 
extra length so it doesn't actually help
you<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:43.079> largest<00:01:43.350> case<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.549> that's

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you and the largest case is see that's

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.249 
you and the largest case is see that's
the<00:01:45.420> one<00:01:45.540> where<00:01:45.659> you're<00:01:45.780> getting<00:01:45.930> some<00:01:46.110> extra

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the one where you're getting some extra

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.840 
the one where you're getting some extra
mechanical<00:01:46.799> advantage<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.640> rod

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
mechanical advantage because the rod

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.420 
mechanical advantage because the rod
increases<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.259> length<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> point

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
increases the length are from the point

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.069 
increases the length are from the point
of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> pivot<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.390> point<00:01:51.810> where<00:01:51.960> you're

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
of the pivot to the point where you're

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.319 
of the pivot to the point where you're
applying<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.470> force<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.979> that's<00:01:53.729> also<00:01:53.909> at<00:01:54.090> 90

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
applying the force and that's also at 90

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.389 
applying the force and that's also at 90
degrees<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.470> works<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.280> be

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
degrees so that actually works out to be

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.109 
degrees so that actually works out to be
sine<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> 90th<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:59.040> C<00:01:59.549> will<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> case

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
sine of 90th one so C will be the case

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.899 
sine of 90th one so C will be the case
of<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> largest<00:02:00.600> torque
