this backdoor entrance right here this
is<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:33.910> significant<00:00:34.570> part<00:00:34.720> of<00:00:34.930> this<00:00:35.530> map<00:00:35.860> this

is a significant part of this map this
does<00:00:36.460> mean<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:36.970> for<00:00:37.899> warp<00:00:38.140> gate<00:00:38.320> pushes<00:00:38.710> are

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
does mean that for warp gate pushes are

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.200 
does mean that for warp gate pushes are
a<00:00:38.860> little<00:00:39.040> bit<00:00:39.250> more<00:00:39.370> threatening<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:39.970> get

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
a little bit more threatening and get

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.760 
a little bit more threatening and get
into<00:00:40.329> your<00:00:40.480> opponent's<00:00:40.630> face<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:41.320> little<00:00:41.649> bit

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
into your opponent's face a little bit

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.670 
into your opponent's face a little bit
more<00:00:42.399> easily<00:00:42.820> as<00:00:42.969> a<00:00:43.000> result<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:43.630> qxc<00:00:44.110> going<00:00:44.590> to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
more easily as a result so qxc going to

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.139 
more easily as a result so qxc going to
have<00:00:44.770> some<00:00:44.950> big<00:00:45.100> decisions<00:00:45.130> at<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.790> start<00:00:46.059> of

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
have some big decisions at the start of

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.459 
have some big decisions at the start of
how<00:00:46.270> he's<00:00:46.420> going<00:00:46.570> to<00:00:46.630> manage<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.079> front<00:00:47.350> and

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
how he's going to manage the front and

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.590 
how he's going to manage the front and
back<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:47.710> his<00:00:48.040> base<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.550> little<00:00:48.940> bit<00:00:49.120> harder<00:00:49.420> for

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
back of his base a little bit harder for

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.850 
back of his base a little bit harder for
terran<00:00:49.930> cuz<00:00:50.079> Terran<00:00:50.320> has<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.530> play<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.710> little

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
terran cuz Terran has to play a little

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.090 
terran cuz Terran has to play a little
bit<00:00:51.070> more<00:00:51.190> passively<00:00:51.790> in<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.510> early<00:00:52.899> game<00:00:53.100> so

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
bit more passively in the early game so

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100 
bit more passively in the early game so
white<00:00:54.489> rom<00:00:54.760> is<00:00:54.969> of<00:00:55.180> course<00:00:55.329> making<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.719> pile<00:00:55.930> on

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
white rom is of course making a pile on

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.139 
white rom is of course making a pile on
directly<00:00:56.590> next<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.920> his<00:00:57.100> nexus<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:57.969> will

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
directly next to his nexus this will

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.090 
directly next to his nexus this will
allow<00:00:58.360> him<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.809> manage<00:00:59.500> Reaper<00:00:59.800> her<00:00:59.920> ass<00:01:00.070> a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
allow him to manage Reaper her ass a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.709 
allow him to manage Reaper her ass a
little<00:01:00.370> bit<00:01:00.460> better<00:01:00.730> don't<00:01:01.090> ever<00:01:01.300> want<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.600> get

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
little bit better don't ever want to get

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.209 
little bit better don't ever want to get
that<00:01:01.809> gateway<00:01:02.050> too<00:01:02.199> far<00:01:02.649> away<00:01:02.739> at<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:02.980> start

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
that gateway too far away at the start

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.490 
that gateway too far away at the start
players<00:01:03.820> used<00:01:04.329> to<00:01:04.539> Wallin<00:01:04.899> at<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.079> front<00:01:05.379> they

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
players used to Wallin at the front they

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.709 
players used to Wallin at the front they
still<00:01:05.740> do<00:01:06.070> against<00:01:06.460> protoss<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:06.999> zerg<00:01:07.569> but

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
still do against protoss and zerg but

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.899 
still do against protoss and zerg but
against<00:01:07.959> terran<00:01:08.259> it's<00:01:08.439> a<00:01:08.829> little<00:01:09.490> little<00:01:09.759> bit

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
against terran it's a little little bit

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.449 
against terran it's a little little bit
risky<00:01:10.479> just<00:01:10.990> because<00:01:11.319> of<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.590> fact<00:01:11.859> that

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:12.459 
risky just because of the fact that

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.029 
risky just because of the fact that
those<00:01:12.789> Reapers<00:01:13.209> are<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:13.990> prominent<00:01:14.350> in<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
those Reapers are so prominent in the

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.580 
those Reapers are so prominent in the
early<00:01:15.310> game<00:01:15.459> and<00:01:15.609> of<00:01:15.670> course<00:01:15.850> against<00:01:16.119> qxc

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
early game and of course against qxc

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.719 
early game and of course against qxc
wouldn't<00:01:17.590> be<00:01:17.649> surprised<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:17.979> he<00:01:18.279> is<00:01:18.369> that<00:01:18.549> as

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
wouldn't be surprised if he is that as

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.639 
wouldn't be surprised if he is that as
much<00:01:19.240> as<00:01:19.450> possible<00:01:19.659> so<00:01:20.020> we<00:01:20.049> do<00:01:20.200> have<00:01:20.380> one

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
much as possible so we do have one

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.379 
much as possible so we do have one
gateway<00:01:20.979> going<00:01:21.399> down<00:01:21.520> right<00:01:21.700> now<00:01:21.909> white<00:01:22.179> Ross

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:22.389 
gateway going down right now white Ross

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:25.230 
gateway going down right now white Ross
scouting<00:01:22.899> right<00:01:23.499> afterwards<00:01:24.069> at<00:01:24.249> 12<00:01:24.729> getting

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
scouting right afterwards at 12 getting

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.660 
scouting right afterwards at 12 getting
directly<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.840> his<00:01:25.929> opponents<00:01:26.319> base<00:01:26.469> ASAP<00:01:27.009> so

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
directly to his opponents base ASAP so

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.179 
directly to his opponents base ASAP so
looks<00:01:28.240> like<00:01:28.299> barracks<00:01:28.840> going<00:01:29.139> down<00:01:29.289> for<00:01:29.619> qxc

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
looks like barracks going down for qxc

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.529 
looks like barracks going down for qxc
as<00:01:31.090> well<00:01:31.479> Kulick<00:01:31.869> see<00:01:32.049> not<00:01:32.349> gassing<00:01:33.219> yet<00:01:33.549> just

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
factory barracks build here comes the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.250 
factory barracks build here comes the
Hellion<00:03:48.670> push<00:03:48.850> with<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.090> Marines<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:49.570> love<00:03:50.110> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
Hellion push with the Marines I love the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.530 
Hellion push with the Marines I love the
fact<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.670> qxe<00:03:51.670> moved<00:03:51.940> those<00:03:52.090> Marines<00:03:52.390> out

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
fact that qxe moved those Marines out

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.720 
fact that qxe moved those Marines out
early<00:03:52.900> they<00:03:53.019> are<00:03:53.200> slower<00:03:53.590> than<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:53.920> Hellion<00:03:54.310> so

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
early they are slower than a Hellion so

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.860 
early they are slower than a Hellion so
that<00:03:54.850> doesn't<00:03:55.030> mean<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.420> Hellion<00:03:55.720> can

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
that doesn't mean that the Hellion can

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.990 
that doesn't mean that the Hellion can
catch<00:03:56.079> up<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.410> all<00:03:56.650> white<00:03:56.980> rah<00:03:57.100> has<00:03:57.280> no<00:03:57.610> idea
