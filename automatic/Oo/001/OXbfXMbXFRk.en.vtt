are the files that you're going to be

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.280 
are the files that you're going to be
copying<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.670> mp3<00:01:27.360> player<00:01:27.390> once<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
copying on to your mp3 player once you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.140 
copying on to your mp3 player once you

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
put it into recovery mode what we need

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
put it into recovery mode what we need
to<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.900> switch<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> player<00:01:31.770> into

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to do here is switch the player into

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.429 
to do here is switch the player into
recovery<00:01:32.310> mode<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.420> make<00:01:33.810> sure<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.079> player<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
recovery mode so make sure the player is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.469 
recovery mode so make sure the player is
off<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.909> hold<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> power

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
off if it's on you can hold the power

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.219 
off if it's on you can hold the power
button<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:37.560> 10<00:01:38.490> seconds<00:01:38.909> maybe<00:01:39.229> something

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
button for 10 seconds maybe something

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
button for 10 seconds maybe something
like<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.820> once<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> player<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.390> off

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
like that and once the player is off

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.649 
like that and once the player is off
first<00:01:43.560> thing<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.430> switch<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
first thing you want to do is switch the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.139 
first thing you want to do is switch the
hold<00:01:46.140> switch<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.159> position<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
hold switch to the on position so the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.370 
hold switch to the on position so the
hold<00:01:48.329> switch<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.899> here

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
hold switch is here
