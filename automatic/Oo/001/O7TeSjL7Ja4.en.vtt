00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
LeBron mags and I was inspired I saw a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.869 
LeBron mags and I was inspired I saw a
picture<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.120> somebody<00:00:45.420> did<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> Meg<00:00:46.879> render

throw<00:00:48.600> LeBron<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.410> had<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
throw LeBron but I think they had the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.959 
throw LeBron but I think they had the
legs<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.950> bottom<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.850> it's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
legs at the bottom but you know it's

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.569 
legs at the bottom but you know it's
just<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:52.440> too<00:00:52.559> difficult<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.980> take<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.340> off

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
just it's too difficult to take this off

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.069 
just it's too difficult to take this off
and<00:00:54.000> put<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.210> light<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.570> each<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> these

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and put a light in each one of these

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.560 
and put a light in each one of these
little<00:00:55.289> sections<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.760> flat<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.210> or

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
little sections or just a flat one or

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.060 
little sections or just a flat one or
something<00:00:57.840> whatever<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> case<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.920> too

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
something whatever the case is just too

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
something whatever the case is just too
much<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.489> it<00:01:00.390> probably<00:01:00.570> won't<00:01:00.840> last<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.199> long

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
much and it probably won't last as long

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.240 
much and it probably won't last as long
walking<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> decided<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> on

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250

small materials for it I started out
doing<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.689> nine<00:02:03.960> volt<00:02:03.990> battery<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.090> charge

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
doing a nine volt battery to charge

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.819 
doing a nine volt battery to charge
these<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> horrible<00:02:07.320> idea

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
these and that was a horrible idea

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.250 
these and that was a horrible idea
cuz<00:02:08.039> um<00:02:08.220> again<00:02:09.259> not<00:02:10.259> enough<00:02:10.500> space<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.890> here<00:02:11.069> so

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
cuz um again not enough space in here so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.170 
cuz um again not enough space in here so
that<00:02:12.860> was<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> problem<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.370> what<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.640> do<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.030> did

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
that was a problem so what I do is I did

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.930 
that was a problem so what I do is I did
more<00:02:14.330> research<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:15.080> these<00:02:16.069> are<00:02:16.340> these<00:02:16.760> have

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
more research now these are these have

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.080 
more research now these are these have
rechargeable<00:02:17.360> batteries<00:02:17.840> which<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.410> smaller

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
rechargeable batteries which is smaller

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.110 
rechargeable batteries which is smaller
and<00:02:20.090> will<00:02:20.330> last<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.630> longer<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.670> most<00:02:23.000> of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
and will last you longer so and most of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.550 
and will last you longer so and most of
it<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.239> stuffed<00:02:23.510> in<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.720> tongue<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.319> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
it is stuffed in the tongue and the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.160 
it is stuffed in the tongue and the
tongue<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:26.530> if<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.650> pull<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:27.890> back<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.840> opens

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
off the battery's fully charged now you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.240 
off the battery's fully charged now you
shouldn't<00:04:31.140> charge<00:04:31.440> these<00:04:31.710> while<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.070> lights

shouldn't charge these while the lights
are<00:04:32.370> on<00:04:32.490> because<00:04:32.910> it'll<00:04:33.210> burn<00:04:33.360> out<00:04:33.540> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
are on because it'll burn out the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.990 
are on because it'll burn out the
battery<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.200> it<00:04:34.980> won't<00:04:35.130> last<00:04:35.250> as<00:04:35.430> long<00:04:35.550> it's

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
battery and it won't last as long it's

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.040 
battery and it won't last as long it's
kind<00:04:36.150> of<00:04:36.180> like<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.330> cell<00:04:36.510> phone<00:04:36.540> pretty<00:04:36.990> much

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
kind of like a cell phone pretty much

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.760

the<00:04:37.200> same<00:04:37.350> thing<00:04:37.560> as<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.680> cell<00:04:37.830> phone<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:40.470> as<00:04:40.620> you

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
the same thing as a cell phone so as you

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.920 
the same thing as a cell phone so as you
can<00:04:40.860> see<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.940> battery<00:04:42.150> in<00:04:42.360> here<00:04:42.390> isn't<00:04:42.630> fully

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
can see the battery in here isn't fully

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.390 
can see the battery in here isn't fully
charged<00:04:43.440> that's<00:04:43.620> why<00:04:43.740> don't<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.070> red<00:04:44.220> light
