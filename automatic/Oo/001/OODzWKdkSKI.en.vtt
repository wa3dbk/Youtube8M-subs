00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.270
 it's about me 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.700
 do not learn 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.699
 although they urged to be regular 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.749
 percent to be able to name 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.639
 spoke with port 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.849
 that form the elements of the periodic table 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.480
 the rules series very easy 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.689
 and for that we are going to try not somehow explain what they mean 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.009
 the valence of metals 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.169
 in this table we have we do not have divided into two parts 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.250
 Two parts 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.250
 so that at the top he declared yesterday 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.710
 let's have a gale 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 and in the lower part the two metals 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.019
 the goal brings me the rival band 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.630
 and each of them 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.020
 middle petra in a box 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.409
 percent 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.550
 d min will be also start me and have given valencia ep 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.620
 that correspond 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.700
 there is no enemy per group 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.630
 so that it is easy to remember the winners setting 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.550
 so we have in the first 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.560
 the first 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.160
 Pablo 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.720
 for example hydrogen 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.450
 edition sodium potassium a sexy video operated 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.090
 and silver 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.300
 pale we will not put it as pancho 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.200
 the lithium as I read 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840
 the sodium in it 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.530
 potassium like k 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200
 Rubidium rb 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.159
 the cesium ccs 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.709
 those of oltra have been since the plant requires 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.190
 the presentation of all this 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.159
 would 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.050
 from the whole group 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.030
 It would also be 1 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.780
 this means 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 that each of the elements of this table 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.290
 will have as valencia mansur 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 so for example hydrogen will have valence +1 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.639
 the video valencia +1 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.569
 Sodium valence +1 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.670
 if each of them valence +1 it means that you can lose our 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.229
 not if he really decides everything about me 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.319
 percent in the world 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.319
 the delirium 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.909
 the magnesium 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.529
 The calcium 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.629
 the strontium 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.779
 various 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.719
 radio 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.289
 5 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.189
 ical 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.349
 good for the veriÃ±a corresponds the symbol of a baby 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.649
 the names of the df symbols 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.060
 the declaration 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.099
 symbol 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.859
 city 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.859
 but the explosion symbol str 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.359
 but there has not been a symbol you will see 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.749
 a radio 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.159
 symbol 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.159
 herrera 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.459
 but anyway 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.399
 bimbo the obstetrician 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.399
 and for the cadmium cd symbol 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.109
 all this has in valencia banks 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.729
 typifies who revived has command valence 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:38.069
 the magnesium valencia commanded the calcium goals that marked all valencia march 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.309
 they come from groups 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.519
 and in it 2 valence 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.629
 in the indie rock group 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.109
 of cobalt 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.389
 and from Miguel 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.469
 they have valencia more 2 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.709
 and valencia mar 3 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.709
 yesterday he showed it with the symbol of faith 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.489
 something valuable symbol csc 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.229
 and nickel the symbol in it 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.079
 the next group is his group 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.789
 copper and mercury 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.830
 kobe 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.830
 in symbols of days usa 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.550
 the Mercury 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.550
 the symbol would be hg 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 and valencia would be 1 guido 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.379
 there was always in the gold group 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.719
 only such gold 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.719
 the symbol would be aoun 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.749
 and then for days plus one 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.180
 +3 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.639
 the next group get out of here 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.020
 that day the bolus group 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.240
 aluminum 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.419
 ghalioun 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.819
 indiano italy 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.909
 the bonus symbol b 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.520
 palomino symbol for the event 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.770
 d amelio efe symbol 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.439
 Indian symbols comes 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.849
 italy a symbol l 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.849
 all this has in valencia +3 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.289
 It was Friday for a hundred 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.759
 documentary film 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.150
 manganese and chrome 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.240
 as we are expanding it, tell it swamp on the top 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.850
 of the red line 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.930
 carrying metals 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.949
 and this were separated in this case 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:59.400
 if manganese 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.400
 they prolong they asked for magnesium they send that 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.919
 symbol in milk 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:08.939
 and valence 2 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.939
 and 4 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.789
 and now let's see the chrome group 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.789
 the promotion and access 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.509
 and valence + 2 and more 3 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.439
 what does this mean if they are metals they act separately 

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:30.849
 and magnesium 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.720
 over time I get into valencia 2004 as mental because it's in the part of 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:38.719
 up carefully 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.319
 the chrome will have valencia 2003 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.830
 and cdr symbol and act to 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.669
 as mental 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.669
 because so the upper part is here 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.039
 if they were the lower part 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.300
 it came 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.050
 a monumental 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.050
 and 2nd would have the same valence 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.860
 tell 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.860
 if they had in the part of the work of this girl 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:09.110
 would 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.110
 this is not useful for me 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.099
 and they would have 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:20.629
 the same valence that is to say - 2 

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:22.300
 - 4 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.759
 - cei 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.189
 - 7 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:28.850
 and manganese 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.059
 and as a wolf together 

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:32.240
 a symbol 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.300
 mm 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.990
 and sete
