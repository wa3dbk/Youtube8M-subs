oxygen mask on their face they're gonna

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.389 
oxygen mask on their face they're gonna
rip<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> off<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.199> be

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
viruses that we see it causes a viral

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.210 
viruses that we see it causes a viral
pneumonia<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.479> babies<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> young<00:01:19.650> children

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
pneumonia in babies and young children

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
pneumonia in babies and young children
and<00:01:20.570> since<00:01:21.570> there's<00:01:21.750> no<00:01:21.900> treatment<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and since there's no treatment it's a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
and since there's no treatment it's a
virus<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.490> only<00:01:23.850> thing<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
virus the only thing we can do is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.380 
virus the only thing we can do is
supportive<00:01:25.020> care<00:01:25.259> such<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.680> IV<00:01:26.460> fluids<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
supportive care such as IV fluids and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.569 
supportive care such as IV fluids and
supplemental<00:01:27.930> oxygen<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.950> lots<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.280> lots<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
supplemental oxygen and lots and lots of

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.819 
supplemental oxygen and lots and lots of
monitoring<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> classic

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
monitoring so that would be a classic

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.039 
monitoring so that would be a classic
example<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.610> something<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.540> would<00:01:33.720> admit

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
example of something that we would admit

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.740 
example of something that we would admit
here<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:35.220> patient<00:01:35.850> who<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:35.939> needs<00:01:36.360> some<00:01:36.540> extra

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
here a patient who just needs some extra

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.660 
here a patient who just needs some extra
oxygen<00:01:37.290> until<00:01:37.500> their<00:01:37.740> body<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.070> able<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.369> fight

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
oxygen until their body is able to fight

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.660 
oxygen until their body is able to fight
off<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> virus<00:01:39.200> another<00:01:40.200> example<00:01:40.799> might<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
off the virus another example might be a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.899 
off the virus another example might be a
child<00:01:42.060> who<00:01:42.240> has<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.869> stomach<00:01:43.560> flu<00:01:43.909> vomiting
