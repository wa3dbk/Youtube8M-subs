expertvillage.com now I can also show a
old<00:00:07.109> bridge<00:00:07.799> which<00:00:08.700> wasn't<00:00:09.389> fitted<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.019> this

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
old bridge which wasn't fitted to this

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.020 
old bridge which wasn't fitted to this
particular<00:00:10.769> top<00:00:10.980> but<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:12.240> by<00:00:13.110> comparison

particular top but but by comparison

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.689 
particular top but but by comparison
it's<00:00:15.030> much<00:00:15.990> smaller<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.590> great<00:00:17.010> deal<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.340> wood

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it's much smaller a great deal of wood

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:26.330 
it's much smaller a great deal of wood
has<00:00:17.820> been<00:00:18.029> removed<00:00:19.250> and<00:00:23.900> this<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:26.130> was

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
has been removed and this was this was

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.820

not<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.199> would<00:00:31.380> fit

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
not to this one but it would fit

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.560 
not to this one but it would fit
approximately<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.030> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
approximately like that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.630 
approximately like that
now<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.559> bridge<00:00:34.890> has<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:36.030> little<00:00:36.809> piece<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
now this bridge has a little piece of

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.290 
now this bridge has a little piece of
ebony<00:00:38.840> inlaid<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.739> ebony

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
ebony inlaid into it the ebony

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.410 
ebony inlaid into it the ebony
supposedly<00:00:42.300> will<00:00:43.050> resist<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.100> wire<00:00:44.910> from<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
supposedly will resist the wire from the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.389 
supposedly will resist the wire from the
strings

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
strings

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.060 
strings
better<00:00:47.399> than<00:00:47.789> maple<00:00:48.390> will<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.739> some

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
better than maple will and so some

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.049 
better than maple will and so some
bridges<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:51.000> lemony<00:00:51.480> insert<00:00:52.050> that

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
bridges have a little lemony insert that

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.920 
bridges have a little lemony insert that
supposedly<00:00:55.160> gives<00:00:56.160> them<00:00:56.370> longer<00:00:56.730> life<00:00:56.930> this

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
supposedly gives them longer life this

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.950 
supposedly gives them longer life this
other<00:00:58.170> bridge<00:00:58.640> does<00:00:59.640> not<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.690> ebony

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
other bridge does not have an ebony

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.640 
other bridge does not have an ebony
insert<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.359> arguable<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
insert and it's arguable that it's a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.890 
insert and it's arguable that it's a
little<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.159> vulnerable<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.330> wear<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
little more vulnerable to the wear of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.109 
little more vulnerable to the wear of
the<00:01:07.530> e<00:01:07.560> string<00:01:08.010> which<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.220> after<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the e string which is after all just a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.140 
the e string which is after all just a
very<00:01:09.299> thin<00:01:09.659> piece<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> wire<00:01:10.770> under<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.880> high

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
very thin piece of wire under very high

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.859 
very thin piece of wire under very high
tension<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.860> demonstrate<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.630> show

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
tension now I can demonstrate I can show

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.600 
tension now I can demonstrate I can show
a<00:01:16.220> violin<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.409> bridge<00:01:19.650> installed<00:01:20.400> on

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
a violin with the bridge installed on

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.399 
a violin with the bridge installed on
the<00:01:20.790> instrument<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.750> if

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the instrument and here we can see if if

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
the instrument and here we can see if if
the<00:01:25.830> close-up<00:01:26.759> works<00:01:27.060> well<00:01:27.360> enough<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.720> can

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the close-up works well enough we can

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.240 
the close-up works well enough we can
see<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.229> there's<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> very<00:01:29.009> small<00:01:29.610> piece<00:01:30.180> of

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
see that there's a very small piece of

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
see that there's a very small piece of
plastic<00:01:32.250> tubing<00:01:33.560> on<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:35.579> e<00:01:35.610> string<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.930> this

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
plastic tubing on the e string and this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.890 
plastic tubing on the e string and this
is<00:01:37.320> acting<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.280> bridge<00:01:38.729> protector<00:01:39.659> it's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
is acting like a bridge protector it's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.600 
is acting like a bridge protector it's
actually<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.829> little<00:01:41.960> line<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.229> protection

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
actually a little line of protection

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.359 
actually a little line of protection
between<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.479> wire<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.110> string<00:01:46.560> under

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
between the wire of the string under

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.330 
between the wire of the string under
high<00:01:47.520> tension<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.869> maple<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:50.130> also

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
high tension and the maple and it's also

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.210 
high tension and the maple and it's also
arguable<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.829> filters<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
arguable that this filters the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.460 
arguable that this filters the
vibrations<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> e<00:01:54.479> string<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.170> bit

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
vibrations of the e string a little bit

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.690 
vibrations of the e string a little bit
so<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.719> perhaps<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.710> sound<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.280> comes<00:01:59.549> out

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
so that perhaps the sound that comes out

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.940 
so that perhaps the sound that comes out
of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> fiddle<00:02:00.469> has<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.829> somewhat<00:02:02.490> rounder

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
of the fiddle has a somewhat rounder

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.559 
of the fiddle has a somewhat rounder
softer<00:02:04.950> richer<00:02:05.880> sound<00:02:06.149> rather<00:02:06.540> than<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.009> shrill

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
softer richer sound rather than a shrill

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.710 
softer richer sound rather than a shrill
zingy

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
zingy

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.110 
zingy
ringy<00:02:10.349> sound

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
ringy sound

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.009 
ringy sound
is<00:02:11.799> associated<00:02:12.799> with<00:02:13.040> some<00:02:13.400> east<00:02:14.360> rings<00:02:14.659> and

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
is associated with some east rings and

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.770 
is associated with some east rings and
this<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:16.010> an<00:02:16.549> example<00:02:16.909> of<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.209> bridge<00:02:17.450> that's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
this is an example of a bridge that's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.320 
this is an example of a bridge that's
been<00:02:18.019> individually<00:02:19.010> fitted<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:20.150> this

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
been individually fitted to this

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.720 
been individually fitted to this
instrument<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:22.599> therefore<00:02:23.599> is<00:02:24.010> gaining<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
instrument and therefore is gaining the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.449 
instrument and therefore is gaining the
