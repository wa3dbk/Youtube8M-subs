00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it's really cheap set it's a really

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.340 
it's really cheap set it's a really
really<00:01:53.880> cool<00:01:54.060> set<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.570> don't<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> would

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
really cool set I don't know if it would

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
really cool set I don't know if it would
work<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> typical<00:01:56.219> layout<00:01:56.369> today<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:56.969> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
work in a typical layout today but I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.100 
work in a typical layout today but I
think<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.299> would<00:01:57.390> work<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.750> sort<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
think it would work as sort of like a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.990 
think it would work as sort of like a
slot<00:01:58.409> car<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> go-kart<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> race<00:01:59.759> track

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
slot car or a go-kart on a race track

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600 
slot car or a go-kart on a race track
and<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.469> cool<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.460> I
