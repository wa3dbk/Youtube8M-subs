have maximum agility for this to work so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.750 
have maximum agility for this to work so
you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.780> maximize<00:00:49.110> both<00:00:49.530> armor<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.280> recovery

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
any speed to do this correctly you'll

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.199 
any speed to do this correctly you'll
need<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> running<00:02:35.610> start

need to get a running start

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.539 
need to get a running start
then<00:02:36.630> activate<00:02:37.019> shoulder<00:02:37.560> charge<00:02:37.800> as<00:02:38.099> soon<00:02:38.459> as

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
then activate shoulder charge as soon as

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:39.530 
then activate shoulder charge as soon as
it<00:02:38.670> becomes<00:02:38.940> available

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it becomes available

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.680 
it becomes available
and<00:02:39.660> triple<00:02:40.380> tap<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.980> jump<00:02:41.280> button<00:02:41.540> timing<00:02:42.540> is

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
and triple tap the jump button timing is

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.380 
and triple tap the jump button timing is
crucial<00:02:43.049> here<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:44.250> triple<00:02:44.519> tap<00:02:44.819> too<00:02:45.060> early

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
crucial here if you triple tap too early

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.240 
crucial here if you triple tap too early
or<00:02:45.569> too<00:02:45.630> late<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.620> will<00:02:46.739> lose<00:02:46.920> your<00:02:47.069> momentum

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
or too late you will lose your momentum

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.210 
or too late you will lose your momentum
the<00:02:48.180> trick<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.690> let<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.590> shoulder<00:02:49.920> charge

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
the trick is to let the shoulder charge

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.610 
the trick is to let the shoulder charge
animation<00:02:50.489> complete<00:02:51.269> before<00:02:51.959> triple<00:02:52.380> tapping
