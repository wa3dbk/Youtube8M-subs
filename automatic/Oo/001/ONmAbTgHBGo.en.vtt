00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 before buying your next printer 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.700
 remember that a law 'be colored 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.130
 can be a good option with more prices 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.950
 they are much more affordable 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.719
 and offer much more quality and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.660
 productivity 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.070
 we tested the three main models for 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.970
 domestic use 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.970
 check the results 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.579
 To begin with, we need to tell each other 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.440
 of the digital look we are fans of 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.450
 color laser printers 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.420
 the first thing that strikes you is the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 quality but very much greater than one 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.039
 jet printing ink is true that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.320
 you pay for it clear but despite 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.879
 seem more expensive, you have to remember 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.090
 that these printers leave the factory 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.190
 with the capacity to print at least 700 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.140
 pages to have the same 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 inkjet printers would be required 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.880
 approximately 10 sets of 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.480
 cartridges if you do the math will 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.850
 see that ends up coming more expensive 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.950
 Another advantage is that the laws and print 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.940
 in heavier papers such as 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.010
 photographers 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.680
 the result is great photos 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.300
 quality and vibrant color and has more 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.040
 this type of printer usually 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.480
 offers network connection inclusive 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.480
 some wireless 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.600
 we are three of the newest printers 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.040
 of the pro color laser cp market in 1525 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.930
 mw da hp 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.680
 the clp 325 w of samsung and made it 61 40 of the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.900
 key 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.020
 the first detail they are still well 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.980
 Samsung weighs lighter weighs 11 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.010
 pounds 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.230
 the other two just over 18 others 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.800
 detail they are larger than the jet of 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.810
 ink 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.970
 draws attention to the chery model that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.970
 almost double the height of the others 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.340
 installation is very simple just follow 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.800
 the step by step of the CD, including 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.929
 installation is only a tip. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.270
 if you have more than one computer and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.880
 install the drivers on all of them in this 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.860
 hp and samsung lead to the best 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.260
 they already come ready for the wireless network 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.070
 already thought you need an accessory 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.070
 purchased part 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.989
 china printer plunges through 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.360
 size gains in speed 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.879
 it prints 18 pages per minute in the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.700
 color mode and 20 pages per minute in 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.950
 black and white adhp and prime eight pages 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.400
 in color per minute and 12 in black and 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.680
 White 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.959
 already samsung is the slowest in the mode 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.590
 colored pages are only four pages per 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.599
 minute 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.130
 performance is better in black and white 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.130
 with 16 pages per minute 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.160
 we evaluate the quality with images 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.260
 colored and monochrome patterns 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.300
 printed on photographic paper who 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.460
 got the best results was at hp 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.120
 followed by xerox and finally the 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.120
 samsung 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.070
 this is a super important item is 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.170
 important because a toner or a 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.810
 ink cartridge can cost as much 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.570
 how much or even more than the very 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.660
 printer in our hp tests 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.820
 registered the lowest cost 33 cents per 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.580
 color page printed in second 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.780
 place was the xerox with 49 cents per 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.080
 page and samsung with the most expensive page 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.080
 54 cents 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.010
 in the case of laser or cheap really 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.870
 it's more expensive 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.280
 some toner cartridges that came with 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.890
 a new printer comes with 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.450
 this happened in the case of 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.580
 samsung and the key 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.740
 hp chose to provide the user 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.300
 cartridge with the same specifications as the 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.180
 original result 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.540
 the samsung printer costs 650 reals 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.280
 and it's 200 reais cheaper than HP 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.800
 leaves for 850 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.230
 but hp comes with autonomy to print 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.850
 almost twice as many pages or 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.160
 it would be necessary to acquire a set 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.450
 complete toner for samsung have to 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.030
 same capacity 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.650
 this means an increase of 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.400
 six hundred and seventy- two reais 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.489
 account 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.710
 in the end the advantage that was of $ 200 thousand 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.170
 a disadvantage of four hundred and 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.360
 seventy-two reais the price searched 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.180
 of the fall was the same as samsung 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.890
 autonomy is a bit higher but even 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.890
 so much below the hp 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.050
 the choice of digital look is the law 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.180
 energetic pro-collor cp 1525 mw of hp 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.670
 she presented the best price the best 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.420
 cost per page and the best quality 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.490
 print 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.320
 in addition hp also remembered the 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.440
 consumer in detail that can even 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.390
 Look silly it includes the usb cable 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.000
 It's frustrating experience to get in 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.050
 want to use the printer and only then 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.580
 realize that you forgot to buy the car 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.320
 all digital lab tests 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.730
 are at your disposal of the digital 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.160
 dot com 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.050
 there you give more details and the whole 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.030
 methodology used to compare the 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.020
 products before you buy 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.020
 access and check
