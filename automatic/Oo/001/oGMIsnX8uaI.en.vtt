into<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.479> sotelo<00:01:48.840> night<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> can

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
into a sotelo night and you know it can

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.039 
into a sotelo night and you know it can
attack<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.880> wish<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> 550<00:01:51.720> kind<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
attack you so wish but the 550 kind of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
attack you so wish but the 550 kind of
ruins<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> big<00:01:53.850> things<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
ruins that but one of the big things is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.209 
ruins that but one of the big things is
you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.780> now<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.140> into<00:01:55.290> diamond<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:55.979> off<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you can now go into diamond just off the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.499 
you can now go into diamond just off the
altar<00:01:56.579> because<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.000> summoned<00:01:57.210> me<00:01:57.329> outer

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
altar because you summoned me outer

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.850 
altar because you summoned me outer
someone<00:01:57.930> something<00:01:58.110> else<00:01:58.380> probably<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
someone something else probably the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.260 
someone something else probably the
dinette<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.399> search<00:01:59.610> off<00:01:59.790> another<00:02:00.030> outer

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
dinette to search off another outer

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.660 
dinette to search off another outer
overlay<00:02:00.899> into<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.290> their<00:02:01.890> main<00:02:02.070> fish<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.460> go

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
overlay into this their main fish to go

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
overlay into this their main fish to go
into<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> diamonds<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:04.409> card

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
into the diamonds so that's a one card

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.520 
into the diamonds so that's a one card
diamond<00:02:05.310> basically<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.170> pretty

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
diamond basically now and that is pretty

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
diamond basically now and that is pretty
big<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.160> because<00:02:08.879> diamonds<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.420> very

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
big I think because diamonds are very

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.869 
big I think because diamonds are very
very<00:02:09.840> very<00:02:10.170> good<00:02:10.319> cards<00:02:10.890> even<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.489> its<00:02:11.640> own

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
very very good cards even on its own

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.670 
very very good cards even on its own
it's<00:02:12.720> still

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's still

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.130 
it's still
having<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.489> negate<00:02:14.909> things<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.599> it's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
having that can negate things and it's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.559 
having that can negate things and it's
just<00:02:16.349> an<00:02:16.409> incredible<00:02:16.859> card<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:18.329> gives

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
just an incredible card so this gives

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.509 
just an incredible card so this gives
access<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.989> diamonds<00:02:19.469> which<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.069> very

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
access to diamonds which is a very

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.099 
access to diamonds which is a very
important<00:02:21.090> thing<00:02:21.359> so<00:02:21.599> let's<00:02:21.750> go<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.079> the

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
important thing so let's go on to the

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.599 
important thing so let's go on to the
first<00:02:22.349> effect<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.829> detach<00:02:23.129> three<00:02:23.459> two

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
first effect you detach three two

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.339 
first effect you detach three two
special<00:02:24.000> mamaan<00:02:24.299> that<00:02:24.599> basically<00:02:24.930> means<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
special mamaan that basically means you

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.009 
special mamaan that basically means you
can<00:02:25.560> go<00:02:25.709> into<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.489> constellar<00:02:27.150> pleiades<00:02:27.540> that's

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
can go into a constellar pleiades that's

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.479 
can go into a constellar pleiades that's
probably<00:02:28.260> one<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.560> most<00:02:28.680> optimum<00:02:29.219> things

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
probably one of the most optimum things

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.490 
probably one of the most optimum things
you're<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:29.909> into<00:02:30.090> because<00:02:31.049> palade

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you're going to go into because palade

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.410 
you're going to go into because palade
is<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.859> one<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.219> best<00:02:32.430> rank<00:02:32.670> fives<00:02:32.969> but

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
is just one of the best rank fives but

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.119 
is just one of the best rank fives but
there<00:02:33.629> are<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.989> ones<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.469> go<00:02:34.620> into<00:02:34.769> but

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
there are the ones you can go into but

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.000 
there are the ones you can go into but
the<00:02:35.219> problem<00:02:35.609> is<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.989> Serta<00:02:37.319> lanai<00:02:37.560> extra

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
the problem is the Serta lanai extra

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.030 
the problem is the Serta lanai extra
deck<00:02:38.189> is<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.790> tight<00:02:39.180> already<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:40.500> trying<00:02:40.829> to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
deck is so tight already that trying to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.849 
deck is so tight already that trying to
fit<00:02:41.310> rank<00:02:41.790> fives<00:02:42.209> into<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.019> deck<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.560> very

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
fit rank fives into the deck it's very

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.940 
fit rank fives into the deck it's very
difficult<00:02:44.189> now<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.389> don't<00:02:45.780> think<00:02:46.079> that<00:02:46.500> effect

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
difficult now I don't think that effect

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.770 
difficult now I don't think that effect
will<00:02:47.159> be<00:02:47.189> used<00:02:47.489> all<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.849> much<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.359> be<00:02:48.389> honest

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
will be used all that much to be honest

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.039 
will be used all that much to be honest
it's<00:02:49.439> it's<00:02:49.829> good<00:02:50.129> but<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:51.060> difficult

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
it's it's good but it's difficult

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.199 
it's it's good but it's difficult
because<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:53.040> would<00:02:53.189> have<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.639> restructure

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
because you would have to restructure

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.909 
because you would have to restructure
the<00:02:54.359> whole<00:02:54.510> extra<00:02:54.780> deck<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.169> a<00:02:55.200> different<00:02:55.680> way

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
the whole extra deck to a different way

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.819 
the whole extra deck to a different way
and<00:02:56.280> while<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.209> personally<00:02:57.989> will<00:02:58.169> run<00:02:58.439> one<00:02:58.709> of

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
and while I personally will run one of

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.789 
and while I personally will run one of
these<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.519> will<00:02:59.790> probably<00:03:00.090> run<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.799> Pilates

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
these and I will probably run a Pilates

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.099 
these and I will probably run a Pilates
as<00:03:01.980> well<00:03:02.159> just<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.000> case<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.540> play<00:03:03.750> DS<00:03:03.930> is

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
as well just in case because play DS is

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.020 
as well just in case because play DS is
a<00:03:04.139> great<00:03:04.620> card<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.310> don't<00:03:05.639> think<00:03:05.700> I'll<00:03:05.939> be

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
a great card I don't think I'll be

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.610 
a great card I don't think I'll be
running<00:03:06.150> any<00:03:06.419> of<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.659> other<00:03:06.780> rank<00:03:07.019> fives<00:03:07.290> I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
running any of the other rank fives I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.709 
running any of the other rank fives I
don't<00:03:08.069> really<00:03:08.189> see<00:03:08.430> any<00:03:08.549> reason<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:09.030> but<00:03:09.599> if<00:03:09.689> we

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
don't really see any reason to but if we

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.509 
don't really see any reason to but if we
look<00:03:09.840> at<00:03:10.169> the<00:03:10.469> big<00:03:10.799> effect<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.189> one<00:03:11.340> that's

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
look at the big effect the one that's

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.819 
look at the big effect the one that's
got<00:03:11.609> everyone<00:03:11.760> talking<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.569> detached<00:03:13.079> 7

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
got everyone talking is the detached 7

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.379 
got everyone talking is the detached 7
so<00:03:14.040> if<00:03:14.159> we<00:03:14.280> think<00:03:14.430> about<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:14.909> how<00:03:15.120> many

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
so if we think about it how many

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.119 
so if we think about it how many
materials<00:03:15.989> can<00:03:16.169> you<00:03:16.260> summon<00:03:16.500> with<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.889> card

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
materials can you summon with this card

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.219 
materials can you summon with this card
straight<00:03:17.400> away<00:03:17.669> well<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.750> could<00:03:18.900> probably

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
straight away well you could probably

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.349 
straight away well you could probably
easily<00:03:19.709> get<00:03:20.159> three<00:03:20.549> maybe<00:03:20.909> even<00:03:21.030> four

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
easily get three maybe even four

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.050 
easily get three maybe even four
straight<00:03:22.139> away<00:03:22.379> on<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.949> but<00:03:23.729> then<00:03:23.849> you<00:03:23.940> have

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
straight away on this but then you have

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.610 
straight away on this but then you have

have to wait at least two to three turns
to<00:03:47.759> get<00:03:47.879> this<00:03:48.030> effect<00:03:48.299> off<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:49.500> all<00:03:49.739> know

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
to get this effect off and we all know

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.089 
to get this effect off and we all know
that<00:03:50.629> cards<00:03:51.629> do<00:03:51.810> not<00:03:51.840> stay<00:03:52.229> on<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:52.470> field<00:03:52.680> that

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
that cards do not stay on the field that

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.069 
that cards do not stay on the field that
long<00:03:53.370> anymore<00:03:53.699> in<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.180> current<00:03:54.870> matter

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
long anymore in this current matter

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.009 
long anymore in this current matter
cards<00:03:55.739> are<00:03:55.859> gone<00:03:56.099> in<00:03:56.430> maybe<00:03:56.849> two<00:03:57.269> turns<00:03:57.599> even

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019

towers<00:03:58.470> can<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.799> taken<00:03:59.159> down<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.759> amount

towers can be taken down in that amount

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.249 
towers can be taken down in that amount
of<00:04:00.090> time<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.629> think<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.079> really

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:01.259 
of time I think it's a really

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.020 
of time I think it's a really
interesting<00:04:01.349> card<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.400> think<00:04:02.579> it's<00:04:02.699> a<00:04:02.759> really

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
interesting card I think it's a really

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.330 
interesting card I think it's a really
interesting<00:04:03.150> effect<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.319> I<00:04:04.709> wouldn't<00:04:05.099> really

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
interesting effect and I wouldn't really

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.420 
interesting effect and I wouldn't really
mind<00:04:05.729> seeing<00:04:06.359> them<00:04:06.629> do<00:04:07.139> more<00:04:07.379> like<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:08.159> I

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
mind seeing them do more like this but I

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.729 
mind seeing them do more like this but I
don't<00:04:08.909> think<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.509> second<00:04:10.019> effect<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
don't think the second effect that the

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.909 
don't think the second effect that the
mass<00:04:11.609> defect<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.209> all<00:04:12.449> that<00:04:12.720> good<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.530> can<00:04:13.709> use

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
mass defect is all that good you can use

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.879 
mass defect is all that good you can use
really<00:04:14.579> boring<00:04:15.299> old<00:04:15.540> terrible<00:04:16.079> cards<00:04:16.590> like

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
really boring old terrible cards like

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.800 
really boring old terrible cards like
that<00:04:17.400> spell<00:04:18.000> card<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.449> i<00:04:18.479> can't<00:04:18.720> remember

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
that spell card that i can't remember

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.270 
that spell card that i can't remember
there<00:04:19.229> was<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.380> thunder<00:04:19.769> one<00:04:19.889> that<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.130> can

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
there was a thunder one that you can

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.190 
there was a thunder one that you can
attach<00:04:20.759> stuff<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.389> yeah<00:04:21.779> i<00:04:21.810> don't<00:04:21.989> use<00:04:22.169> that

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
attach stuff to it yeah i don't use that

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.240 
attach stuff to it yeah i don't use that
that's<00:04:22.529> terrible

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
that's terrible

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.680 
that's terrible
are<00:04:23.370> all<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.550> cards<00:04:23.790> interesting<00:04:24.390> the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
are all the cards interesting the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.060 
are all the cards interesting the
functionality<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.560> going<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:25.950> in

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
functionality that is going to have in

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.590 
functionality that is going to have in
the<00:04:26.160> deck<00:04:26.340> people<00:04:26.820> will<00:04:26.940> probably<00:04:27.090> run<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.510> up

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
the deck people will probably run it up

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.170 
the deck people will probably run it up
one<00:04:27.840> I'm<00:04:28.110> gonna<00:04:28.350> run<00:04:28.530> out<00:04:28.710> one<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.220> i<00:04:29.730> think

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
one I'm gonna run out one and i think

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.180 
one I'm gonna run out one and i think
that<00:04:30.480> it's<00:04:30.690> just<00:04:30.810> good<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.230> be<00:04:31.530> able<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.800> access

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
that it's just good to be able to access

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.130 
that it's just good to be able to access
diamonds<00:04:32.700> quicker<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.210> it's<00:04:33.330> also<00:04:33.480> just<00:04:33.840> good

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
diamonds quicker and it's also just good

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.400 
diamonds quicker and it's also just good
to<00:04:34.350> have<00:04:34.560> some<00:04:35.450> altair<00:04:36.450> place<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:37.050> might<00:04:37.290> be

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
to have some altair place that might be

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.530 
to have some altair place that might be
a<00:04:37.440> bit<00:04:37.620> live<00:04:37.970> depending<00:04:38.970> on<00:04:39.060> what<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.330> want<00:04:39.360> to

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
a bit live depending on what you want to

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.890 
a bit live depending on what you want to
run<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:39.810> for<00:04:40.050> but<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.310> slight<00:04:41.940> issue<00:04:42.150> in<00:04:42.660> that

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
run it for but the slight issue in that

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.800 
run it for but the slight issue in that
is<00:04:43.650> that<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.760> doesn't<00:04:45.090> do<00:04:45.240> anything<00:04:45.570> when<00:04:45.720> it

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
is that it doesn't do anything when it

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.650 
is that it doesn't do anything when it
goes<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:45.990> grave<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.760> when<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:48.000> have<00:04:48.270> things

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
goes to grave and when you have things

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.380 
goes to grave and when you have things
like<00:04:49.010> nova<00:04:50.010> maybe<00:04:50.400> if<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:50.610> do<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:50.820> outer<00:04:50.970> into

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
like nova maybe if you do the outer into

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.870 
like nova maybe if you do the outer into
the<00:04:51.480> Deneb<00:04:51.810> then<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.470> have<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.770> nova<00:04:53.550> you

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
the Deneb then you have the nova you

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.550 
the Deneb then you have the nova you
might<00:04:54.030> not<00:04:54.360> really<00:04:54.660> want<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:55.020> overlay<00:04:55.320> into

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
might not really want to overlay into

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.080 
might not really want to overlay into
this<00:04:55.680> because<00:04:56.130> you're<00:04:56.640> basically<00:04:57.000> just

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
this because you're basically just

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.420 
this because you're basically just
giving<00:04:57.510> up<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:57.810> your<00:04:58.020> monsters<00:04:58.200> for<00:04:59.160> a<00:04:59.190> one

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
giving up to your monsters for a one

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.370 
giving up to your monsters for a one
over<00:04:59.669> and<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.600> might<00:05:00.750> just<00:05:00.870> want<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.110> keep<00:05:01.200> it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
over and you might just want to keep it

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.840 
over and you might just want to keep it
that<00:05:01.410> way<00:05:01.530> but<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.830> all<00:05:02.040> depends<00:05:02.460> on<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.700> way

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
that way but it all depends on the way

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.100 
that way but it all depends on the way
that<00:05:03.000> you're<00:05:03.120> playing<00:05:03.240> all<00:05:03.510> depends<00:05:03.930> on<00:05:04.020> the

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
that you're playing all depends on the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.630 
that you're playing all depends on the
game<00:05:04.260> that<00:05:04.470> you're<00:05:04.560> in<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.040> all<00:05:05.190> depends<00:05:05.520> in

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
game that you're in and all depends in

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.010 
game that you're in and all depends in
the<00:05:05.730> situation<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.300> you're<00:05:06.450> playing<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.870> in

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
the situation that you're playing it in

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.010 
the situation that you're playing it in
so<00:05:07.500> overall<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.669> think<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:09.030> cards<00:05:09.270> nice<00:05:09.510> it's

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
so overall I think the cards nice it's

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.080 
so overall I think the cards nice it's
good<00:05:10.290> just<00:05:10.620> because<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.190> outer<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:12.000> the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
good just because of the outer to the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.990 
good just because of the outer to the
diamond<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:13.530> feel<00:05:13.890> that<00:05:14.160> it's<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.730> really

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
diamond and I feel that it's a really

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.750 
diamond and I feel that it's a really
interesting<00:05:15.419> effect<00:05:15.990> maybe<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:17.310> detached

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
interesting effect maybe the detached

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.580 
interesting effect maybe the detached
three<00:05:18.120> materials<00:05:18.600> might<00:05:18.810> be<00:05:18.990> used<00:05:19.230> because

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
three materials might be used because

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.470 
three materials might be used because
especially<00:05:20.040> in<00:05:20.340> Sydney<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.790> players<00:05:21.000> turn<00:05:21.300> it

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
especially in Sydney the players turn it

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.750 
especially in Sydney the players turn it
might<00:05:21.630> be<00:05:21.750> nice<00:05:21.900> but<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.710> about<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.950> so

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
might be nice but that is about it so

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.190 
might be nice but that is about it so
