00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:21.230
 The clothes are all good that the guima making a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.189
 some videos here a little bit 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.529
 different from the videos I've been doing 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 I'm not going to play drums if you can. 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.359
 see here at the mill that on the edge of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.210
 lagoon of the conception and what to count 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.270
 story for you about my 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.020
 my first presentation 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.940
 then the story of the first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.129
 presentation of my life is as follows 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.050
 at the college where I was studying 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.910
 is the team in the eighth grade or so 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.820
 97 had started doing some lessons 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 already had a pair of drumsticks 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.109
 the sofa that I trained at home and only 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.329
 and there in mine in my school they made a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.699
 kind of a band contest where you 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.700
 could make a little group and sign up 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.689
 to play with your friends then 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.000
 We made a group there and signed up. 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.250
 and we went to play a little piece of a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.659
 There stage in the gym a huge battery 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.990
 They did a drum rowing if I did not 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.520
 cheating and damn good beating so exotic 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.240
 I 've never seen any battery 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.460
 similar to that one and finally we went 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.470
 and I did not have a teacher who 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.020
 I was going to have a canja with us. 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.240
 sing a song of his and we were 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.979
 rehearsing we went out with him and remember 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.460
 who in the essay he spoke the following spoke 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.409
 Dilma dilates there, right? 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.729
 It's normal that when it's time to do the show 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 Do you get a little nervous then? 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.750
 take care of the nervousness not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.500
 hinder time to not not touch 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.540
 not accelerate the songs of the most 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.960
 I heard it was not beauty you can let it stay 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.320
 Here was my first presentation. 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.979
 I was so euphoric so it's so 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.390
 that practically doubled and 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.210
 all bpm of the songs all were 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.730
 like this 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.320
 horrible I doubled everything sped everything 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.960
 teacher could not even sing 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.460
 music so fast that it's playing and 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.090
 my friend was looking at it just like that 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.180
 what are you doing and I did not know what 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.860
 say that I thought I was playing 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.210
 right but I want it so nervous that I 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.860
 I ran too fast and this was the first 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.200
 mico I paid the first 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.500
 presentation but that's what happened to me 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.110
 could have given it up or even talked about the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.100
 home pink battery is not for me but has 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.020
 something that seems to force is the 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.700
 The will to play is much greater than 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.660
 anything at all 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.660
 and then what happened I got it and in the year 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.840
 following another festival of 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.200
 bands I did another band 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.180
 the little older people I was already 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.820
 He trained much then is already playing well 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.720
 better that we made another band 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:20.530
 that is even the name was she sings it 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.430
 Tell us, did you play three songs? 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.610
 I remember it was black night of papo rolou 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:33.540
 for alan zeppelin and the water also 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:36.370
 body and what happened in this presentation 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.340
 to trainee sing your songs to people 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.320
 I left so I decorated the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.020
 songs until today I think you play 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.890
 she back and forth without leaving any 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.770
 the music so I trained a lot and the 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.870
 people were playing even the 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.600
 same battery that had been rented 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.970
 by the sound company not even car 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.460
 I started the drums I remember that this 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.290
 I once 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.460
 the story was different I'm here 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.930
 people played superb and here was beautiful 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.540
 so I remember that day I had 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.670
 an epiphany if I said man what it 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.850
 I want to do for the rest of my life. 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.970
 we had one this time I had one 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.130
 extra bonus for the band of a 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.340
 the teachers who judged 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.650
 and such and we won the first place 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.750
 in place with this band 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.669
 these songs are the same as I think 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.900
 I even have a medal 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.789
 they gave the face decided I got it 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.380
 It was expensive, what I want to do anyway. 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.570
 for the rest of my life 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.280
 the time passed and I went 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.979
 assimilating this and why I 'm counting 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.650
 your story you did not think I was born 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.690
 I know there knowing her I was born already with a 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.720
 battery in my house to play 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.330
 maybe it's even the same 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.669
 condition that you have there in your house 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.280
 Like you do not have the battery of 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:06.130
 your dreams still you may not have 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.690
 the dishes of your dream still expensive this is 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.930
 a matter of time you have to do 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.150
 it's your homework let's say 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:18.250
 thus independent of that of the instrument 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.320
 Do you have what it takes for fla? 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.599
 I did it for the love that I have the song and 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.000
 by art, but by instrument 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.539
 even though I always speak or seem not to 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.410
 It's the people who choose to be born. 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:34.330
 born drummer was born percussive 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.250
 so that's what it's all about 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.460
 this story I'm going to do a series of 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.169
 five videos talking some counting 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.810
 some of my stories I hope 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.370
 Be cool, it's a little different there. 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.860
 Just behind the drums I'm not there in the 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.650
 studio then I find it interesting 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.270
 slightly counterbalance some 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.919
 stories so they are a little 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.020
 unusual not 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.139
 and also to perhaps help you 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.970
 Did you like this video? I liked it. 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.979
 down here or who did not like if you 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.570
 did not like that I know any of the 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.990
 two ways will help me to know if 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:10.449
 It's going in the right direction to do. 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.330
 these videos then from your comment 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.729
 I wonder if this story 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.139
 was useful to you if you 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.520
 identified with something that I 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:23.620
 I said I like to tell every time I 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.620
 I said that I started playing a sofa and 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.240
 I played two years on the sofa two years 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.780
 with a pair of drumsticks in which the 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.050
 first pair of drumsticks the metal drumstick 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.789
 which was the only one that I was thicker 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.520
 but fulfilled the second stick form 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:42.340
 promark the third 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.229
 if the ivory feed and I remember that the 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.979
 The first thing that I even bought was 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:51.129
 a chimbau chimbau of the supper that I have 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:53.020
 Until today it fell I was playing until 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:56.800
 two years later I bought the first 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:00.190
 battery and I'll tell you a little more 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.650
 of these victories in the next videos 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.889
 so this is a big hug and even the 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.889
 next
