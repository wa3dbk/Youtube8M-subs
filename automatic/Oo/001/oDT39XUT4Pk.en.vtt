00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
poison off here is nearest because it

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.910 
poison off here is nearest because it
does<00:04:35.600> for<00:04:35.960> everybody<00:04:36.350> who's<00:04:36.560> near<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.950> tank

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
does for everybody who's near the tank

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.200 
does for everybody who's near the tank
but<00:04:39.920> you<00:04:40.220> only<00:04:40.310> want<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.610> stay<00:04:40.730> close<00:04:40.760> enough

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
but you only want to stay close enough

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.660 
but you only want to stay close enough
and<00:04:41.480> long<00:04:42.440> enough<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.980> actually<00:04:43.100> get<00:04:43.520> rid<00:04:43.640> of

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
and long enough to actually get rid of

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.260 
and long enough to actually get rid of
the<00:04:43.790> poison<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.360> can<00:04:44.570> actually<00:04:45.380> survive

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
the poison so you can actually survive

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.390 
the poison so you can actually survive
because<00:04:47.270> of<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.540> poison<00:04:47.930> text<00:04:48.860> for<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.010> bit<00:04:49.040> 20

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
because of the poison text for a bit 20

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.610 
because of the poison text for a bit 20
seconds<00:04:49.790> I<00:04:49.820> think<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.120> is<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:51.200> lasts<00:04:51.410> for<00:04:51.560> about

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
seconds I think it is it lasts for about

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.380 
seconds I think it is it lasts for about
a<00:04:51.740> minute<00:04:51.920> but<00:04:52.190> after<00:04:52.700> 20<00:04:52.790> seconds<00:04:53.270> you're

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
a minute but after 20 seconds you're

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
against them but even raised before we

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.160 
against them but even raised before we
