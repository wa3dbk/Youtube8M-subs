00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
the number one name came into the

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.750 
picture I really like River but I do
worry<00:06:13.760> that<00:06:14.060> it's<00:06:14.750> not<00:06:15.260> a<00:06:15.289> serious<00:06:15.979> name<00:06:16.400> like

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
worry that it's not a serious name like

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.210 
worry that it's not a serious name like
that<00:06:17.199> if<00:06:18.199> he<00:06:18.380> wants<00:06:18.650> to<00:06:18.680> go<00:06:18.830> into<00:06:19.039> something

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
that if he wants to go into something

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.520 
that if he wants to go into something
professional<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:20.270> wanted<00:06:20.690> to<00:06:20.810> be<00:06:20.900> able<00:06:21.110> to<00:06:21.409> be

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
I think I would use River but I would be

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.530 
I think I would use River but I would be
