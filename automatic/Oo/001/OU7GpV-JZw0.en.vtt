00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
that some DLC image leaks are fake now I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.960 
that some DLC image leaks are fake now I
used<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.039> all<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.279> time<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.699> backups

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
used to do this all the time for backups

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.939 
used to do this all the time for backups
to<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.240> was<00:00:21.330> really<00:00:21.630> fun<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.439> discovering

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
to that was really fun just discovering

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
to that was really fun just discovering
why<00:00:23.640> people<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.119> made<00:00:24.240> me<00:00:24.390> fake<00:00:24.570> map<00:00:24.750> Pat's

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
why people have made me fake map Pat's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.450 
why people have made me fake map Pat's
what<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.410> fake<00:00:25.590> about<00:00:25.769> them<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.340> just

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
what was fake about them and just

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.189 
what was fake about them and just
pointing<00:00:26.880> out<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.390> flaws<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.689> their<00:00:28.050> design

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
pointing out the flaws in their design

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.810 
pointing out the flaws in their design
now<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:29.039> really<00:00:29.220> done<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.609> ghosts

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
now I have really done it with ghosts

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.370 
now I have really done it with ghosts
because<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.359> hasn't<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.660> been<00:00:30.840> that

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
because there hasn't really been that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
because there hasn't really been that
many<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.980> most<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.309> them<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:32.940> really

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
many and most of them are all really

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450 
many and most of them are all really
clearly<00:00:33.540> fake<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.290> anyway<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.680> got<00:00:34.980> shown<00:00:35.280> one

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
clearly fake but anyway I got shown one

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.400 
clearly fake but anyway I got shown one
earlier<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.390> my<00:00:36.510> first<00:00:36.750> thoughts<00:00:36.989> about<00:00:37.200> any

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
earlier and my first thoughts about any

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.200 
earlier and my first thoughts about any
sort<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> leak<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.730> call<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
sort of leak like this is that I call it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.790 
sort of leak like this is that I call it
fake<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.809> there's<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.079> high<00:00:40.230> chance<00:00:40.260> it's

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
fake like it there's a high chance it's

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.200 
fake like it there's a high chance it's
going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.219> fake<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.820> finding<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
going to be fake but just finding the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.670 
going to be fake but just finding the
proof<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> evidence<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.440> fake

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
proof and the evidence they is fake

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
proof and the evidence they is fake
which<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> did<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.910> honest<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.300> struggle<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
which it did to be honest I struggle to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
which it did to be honest I struggle to
find<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.440> proof<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.370> was

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
find the proof for this one that it was

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
find the proof for this one that it was
fake<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> end<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.360> did<00:00:48.899> sort<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.140> find

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
fake but in the end I did sort of find

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.770 
fake but in the end I did sort of find
sort<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.829> big<00:00:50.370> hint<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.180> fake<00:00:51.390> image

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
sort of big hint that it's a fake image

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.330 
sort of big hint that it's a fake image

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.039 
did come out on a Thursday now there's
some<00:01:29.670> speculation<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.600> may<00:01:30.810> have

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
some speculation that they may have

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.179 
some speculation that they may have
changed<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> date<00:01:31.590> due<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> thai<00:01:32.130> temple

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
changed the date due to the thai temple

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.770 
changed the date due to the thai temple
but<00:01:32.579> won't<00:01:32.820> go<00:01:32.939> into<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.390> might<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.659> into

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
but won't go into that we might go into

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.630 
but won't go into that we might go into
detail<00:01:34.140> about<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.350> let's<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.310> move<00:01:35.520> on

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
detail about that let's just move on

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.249 
detail about that let's just move on
with<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> rest<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> image<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.229> we

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
torn and mortar now as with most leaks

this<00:01:45.750> image<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.770> poor<00:01:46.950> quality<00:01:47.340> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this image is really poor quality you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
this image is really poor quality you
can't<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.880> make<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.180> much<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
can't really make out much of it and I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.630 
can't really make out much of it and I
would<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.649> played<00:01:49.799> spent<00:01:50.070> time<00:01:50.250> trying<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
would have played spent time trying to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.399 
would have played spent time trying to
find<00:01:50.939> where<00:01:51.509> these<00:01:51.689> images<00:01:52.049> came<00:01:52.229> from

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
find where these images came from

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.870 
find where these images came from
exactly<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.310> soon<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.549> found<00:01:53.700> these

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
exactly but as soon as I found these

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.130 
exactly but as soon as I found these
other<00:01:54.119> floors<00:01:54.420> which<00:01:54.570> they're<00:01:54.720> gonna<00:01:54.869> point

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
other floors which they're gonna point

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.959 
other floors which they're gonna point
out<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.380> didn't<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:55.860> feel<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.280> need<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
out i didn't really feel the need to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
out i didn't really feel the need to
waste<00:01:57.180> my<00:01:57.390> time<00:01:57.600> trying<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.200> find<00:01:58.350> these

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
waste my time trying to find these

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.310 
waste my time trying to find these
