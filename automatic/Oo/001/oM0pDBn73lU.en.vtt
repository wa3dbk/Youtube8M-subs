thanks<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> commercial<00:01:00.059> fishing<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.510> sort

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
thanks to commercial fishing it's sort

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.290 
thanks to commercial fishing it's sort
of<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.020> had<00:01:01.170> 10<00:01:01.440> fish<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:02.520> ate<00:01:02.670> 9<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.120> them

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
of like we had 10 fish we ate 9 of them

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.850 
of like we had 10 fish we ate 9 of them
so<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.439> moment<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
so now what at the moment the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380 
so now what at the moment the
international<00:01:05.339> community<00:01:05.729> has<00:01:05.939> agreed<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
international community has agreed to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750 
international community has agreed to
fish<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.780> seasons<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.740> catch<00:01:08.070> quotas<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
fish in seasons with catch quotas and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.850 
fish in seasons with catch quotas and
minimum<00:01:09.119> size<00:01:09.360> limits<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> hope<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
minimum size limits with the hope that

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
minimum size limits with the hope that
this<00:01:10.979> would<00:01:11.159> allow<00:01:11.400> time<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> fish<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
this would allow time for the fish to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
this would allow time for the fish to
mature<00:01:12.900> spawn<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> build<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> population

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
mature spawn and build the population

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.179 
mature spawn and build the population

back newsflash fit ain't working why

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.039

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.160 
a new plan published in PLoS Biology has
a<00:01:34.200> pretty<00:01:34.920> radical<00:01:35.610> solution<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.810> they<00:01:36.960> say

a pretty radical solution that they say

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.569 
a pretty radical solution that they say
will<00:01:37.290> sustain<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> fish<00:01:37.979> populations

will sustain the fish populations

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.130 
will sustain the fish populations
forever<00:01:38.820> close<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.450> oceans

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
forever close the oceans

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.039 
forever close the oceans
ok<00:01:40.770> everybody<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.340> had<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> good<00:01:41.700> run<00:01:41.970> close<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
ok everybody we had a good run close it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:43.429 
ok everybody we had a good run close it
up

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
up

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.170 
up
we're<00:01:43.829> done<00:01:44.070> seriously<00:01:44.670> though<00:01:44.820> close<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
we're done seriously though close the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090 
we're done seriously though close the
oceans<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> work<00:01:46.200> according

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
oceans is this going to work according

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.340 
oceans is this going to work according
to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> researchers<00:01:47.759> models<00:01:48.210> yeah<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:49.320> only

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
to the researchers models yeah not only
