00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.290 

I<00:00:12.440> was<00:00:13.070> asked<00:00:13.340> to<00:00:13.370> create<00:00:13.550> a<00:00:13.700> piece<00:00:13.940> of<00:00:13.970> art

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.680 
I was asked to create a piece of art
that<00:00:14.450> communicated<00:00:15.290> my<00:00:15.410> vision

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
as I looked for inspiration I realized

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.660 
as I looked for inspiration I realized
stacking<00:00:19.960> was<00:00:20.110> all<00:00:20.260> around<00:00:20.530> me<00:00:20.680> it<00:00:21.520> was

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
stacking was all around me it was

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.210 
stacking was all around me it was
everywhere<00:00:22.120> I<00:00:22.180> went<00:00:22.300> I<00:00:22.950> learned<00:00:23.950> that<00:00:24.070> no

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
everywhere I went I learned that no

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.770 
everywhere I went I learned that no

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.930 
matter how great something is on its own
sometimes<00:00:26.470> it<00:00:26.830> has<00:00:26.950> more<00:00:27.130> of<00:00:27.190> an<00:00:27.340> impact<00:00:27.490> when

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
sometimes it has more of an impact when

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.220 
sometimes it has more of an impact when
it's<00:00:28.060> combined<00:00:28.420> with<00:00:28.480> other<00:00:28.690> things<00:00:29.050> to

it's combined with other things to

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.010 
it's combined with other things to
complement<00:00:29.770> it<00:00:29.920> like<00:00:30.610> a<00:00:30.640> sandwich<00:00:31.119> if<00:00:31.840> you

decided<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.870> stack<00:01:23.460> 370<00:01:24.460> crates<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:25.060> use<00:01:25.300> as<00:01:25.450> my

the<00:01:28.260> first<00:01:28.560> step<00:01:28.830> was<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.220> spray<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.790> crates

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the first step was to spray the crates

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.880 
the first step was to spray the crates
with<00:01:30.270> different<00:01:30.690> layers<00:01:30.870> of<00:01:31.140> colors<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.740> use

I<00:01:39.250> added<00:01:40.240> another<00:01:40.480> layer<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.780> images<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.470> you

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
I added another layer of images that you

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:58.860
