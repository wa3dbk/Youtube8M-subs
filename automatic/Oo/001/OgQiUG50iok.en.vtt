certainly need help but with the Packers

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.490 
certainly need help but with the Packers
it's<00:00:44.100> always<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> same<00:00:44.610> need<00:00:45.090> blast<00:00:45.719> five<00:00:46.170> six

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it's always the same need blast five six

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.190 
it's always the same need blast five six
seven<00:00:46.739> years<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.399> defense<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.300> know

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
seven years and that's defense I know

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
seven years and that's defense I know
people<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:49.920> inside<00:00:50.309> linebacker<00:00:50.610> they

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
people want an inside linebacker they

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.880

were<00:00:51.180> clamoring<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> think

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
were clamoring for that but I think

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
were clamoring for that but I think
cornerback<00:00:53.489> was<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> bigger<00:00:53.969> need<00:00:54.239> due<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
cornerback was a bigger need due to the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.529 
cornerback was a bigger need due to the
importance<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> position<00:00:55.940> as<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> result<00:00:57.449> i

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
importance of the position as a result i

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.420 
importance of the position as a result i
have<00:00:57.660> no<00:00:57.899> no<00:00:58.590> problem<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> fact<00:00:59.309> that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
have no no problem with the fact that

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040 
have no no problem with the fact that
packers<00:00:59.820> drafted<00:01:00.210> cornerbacks<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.930> their

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
they're both a little bit of projects

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.350 
they're both a little bit of projects
but<00:01:15.720> they're<00:01:15.900> intriguing<00:01:16.259> talents<00:01:17.360> my

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
but they're intriguing talents my

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
but they're intriguing talents my
question<00:01:18.780> about<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.830> two<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.549> have

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
question about these two is do they have

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
question about these two is do they have
the<00:01:20.820> size<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> speed<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.570> play<00:01:21.810> outside

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the size and speed to play outside

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
the size and speed to play outside
because<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.799> looks<00:01:22.979> right<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
because it looks right now like the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.060 
because it looks right now like the
Packers<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> lot<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.140> Nickelback's<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
Packers have a lot of Nickelback's and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520 
Packers have a lot of Nickelback's and
maybe<00:01:26.700> only<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.270> guy<00:01:27.479> Sam<00:01:27.869> Shields<00:01:28.200> who's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
maybe only one guy Sam Shields who's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770 
maybe only one guy Sam Shields who's
really<00:01:28.829> proven<00:01:29.220> himself<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.240> true

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
really proven himself to be a true

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.289 
really proven himself to be a true
outside<00:01:31.229> guy<00:01:31.470> who<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.890> run<00:01:32.100> run<00:01:32.820> deep<00:01:33.090> with

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
outside guy who can run run deep with

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.380 
outside guy who can run run deep with
the<00:01:33.329> big<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> big<00:01:34.320> tall<00:01:34.560> receivers

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
the big with the big tall receivers

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.569 
the big with the big tall receivers
still<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.619> both<00:01:37.799> those<00:01:37.950> guys<00:01:38.159> have<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
still I think both those guys have the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
still I think both those guys have the
kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.850> talent<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
kind of talent and the kind of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.270 
kind of talent and the kind of
playmaking<00:01:40.200> ability<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.799> will<00:01:40.920> help<00:01:41.070> this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
playmaking ability that will help this

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
playmaking ability that will help this

if<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.960> Packers<00:02:23.350> didn't<00:02:23.680> think<00:02:23.920> any<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.520> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
if the Packers didn't think any of the

if the Packers didn't think any of the
others<00:02:24.880> were<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.420> think<00:02:25.810> Jake<00:02:26.110> Ryan<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.470> going

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590

to<00:02:26.650> be<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.770> terrific<00:02:27.130> player<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.670> think<00:02:28.000> it'd<00:02:28.090> be

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
to be a terrific player I think it'd be

to be a terrific player I think it'd be
a<00:02:28.210> real<00:02:28.480> solid<00:02:28.750> player<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> don't<00:02:29.590> know<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.860> it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
a real solid player I don't know that it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.620 
a real solid player I don't know that it
would<00:02:29.950> be<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.100> great<00:02:30.310> player<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.940> think<00:02:31.360> you'd<00:02:31.480> be

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
would be a great player I think you'd be

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.510 
would be a great player I think you'd be
a<00:02:31.660> solid<00:02:31.900> player<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.740> he<00:02:32.830> might<00:02:33.010> be<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.190> solid

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
a solid player and he might be a solid

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.390 
a solid player and he might be a solid
player<00:02:33.850> all<00:02:34.170> pretty<00:02:35.170> soon<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.650> as<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.040> this

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
player all pretty soon like as in this

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.330 
player all pretty soon like as in this
year<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.870> they<00:02:38.140> felt<00:02:38.380> some<00:02:38.560> needs<00:02:38.740> on<00:02:38.950> defense

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
year so they felt some needs on defense

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.100 
year so they felt some needs on defense
I<00:02:39.550> think<00:02:39.760> that's<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.060> successful<00:02:40.630> draft<00:02:40.900> a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
I think that's a successful draft a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.100 
I think that's a successful draft a
promising<00:02:41.709> draft<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:43.330> course<00:02:43.570> not<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.780> players

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
promising draft of course not a players

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.690 
promising draft of course not a players
have<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.500> perform<00:02:44.860> that's<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> one<00:02:45.340> thing<00:02:45.520> we

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
have to perform that's the one thing we

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.160 
have to perform that's the one thing we
never<00:02:45.880> know<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.360> we<00:02:46.420> won't<00:02:46.570> know<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.930> till

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
never know and we won't know that till

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.740 
never know and we won't know that till
