00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
now once we get that we've got the first

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.990 
now once we get that we've got the first
table<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.200> user<00:01:13.530> variables<00:01:14.400> all

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
table here which is user variables all

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.660 
table here which is user variables all
right<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.900> need<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> add<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> path<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
right and we need to add a path so that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.480 
right and we need to add a path so that
the<00:01:17.759> computer<00:01:18.090> knows<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.659> look<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.590> Ouya

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the computer knows to look for the Ouya

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.630 
the computer knows to look for the Ouya
console<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> path<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
console so that path that we're going to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.120 
console so that path that we're going to
add<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> depend<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.409> where

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
add is really going to depend on where

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
add is really going to depend on where
we<00:01:26.490> place<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.390> Android<00:01:27.869> SDK<00:01:29.090> what<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> want

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
we place the Android SDK what you want

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.330 
we place the Android SDK what you want
to<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.049> want<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> point<00:01:31.680> toward<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to do is you want to point toward the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.859 
to do is you want to point toward the
platform<00:01:32.729> tools<00:01:33.570> section<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.650> SDK<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.479> in
