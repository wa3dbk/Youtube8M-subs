00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.979
 hello good morning how are you today with less 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.749
 of 10 dollars we are going to change the rattan 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:10.049
 touch screen of a Huawei mobile 

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:12.179
 ascend and 300 the shipping is free and 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.070
 inside the box as you see comes to us 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.170
 perfectly packaged the screen 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.140
 touch with your flex or connection cable 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.820
 plus a small but useful kit 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.590
 tools that will facilitate us and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.140
 will help in this work as 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.090
 extra tools the only one bit more 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.430
 rare will necessarily be a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.920
 six-point hexagonal screwdriver 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.320
 We will start by removing the back cover the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.719
 battery and the seven head screws 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.460
 hexagonal with caution that one of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.890
 they are covered with that sticker 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.780
 white that you are seeing that makes the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.550
 times of protection against 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.550
 Prolonged two-year warranties 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.760
 then with the two levers of 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.370
 plastic that they saw us included in 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.159
 buy the touch screen we will open the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.649
 smartphone removing its back frame and 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.650
 so you can access the connection tab 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.540
 of the touch screen to disconnect it 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.030
 important as you see you have to disconnect 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.310
 the so that when we force the rattan 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.210
 When we extract the screen, we do not damage the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.210
 female connector 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.369
 ok here is broken touch screen for 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.649
 the two will not be of great help 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.229
 wedges and the suction cup that included us 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.270
 buy the touch screen as you are 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.219
 watching for the sucker to strike 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.530
 strongly first we remove the 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.899
 screen saver we only love the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.149
 wind the screen and throw it to the 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.280
 same time we raise with the wedge 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.859
 more rigid when we get up 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.340
 a little the screen we introduce the wedge 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:53.409
 more flexible and nothing with patience go 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.280
 taking off the screen until we can 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.409
 with your fingers take out the touch as 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.409
 no no 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.840
 even so they are going to be left stuck together 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.609
 to the smartphone those little pieces you have to 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.679
 remove them to fit perfectly 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.230
 in the new screen to remove them 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.390
 We will be very careful not to scratch or 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.370
 damage the smartphone's frame 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.410
 that's why the tools for 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.349
 repair of mobile phones are usually 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.180
 plastic screwdrivers wedges and 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.340
 levers 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.010
 mecachis these two that you are seeing 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.319
 they are resisting me in passing I show you 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.870
 the little hole where you have to enter 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.190
 the connection flex embedded in the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.190
 new touch screen 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.209
 as I have to remove those two 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.560
 pieces of the old screen I do not have left 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.590
 More remedy than using a screwdriver 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.939
 metallic that yes very careful not to 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.469
 scratch the mobile well at the end ready already 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.349
 The body of the 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:58.180
 smartphone also of the old touch 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.430
 we can take advantage of the framework 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.189
 foam rubber that surrounds the visible part of 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.750
 the screen as you see with patience what 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.750
 We can remove it for reuse 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.440
 Nothing is as simple as returning it to 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.140
 fold this frame on the new screen 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.000
 will give robustness to the touch and will prevent 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.170
 small leaks of liquids to the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.170
 panel lcd this 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.520
 the next step we reopen the 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.190
 mobile with plastic levers with 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.200
 patience we fit them look at is the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.380
 old tactile connector had we had 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.450
 broken is worth now with the new 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.550
 screen we have to go with a lot 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.070
 careful not to scratch the and especially not 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.020
 break the connection flex this flex what 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.700
 we introduce through the hole and with the 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.580
 help from a pair of tweezers we take it out 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.260
 ready for later connection 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.780
 well then we remove dust and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.550
 chips with the brush and we studied that 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.400
 such fits the new touch in the 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.070
 smartphone worth the screen fits 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.730
 perfectly and obligatorily 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.730
 to go stuck 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.190
 now we already conscientiously make sure 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.830
 that everything is clean first with a 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.080
 brush and then with a chamois or cloth 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.820
 those who leave us little hair and appeal with 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.610
 the glue that you like or 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.340
 you prefer, I usually use loctite 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.350
 fast glue and extra strong so 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.380
 that I quickly apply the glue and 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.900
 I immediately fit 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.490
 also realize that the glue and 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.710
 one of post in the places where 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.580
 set the screen and that there is no 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.080
 buttons sensor cables or membranes 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.190
 we keep pressed a few minutes like this 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.920
 until the quick glue dries 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.470
 then connect the flex cable 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.590
 of the screen on its connector we check 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.180
 everything is well connected and fit 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.940
 we clean 10 minutes and then with our 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.900
 brush to finish inserting the lid 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.900
 back pressure 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.550
 we have to hear the packs indicating that 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.590
 has perfectly fit to finish 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.810
 with the last step screwing the 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.500
 seven screws making sure they remain 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.500
 very strong 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.030
 we have already finished the replaced screen 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.060
 satisfactorily now the proof of 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.880
 fire we put the battery the lid and 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.680
 we turn on a few seconds to start 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.680
 and the system is initialized 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.510
 perfect everything right now we check the 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.540
 keyboard and touch of wonder we give 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.970
 the repair by good friends this is 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.700
 I hope you liked it . 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.700
 and until the next video tutorial chao
