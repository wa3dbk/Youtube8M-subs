00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.550
 at the end of my record view it depends 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.550
 pay 0 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.900
 and the papers 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.190
 this excuse me that today has been a 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.190
 little bit my mouth is dry from allergies 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.690
 they were also especially like the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.690
 serial beech 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.730
 but I did not have coupons if I got a 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.769
 little bit more expensive for that reason 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.400
 so I show you here look at it this 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:34.540
 box of which have this next 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.540
 on these coupons 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.550
 a dollar of 2 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.300
 a dollar of 2 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.770
 but of mini wheats 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.010
 a pain of three 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.290
 if you find those boxes and you 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.690
 They feel comfortable taking out the coupon and 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.770
 use it right there to buy that box 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:00.060
 do it but please, if it is not worth it 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.060
 to buy then 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.050
 try not to do that because I went today 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.480
 and there were a lot of boxes open there 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.040
 nothing more open because people are 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.560
 I had stolen the coupons that come 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.680
 inside the box so they opened it 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.920
 they took the coupons but they did not buy 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.920
 the product 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.940
 this coupon also comes here 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.460
 I 'm not the police or anything of the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.800
 coupons but 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.289
 and that does not look good on anyone 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.280
 especially one like people who 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:39.590
 They composed as it believes disrepute 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.360
 all not only oneself 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.360
 and let follow the expiration date 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.190
 It is for November 1, 2013 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.350
 so 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.080
 take advantage if you find in those boxes 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.970
 with the coupons inside to buy them 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.919
 and they can do the special again 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.800
 well that's all for today we wanted them 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:10.620
 teach quick what I went to do 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.620
 and then it was not much but to network 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.040
 enough because I forgot to point out that 

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:18.590
 this receipt but 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.440
 we paid a total of 12 75 for the 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.140
 portals so that with the farc with what 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.000
 that I had the face of skin and countries 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:33.170
 I had 15 dollars so I spent them there 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.289
 in our products and I paid from me for 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:41.289
 my tv card 120 for everything 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.270
 so you can say later but 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.069
 because they returned my guard five 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.020
 Dollars 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.349
 then pay 120 for all these 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.349
 friends 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.190
 I think I was pretty good good 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.080
 I hope you are having a 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.080
