I mean after everything is working as

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.390 
I mean after everything is working as
well<00:02:38.860> for<00:02:39.189> since<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.180> very<00:02:40.420> beginning<00:02:41.400> it's

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
well for since the very beginning it's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.390 
well for since the very beginning it's
been<00:02:43.180> incredible<00:02:43.689> so<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.370> personally<00:02:45.370> I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
been incredible so I personally I

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.789 
been incredible so I personally I
wouldn't<00:02:45.730> mind<00:02:46.120> seeing<00:02:46.480> William<00:02:46.780> Regal<00:02:46.959> just

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
wouldn't mind seeing William Regal just

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.380 
wouldn't mind seeing William Regal just
win<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.040> World<00:02:48.280> Championship<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.939> then<00:02:49.090> retire

win a World Championship and then retire

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
but I think it'd be pretty pointless and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.910 
but I think it'd be pretty pointless and
right<00:02:52.209> now<00:02:52.360> it's<00:02:52.569> not<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.989> good<00:02:53.260> time<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.739> mean

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920
