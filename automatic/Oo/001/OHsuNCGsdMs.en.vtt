00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.810
 7 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.160
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:31.870
 This time I will play sports with Lexus gs 450 h 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:37.420
 I would like to see in comparison with this bmw active hybrid 5 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:42.730
 This Lexus gs 450 h gs itself was announced in January 2012 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.660
 Then in the form of a well- known hybrid model, which will be called this 4 days later in March 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.250
 It was released 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:55.640
 This year Lexus gs Mimo until now, but it had been this hybrid model available 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.210
 Substantially this 45 Marekko is no there was v8 model until now in this model 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.290
 Or say I mean to ne 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.090
 Lexus gs drinking will be a model of high-end top end 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.080
 Powertrain has a v-type 6 and a 3.5 liter engine with a yeah electric motor 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 It was combined 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.460
 It fact, the system itself is called a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.200
 As the Well it does not have changed so much that went through in Sendai 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.560
 Maa specs show the system maximum output morning 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.820
 48 needles and the fuel efficiency of the core is 18.2 kg per liter in jc 08 mode 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.880
 We put the numbers 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.570
 I think that Sendai was 12.8 k 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:37.030
 It will be said that about 40% has been improved. 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.190
 Hybrid Even now, I strongly emphasized the form of the power hybrid, but this time 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.840
 so 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.780
 I finished the fuel efficiency largely without sacrificing the power of 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.680
 I think it is one of the highlights of 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:54.710
 And here is bmw Active Hybrid 5 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:58.910
 Powertrain is a series of 6th and 3 liter turbo engines. Here is one motor. 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.470
 In the case of Lexus gs 450 h, it will be in the form of a so-called motor 2 motor 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.200
 But this is one 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.910
 The one motor is well established in the form at home 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.420
 The maximum power output of the system is 340 horsepower 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:19.560
 Well gs 4 sesame column is quite similar numbers 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.560
 The fuel consumption is 13.6 kg after switching off in jc 08 mode 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.740
 Yes It is interior of here gs 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.220
 Well how do you look at the dashboard design from this gs 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.400
 I was at once greatly changed that Well of horizontal keynote 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.049
 It really does not's a creative 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:43.489
 Well I think it looks beautiful and the characteristic thing is the sound here 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:47.569
 Very big monitor of 12.31 It is said that it is the largest in the world so far 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.380
 The monitor is included here is Nana Navi or something else Hybrid system 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:54.610
 It is information of and can display various things 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:58.690
 And if you look at the design and so on like so-called quality, for example, this side 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.470
 The laser on the dashboard has a laser like this and it's very fine stitching 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.370
 I have entered 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.860
 Looking Toka stitch 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.879
 It is felt that the place like craftsmanship is true that the effect prettyness is really high 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.230
 I guess I guess 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.870
 Another important point of sound The new gs focuses on the driving position 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.220
 Is very strong 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.390
 This properly brother of the current steering is not just a little ne smaller 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.180
 I'm standing, I'm not feeling out 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.610
 Also lower leg position of the driving position sheet that told properly driver to come 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.870
 It's really good also a sound positional relationship of Toka 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.870
 It 's a driver's car that really makes it go 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.380
 I think there is no yeah rear seat 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.820
 Sendai In the gs In fact, if this rear seat is ne Well, a little narrow 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:51.400
 It is said that the main fact is that it was the point of unsatisfied frustration 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:56.410
 I'm improving it in the new model, but I'm actually turning all schools 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.450
 I understand if you can do it I do not use my head even if I grow up with Oma-chan 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.370
 Here I tried to take a gs not 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.210
 I think you can feel it is a big evolution 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.520
 The 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:11.390
 It is luggage space here too, especially in the hybrid model of Sendai 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.470
 The capacity of the battery being eroded has become quite small 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:20.470
 Well , if you put the battery on the new stage and put it in 2 steps 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.230
 In this only it has produced the space of the specific capacity in the form of relegate Well 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.660
 465 l 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:30.930
 It has become 300 liters was was to think and Well 1.5 times more than in Sendai Ganeemaa floor 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:35.310
 Well there are four golf bags in it . 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.510
 I think you might have got enough capacity for a car of this size Eye Power Trunk 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.350
 Also has a lid 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.220
 Well if you open the room or if you have your own key 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.310
 9 behind the car 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.590
 It can be operated by the switch 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.590
 You only have to press the switch here to close 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:59.620
 Yes, I would like to make sure that the people of the run 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.610
 It 's not that I feel that sleeping face is so big, but the work of this ldh is also big 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:07.860
 And I wonder if 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.860
 It sounds like an act , even in tight corners that come around in a price movement at all
