set<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> sync<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> via<00:01:47.189> Wi-Fi<00:01:47.460> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
set it up you can sync it via Wi-Fi and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
set it up you can sync it via Wi-Fi and
to<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.020> device<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> device<00:01:49.770> has<00:01:49.799> Wi-Fi<00:01:50.430> in

to the device of the device has Wi-Fi in

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.429 
to the device of the device has Wi-Fi in
it<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.180> means<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.750> automatically

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it that means it can automatically

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.649 
it that means it can automatically
receive<00:01:53.219> information<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.030> portal<00:01:54.420> new

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
actually don't completed a workout it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.410 
actually don't completed a workout it
will<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:58.799> sync<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.549> information<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.210> up

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
will then sync that information back up

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.969 
will then sync that information back up
to<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.570> portal<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.259> making<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.619> nice<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
to the portal just making it nice and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
to the portal just making it nice and
convenient<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.869> we've<00:02:03.869> talked<00:02:04.110> about

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
convenient so we've talked about

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.630 
convenient so we've talked about
planning<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.710> workout<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.520> it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
planning your workout you have it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.429 
planning your workout you have it
planned<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.299> next<00:02:06.600> thing<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.229> want<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
planned the next thing is you want to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.029 
planned the next thing is you want to
actually<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.829> on

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
actually go on

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.479 
actually go on
it<00:02:08.219> as<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:09.329> off<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.979> actually<00:02:10.979> compete

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
it as you go off and actually compete

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.250 
it as you go off and actually compete
then<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.390> key<00:02:12.569> thing<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:12.989> would<00:02:13.079> do<00:02:13.170> is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
then the key thing that it would do is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.199 
then the key thing that it would do is
it<00:02:13.290> has<00:02:13.560> specific<00:02:14.219> keys<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.609> the<00:02:14.700> top<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:14.909> the

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
it has specific keys on the top of the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.199 
it has specific keys on the top of the
device<00:02:15.590> for<00:02:16.590> work<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> left<00:02:17.609> and<00:02:17.879> then

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
device for work out on the left and then

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.149 
device for work out on the left and then
music<00:02:18.359> on<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.290> right<00:02:19.469> and<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.829> see<00:02:20.010> them

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
music on the right and you can see them

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.130 
music on the right and you can see them
probably<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.459> little<00:02:20.579> bit<00:02:20.730> better<00:02:20.939> here<00:02:21.359> so<00:02:22.049> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
probably a little bit better here so you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.330 
probably a little bit better here so you
press<00:02:22.319> your<00:02:22.500> workout<00:02:22.829> button<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.250> your

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
press your workout button and your

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.460 
press your workout button and your
comments<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:23.879> workout<00:02:24.359> as<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.079> go<00:02:25.200> through

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
comments your workout as you go through

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.899 
comments your workout as you go through
your<00:02:25.500> workout<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.099> important<00:02:26.519> element<00:02:26.819> is

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
your workout the important element is

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.460 
your workout the important element is
tracking<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.689> monitoring<00:02:28.109> what<00:02:28.349> you're

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
tracking and monitoring what you're

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.050 
tracking and monitoring what you're
doing<00:02:28.739> for<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.340> there<00:02:29.549> are<00:02:29.609> certain

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
doing for this there are certain

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.699 
doing for this there are certain
technologies<00:02:30.659> which<00:02:30.840> enable<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.349> do<00:02:31.560> that

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
technologies which enable you to do that

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.949 
technologies which enable you to do that
the<00:02:32.340> first<00:02:32.370> thing<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:33.000> obviously<00:02:33.299> it's<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.540> GPS

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the first thing is obviously it's a GPS

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.750 
the first thing is obviously it's a GPS
tracker<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.530> as<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:34.889> see<00:02:35.099> here<00:02:35.400> it's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
tracker so as you can see here it's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.819 
tracker so as you can see here it's
tracking<00:02:36.269> by<00:02:36.420> GPS<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.139> room<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.650> go

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
tracking by GPS the room that you go

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.830 
tracking by GPS the room that you go
after<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.730> that's<00:02:38.909> really<00:02:39.120> important<00:02:39.719> so<00:02:39.810> you

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
after so that's really important so you

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.869 
after so that's really important so you
know<00:02:40.049> that<00:02:40.260> when<00:02:40.409> you're<00:02:40.560> outdoors<00:02:40.879> but

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
know that when you're outdoors but

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.089 
know that when you're outdoors but
sometimes<00:02:42.299> you're<00:02:42.810> indoors<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.950> is

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
sometimes you're indoors and this is

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.099 
sometimes you're indoors and this is
where<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.430> Accu<00:02:44.760> sense<00:02:45.030> technology<00:02:45.299> comes<00:02:45.870> in

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
where the Accu sense technology comes in

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.429 
where the Accu sense technology comes in
nayaki<00:02:46.980> sense<00:02:47.250> takes<00:02:47.669> your<00:02:48.540> information<00:02:49.290> you

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
nayaki sense takes your information you

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.250 
nayaki sense takes your information you
input<00:02:49.470> about<00:02:49.889> your<00:02:50.129> height<00:02:50.400> your<00:02:50.760> weight<00:02:51.260> and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
input about your height your weight and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.830 
input about your height your weight and
your<00:02:52.319> age<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.010> then<00:02:53.970> also<00:02:54.120> uses<00:02:54.720> an

your step count and the amount of

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.440 
your step count and the amount of
calories<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.639> you<00:03:05.669> burn<00:03:05.790> through<00:03:06.359> an

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
calories that you burn through an

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.929 
calories that you burn through an
activity<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.470> gives<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.919> an<00:03:08.040> added<00:03:08.459> level<00:03:08.730> of

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
activity it gives you an added level of

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.039 
activity it gives you an added level of
tracking<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.200> monitoring<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:11.189> your<00:03:11.370> workout

plus<00:03:13.049> if<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.859> want<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.250> take<00:03:14.639> it<00:03:14.669> to<00:03:14.909> an<00:03:15.030> even

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
plus if you want to take it to an even

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.899 
plus if you want to take it to an even
deeper<00:03:15.510> level<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.379> can<00:03:16.590> use<00:03:16.799> heart<00:03:17.699> rate

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
deeper level you can use heart rate

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.589 
deeper level you can use heart rate
monitor<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.859> to<00:03:19.859> get<00:03:20.069> your<00:03:20.299> get<00:03:21.299> your<00:03:21.329> heart

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
monitor and to get your get your heart

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.899 
monitor and to get your get your heart
rate<00:03:21.780> also<00:03:22.709> there<00:03:22.919> will<00:03:23.069> be<00:03:23.220> coming<00:03:23.609> through

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
rate also there will be coming through

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.189 
rate also there will be coming through
short<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.239> your<00:03:24.359> speed<00:03:24.569> and<00:03:24.599> cadence<00:03:24.870> sensor

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
short of your speed and cadence sensor

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.809 
short of your speed and cadence sensor
for<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.620> bike<00:03:25.829> so<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.159> can<00:03:26.370> input<00:03:26.489> that

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
for the bike so you can input that

complete picture of your training know
when<00:06:54.449> you<00:06:54.539> roll<00:06:54.810> that<00:06:54.960> all<00:06:55.110> into<00:06:55.379> one<00:06:55.589> the

analysis and then inform the planning

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.409 
analysis and then inform the planning
and<00:06:58.710> then<00:06:59.039> you<00:06:59.190> can<00:06:59.400> look<00:06:59.580> to<00:06:59.729> say<00:06:59.879> okay<00:07:00.180> you're

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
not doing as well as I thought here or I

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.980 
not doing as well as I thought here or I
may<00:07:02.669> have<00:07:02.819> something<00:07:03.060> I<00:07:03.210> need<00:07:03.240> to<00:07:03.360> approve<00:07:03.719> I

may have something I need to approve I
can<00:07:04.379> then<00:07:04.469> adjust<00:07:04.589> my<00:07:04.889> training<00:07:05.279> plants<00:07:05.639> of

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
can then adjust my training plants of

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.050 
can then adjust my training plants of
digital<00:07:06.419> cycle<00:07:06.900> so<00:07:07.710> all<00:07:08.129> in<00:07:08.310> all<00:07:08.370> I<00:07:08.430> think<00:07:08.639> moto

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
digital cycle so all in all I think moto

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.610 
digital cycle so all in all I think moto
active<00:07:09.539> offers<00:07:09.839> something<00:07:10.050> if<00:07:10.319> you<00:07:10.440> are<00:07:10.560> a
