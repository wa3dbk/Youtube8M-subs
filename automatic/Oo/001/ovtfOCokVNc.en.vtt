00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello here we will show in the chart 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.889
 the different types of cavitation and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.309
 acid system here we must rule 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:20.509
 for this line and alkalization and 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.580
 and the civic system for example the 3.0 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.070
 that the brick color is a very color 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.660
 dangerous 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.110
 deposits his saliva in a cup and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.970
 take this drop and it becomes this color 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.650
 you are about to have cancer 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.320
 has a lot of vilo hype for the topic that 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.110
 is your system that is the system is very 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.910
 acid here the 4.0 is also of 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.650
 5.0 very bad gravity 6.0 is in the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.720
 way to improve with the change of 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.430
 get down worsened 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.070
 7.0 that dark greenish color in your 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.890
 saliva that is the perfect balance of your 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:03.629
 ph is a balance is neutral 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.150
 a balance in octave and then 8.0 is 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.619
 more alkaline in the body water 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.710
 organism we have to be here 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.630
 for the water that we drink must be of 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.280
 9.0 in the dark blue color to 10 points 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.990
 in which the color violet or color 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.270
 purple 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.270
 this guy here the 8.0 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.609
 well we are here at the edge of what 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.719
 is the neutral balance but the water of the 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.640
 hectare that we now go on a 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.939
 demonstration with the glasses and what 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.759
 we have here with waters of different 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.940
 site for example we have the water here 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.270
 what is water from the bottle 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.710
 which is the water we consume with the 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.710
 large bottle of water consuming of breath 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.810
 daily homes here we have a 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.110
 tap water we took that is water from 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.110
 the cistern 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.040
 and here we are going to deposit the water that is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.320
 the water is alkalizing with the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.760
 alkalizing that is the ph bus choice 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.190
 1 and 2 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.040
 the length that goes in this glass of such 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.410
 quality that we will then proceed to 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.470
 throw him lake you will see how they will change 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.660
 colors 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.240
 again we show water here 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.350
 some bottle of the key system 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.350
 and here we go 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.099
 to pour the alkaline water that is the one 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.580
 the water that I take the water that is 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.879
 used to maintain an alkaline ph 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.550
 you can see the colors and it's green 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.410
 cited is in the bottle that usually 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.590
 as in fact the boots in the sector 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.319
 naval verdecito usually becomes the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.920
 of the system becomes a little like 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:52.400
 acqua and this is the perfect balance 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.500
 is how a water should be becomes 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.460
 way almost and we're going to proceed 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.460
 with the drops 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.020
 in the bottle 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.069
 the length of the bottle is struggling 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.069
 drops 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:21.390
 and we can see how this color of this 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.850
 point 0 this greenish this greenness is 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.260
 between these two the water of the bottle 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.379
 he is very anxious 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.030
 let's go now with the water from the cistern 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.030
 ers who have alkalized 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.210
 let's proceed 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.950
 with the cistern 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.220
 and half the difference 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.730
 in the water of the cistern that is in 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.060
 8.0 can compare the 8.0 with that color 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.200
 Water 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.280
 if they see 8.0 cistern 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.280
 bottle 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.590
 6.0 5 points in 3 everything is almost 5.0 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.709
 too acidic and it's the water that we 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.350
 we take here in our nation and in others 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.000
 countries of the world to show here how 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.790
 it becomes the color that water takes 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.530
 alkaline which is the water that contains 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.530
 these two drops that selection 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.860
 let's see well what beauty this is or 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:35.590
 it is not 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.590
 camera trick this is pure science 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.590
 technological 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.300
 look at the color 10 points 0 purple color 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.569
 is the color in the player must be 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.490
 our water do not confuse this water 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.969
 It can not be ingested because they contain 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:58.199
 this chemical that is poisonous simply 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:05:00.509
 is the crystalline water in this way the 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.779
 which one should be consumed does not contain 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:07.229
 chemical inside but after being 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.699
 check those processes and some and two if 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.430
 can see the water sample that 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.770
 we must take 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.390
 there are few people who drink water 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.660
 in your house that has this color with twelve 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.180
 tests we used almost always the 98 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.070
 percent of the time we use the 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.770
 water with our children with our 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.010
 sick who is very acidic from 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.620
 'botellón' the cistern is still 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.970
 better than the bottle but people 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.820
 he is afraid of the system because a 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.500
 stagnant water is known to have 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.740
 simple mental but if you use a good 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.930
 filter and boil this water can consume 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.030
 the best that the botillo that does the 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.340
 filter the fried the filter highlight the 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.140
 heavy metals which are housed in 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.060
 the brain causing the shamsi a 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.120
 No number of diseases pain of 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.980
 arthritis and cardiovascular problems 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.530
 for the excess of metal that the tree brings 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.290
 if an alkalinizing filter d'or is used 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.410
 This decision can be made without any 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.630
 problem because the filter purifies if not 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.870
 has the filter then I opted for 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:13.160
 the lake of the botellón restructure it with 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.190
 the sky in booster that the ph a phd there 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.710
 a hoist and the channeler where 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.830
 get good this through here in 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.990
 fact is that they can also get in 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.210
 amazon.com can get this water or 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.150
 through my here in our clinic 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.700
 our office how much depleted of 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.950
 champions there will be a gallon to a gallon 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:39.260
 you get 70 installments of each if you 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:41.120
 multiply 70 drop by 5 wish that the 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.150
 story bottle are analyzed what they will see 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.850
 multiplying multiply 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.320
 this is very important according to the organism 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.230
 that is alkaline 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.760
 A) Yes 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:58.480
 they do not ask for a google go back to children with the 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.520
 water that we take in this in this state 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.470
 cancer are prone to cancer and 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.450
 many degenerative diseases 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.450
 which it is suffering humanity 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.050
 thank you very much I hope you have been 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.780
 of more interest our demonstration 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.660
 scientifically ill change their way of 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.180
 life in your home more ingestion of the same 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.090
 9 glass of alkaline water not glass of water 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.440
 Acid to prevent diseases 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.440
