00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.440
 welcome everyone to my channel and we 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.570
 We know that recently came out so 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.540
 great game like daylight 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.210
 but for many it slows down even on my 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.180
 top-end gland she manages to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.050
 some places just slow down 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.640
 here in the building 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.150
 keeps 60 fps in on the street like 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 would be good too 50 60 but there are such places 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.480
 just drawdown where not unreal happens 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.239
 and up to 30 subsides and up to 20 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.980
 about those who have stable birds holding 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 such they may even be up to 0 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.950
 squander namely with a sharp 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140
 turning the camera principle and that's it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.250
 maybe well that does not have time 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 will load 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.079
 Now I can not say that the optimization in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.199
 this game is bad and worse 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.969
 Still, there are some shoals and we will try 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.899
 with you these shoals 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.020
 prevent we do with you 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.200
 optimizing this game is of course worsening 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.600
 you're worsening the visualization of the game itself 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.720
 there we will remove the shadows completely and we 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.050
 a little bit 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.230
 we are like a little shadow we will remove for those 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.990
 one game lag Dowd fully and 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.330
 Who has a very weak comp game just does not 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.330
 draws this game we also make 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.120
 The resolution is low because I tried 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.670
 I run on my laptop at least 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.210
 the resolution was 1024 by 600 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.780
 although you can and 800 to 600 and 640 stand on 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.980
 480 set 40 by 480 is a little bit higher 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.400
 too low resolution 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.390
 but 800 to 600, in principle, more or less 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.400
 You can play now let's start 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.590
 first optimization just remove you 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.220
 let's go to my documents here we find 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.229
 daddy daylight as you can see y 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.270
 I have here a lot of folders and files in 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.720
 you will be like one or two butterflies 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.369
 just out and something else 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.209
 terrible we still do the same as in 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.620
 me you just need to download 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.050
 archive 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.930
 I'll post everything under the video in the description here 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.880
 archive will be called out we go into this 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.400
 select all the folder and set it all 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.680
 in that same daylight folder here 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.840
 not going anywhere else in any folder 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.360
 him father though cleaning up the daylight folder 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.720
 paste these all the files wait 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.450
 oh wait processor transfer process 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.739
 format 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.660
 in the folder let's here when you wait for 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.790
 you all move day and get out 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.310
 Now the second way for those who 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.670
 just comp and don't pull this game out 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.560
 how of course after this method you have 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.580
 performance when afraid to 15 20 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.890
 fps which is very good here and now we 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.250
 try the method but which is generally just 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.590
 he makes the resolution low here and 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.959
 some little parameters he killed 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.739
 cleans and stands on low want 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.220
 warn 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.120
 after you need to go here will be a folder 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.660
 in daylight we â€™ll go down here sitting and here 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.920
 these two files are inserted here when you 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.470
 paste these 2 files 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.510
 I ask you not to change anything in the parameters 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.360
 the game itself if you put in there and 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.250
 change change some parameter all 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.530
 These settings are from two files. 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.799
 just get lost the game will be again anew 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.230
 lag here just don't ask for anything 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.690
 touch in the parameters here of course 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.730
 after replacing these files everything will be on 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.130
 low resolution will be low though 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.600
 the lowest one will be written 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.959
 in the game it will actually be much 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.870
 below what is written there and will be 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.480
 such an option stand foliage quality on 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.920
 high don't change it not to low 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.260
 nothing if you have it even a little 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.150
 change yes and apply all these two 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.889
 the parameters will simply get off and you will again 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.079
 will start to lag 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:10.440
 here take shuffle replace all 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.480
 more than anything, I hope that you these 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.480
 ways helped 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.310
 here it is all until we meet again 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.049

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.360
 I think there will be no problems because all 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.850
