00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
him once or twice and I didn't have to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.160 
him once or twice and I didn't have to
tie<00:02:31.829> it<00:02:31.859> up

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the other thing was that Branford had

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.560 
the other thing was that Branford had
left<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.460> show<00:03:05.610> they<00:03:05.790> changed<00:03:06.090> band<00:03:06.270> leaders
