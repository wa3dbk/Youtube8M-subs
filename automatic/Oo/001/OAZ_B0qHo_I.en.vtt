00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.230
 like amazing spiderman 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.230
 the genesis 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.580
 Did you feel lonely, sad? 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.580
 powerless 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.720
 Peter Parker filled each one as well 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.340
 day a swept in the school 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.630
 Just did not understand why Peter 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.880
 enjoyed things 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.739
 and if kids do not do anything right 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.739
 they can be very cruel to understand 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.490
 Peter, however, liked all his subjects 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.500
 Science was his 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.060
 favorite subjects 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.340
 He was the best student that with on 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.750
 had seen high for years and his 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.750
 Teachers were very proud of him 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.120
 the only thing that Peter loved even more 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.420
 his natural sciences were his 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.890
 aunt may and his uncle ben whenever 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.890
 peter in the school a bit bitter 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.610
 even if some give him a short break at school 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.700
 peter could not stand it 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.860
 never unkind it should be one 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.460
 great performance in the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.289
 natural science school 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 give 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.990
 he asked the other kids if they were up 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.990
 wanted to join him 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.920
 The other students just laughed 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.200
 over peter one of them a stocky one 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.799
 guy named flash thompson nudged him 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.799
 even to the ground 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.590
 until he arrived, he had all his own 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.930
 classmates forget everything 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.360
 I could think that was the experiment 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.500
 he could not wait to see how 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.390
 the scientists probably one 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.810
 control radioactive radiation values 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.810
 would 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.680
 Everything was ready that could try 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.680
 begin 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.819
 Peter sourly expectant to exactly how 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.819
 something else 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.730
 excelsior 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.170
 Everyone was so fascinated that nobody 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.150
 noticed that a spider just the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.230
 time of activation between the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.230
 Let down rays 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.659
 and when she now spins radioactive 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.019
 fell deadly hit 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:41.129
 Until you are the closest creature it 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.129
 was Peter Parker 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.660
 ex chelsea 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.980
 immediately felt as if Peter were bitten 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.110
 he is weak and tired 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.490
 he just wanted to leave the dark lab 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.490
 out and then the fresh air 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.720
 Peter's head whirred 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.130
 Tingle everything he knew 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.130
 that he had to react 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.740
 had to do something 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.180
 and so he did something 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.090
 later it was certain that he was dreaming 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.630
 He could not really work on one 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.630
 wall up 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.140
 when he reached the roof he reached 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.390
 looking for a chimney and 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.640
 smashed 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.640
 he had never been so strong 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:18.320
 He felt the tingling again this time 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:19.940
 it urged him to do it and he did 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.680
 wanted to go down to the street again 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.120
 It was almost as easy as one 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.120
 Climb down clothesline 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.979
 Peter looked in admiration 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.389
 how can this be done? 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.400
 somehow the experiment had the 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.280
 have influenced the dying creature 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.389
 and when she peter up she had his 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.389
 Power passed on to him 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.919
 Peter old home 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.740
 then he hurried back again 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.400
 later his new one decided 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.190
 powers on a brutal wrestler named 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.870
 crusher lifted to test 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.430
 Peter wore a disguise with it 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.400
 nobody could make fun of him 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.110
 if his plan did not work out 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.490
 when pine challenged the wrestler 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.490
 laughed collar 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.639
 joanne k 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.069
 because 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.870
 v 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.389
 Yes 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:40.740
 And that was the rule the Peter Parker 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:40.740
 lived from that day on 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.840
 The End 

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:12.130
 vengeance origins haug 

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.130
 vengeance origins pace 

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:14.840
 again
