00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.510 
dark troops so this game is actually
starting<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.180> evolve<00:03:36.569> more<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.110> more<00:03:37.520> pretty

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
starting to evolve more and more pretty

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.520 
starting to evolve more and more pretty
impressive<00:03:39.800> so<00:03:40.879> um<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:44.069> stats<00:03:44.430> um

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
impressive so um the stats um

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.949 
impressive so um the stats um
approximately<00:03:46.530> are<00:03:48.620> 37<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.860> 39<00:03:50.370> damage<00:03:51.330> per

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
approximately are 37 to 39 damage per

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.720 
approximately are 37 to 39 damage per
shot<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.560> they<00:03:52.920> attack<00:03:53.220> about<00:03:55.280> every<00:03:56.280> second

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
shot and they attack about every second

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.350 
shot and they attack about every second
maybe<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.780> little<00:03:57.840> bit<00:03:58.170> faster<00:03:58.520> so<00:03:59.520> um<00:04:02.360> well

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
maybe a little bit faster so um well

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.479 
maybe a little bit faster so um well
let's<00:04:04.349> actually<00:04:04.560> check<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.129> wiki<00:04:05.599> ok<00:04:06.599> I<00:04:06.810> think

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:49.809 
since also you could see that these got

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:56.809 
since also you could see that these got
the<00:04:50.289> minions<00:04:50.679> do<00:04:51.339> attack<00:04:51.699> all<00:04:52.919> let's<00:04:53.919> find<00:04:54.399> it

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:03.209 

let<00:04:57.819> me<00:04:57.969> try<00:04:58.179> to<00:04:58.239> fight<00:04:58.479> it<00:05:01.559> it's<00:05:02.559> not<00:05:02.829> only

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:03.219 
let me try to fight it it's not only

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.699 
let me try to fight it it's not only
resource<00:05:03.849> when<00:05:04.809> I<00:05:04.839> saw<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.169> pictures<00:05:05.349> I

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:05.709 
resource when I saw the pictures I

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:08.609 
resource when I saw the pictures I
actually<00:05:05.889> thought<00:05:06.360> they<00:05:07.360> were<00:05:07.419> going<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.229> be

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:08.619 
actually thought they were going to be

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:16.369 
actually thought they were going to be
new<00:05:09.189> goblins<00:05:09.699> but<00:05:10.499> not<00:05:11.499> exactly<00:05:14.309> hey<00:05:15.309> wait

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
new goblins but not exactly hey wait

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.219 
new goblins but not exactly hey wait
okay<00:05:17.379> as<00:05:17.559> you<00:05:17.739> can<00:05:17.860> see<00:05:18.599> the<00:05:19.599> minions<00:05:19.989> are

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
okay as you can see the minions are

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.249 
okay as you can see the minions are
actual<00:05:20.619> attacking<00:05:20.979> that<00:05:21.099> cannon<00:05:21.489> so<00:05:22.259> you

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
actual attacking that cannon so you

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.809 
actual attacking that cannon so you
could<00:05:23.409> obviously<00:05:23.739> see<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.309> the<00:05:24.519> not<00:05:24.669> only

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
could obviously see that the not only

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.479 
could obviously see that the not only
resources<00:05:25.479> but<00:05:26.019> they<00:05:26.259> are<00:05:26.349> also<00:05:26.649> defense<00:05:27.339> is

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:27.489 
resources but they are also defense is

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:28.829 
resources but they are also defense is
so<00:05:27.669> thick<00:05:27.909> that<00:05:28.059> means<00:05:28.389> that<00:05:28.599> they<00:05:28.809> are

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:28.839 
so thick that means that they are

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:33.299 
so thick that means that they are
attacking<00:05:29.679> any<00:05:30.039> so<00:05:31.559> goblin<00:05:32.559> till<00:05:32.739> five<00:05:33.069> would

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:33.309 
attacking any so goblin till five would

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:39.739 
attacking any so goblin till five would
do<00:05:33.459> 30<00:05:33.879> to<00:05:34.209> attack<00:05:34.989> any<00:05:35.489> but<00:05:36.489> on<00:05:36.669> resources<00:05:37.179> 64

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:39.749 
do 30 to attack any but on resources 64

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:44.939 
do 30 to attack any but on resources 64
so<00:05:40.749> in<00:05:40.929> all<00:05:41.079> the<00:05:41.559> pretty<00:05:41.799> strong<00:05:42.159> but<00:05:43.739> the<00:05:44.739> hip

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
so in all the pretty strong but the hip

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:51.509 
so in all the pretty strong but the hip
points<00:05:45.249> it<00:05:45.759> takes<00:05:46.599> to<00:05:47.639> UM<00:05:49.709> shots<00:05:50.709> from<00:05:51.039> an

points it takes to UM shots from an
archer<00:05:51.939> tower<00:05:52.179> I<00:05:52.509> think<00:05:53.050> level<00:05:53.469> 7<00:05:53.949> let's<00:05:54.699> see

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:54.939 
archer tower I think level 7 let's see

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:57.389 
archer tower I think level 7 let's see
what<00:05:55.089> yeah<00:05:55.779> level<00:05:56.079> 7<00:05:56.409> they<00:05:56.769> searched<00:05:57.009> error

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:57.399 
what yeah level 7 they searched error

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.719 
what yeah level 7 they searched error
right<00:05:57.639> next<00:05:57.939> to<00:05:58.029> the<00:05:58.860> air<00:05:59.860> defense<00:06:00.189> that's

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
right next to the air defense that's

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.939 
right next to the air defense that's
level<00:06:01.029> seven<00:06:01.329> hours<00:06:01.449> hair<00:06:01.809> and<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.559> took<00:06:02.739> two

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
level seven hours hair and it took two

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.479 
level seven hours hair and it took two
hits<00:06:03.129> from<00:06:03.550> hit<00:06:03.729> that<00:06:03.909> guy<00:06:04.119> so<00:06:05.050> and<00:06:05.349> each<00:06:06.219> hit

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:06.489 
hits from hit that guy so and each hit

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:11.959 
hits from hit that guy so and each hit
from<00:06:06.699> an<00:06:06.849> arch<00:06:07.149> terror<00:06:07.659> is<00:06:08.189> about<00:06:09.419> 42<00:06:10.419> damage

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
from an arch terror is about 42 damage

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:18.419 
from an arch terror is about 42 damage
let's<00:06:12.969> check<00:06:13.300> that<00:06:15.839> so<00:06:16.839> they<00:06:17.349> have<00:06:17.649> more<00:06:17.949> than

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:18.429 
let's check that so they have more than

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:26.639 
let's check that so they have more than
know<00:06:19.149> they<00:06:19.869> have<00:06:22.409> 84<00:06:23.759> hit<00:06:24.759> points<00:06:25.209> or<00:06:25.389> less<00:06:25.649> so

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:26.649 
know they have 84 hit points or less so

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:30.829 
know they have 84 hit points or less so
let's<00:06:26.889> see<00:06:27.279> little<00:06:27.759> seven<00:06:28.449> hit<00:06:29.169> 42<00:06:29.889> /<00:06:30.039> shot

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:30.839 
let's see little seven hit 42 / shot

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:36.529 
let's see little seven hit 42 / shot
okay<00:06:32.489> so<00:06:33.489> that<00:06:33.669> concludes<00:06:33.699> my<00:06:34.329> minion

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
okay so that concludes my minion

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.229 
okay so that concludes my minion
overview<00:06:37.539> and<00:06:37.749> the<00:06:38.229> video<00:06:38.499> I'll<00:06:38.849> probably<00:06:39.849> do
