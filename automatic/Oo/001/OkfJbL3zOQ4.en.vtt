in overall coming back to Dreamhack who

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.830 
in overall coming back to Dreamhack who
you<00:02:30.159> see<00:02:30.430> as<00:02:30.549> your<00:02:30.579> toughest<00:02:31.209> opponent<00:02:31.629> in<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
you see as your toughest opponent in the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.629 
you see as your toughest opponent in the
playoffs<00:02:32.290> because<00:02:32.680> they<00:02:32.829> are<00:02:33.010> from<00:02:33.249> the<00:02:33.400> first

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
playoffs because they are from the first

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.470 
playoffs because they are from the first
place<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.719> the<00:02:34.750> group<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:37.090> going<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:37.329> be

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
place in the group so it's going to be

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.500 
place in the group so it's going to be
hard<00:02:38.409> to<00:02:38.560> say<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:39.609> don't<00:02:39.819> really<00:02:39.969> know<00:02:40.209> like

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
hard to say we don't really know like

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.479 
hard to say we don't really know like
the<00:02:40.989> results<00:02:41.379> of<00:02:41.439> other<00:02:41.620> groups<00:02:41.889> yet<00:02:42.129> so<00:02:42.340> we're

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
the results of other groups yet so we're

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.309 
the results of other groups yet so we're
not<00:02:42.579> sure<00:02:42.790> who<00:02:42.939> we're<00:02:43.090> gonna<00:02:43.209> play<00:02:43.480> but<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
not sure who we're gonna play but I

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.979 
not sure who we're gonna play but I
think<00:02:44.620> overall<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.939> think<00:02:46.000> Nabi<00:02:46.540> will<00:02:46.780> be<00:02:46.870> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
think overall I think Nabi will be the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.920 
think overall I think Nabi will be the
toughest<00:02:47.469> opponent<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.150> think<00:02:49.450> their

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
and prize money from dota not really

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.740 
and prize money from dota not really
I<00:04:27.050> think<00:04:27.849> the<00:04:28.849> cost<00:04:29.090> of<00:04:29.300> living<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.720> definitely

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
I think the cost of living is definitely

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.409 
I think the cost of living is definitely
a<00:04:30.139> lot<00:04:30.319> higher<00:04:30.530> in<00:04:30.819> Canada<00:04:31.819> and<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.210> United

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
a lot higher in Canada and the United

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.990 
a lot higher in Canada and the United
States<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.889> can<00:04:34.220> make<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.490> hard<00:04:34.699> if<00:04:34.880> you're

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
seemed like maybe like a punishment was

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.640 
seemed like maybe like a punishment was
like<00:05:52.070> set<00:05:52.969> out<00:05:53.150> before<00:05:53.479> like<00:05:53.990> all<00:05:54.169> the<00:05:54.289> facts

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
like set out before like all the facts

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.339 
like set out before like all the facts
were<00:05:54.680> in<00:05:54.919> but<00:05:55.659> it's<00:05:56.659> hard<00:05:56.780> to<00:05:56.960> really<00:05:57.169> say<00:05:57.969> like

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
were in but it's hard to really say like

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.559 
were in but it's hard to really say like
do<00:06:00.349> you<00:06:00.530> agree<00:06:01.159> that<00:06:01.280> people<00:06:02.030> should<00:06:02.449> be

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
do you agree that people should be

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.430 
do you agree that people should be
punished<00:06:02.900> for<00:06:03.259> that<00:06:03.500> like<00:06:04.039> so<00:06:04.400> hard<00:06:04.729> or<00:06:05.440> maybe

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
punished for that like so hard or maybe

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.920 
punished for that like so hard or maybe
they<00:06:07.280> should<00:06:07.610> be<00:06:07.729> warned<00:06:08.150> because<00:06:08.569> it<00:06:08.690> was<00:06:08.810> the

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
they should be warned because it was the

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.219 
they should be warned because it was the
first<00:06:08.960> time<00:06:09.409> in<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.650> history<00:06:09.680> I<00:06:10.280> think<00:06:11.270> if

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
first time in the history I think if

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.100 
first time in the history I think if
it's<00:06:12.590> like<00:06:12.830> proven<00:06:13.400> then<00:06:14.240> I<00:06:14.270> do<00:06:14.599> think<00:06:14.990> they

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
it's like proven then I do think they

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.649 
it's like proven then I do think they
should<00:06:15.319> be<00:06:15.469> punished<00:06:15.680> like<00:06:16.009> that<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.490> did<00:06:17.479> you

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
should be punished like that and did you

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.320 
should be punished like that and did you
