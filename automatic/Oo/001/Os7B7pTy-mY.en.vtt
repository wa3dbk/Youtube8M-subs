okay<00:00:05.160> so<00:00:07.460> here<00:00:08.460> we<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:09.360> corner<00:00:10.200> pocket<00:00:11.179> of

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
okay so here we have a corner pocket of

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.740 
okay so here we have a corner pocket of
the<00:00:12.480> pool<00:00:12.690> table<00:00:13.340> our<00:00:14.340> felt<00:00:14.750> stretched

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the pool table our felt stretched

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.500 
the pool table our felt stretched
tightly<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.410> top<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.180> have<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.390> purple<00:00:19.020> marker

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
tightly on top I have a purple marker

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.609 
tightly on top I have a purple marker
it's<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.750> dark<00:00:22.050> enough<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.590> me<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> see<00:00:24.619> okay

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it's just dark enough for me to see okay

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470 
it's just dark enough for me to see okay
if<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.830> push<00:00:26.130> down<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.910> could<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
if I push down in I could see the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.220 
if I push down in I could see the
outline<00:00:27.510> ridge<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> slate<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.810> then<00:00:30.990> draw

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
outline ridge of the slate and then draw

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
outline ridge of the slate and then draw
a<00:00:31.260> light<00:00:31.529> line<00:00:31.830> about<00:00:32.579> half<00:00:32.969> an<00:00:33.149> inch<00:00:34.040> half<00:00:35.040> an

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
a light line about half an inch half an

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.330 
a light line about half an inch half an
inch<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> 3/4<00:00:37.010> following<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> contour<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
inch to 3/4 following the contour of the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.560 
inch to 3/4 following the contour of the
pocket<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:45.950> being<00:00:46.950> careful<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.730> don't

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
pocket and being careful that I don't

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:59.740 
pocket and being careful that I don't
mess<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:52.850> okay<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> here

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.450 

it's<00:01:00.379> basically<00:01:00.890> our<00:01:01.269> contour<00:01:02.269> of<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.600> slate

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
it's basically our contour of the slate

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.120 
it's basically our contour of the slate
half<00:01:04.460> an<00:01:04.699> inch<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.560> I'm<00:01:06.560> going<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.740> pull<00:01:06.950> this

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
half an inch in I'm going to pull this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.210 
half an inch in I'm going to pull this
out<00:01:08.020> I'm<00:01:09.020> going<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.290> draw<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.500> straight<00:01:09.799> line

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
out I'm going to draw a straight line

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.770 
out I'm going to draw a straight line
from<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.610> center<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:11.299> arc<00:01:13.570> straight<00:01:14.570> on

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
from the center of this arc straight on

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.410 
from the center of this arc straight on
out<00:01:15.080> okay<00:01:17.799> I'm<00:01:18.799> going<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.040> draw<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:19.850> center

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
out okay I'm going to draw a center

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.910 
out okay I'm going to draw a center
point<00:01:22.180> about<00:01:23.180> right<00:01:23.540> here<00:01:25.659> about<00:01:26.659> two<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:27.830> a

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
point about right here about two and a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.340 
point about right here about two and a
half<00:01:27.950> maybe<00:01:28.880> three<00:01:29.090> inches<00:01:29.479> at<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.869> most<00:01:30.110> from

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
half maybe three inches at the most from

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.100 
half maybe three inches at the most from
the<00:01:30.470> top<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:30.950> arc<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.020> then<00:01:33.020> from<00:01:33.320> here

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
the top of that arc and then from here

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.309 
the top of that arc and then from here
we're<00:01:36.110> going<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.380> draw<00:01:36.560> lines<00:01:38.080> we're<00:01:39.080> going<00:01:39.259> to

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
we're going to draw lines we're going to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.889 
we're going to draw lines we're going to
divide<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.860> space<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:40.460> wouldn't<00:01:41.300> go<00:01:41.420> any<00:01:41.630> more

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
divide the space I wouldn't go any more

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.260 
divide the space I wouldn't go any more
than<00:01:41.960> 3/4<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:42.979> an<00:01:43.130> inch<00:01:43.250> across<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.030> top<00:01:44.240> of

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
than 3/4 of an inch across the top of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.900 
than 3/4 of an inch across the top of
the<00:01:44.509> arc

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:02.090 

okay<00:01:55.360> there<00:01:55.870> we<00:01:56.140> go

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.350 

and<00:02:02.970> what<00:02:03.120> these<00:02:03.300> lines<00:02:03.630> are<00:02:03.900> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.170> be

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
and what these lines are going to be

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.249 
and what these lines are going to be
these<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.510> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.720> be<00:02:06.810> our<00:02:06.930> cut<00:02:07.229> lines

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
these are going to be our cut lines

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.920 
these are going to be our cut lines
hopefully<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:12.200> all<00:02:13.200> right<00:02:14.930> now

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
hopefully you can see that all right now

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.310 
hopefully you can see that all right now
we're<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.290> take<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> scissors<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:18.320> cut

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
we're going to take the scissors and cut

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:27.860 
we're going to take the scissors and cut
up<00:02:19.950> from<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.880> edge<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.300> felt<00:02:26.450> where<00:02:27.450> cut

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
up from the edge of the felt where cut

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.699 
up from the edge of the felt where cut
all<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.680> way

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.569 

through<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.459> middle<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.879> this<00:02:35.060> arc<00:02:36.579> staying

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
through the middle of this arc staying

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:46.390 
through the middle of this arc staying
on<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:37.849> centerline<00:02:44.469> and<00:02:45.469> that's<00:02:46.010> about<00:02:46.159> as

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
on that centerline and that's about as

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.429 
on that centerline and that's about as
far<00:02:46.640> as<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:47.000> could<00:02:47.150> go<00:02:47.209> now<00:02:47.840> what<00:02:48.079> we're<00:02:48.260> going

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
far as you could go now what we're going

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.660 
far as you could go now what we're going
to<00:02:48.469> do<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.799> we're<00:02:48.980> going<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.159> start<00:02:49.459> these

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
to do is we're going to start these

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.690 
to do is we're going to start these
other<00:02:50.739> these<00:02:51.739> other<00:02:52.040> lines<00:02:54.519> starting<00:02:55.519> right

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
other these other lines starting right

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.929 
other these other lines starting right
here<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:57.500> won't<00:02:57.739> be<00:02:57.889> able<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.280> go<00:02:58.400> all<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.790> way

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
here you won't be able to go all the way

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.670 
here you won't be able to go all the way
to<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.239> end<00:02:59.420> that's<00:02:59.719> what<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.049> Rays<00:03:00.230> are<00:03:00.469> nice

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
to the end that's what the Rays are nice

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.140 
to the end that's what the Rays are nice
for<00:03:02.349> all<00:03:03.349> you<00:03:03.590> got<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.859> really<00:03:04.069> do<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.670> get<00:03:05.030> it

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
for all you got to really do is get it

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:16.089 
for all you got to really do is get it
started<00:03:07.840> like<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.889> my<00:03:15.099> fourth

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
started like this this is my fourth

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.809 
started like this this is my fourth
pocket<00:03:16.609> I've<00:03:16.760> done<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.180> my<00:03:17.299> life<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.489> guess

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
pocket I've done in my life so I guess

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.530 
pocket I've done in my life so I guess
by<00:03:20.030> now<00:03:20.060> I'm<00:03:20.480> an<00:03:20.659> expert<00:03:21.079> right<00:03:24.819> but<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.329> other

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
by now I'm an expert right but the other

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.679 
by now I'm an expert right but the other
the<00:03:27.260> first<00:03:27.500> one<00:03:27.739> was<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> little<00:03:28.280> rough<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:29.000> the

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
the first one was a little rough but the

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.020 
the first one was a little rough but the
other<00:03:29.900> three<00:03:30.230> were<00:03:31.239> picture<00:03:32.239> picture-perfect

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
other three were picture picture-perfect

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.000 
other three were picture picture-perfect
okay<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.090> we<00:03:35.329> have<00:03:35.510> them<00:03:35.629> started<00:03:36.169> what<00:03:36.859> we're

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
okay so we have them started what we're

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.140 
okay so we have them started what we're
going<00:03:37.159> to<00:03:37.189> do<00:03:37.340> is<00:03:37.549> we're<00:03:37.729> going<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:37.909> chase
