00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.519
 if you believe that reality goes beyond what our eyes can see and 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.169
 our microscopes 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.169
 we have something to show 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.640
 so it's that humans 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.069
 we are more than a physical body 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.069
 we have something to show you 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.650
 If you think that love 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.130
 belongs to the world of the intangible 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.130
 we have something to show 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.840
 we started to be interested 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.840
 the activation of water through 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.700
 and the water messages is the world's most expensive 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.070
 we try to search the internet 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.520
 in that search internet or antonio 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.560
 kennan my partners 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800
 in gerona documentation and I told myself 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.490
 these pacts 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.850
 and it was a course of these ships of the water the patagonia argentina 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.810
 that began fifteen days 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.590
 it resonated 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.330
 in one way 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.320
 total in that sense that on Monday I contacted the person who 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.670
 start the course 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.670
 and at 15 days they are counted 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.920
 once there nick a day in a meditation the yellow runner diana 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.750
 to which that person who says to the course says to me percent juancho 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.010
 do not take off your glasses or on what basis of technologies 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580
 I took it as a Navarrese 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.910
 inefficient 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.240
 percent then we closed our eyes the stretch without him in it 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.190
 in the process 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.320
 and at a certain time I gave a creator 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.269
 more than seeing them now was a knowledge and a sense 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.419
 it was clearer knowing and feeling than seeing it as I am seeing 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.329
 it's like I'm seeing art 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.229
 luque min yes that is a trigger 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.709
 d somehow a 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.799
 a longing 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.529
 to carry forward 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.529
 percent that project 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.249
 You receive information that has a nutrition expert 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:44.939
 2 and that resonates 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.159
 that enters 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.159
 somehow you know what is camping 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:56.429
 and then from there comes a process of creativity daughter left 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:00.519
 creating a team in which is the one that has to be where each one contributes 1 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.999
 as a part of knowledge and belonging attacks and protected 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:06.829
 materialistic 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.829
 presented in the formation of what Spain also 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.489
 massa are all good 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.989
 to field 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.180
 and we put ourselves with the penalties things nicasio began to happen things like that 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.259
 could channels that same day a pact is exposed 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.139
 of physical protection 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.059
 the expected 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:33.219
 sometimes these things happen and you move away from your position because it's time 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.219
 quite own facts there we decide what 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.069
 we would work 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.119
 Monday afternoon together 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.359
 they take out what is a program without knowing exactly who 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.409
 and here the day that 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.019
 the adventure of lemon 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.019
 we are that fruit and north 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.509
 we have no idea 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.939
 You're nothing, we're not engineers 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.429
 in the group 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:02.699
 there is an economist the business tax there is a paschal philosopher 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:08.089
 two people are in alternative medicine that was read crowd that 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.139
 springs from sociology 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.100
 we do not know anything about this whole process and suddenly 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.100
 we did cleanups connections meditations 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.039
 the first thing that is not low 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.650
 fun gauging 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.650
 I think if we happened to go to that form it was a pumpkin 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.509
 I say we are to work because we live 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.650
 a way like that standing at the next meeting 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.029
 the social field 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.029
 to simulate 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:55.979
 based on decisions and during the day the forms and contents were complicated 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.979
 the parts the proportions all 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:07.909
 when we saw the definitive drawing of lemos we did not know what to do with it 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.199
 it took weeks until we decided to throw ourselves 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.259
 and look for an engineer who was able to understand the information we had 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.249
 received 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.430
 I would go body hurt from the water 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.430
 the first thing we did was the prototype 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.490
 For Ana 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.020
 the prototype 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.360
 it was all removable with viewers to see what was happening and how 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.400
 the whole was circulating
