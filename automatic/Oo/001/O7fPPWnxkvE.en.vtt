 video of a boxing that was pretty 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.429
 time we did not have any over here 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.930
 and of a game that also surely 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.820

 definition of res and level remake is 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.410
 say the original level resident that in 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.050
 his moment was made a remake for 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.700
 gamecube which is this version 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.530
 OK 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.210
 and this version of green that uses made 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.280

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.140
 remastered in high definition to 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.860
 current platforms and also the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.660
 past generation play 3 and 360 until the 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.140
 a digital edition for all 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.309
 platforms but of playstation3's 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.000
 the playstation 3 version 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.520
 only in japan only in japan has 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.080
 an edition in physical format of 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.660
 this remastered edition of resident 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.340
 evil personally playstation 3 and 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.620
 only in Japan but that is very 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.310
 well because it comes subtitled it seems to be 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.050
 Whether the Castilian or great plus 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.450
 of that besides leaving the election in 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.369
 physical format with its box with its disk 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.440
 and such has come out in addition to an edition 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.030
 special a collector's edition of 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.950
 that king and bolt of this edition 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.020
 remastered and that's precisely the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.340
 a boxing that we are going to do here good 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.500
 because man a boxing of a game 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.700
 normal because he does not have many thanks but 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.680
 good as this is one thing that can 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.090
 be pretty cool okay then here 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.200
 we have the package 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.399
 I guess it comes wrapped up because 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.270
 I do not think that I am so big 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.009
 but well let's see what this brings 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.100
 what you said already you know everything that has come out 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.610
 about that month 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.710
 remastered just and bolt and now 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.789
 for the truth, you want to play it a lot 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.369
 people have asked around here for the 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.759
 channel that if we're going to do something good of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.200
 I do not intend to get on 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.819
 erin and nothing like that according 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.549
 but yes we might have 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.500
 some a loose gameplay is worth that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.620
 it could be pretty good and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.480
 probably this way 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.720
 well let's see 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.770
 is here very well wrapped all in 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.789
 detail 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.330
 and let's see let's see why it has 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.200
 good looking I did not think he has almost 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.670
 almost the size of 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.130
 of a textbook 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.410
 the institute of what is called the subject 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.480
 fun clear yes yes well here 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.489
 you have it this is the outer house 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.480
 quite pretty big I did not think 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.480
 that was going to be this big 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.769
 and now now let's open this time 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.940
 let's go carefully 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.510
 these things are usually delicate and 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.190
 good the truth 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.120
 for what I have seen very cool is 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.080
 this edition 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.730
 the very difficult thing to find but 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.709
 but good for you to like it fresh and 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.840
 that you like the saga and this is why I 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.180
 I think it's a 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.330
 it is something essential is not true is 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.540
 true that the next day with a colleague who 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.670
 maybe with the passage of time 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.670
 assuming that capcom takes editions 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.970
 remastered from more reside and bolt it 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.640
 which it is the 0 level 03 and whatever it 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.880
 it is possible that in the end here in europe 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.240
 also be finished taking some pack 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.010
 physical that maybe with a 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.090
 compilation that you imagine that it leaves 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.650
 just the 0 the remastering in hd not 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.350
 Well maybe I'll take out a physical edition 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.690
 here in europe and in america also from 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.340
 0 with the remake together but good is that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.330
 this is a special edition and we are going to 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.330
 see let's see what this brings 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.560
 come here 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.469
 There is one thing that is very cool about 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.520
 all of him and I want to demonstrate the 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:02.830
 good the game of course 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.900
 the game is this this can also be 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.330
 buy separately only this from 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.160
 agreement what is the game and the truth 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.950
 that's good now we'll have to see what 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.470
 such is but what is said with much desire 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.530
 and many eager to throw a 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.490
 Here is the good thing comes 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.840
 an art book 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.990
 with very good quality paper austria 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.120
 very thick paper of very many paper 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.130
 quality 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.510
 good with different maps will that 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.510
 some little thing so you can see how it goes 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.210
 of art with 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.570
 in different areas of the mansion with 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.300
 maps and even here at the foot of the page 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.830
 It's great, it 's great 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.480
 this so that you like what was said so that 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.390
 he likes resinero effectively comes 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.390
 divided by areas of the mansion 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.240
 designed by trevor clear that if the 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.400
 manors trevor 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.599
 guess who I want to open it a lot for 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.230
 that does not spoil but come here in the 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:16.100
 index comes the sections should not 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.910
 this is a pass 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.910
 some more thing 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.720
 so only because this just for this and 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.720
 it would be worth it but it is that 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.600
 here comes folded and this is pretty 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.970
 bigger than I thought this 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.050
 almost to put it as a poster in the 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.050
 room this great 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.020
 well here the plane of states that plane 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.510
 Vienna has I will leave everything that 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.230
 I can 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.000
 this is an absolutely incredible plane 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.130
 with a very good paper too 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.890
 quality that seems almost the role that 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.630
 they use the architects and that is 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.570
 a very dense paper 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.280
 surely with annotations and talos 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.450
 until it's very well done and here too 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.450
 there is a note here behind 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.639
 to this one 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:14.600
 the mansion mansion I thought long no 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.640
 I know exactly I think if in the year 67 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.920
 the saga when inside what is the 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.600
 chronology of the saga but it is assumed that 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.000
 the plans were delivered and come 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.150
 here in fact signed on March 21 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.740
 of the year 62 of agreement and this is a 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.810
 Once this is an authentic past 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.640
 so good that's what this brings 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.670
 collector's edition at the beginning 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.520
 I had also seen it but I think that 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.440
 he stayed in the end in nothing 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.990
 commented that it can also include a 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.240
 pen with a notebook of 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.060
 team stars but in the end it's good 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.340
 stayed in this still and as I say is 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.440
 a very cool edition and it really is that 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.570
 and to the truth that the outer box is a 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.760
 last is much bigger than I 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.080
 I thought so, well, nobody 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.090
 true that there is much desire also of 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.650
 take a tiento this edition I 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.810
 seen already videos I have already seen videos 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.120
 I've also seen videos of new people 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.190
 action and I've seen videos of versions of 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.590
 current consoles of the pc version 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.360
 that evidently, technically, 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.440
 supposed to be even a little bit 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.000
 top 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.770
 but also because of the type of game that is 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.450
 for a remastering of a game that 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.860
 at the time it came out in gamecube 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.540
 surely the version of playstation 3 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.710
 I've also seen videos of the version of 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.540
 playstation 3 too and you see 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.670
 absolutely great then we are going to 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.260
 view it in physical format as 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.940
 I was waiting for him to come by 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.340
 that we have not had anything here before 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.660
 resin and ball remaster hd in the channel 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.180
 ok because I was waiting for 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.710
 come this this edition so good 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.300
 Well, what's said is a box that remains 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.800
 here for all who want to know what 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.450
 that brings this collector's edition worth 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.240
 but it can be interesting at least 

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.680
 that you know and I have said it even though 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.360
 There have been people who have told you about a series 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.010
 I do not know what is going at the moment we leave it 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.260
 in the air but what is true 

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.090
 what it is true that some one 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.370
 little game maybe some gameplay 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.650
 if we can have here a little maybe 

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.020
 even as a comparison of how it 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.040
 from one version to another this version with 

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.360
 the version of good club that also 

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.740
 it can be interesting so what's said 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.090
 well now we went down here that was 

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.200
 just this little one a box in the 

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.150
 what I wanted to bring for those who 

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.840
 could interest and we continue to see 

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.840
 over week
