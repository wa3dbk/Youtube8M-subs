00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
know what SP means this means speed

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.520 
know what SP means this means speed
right<00:03:43.980> now<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.400> set<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.610> 100<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:46.170> means

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
right now it's set to 100 this means

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.180 
right now it's set to 100 this means
100%<00:03:47.270> later<00:03:48.270> on<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.810> code<00:03:49.170> when<00:03:49.710> you<00:03:49.830> tell<00:03:50.070> your

100% later on in code when you tell your

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.670 
100% later on in code when you tell your
objects<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.850> follow<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.390> path<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:52.350> set<00:03:52.650> a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
objects to follow this path you set a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.270 
objects to follow this path you set a
speed<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.370> if<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.000> point<00:03:54.270> is<00:03:54.510> set<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.840> 100%

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
speed and if that point is set to 100%

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.010 
speed and if that point is set to 100%
your<00:03:56.280> object<00:03:56.670> will<00:03:56.790> move<00:03:56.940> at<00:03:57.120> 100%<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.960> that

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
your object will move at 100% of that

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.890 
your object will move at 100% of that
speed<00:03:58.620> value<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.760> let's<00:04:00.000> say<00:04:00.240> you've<00:04:00.570> given

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
speed value so let's say you've given

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.650 
speed value so let's say you've given
your<00:04:01.110> object<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.830> speed<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.400> four<00:04:02.850> that<00:04:03.450> means

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
your object the speed of four that means

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.230 
your object the speed of four that means
it'll<00:04:03.900> move<00:04:04.080> from<00:04:04.380> point<00:04:04.650> A<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.430> point<00:04:05.460> B<00:04:05.790> at

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
it'll move from point A to point B at

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.300 
it'll move from point A to point B at
the<00:04:06.630> speed<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:07.020> four<00:04:07.320> because<00:04:07.770> we<00:04:07.800> have<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.130> set

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
the speed of four because we have it set

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.940 
the speed of four because we have it set
to<00:04:08.340> 100%<00:04:08.990> however<00:04:09.990> if<00:04:10.200> we<00:04:10.350> set<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.680> speed<00:04:10.890> to

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
to 100% however if we set the speed to

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.640 
to 100% however if we set the speed to
50%<00:04:11.820> your<00:04:12.480> object<00:04:12.930> will<00:04:13.050> move<00:04:13.080> at<00:04:13.320> a<00:04:13.380> speed<00:04:13.500> of

50% your object will move at a speed of

50% your object will move at a speed of
two<00:04:14.280> which<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.270> 50%<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:16.260> four<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:17.220> can<00:04:17.370> always
