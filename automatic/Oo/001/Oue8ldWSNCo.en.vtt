surprised to be seeing them but they are

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120 
surprised to be seeing them but they are
following<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.600> toe<00:01:27.659> right<00:01:27.960> along<00:01:28.290> changes<00:01:29.009> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
following my toe right along changes in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.969 
following my toe right along changes in
the<00:01:29.250> seasons<00:01:29.729> changes<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> climate

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
the seasons changes in the climate
changes<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> axis<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> earth<00:01:32.939> things

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
changes on the axis of the earth things

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.380 
changes on the axis of the earth things
which<00:01:34.170> back<00:01:34.409> at<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> time<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.299> have

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
which back at that time we would have

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.670 
which back at that time we would have
said<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:38.659> think<00:01:39.659> most<00:01:39.960> people<00:01:40.320> would<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.500> said

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
said I think most people would have said

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
said I think most people would have said
they<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.369> expect<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.329> but

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
they would not really expect to see but

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.920 
they would not really expect to see but
here<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.380> seeing<00:01:43.799> them

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
here we are seeing them

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.469 
here we are seeing them
this<00:01:45.930> also<00:01:46.200> ties<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.399> historical<00:01:48.210> curve

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
this also ties into the historical curve

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.440 
this also ties into the historical curve

changes in the culture there certainly I
think<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:35.880> would<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.420> agree<00:02:36.650> that

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
think the one would have to agree that

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.880 
think the one would have to agree that
the<00:02:37.769> period<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.160> 100<00:02:38.549> years<00:02:39.200> period<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.350> 200

the period of 100 years period of 200

see<00:04:09.389> what<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:09.720> what<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.319> feel<00:04:11.250> from<00:04:11.579> yet

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
see what you what you can feel from yet

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.280 
see what you what you can feel from yet
in<00:04:12.120> terms<00:04:12.419> of<00:04:12.599> what<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> earth<00:04:13.019> is

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
in terms of what the earth is

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.840 
in terms of what the earth is
experiencing<00:04:14.129> and<00:04:14.400> whether<00:04:15.120> or<00:04:15.209> not

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.360 

whether<00:04:20.600> or<00:04:20.750> not<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.230> crystals<00:04:21.680> haven't<00:04:22.010> have

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
whether or not the crystals haven't have

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.200 
whether or not the crystals haven't have
an<00:04:22.490> input<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:23.180> make<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:25.520> are<00:04:25.550> very<00:04:25.820> open<00:04:25.880> to

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
an input to make we are very open to

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.970 
an input to make we are very open to
suggestions<00:04:26.930> as<00:04:27.170> we<00:04:27.410> put<00:04:27.590> together<00:04:27.710> this

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
suggestions as we put together this

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.760 
suggestions as we put together this
ritual<00:04:28.600> which<00:04:29.600> will<00:04:29.840> be<00:04:29.960> again<00:04:30.470> for

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
ritual which will be again for

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.860 
ritual which will be again for
attunement<00:04:31.340> with<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.880> ongoing<00:04:32.000> changes<00:04:32.570> in

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
attunement with the ongoing changes in

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.940 
attunement with the ongoing changes in
the<00:04:33.020> earth<00:04:35.170> certainly<00:04:36.170> we<00:04:36.290> must<00:04:36.470> expect<00:04:36.800> to

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
the earth certainly we must expect to

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.420 
the earth certainly we must expect to
see<00:04:37.130> more<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:38.890> for<00:04:39.890> better<00:04:40.010> or<00:04:40.250> worse

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
see more of this and for better or worse

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.040 
see more of this and for better or worse
I<00:04:40.640> suspect<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.150> we<00:04:41.240> will<00:04:41.300> see<00:04:41.570> more<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:41.930> these

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
I suspect that we will see more of these

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.780 
I suspect that we will see more of these
earthquakes<00:04:42.260> and<00:04:42.860> in<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.190> not<00:04:43.340> terribly

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
earthquakes and in the not terribly

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:52.390 
earthquakes and in the not terribly
distant<00:04:44.270> future<00:04:48.310> what<00:04:49.310> can<00:04:49.490> one<00:04:49.610> say<00:04:50.800> what<00:04:51.800> we

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
distant future what can one say what we

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.520 
distant future what can one say what we
cannot<00:04:52.760> stop<00:04:53.150> them<00:04:53.420> we<00:04:53.600> can<00:04:53.750> only<00:04:53.870> have<00:04:54.320> to

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
cannot stop them we can only have to

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.000 
cannot stop them we can only have to
attune<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.730> changing<00:04:56.150> energies<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:57.010> also

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
attune to the changing energies and also

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.030 
attune to the changing energies and also
try<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.340> guide<00:04:58.610> those<00:04:58.910> energies<00:04:59.890> into<00:05:00.890> the

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
try to guide those energies into the

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.010 
try to guide those energies into the
most<00:05:01.190> positive<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.910> least<00:05:02.510> disruptive

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
most positive the least disruptive

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.220 
most positive the least disruptive
patterns<00:05:03.620> possible<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.660> hope<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.020> you

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
patterns possible so I hope that you

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.950 
patterns possible so I hope that you
will<00:05:06.290> join<00:05:06.350> me<00:05:06.590> on<00:05:06.980> march<00:05:07.310> six<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:08.840> will

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
will join me on march six we will

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.000 
will join me on march six we will
certainly<00:05:09.140> be<00:05:09.410> putting<00:05:09.650> out<00:05:09.770> more

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
certainly be putting out more

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.130 
certainly be putting out more
information<00:05:10.280> before<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:11.090> ritual<00:05:11.240> begins<00:05:11.600> and

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
information before the ritual begins and

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.340 
information before the ritual begins and
it<00:05:12.890> will<00:05:13.010> again<00:05:13.220> be<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.460> global<00:05:13.700> ritual<00:05:14.350> that

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
it will again be a global ritual that

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.080 
it will again be a global ritual that
that<00:05:15.710> will<00:05:15.920> move<00:05:16.100> in<00:05:16.280> a<00:05:16.370> wave<00:05:16.580> around<00:05:16.910> the

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
that will move in a wave around the

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.070 
that will move in a wave around the
planet<00:05:18.520> so<00:05:19.520> stay<00:05:20.030> tuned<00:05:20.240> to<00:05:20.270> this<00:05:20.480> channel<00:05:20.540> for

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
planet so stay tuned to this channel for

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.560 
planet so stay tuned to this channel for
more<00:05:21.440> information<00:05:22.220> thank<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.120> and<00:05:23.240> bless<00:05:23.330> it
