00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
like making it just because it's a pain

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.289 
like making it just because it's a pain
for<00:01:34.320> me<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.590> make<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.039> store<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
for me to make at the store but I

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.090 
for me to make at the store but I
understand<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:36.990> appeal<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.289> it<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.039> would

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
understand the appeal of it and I would

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.010 
understand the appeal of it and I would
actually<00:01:38.490> probably<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:39.390> somebody<00:01:39.780> else<00:01:39.899> were

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
actually probably if somebody else were

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.510 
actually probably if somebody else were
to<00:01:40.080> make<00:01:40.289> it<00:01:40.440> for<00:01:40.649> me<00:01:40.770> I'd<00:01:40.890> probably<00:01:41.310> eat<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to make it for me I'd probably eat it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.380 
to make it for me I'd probably eat it
quite<00:01:41.759> regularly
