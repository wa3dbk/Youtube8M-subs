00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
know I'm probably well I mean they're
different<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.379> different<00:00:40.440> reasons<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.219> mean

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
different very different reasons I mean

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.420 
different very different reasons I mean
singing<00:00:42.239> dances<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:43.050> particular<00:00:43.920> dancing<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
singing dances is particular dancing is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.100 
singing dances is particular dancing is
not<00:00:44.579> something<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.940> came<00:00:45.239> naturally<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> me

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
not something that came naturally to me

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.229 
not something that came naturally to me
I<00:00:46.140> did<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> lot<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> lessons<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
I did a lot of lessons to do that so I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.770 
I did a lot of lessons to do that so I
think<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:48.930> being<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> stage<00:00:49.590> cumbia<00:00:50.219> Julia

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
think but being on a stage cumbia Julia

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.830 
think but being on a stage cumbia Julia
well<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.989> don't<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:53.390> then<00:00:54.390> right

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
well you don't have to do then right

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.209 
well you don't have to do then right
then<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.230> don't<00:00:55.559> you've<00:00:55.710> done<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.190> know

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
then you don't you've done it you know

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.569 
then you don't you've done it you know
anyone<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> yeah<00:00:58.770> I'd<00:00:58.920> say<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
anyone can do that so yeah I'd say if I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.920 
anyone can do that so yeah I'd say if I
have<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> choose<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.480> eight<00:01:00.629> times<00:01:00.809> a
