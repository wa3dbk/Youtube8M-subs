00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.400 
hose off the bar straight Iraq it'll
make<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.820> little<00:02:19.000> easier<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.600> get<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.080> out<00:02:20.230> when

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
make a little easier to get it out when

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.460 
make a little easier to get it out when
you<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.590> some<00:02:20.740> flexibility

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.560 

I<00:02:24.580> don't<00:02:25.580> know<00:02:25.700> how<00:02:25.850> well<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.120> will<00:02:26.270> show<00:02:26.450> up

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
I don't know how well this will show up

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.210 
I don't know how well this will show up
on<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.840> video<00:02:26.960> camera<00:02:27.440> but<00:02:27.590> down<00:02:27.800> there<00:02:28.100> you

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
on the video camera but down there you

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.940 
on the video camera but down there you
can<00:02:28.550> maybe<00:02:28.970> barely<00:02:29.390> see<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.690> line<00:02:29.900> behind<00:02:30.560> the

a wrench on it and force it in you'll

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.400 
a wrench on it and force it in you'll
usually<00:03:12.030> 99.8%<00:03:13.030> have<00:03:13.450> bad<00:03:13.660> luck<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.170> strip

the<00:03:16.239> power<00:03:16.540> steering<00:03:16.750> rack<00:03:17.050> so<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.680> know<00:03:18.310> what

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
the power steering rack so you know what

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.030 
the power steering rack so you know what
stripping<00:03:19.180> out<00:03:19.269> threads<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.769> I'll<00:03:20.860> make<00:03:20.980> sure

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
stripping out threads so I'll make sure

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.199 
stripping out threads so I'll make sure
it<00:03:21.220> starts<00:03:21.459> by<00:03:21.640> with<00:03:22.209> your<00:03:22.330> fingers<00:03:24.060> we'll<00:03:25.060> do

it starts by with your fingers we'll do
that<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.600> we'll<00:03:25.660> tighten<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.140> up<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.430> it'll

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
that and we'll tighten that up and it'll

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.210 
that and we'll tighten that up and it'll
move<00:03:27.820> over<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.420> other<00:03:28.570> end

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.619 

we<00:03:33.220> have<00:03:33.310> our<00:03:33.430> line<00:03:33.670> down<00:03:33.939> there<00:03:34.090> snapped<00:03:34.420> into

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
we have our line down there snapped into

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.610 
we have our line down there snapped into
place<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.819> we<00:03:37.000> snapping<00:03:37.450> our<00:03:37.599> clip<00:03:37.930> down<00:03:38.439> on

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
place and we snapping our clip down on

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.500 
place and we snapping our clip down on
top<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.159> it's<00:03:39.640> got<00:03:39.790> some<00:03:39.939> teeth<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.360> there

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
top of that it's got some teeth in there

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:49.380 
top of that it's got some teeth in there
should<00:03:41.250> bite<00:03:42.250> in<00:03:42.569> into<00:03:43.569> place<00:03:48.000> we'll<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.209> be

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
should bite in into place we'll just be

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.899 
should bite in into place we'll just be
connecting<00:03:50.049> this<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.379> this<00:03:50.549> it'd<00:03:51.549> be<00:03:51.670> too<00:03:51.790> bad

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
connecting this to this it'd be too bad

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.460 
connecting this to this it'd be too bad
at<00:03:52.090> all<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:54.599> we<00:03:55.599> got<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.810> line<00:03:55.989> hooked<00:03:56.260> up

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
at all so we got the line hooked up

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.530 
at all so we got the line hooked up
there<00:03:56.829> finger<00:03:57.700> fingered<00:03:58.690> it<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:01.420> we<00:04:01.510> started

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
there finger fingered it so we started

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.940 
there finger fingered it so we started
the<00:04:01.840> line<00:04:02.019> there<00:04:02.200> with<00:04:02.319> her<00:04:02.409> fingers<00:04:02.739> we<00:04:02.829> get

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
the line there with her fingers we get

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.500 
the line there with her fingers we get
it<00:04:03.040> in<00:04:03.159> there<00:04:03.370> pretty<00:04:03.849> good<00:04:03.940> now<00:04:04.299> we're<00:04:04.390> gonna
