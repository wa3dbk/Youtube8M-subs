with<00:00:15.480> all<00:00:15.599> my<00:00:15.719> other<00:00:15.750> videos<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.379> will<00:00:16.529> need<00:00:16.710> I

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
with all my other videos you will need I

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.220 
with all my other videos you will need I
file<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.690> will<00:00:18.869> need<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> be

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
file for this so you will need to be

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.019 
file for this so you will need to be
jailbroken<00:00:19.490> obviously<00:00:20.490> but<00:00:20.640> if<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:20.910> not

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
jailbroken obviously but if you do not

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.580 
jailbroken obviously but if you do not
have<00:00:21.270> AI<00:00:21.300> file<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.230> go<00:00:22.320> ahead<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
have AI file you can just go ahead and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.890 
have AI file you can just go ahead and
get<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.800> from<00:00:23.010> Cydia<00:00:23.340> it's<00:00:24.029> $4<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
get that from Cydia it's $4 for the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.050 
get that from Cydia it's $4 for the
license<00:00:25.289> version<00:00:25.500> which<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.910> version

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
license version which is the version

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.880 
license version which is the version
that<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> recommend<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.800> get

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that I recommend you get or you can get

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.019 
that I recommend you get or you can get
the<00:00:28.980> correct<00:00:29.160> version<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.670> doesn't<00:00:29.939> really

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the correct version it doesn't really

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.880 
the correct version it doesn't really
matter<00:00:30.240> because<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:31.140> hack<00:00:31.289> will<00:00:31.500> work<00:00:31.679> with

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
matter because the hack will work with

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160 
matter because the hack will work with
both<00:00:31.920> versions<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> perform<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.050> with

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
both versions you can perform it with

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.510 
both versions you can perform it with
the<00:00:34.230> other<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.100> doesn't<00:00:35.190> really

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the other one so it doesn't really

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.030 
the other one so it doesn't really
matter<00:00:35.700> which<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.800> but<00:00:37.800> once<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
matter which one you get but once you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440 
matter which one you get but once you
have<00:00:38.219> life<00:00:38.399> I'll<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:38.940> ahead<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.210> open<00:00:39.270> up
