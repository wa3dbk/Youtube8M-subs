 berlin for you to live yet another 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.280
 novelty samsung 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.480
 yesterday it was the galaxy gear the watch 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.460
 connect you could see forward 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:24.570
 first today is the galaxy 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:28.010
 note 3 discover the innovations of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.010
 the ifa with toshiba 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.660
 and once again the Korean samsung 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.040
 strikes hard on the occasion of this ifa 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.809
 the ifa is really the biggest show 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.030
 high-tech europe 1 today 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.430
 then the Galaxy Note 3 What is it 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.260
 did you like galaxy note galaxy 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.839
 note of and well you will like the 3 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.519
 good then and in addition she has three 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.989
 features that are still quite 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.730
 rare in the world of news 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.379
 technologies thundered you well she is 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.320
 finer lighter and more powerful 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.730
 and in addition she has a screen full hd that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.860
 this is the big novelty 1 compared 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.680
 at galaxy note 2 we will record it 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.489
 the hd and now it's full hd 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.809
 yes you are right saved values 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.970
 like that for his products 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.900
 we will be better finer lighter and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.689
 more powerful 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.170
 so what else does the little one 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.700
 stylus of course that makes the specificity 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.759
 of this smartphone so she won 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.979
 a few millimeters in screen size 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.229
 it goes from 5.5 to 5.7 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.330
 good it's always good to take even if 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.830
 it does not change the meaning of life 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.450
 the camera is better we go 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.829
 from 8 megapixels to 1 13 megapixels 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.439
 that is to say, here we catch up 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.909
 the delay and we can say that the device 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.620
 photo of galaxy note 3 is equivalent to 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.150
 that of galaxy s 4 and at the design level 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.430
 look at this particularity it's 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.730
 the back the hull the back that is in 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.740
 also leather jérôme leather you like 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.940
 the leather these fresh cooked but especially at 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.860
 waist level 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.650
 so the peculiarity is that it is 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.600
 not leather is assimilated leather we go 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.970
 not to quibble good is to give 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.240
 a side a little luxury yes that's it 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.040
 as well 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.360
 yes it's real good it can not 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.890
 please and in this case and well the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.810
 consumers to return to rates 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.159
 more classic or even a little things 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.450
 Fancy a bit flashy like all 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.040
 and colorful, look at it 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.750
 true that there is truly a choice 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.509
 whether hull or small how 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.610
 I would say small shutters protector a 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.170
 about this galaxy 2 3 is really 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.129
 all the colors available then this 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.200
 which is interesting these are the 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.970
 new software features 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.860
 which are strongly related to the stylet which 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.019
 we were talking instantly because there is a 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.420
 little fable is smartphones with 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.900
 style and so samsung cultivates his 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.340
 difference 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.349
 and what can we do more 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.260
 on this galaxy note 3 and well for example 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.750
 you can serve a beer presents the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.250
 particularity is that with the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.510
 this idea you press the button and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.310
 when you approach the screen you 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.960
 open a menu actually what you 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.230
 allows access to applications 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.570
 widely used by the Galaxy Note lan 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.620
 so the notebook is looking for her 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.390
 screenshot etc 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.730
 it's called and recommends this 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.860
 functionality then for example in the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.330
 notepad and well you are you are 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.950
 in communication over the phone and she 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.200
 wanted to quickly noted a number then 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.610
 you write it by hand to note that this 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.540
 number is bogus started not the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.920
 make up and because we do not know where 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.370
 it will happen we did like that to 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.020
 snatching 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.580
 you write it in a handwritten way 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.000
 you press the little button 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.530
 phone and there magically everything is 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.270
 well transcribed in digital and has 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.680
 understood the number he calls him you 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.120
 can call on tuesday with me 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.500
 almost it's useful everyday I do not know 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.540
 not but in any case the wow effect is 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.950
 managed it works also for example 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.530
 an email address 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.180
 we note an email address and then we 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.790
 can send it normally directly 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.070
 in a message then there is a little 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.500
 more harm but hey it's like a 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.790
 pig I write here I'm doing @ who 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.010
 look a bit like squiggles from 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.930
 monkey excuse me if we are very good 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.000
 it can work well it works well 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.680
 that said @ one never writes them to the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.489
 hand it's rare even though most of the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.750
 time it's on a keyboard 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.700
 I do not know when it's my city 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.110
 do not write an arobase - if sir good 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.850
 what do we have to go we have the 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.530
 pen window so that's nice to you 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.140
 do you draw a square on 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.880
 the screen and it makes you appear all 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.340
 a slew of applications not bad 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.400
 it's pretty cool here you're going to have 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.010
 selected the rain that you need enough 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.420
 quickly deciding this little square that 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.950
 was a gestural shortcut actually 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.090
 yeah what's fun is that the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.560
 engineers from samsung have us 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.590
 explained that they truly 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.549
 studied the uses of galaxy fans 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.720
 note to see a little bit of it 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.950
 stood at when it's fun 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.609
 that there are as many men as women 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.180
 who have a galaxy rating a 50 50 that's 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.100
 pretty amazing 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.540
 and then we also realize samsung 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.979
 realized that users 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.350
 galaxies that were used extensively 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.180
 of the stylus so it's true that well 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.220
 the ingredients have capitalized on 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.990
 applications that serve even more to 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.919
 everyday then we can also his 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.330
 little apps keep them in 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.070
 overprinting over another 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.419
 document that can be practical and then 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.280
 we can also reduce the meters by 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.720
 icon it's cute all full and we 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.040
 move icons on the screen 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.230
 that's what we could say about 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.700
 this galaxy note 3 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.320
 be a look at the big brother 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.350
 or their big sister so look 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.150
 this is the galaxy tab 10.1 in fact you 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.730
 take the galaxy 2 3 you widen it 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.990
 carried out here you with roll to 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.640
 tapestry wanted to shoot 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.140
 this one includes all the news 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.850
 software is appropriate to show you and 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.500
 many more and then we find 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.820
 really the same philosophy so 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.070
 the use of the stylus is a bit the same 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.940
 design with the aco career also in 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.890
 leatherette 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.500
 this is the big news 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.180
 samsung who was eagerly awaited attention 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.830
 this is only the beginning of the ifa on the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.480
 techno channel 01net this big dedicated show 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.360
 at the new techno here in berlin
