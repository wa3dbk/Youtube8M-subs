00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello, I want to talk about the pros 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 and cons lassithi thermometers for 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.800
 aquariums are those same thermometers 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.750
 which is glued to the outer wall 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.480
 aquarium 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.940
 Well, first before the earlier pluses 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.910
 the thermometer was ordinary mercury me 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.850
 a thermometer that was often needed 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.689
 the cape was attached inside the glass 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.539
 aquarium 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 I don't know how we are in the class 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.590
 fought 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 open these velcro and peeled got on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.350
 water surface in the aquarium with the same 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.879
 thermometer and among such problems there 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.410
 it is glued to the outer walls 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.640
 aquarium dirtying the walls of the aquarium 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.430
 practically its unnoticed 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.469
 Well, in principle, he question is simple in 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.239
 using 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.690
 but for purity this is probably all the advantages 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.550
 which I can say about him now a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.000
 his cons well, firstly what you 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.430
 see the reflection of the light bulb 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.970
 ordinary in glass it is made for 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.250
 the fact that without this bulb almost no 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.090
 you will see what is on the scale 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 thermometer i mean if i do 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:27.259
 ordinary acne lighting will be this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:30.570
 look like here is the second 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.720
 Aquarium sticking thermometer should be on 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.299
 free wall so that nato walls do not 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.329
 there was no thermostat filter our 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.189
 the measurements will be wrong because 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.890
 what's the filter what's the natural thermostat 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.320
 heats up and because of this the temperature 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.540
 will be wrong 3 0 what i want to say 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.990
 it `s naturally 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.390
 I read the temperature myself 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.659
 Compared with the side to work with a thermometer 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.549
 the difference is somewhere around 1 degree 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.320
 certainly not very scared anyway 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.470
 unpleasant 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.370
 and it is also very difficult to know all such 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.660
 turn up the temperature in your aqualine without 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.020
 additional devices 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.830
 Here you see the light bulb barely barely 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.740
 seen . 128 degrees then school 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.800
 celsius and fahrenheit 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:30.780
 Well, I take occasion bulb again 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.880
 I can not see anything for this decision 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.130
 it turned out to be a very simple hour 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.630
 small blue lanterns 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:43.050
 flash pockets for days von background 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.670
 which also work as a flashlight now 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:53.010
 I'll take one of these flashlights here I 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:03:00.380
 I called and here I offer this color 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:04.769
 glass aquarium and I look at me 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.140
 shine instructions 28-29 somewhere degrees 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.110
 now we 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.209
 water in the aquarium well, in principle, side by side 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.180
 with the aquarium is not always the same lamp 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.190
 so I can easily see what 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.260
 still i have a temperature in the aquarium 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:25.530
 You are certainly not very comfortable. 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.630
 that's nothing at all to be seen here is basically 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.290
 all I wanted to say about was sit 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.290
 liters
