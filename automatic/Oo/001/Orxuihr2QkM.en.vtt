00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
one of the things that will affect the

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.450 
one of the things that will affect the
way<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.240> play<00:00:06.509> your<00:00:06.720> guitar<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.460> something

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
way you play your guitar is something

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.730 
way you play your guitar is something
called<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> action<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.570> guitar<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.170> that

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
called the action of the guitar and that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.249 
called the action of the guitar and that
just<00:00:11.010> means<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.580> way<00:00:11.790> everything<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.900> set<00:00:13.230> up

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
just means the way everything is set up

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.919 
just means the way everything is set up
the<00:00:13.950> way<00:00:14.099> everything<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.700> adjusted<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.900> way

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the way everything is adjusted the way

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.500 
the way everything is adjusted the way
everything<00:00:16.440> works<00:00:16.680> together<00:00:17.210> part<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.359> this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
everything works together part of this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.170 
everything works together part of this
is<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.109> way<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.439> strings<00:00:19.800> feel<00:00:20.430> when<00:00:21.029> you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
is the way the strings feel when you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.470 
is the way the strings feel when you
push<00:00:21.480> them<00:00:22.220> now<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.400> depends<00:00:23.880> partly<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
push them now that depends partly on the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.920 
push them now that depends partly on the
height<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> strings<00:00:25.529> above<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.970> frets<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
height of the strings above the frets it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.890 
height of the strings above the frets it
also<00:00:28.439> depends<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.570> curvature<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
also depends on the curvature of your

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.510 
also depends on the curvature of your
neck<00:00:31.170> that's<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> talk

neck that's what we're going to talk
about<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.110> curvature<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
about right now is the curvature of the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.580 
about right now is the curvature of the
neck<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> guitar<00:00:36.630> neck<00:00:36.660> generally<00:00:37.290> wants

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
neck now a guitar neck generally wants

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
neck now a guitar neck generally wants
to<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.860> straight<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.670> order<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> guitar

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to be straight in order for the guitar

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.160 
to be straight in order for the guitar
to<00:00:39.930> play<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.320> best<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:42.120> things<00:00:42.870> do

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to play as best it can but things do

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
to play as best it can but things do

way if it gets too dry it might go a
certain<00:00:54.660> way<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.980> turn<00:00:56.190> will<00:00:56.370> affect

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
certain way and that in turn will affect

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the way that it feels to you now you can

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.799 
the way that it feels to you now you can
look<00:01:00.059> down<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> neck<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.770> long<00:01:02.039> way<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.780> get<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
look down a neck the long way and get a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.750 
look down a neck the long way and get a
general<00:01:04.110> idea<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.710> whether<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.220> straight<00:01:05.580> or

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
general idea of whether it's straight or

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.690 
general idea of whether it's straight or
not<00:01:06.470> now<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.530> might<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.130> able<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> tell

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
not now you might not be able to tell

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.359 
not now you might not be able to tell
whether<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.390> neck<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.869> straight<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.500> curving

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
whether your neck is straight or curving

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.940 
whether your neck is straight or curving
in<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> certain<00:01:11.909> direction<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.619> always

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
in a certain direction you can always

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.499 
in a certain direction you can always
bring<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.460> somebody<00:01:14.700> who<00:01:14.970> does<00:01:15.210> such

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
bring it to somebody who does such

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
bring it to somebody who does such
things<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.530> town<00:01:16.799> there's<00:01:17.040> probably<00:01:17.460> a

things in your town there's probably a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.420 
things in your town there's probably a
repair<00:01:17.970> man<00:01:18.150> somewhere<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.840> does<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.430> but

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
repair man somewhere that does this but

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.630 
repair man somewhere that does this but
if<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:22.409> something<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.400> want<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
if you do see something you want to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.350 
if you do see something you want to
adjust<00:01:23.759> yourself<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.380> how<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> works

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
adjust yourself this is how it works

adjust yourself this is how it works
inside<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> neck<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> part<00:01:28.380> called<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
inside the neck is a part called the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.440 
inside the neck is a part called the
truss<00:01:29.009> rod<00:01:29.159> which<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.939> loosened<00:01:30.360> or

truss rod which can be loosened or
tightened<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.170> affect<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> straightness<00:01:32.130> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
tightened to affect the straightness of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
tightened to affect the straightness of
the<00:01:32.369> neck<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.509> place<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.780> tighten<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the neck and the place you tighten it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
the neck and the place you tighten it
will<00:01:34.979> either<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.150> end<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> neck

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
will either be at this end of the neck

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.940 
will either be at this end of the neck
or<00:01:38.299> inside<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.329> other<00:01:39.630> end<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> neck<00:01:40.259> if

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
or inside the other end of the neck if

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.560 
or inside the other end of the neck if
the<00:01:41.100> adjustment<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.820> available<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> top

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the adjustment is available at the top

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.539 
the adjustment is available at the top
of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> neck<00:01:43.259> there<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.009> cover<00:01:44.310> plate

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
of the neck there will be a cover plate

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.300 
of the neck there will be a cover plate
so<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.360> would<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> first<00:01:45.869> step<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.890> take

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
so that would be the first step to take

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030 
so that would be the first step to take
that<00:01:47.520> plate<00:01:47.729> off<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.170> inside<00:01:49.590> there

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
that plate off what we see inside there

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.270 
that plate off what we see inside there
is<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.670> truss<00:01:51.180> rod<00:01:51.390> nut<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.229> that's<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.040> part

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
is the truss rod nut and that's the part

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.760 
is the truss rod nut and that's the part
that<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.909> move<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.899> adjust<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> tightness

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that we can move to adjust the tightness

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.069

you recheck your neck along the way this

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.220 
you recheck your neck along the way this
is<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.770> little<00:02:43.070> tricky<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.490> get<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.940> angle<00:02:44.390> but

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
is a little tricky to get the angle but

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.110 
is a little tricky to get the angle but
if<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.410> can<00:02:45.710> tell<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.250> it's<00:02:46.430> bowed<00:02:46.670> one<00:02:46.940> way

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
if you can tell that it's bowed one way

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.740 
if you can tell that it's bowed one way
or<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.240> other

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
or the other

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.560 
or the other
you<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.650> keep<00:02:48.830> adjusting<00:02:49.010> until<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:50.390> can

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
you just keep adjusting until you can

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.620 
you just keep adjusting until you can
tell<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:51.260> you've<00:02:51.500> made<00:02:51.710> it<00:02:51.890> straight

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
tell that you've made it straight

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.180 
tell that you've made it straight
another<00:02:53.630> factor<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.110> consider<00:02:54.230> when<00:02:54.740> you're

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
another factor to consider when you're

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.360 
another factor to consider when you're
adjusting<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.850> neck<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.300> how<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:57.470> feels<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
adjusting the neck is how it feels and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.260 
adjusting the neck is how it feels and
how<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:59.000> sounds<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.720> guess<00:03:00.140> that's<00:03:00.350> two<00:03:00.560> factors

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
how it sounds I guess that's two factors

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.370 
how it sounds I guess that's two factors
if<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.660> strings<00:03:03.650> are<00:03:03.860> too<00:03:04.100> high<00:03:04.480> which<00:03:05.480> would

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
if the strings are too high which would

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.470 
if the strings are too high which would
be<00:03:06.530> caused<00:03:06.770> by<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.100> neck<00:03:07.400> bowing<00:03:07.820> upwards

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
be caused by the neck bowing upwards

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.720 
be caused by the neck bowing upwards
they're<00:03:08.900> just<00:03:09.170> going<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.380> feel<00:03:09.710> extra<00:03:10.400> stiff

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
they're just going to feel extra stiff

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.700 
they're just going to feel extra stiff
when<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.090> play<00:03:11.330> your<00:03:11.540> notes<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:12.140> not<00:03:12.380> going

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
when you play your notes it's not going

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.400 
when you play your notes it's not going
to<00:03:12.800> be<00:03:12.920> as<00:03:13.010> comfortable<00:03:13.250> as<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:13.970> could<00:03:14.210> be<00:03:14.450> okay

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
to be as comfortable as it could be okay

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.430 
to be as comfortable as it could be okay
now<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.650> have<00:03:16.330> intentionally<00:03:17.330> adjusted<00:03:18.260> this

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
now I have intentionally adjusted this

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.390 
now I have intentionally adjusted this
neck<00:03:18.770> with<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.220> backwards<00:03:20.090> bow<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
neck with a backwards bow so that the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.260 
neck with a backwards bow so that the
strings<00:03:22.700> are<00:03:22.910> now<00:03:23.150> too<00:03:23.990> low<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:25.270> they're

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
strings are now too low and they're

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.120 
strings are now too low and they're
making<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.840> lot<00:03:26.990> of<00:03:27.050> buzzing<00:03:27.380> noises<00:03:27.740> when<00:03:28.100> I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
making a lot of buzzing noises when I

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:37.089 
making a lot of buzzing noises when I
play<00:03:28.460> the<00:03:28.640> notes

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.640 

okay<00:03:38.099> now<00:03:38.400> I'm<00:03:39.120> readjusting<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:40.260> truss<00:03:40.500> rod

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
okay now I'm readjusting the truss rod

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:51.619 
okay now I'm readjusting the truss rod
nut<00:03:43.190> quarter<00:03:44.190> turn<00:03:44.400> at<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.670> time<00:03:46.790> until<00:03:50.629> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
neck is back to its regular straightness

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:08.199 
neck is back to its regular straightness
and<00:03:54.629> now<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:56.220> notes<00:03:56.489> will<00:03:56.760> sound<00:03:57.000> clear<00:03:57.390> again

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.809 

okay<00:04:09.209> now<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.450> have<00:04:09.810> intentionally<00:04:10.819> Mis

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
adjusted the neck in the other direction

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.180 
adjusted the neck in the other direction
where<00:04:14.670> there's<00:04:14.989> upwards<00:04:15.989> bow<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.949> neck

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
where there's upwards bow to the neck

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.610 
where there's upwards bow to the neck
that<00:04:17.489> makes<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.329> strings<00:04:18.660> higher<00:04:19.049> above<00:04:19.590> the

that makes the strings higher above the

that makes the strings higher above the
frets<00:04:20.040> than<00:04:20.340> they<00:04:20.459> really<00:04:20.729> want<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.060> be<00:04:21.299> it's

tough<00:04:22.500> for<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:22.889> see<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.060> maybe<00:04:24.330> but<00:04:24.690> if

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
tough for you to see this maybe but if

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.230 
tough for you to see this maybe but if
you<00:04:24.840> were<00:04:25.020> playing<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.470> guitar<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:27.030> would

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
you were playing the guitar you would

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.900 
you were playing the guitar you would
notice<00:04:27.539> that<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:28.470> strings<00:04:28.800> are<00:04:29.070> higher<00:04:29.520> than

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
notice that the strings are higher than
