the Caliphate King as a lot of you guys
would<00:00:10.080> have<00:00:10.200> expected<00:00:10.559> if<00:00:11.010> you've<00:00:11.190> killed<00:00:11.490> it

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
would have expected if you've killed it

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.720 
would have expected if you've killed it
and<00:00:11.940> gotten<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.960> strategy<00:00:13.920> down<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.580> was

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
and gotten the strategy down this was

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.050 
and gotten the strategy down this was
the<00:00:14.849> best<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:16.410> knew<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:17.070> if<00:00:17.430> you

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the best one that I knew about if you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
the best one that I knew about if you
guys<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.240> watch<00:00:18.600> your<00:00:18.779> screen<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.289> uh<00:00:19.350> this

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
guys just watch your screen this uh this

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.609 
guys just watch your screen this uh this
kill<00:00:20.400> was<00:00:20.430> about<00:00:20.910> two<00:00:21.539> minutes<00:00:21.750> long<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.109> we

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
kill was about two minutes long and we

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.170 
kill was about two minutes long and we
did<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:23.369> long<00:00:23.519> time<00:00:23.699> that's

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
did this for a very long time that's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.450 
did this for a very long time that's
probably<00:00:24.570> how<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:25.439> got<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.830> many<00:00:25.949> good<00:00:26.160> drops

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
probably how we got so many good drops

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.009 
probably how we got so many good drops
in<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.880> nutshell<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.510> two<00:00:27.689> attackers

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
in a nutshell you have two attackers

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.080 
in a nutshell you have two attackers
myself<00:00:28.800> being<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.130> full<00:00:29.340> virtus<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> ver

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
de Swann and virtus books so I've got

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.790 
de Swann and virtus books so I've got
some<00:00:32.279> high<00:00:32.460> DPI<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.960> that's<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.260> everyone

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
some high DPI think that's what everyone

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.380 
some high DPI think that's what everyone
calls<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.219> i'll<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> video<00:00:35.880> showing<00:00:36.300> you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
calls it i'll make a video showing you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
calls it i'll make a video showing you
guys<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.809> attack<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> lot<00:00:37.739> faster<00:00:38.070> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
guys you just attack a lot faster it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.569 
guys you just attack a lot faster it
enables<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> shoot<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.590> spell's<00:00:41.160> at<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
enables you to shoot your spell's at a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.479 
enables you to shoot your spell's at a
fast<00:00:42.329> rate<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.750> guess<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.710> beside<00:00:43.980> me<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> brain

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
fast rate I guess so beside me I brain

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.279 
fast rate I guess so beside me I brain
he<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.850> also<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.360> attacker<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:45.989> he<00:00:46.140> has<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
he is also a attacker but he has a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.869 
he is also a attacker but he has a
shield<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.710> most<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> time<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.520> he<00:00:47.670> can

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
shield on most of the time so he can

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.940 
shield on most of the time so he can
protect<00:00:48.090> our<00:00:48.510> tanker<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.230> he<00:00:49.379> gets<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.710> green

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
protect our tanker if he gets that green

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.799 
protect our tanker if he gets that green
 spat<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.520> him<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> does<00:00:51.629> happen

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
 spat on him and that does happen

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.150 
 spat on him and that does happen
sometimes<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.739> watch<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.129> for

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
sometimes so you have to watch out for

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.100 
sometimes so you have to watch out for
that<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:53.910> kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> separated<00:00:54.570> into<00:00:54.840> two

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
that we're kind of separated into two

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
that we're kind of separated into two
squads<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> other<00:00:56.280> side<00:00:56.610> can't<00:00:57.000> really

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
squads and the other side can't really

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
squads and the other side can't really
see<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.930> our<00:00:58.199> tanker<00:00:58.559> gets<00:00:58.739> green<00:00:58.980> shits<00:00:59.250> bad

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
see if our tanker gets green shits bad

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
see if our tanker gets green shits bad
on<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.789> so<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.629> his<00:01:01.260> back

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
on them so we have to have his back

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.260 
on them so we have to have his back
covered<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.789> case<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
covered and not just in case I have a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.200 
covered and not just in case I have a
shield<00:01:03.539> switch<00:01:04.290> by<00:01:04.500> mean<00:01:04.820> I'm<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
shield switch by mean I'm not going to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.730 
shield switch by mean I'm not going to
be<00:01:06.270> fast<00:01:06.510> enough<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.869> switch<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.560> use

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
be fast enough to switch to that and use

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
be fast enough to switch to that and use
provoke<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.400> residence<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.119> key<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
provoke and then residence the key to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.750 
provoke and then residence the key to
this<00:01:09.479> method<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.409> fact<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> stayed

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
this method is the fact that it stayed

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.340 
this method is the fact that it stayed
on<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.270> mainly<00:01:12.479> face<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:12.990> were<00:01:13.080> getting

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
on it's mainly face and we were getting

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
on it's mainly face and we were getting
so<00:01:13.619> fast<00:01:13.950> kills<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> never<00:01:14.760> switch<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.299> Ranger

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
so fast kills and never switch to Ranger

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.690 
so fast kills and never switch to Ranger
mage<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.710> never<00:01:16.860> had<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> deal<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.310> any<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
mage so we never had to deal with any of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.999 
mage so we never had to deal with any of
the<00:01:17.790> healing<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.420> any<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.869> stuff<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.650> was

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the healing or any of that stuff it was

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.280 
the healing or any of that stuff it was
just<00:01:20.159> very<00:01:20.310> simple<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> relaxed<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.049> it's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
just very simple and relaxed and it's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.469 
just very simple and relaxed and it's
kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.920> thought<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.000> last<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.390> little

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
kind of I thought it would last a little

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.120 
kind of I thought it would last a little
bit<00:01:24.600> longer<00:01:24.840> brawl<00:01:25.110> ready<00:01:25.350> Jake<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.740> has<00:01:25.890> made

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
bit longer brawl ready Jake is has made

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100 
bit longer brawl ready Jake is has made
tweaks<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:27.180> probably<00:01:27.450> done<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> am

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
tweaks I'm probably done for that I am

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.710 
tweaks I'm probably done for that I am

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
up with about 40 mil if you didn't hear

up with about 40 mil if you didn't hear
the<00:03:03.250> prices<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.940> these<00:03:04.060> items<00:03:04.360> got<00:03:04.720> slashed<00:03:05.080> in

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
the prices of these items got slashed in

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.500 
the prices of these items got slashed in
half<00:03:05.350> yesterday<00:03:05.770> manually<00:03:06.520> by<00:03:06.670> jagex<00:03:07.000> because

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
half yesterday manually by jagex because

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.260 
half yesterday manually by jagex because
they<00:03:08.350> saw<00:03:09.220> what<00:03:09.460> was<00:03:09.550> going<00:03:09.640> on<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:09.970> lot<00:03:10.210> of

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
they saw what was going on a lot of

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.910 
they saw what was going on a lot of
people<00:03:10.390> are<00:03:10.630> going<00:03:10.810> here<00:03:11.080> using<00:03:11.440> coin<00:03:11.620> share

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
people are going here using coin share

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.860 
people are going here using coin share
and<00:03:12.160> when<00:03:12.880> everyone<00:03:13.240> was<00:03:13.360> getting<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.630> drop

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
and when everyone was getting a drop

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.330 
and when everyone was getting a drop
they're<00:03:14.080> getting<00:03:14.350> these<00:03:14.410> splits<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.190> were<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
they're getting these splits that were a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.620 
they're getting these splits that were a
lot<00:03:15.550> higher<00:03:15.760> than<00:03:15.820> what<00:03:16.150> they<00:03:16.270> should<00:03:16.510> be

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
lot higher than what they should be

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.970 
lot higher than what they should be
because<00:03:16.810> when<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:17.230> I'm<00:03:17.380> was<00:03:17.590> going<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:17.890> the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
because when that I'm was going to the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.130 
because when that I'm was going to the
GE<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.460> was<00:03:18.550> selling<00:03:18.790> for<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:19.090> lot<00:03:19.180> less<00:03:19.600> than

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
GE it was selling for a lot less than

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.680 
GE it was selling for a lot less than
what's<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:21.130> split<00:03:21.700> was<00:03:22.000> for<00:03:22.270> if<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.480> makes

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
what's that split was for if that makes

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.810 
what's that split was for if that makes
sense<00:03:22.840> as<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.710> now<00:03:23.740> it's<00:03:24.100> actually<00:03:24.370> better<00:03:24.730> to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
sense as of now it's actually better to

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.670 
sense as of now it's actually better to
loot<00:03:25.000> share<00:03:25.240> because<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.600> prices<00:03:25.870> are<00:03:26.290> higher

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
loot share because the prices are higher

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.980 
loot share because the prices are higher
than<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:27.370> GE<00:03:27.580> value<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.780> probably

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
than the GE value this is probably

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.300 
than the GE value this is probably
because<00:03:29.260> people<00:03:29.680> are<00:03:29.770> starting<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.040> realize

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
because people are starting to realize

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.920 
because people are starting to realize
that<00:03:30.340> these<00:03:30.610> weapons<00:03:31.000> are<00:03:31.120> actually<00:03:31.720> pretty

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
that these weapons are actually pretty

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.560 
that these weapons are actually pretty
good<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:33.190> fact<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.550> kalphite<00:03:34.120> king<00:03:34.120> is

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
good and the fact that kalphite king is

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.620 
good and the fact that kalphite king is
getting<00:03:34.930> harder<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:35.890> these<00:03:36.160> items<00:03:36.670> are<00:03:37.240> going

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
getting harder so these items are going

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.990 
getting harder so these items are going
to<00:03:37.750> be<00:03:37.870> more<00:03:38.140> rare<00:03:38.580> we'll<00:03:39.580> see<00:03:39.790> what<00:03:39.910> happens

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
to be more rare we'll see what happens

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.420 
to be more rare we'll see what happens
though
