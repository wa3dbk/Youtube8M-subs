shotguns<00:00:48.240> have<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:49.320> good<00:00:49.410> power<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
think they should be at least more

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.130 
think they should be at least more
realistic<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.700> they<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.540> pretty<00:00:57.810> good<00:00:57.900> damage

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
realistic and they do pretty good damage

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.870 
realistic and they do pretty good damage

sorry I'm still amazed like I've only

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.109 
sorry I'm still amazed like I've only
played<00:01:04.979> probably<00:01:05.339> seven<00:01:05.909> games<00:01:06.119> online<00:01:06.329> and

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
played probably seven games online and

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
played probably seven games online and
11<00:01:09.119> single-player<00:01:09.659> level<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
11 single-player level I think this is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.929 
11 single-player level I think this is
the<00:01:11.460> game<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.970> me<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.159> looked<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.579> cfi

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the game for me and looked out the cfi

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.219 
the game for me and looked out the cfi
she<00:01:15.000> died<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.990> playing

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
she died there it's like playing

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.700 
she died there it's like playing
hardcore<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.400> call<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.180> duty<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.290> normal

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
hardcore on call of duty but it's normal

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.420 
hardcore on call of duty but it's normal
alright<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:24.770> think<00:01:25.770> when

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
alright so you have to really think when

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.530 
alright so you have to really think when
you're<00:01:26.580> playing<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.090> running<00:01:27.150> around<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
you're playing and running around the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.650 
you're playing and running around the
map<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.110> 12<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.530> 12<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.150> like

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.080 

it's<00:01:34.660> not<00:01:34.960> like<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.410> can<00:01:35.530> just<00:01:35.940> what's<00:01:36.940> the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
it's not like you can just what's the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it's not like you can just what's the
word<00:01:37.270> run<00:01:37.990> around<00:01:38.290> easily<00:01:39.660> these<00:01:40.660> are<00:01:40.840> small

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
word run around easily these are small

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.840 
word run around easily these are small
maps<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.440> there's<00:01:44.440> just<00:01:44.530> 12<00:01:45.190> on<00:01:45.310> 12<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:45.730> we've

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
maps and there's just 12 on 12 so we've

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.540 
maps and there's just 12 on 12 so we've
got<00:01:45.970> people<00:01:46.120> everywhere<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:47.410> if<00:01:47.800> then<00:01:48.010> people

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
got people everywhere and if then people

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.340 
got people everywhere and if then people

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
screen on the top right that's a really

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.990 
screen on the top right that's a really
close<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.990> you<00:01:53.080> shooting<00:01:53.410> at<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.460> there's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
close to you shooting at you so there's

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.750 
close to you shooting at you so there's
that<00:01:55.440> some<00:01:56.440> people<00:01:56.740> say<00:01:57.070> that<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.370> graphics

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
that some people say that the graphics

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.640 
that some people say that the graphics
like<00:01:57.940> this<00:01:58.120> game<00:01:58.360> in<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:58.990> they're<00:01:59.170> smoking

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650

like this game in it if they're smoking
some<00:01:59.980> weed<00:02:00.010> or<00:02:00.730> something<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.030> think<00:02:01.060> they're

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
some weed or something I think they're

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.590

beautiful<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:02.680> looks<00:02:02.860> really<00:02:03.100> good<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:04.390> me<00:02:04.420> it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
beautiful it looks really good to me it

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.180 
beautiful it looks really good to me it
runs<00:02:04.780> smooth<00:02:07.260> I've<00:02:08.260> already<00:02:08.440> learned<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:09.100> on

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
runs smooth I've already learned it on

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.310 
runs smooth I've already learned it on
some<00:02:09.520> maps<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:09.910> there<00:02:10.119> was<00:02:10.270> bad<00:02:10.479> places<00:02:10.899> to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
some maps that there was bad places to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.170 
some maps that there was bad places to
be<00:02:11.470> bad<00:02:11.800> choke<00:02:12.100> points<00:02:14.670> where<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.760> get<00:02:15.940> caught

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
be bad choke points where you get caught

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.660 
be bad choke points where you get caught
and<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.600> just<00:02:16.900> they're<00:02:17.350> screwed<00:02:17.680> they<00:02:18.490> have

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
and it's just they're screwed they have

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.670 
and it's just they're screwed they have
added<00:02:18.880> some<00:02:19.240> recoil<00:02:19.690> notice<00:02:19.990> on<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> beta<00:02:20.470> I'd

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
added some recoil notice on the beta I'd

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.350 
added some recoil notice on the beta I'd
never<00:02:20.830> played<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.280> beta<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.090> truly

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360
