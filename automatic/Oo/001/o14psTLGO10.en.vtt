00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to all today I practiced 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.000
 fishing for carp by being with 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 light material for this fishing 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 I use a number 8 hook up 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.580
 directly on the line body and a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.789
 buckshot lead of 2 g pinch about 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.010
 10 centimes 10 15 cm from the hook 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.720
 then you put a grain of corn 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.330
 you let the edge of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.130
 the grain hook a little priming 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.680
 can be done using a few 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.350
 handfuls of corn to bring the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.540
 fish on the spot it is however 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.640
 not necessary to initiate too much or to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.200
 in advance as this may attract 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.010
 other unwanted fish on the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.010
 shot like catfish 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.230
 always keep the maximum of tension 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.230
 so that the fish does not get stuck 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:13.810
 always kept in touch really with 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:15.820
 fish like that fish at once 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:28.000
 gets tired faster and it avoids 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:29.170
 pick up like here as fish wants 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.590
 to go to an obstacle 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.869
 you put the can in the down position 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.960
 faster water and you shoot in 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.350
 the other way to get him out of 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 the danger zone 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.200
 mirror card that about 2 kg 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.020
 often 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.090
 here is the fish a map of about 3 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.090
 kg a beautiful fish 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.840
 it's a fishing that I really love 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.130
 practice because as you see it allows 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.330
 tired and very beautiful fish 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.330
 with light equipment 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:16.070
 here is another very beautiful fish around 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.650
 4 kg can be five kilos a very beautiful 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.030
 mirror map as you can the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.200
 note these fish are size 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.490
 quite modest for those who 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.650
 practice carp fishing 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.669
 but on a cane lights and fish 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.360
 become immediately a lot more 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.360
 fun prevent 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.220
 how 

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:55.829
 here is another fish of about two 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.829
 half pounds 

00:05:56.609 --> 00:06:00.539
 still a beautiful mirror map
