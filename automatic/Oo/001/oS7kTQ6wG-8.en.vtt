00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
own daily driver now the issue I'm

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.980 
own daily driver now the issue I'm
having<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.170> own<00:00:22.440> a<00:00:22.710> 97<00:00:23.460> Nissan<00:00:23.790> Sentra<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
having is I own a 97 Nissan Sentra and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.370 
having is I own a 97 Nissan Sentra and
apparently<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.650> common<00:00:26.220> problem<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.730> these<00:00:26.880> is

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
apparently a common problem for these is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.150 
apparently a common problem for these is
timing<00:00:28.380> chain<00:00:28.620> rattle<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.760> causes<00:00:30.030> this<00:00:30.480> is

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
timing chain rattle what causes this is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.350 
timing chain rattle what causes this is
lack<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.190> or<00:00:32.760> a<00:00:33.239> worn<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:34.050> tensioner<00:00:34.970> so<00:00:35.970> today

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
lack of or a worn out tensioner so today

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.430 
lack of or a worn out tensioner so today
I'm<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.930> installing<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.410> new

I'm going to be installing a new
tensioner<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.550> upper<00:00:38.850> timing<00:00:39.030> chain<00:00:39.449> of

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
tensioner on the upper timing chain of

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.390 
tensioner on the upper timing chain of
the<00:00:40.710> Sentra

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.520

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
valve cover from on top of the engine to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.260 
valve cover from on top of the engine to
do<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.470> it<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:49.830> just<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.190> set<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.580> Phillips

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
do that it was just a set of Phillips

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.640 
do that it was just a set of Phillips
head<00:00:51.480> screws<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.320> around<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
head screws all the way around the

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.010 
head screws all the way around the
perimeter<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.130> valve<00:00:53.370> cover<00:00:53.490> and<00:00:54.020> two

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
perimeter of the valve cover and two

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.800 
perimeter of the valve cover and two
hoses<00:00:55.290> you<00:00:55.740> take<00:00:56.550> those<00:00:56.760> off<00:00:56.970> remove<00:00:57.630> your

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
hoses you take those off remove your

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.870 
hoses you take those off remove your
spark<00:00:58.110> plug<00:00:58.350> boots<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.700> valve

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
spark plug boots and then the valve

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.110 
spark plug boots and then the valve
cover<00:01:00.150> will<00:01:00.300> lift<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.720> off<00:01:01.250> then<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.970> can

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
cover will lift right off then you can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.570 
cover will lift right off then you can
inspect<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.750> tensioner<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.010> tensioner<00:01:05.550> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
inspect your tensioner the tensioner is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
inspect your tensioner the tensioner is
located<00:01:06.480> next<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.870> timing<00:01:07.140> chain<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.680> if

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
located next to the timing chain and if

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.850 
located next to the timing chain and if
you<00:01:07.920> look<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.550> in<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.870> about<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.350> angle

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you look down in right about this angle

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
you look down in right about this angle
you'll<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.730> tensioner<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you'll see the tensioner this is the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560 
you'll see the tensioner this is the
actual<00:01:13.260> tensioner<00:01:13.800> right<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.580> what<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
actual tensioner right here and what I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
actual tensioner right here and what I
noticed<00:01:15.870> was<00:01:16.020> worn<00:01:16.260> down<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.800> is<00:01:16.979> this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
noticed was worn down on it is this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.330 
noticed was worn down on it is this
plastic<00:01:17.520> Pat<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.869> chain<00:01:19.260> is<00:01:19.440> already<00:01:19.830> cut<00:01:20.130> all

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
plastic Pat the chain is already cut all

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.070 
plastic Pat the chain is already cut all
the<00:01:20.580> way<00:01:20.670> down<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.780> into<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the way down into this and down into the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
the way down into this and down into the
metal<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.160> believe<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> what's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
metal and I believe that is what's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.000 
metal and I believe that is what's
causing<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:24.540> rattling<00:01:25.110> sound

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.740 

the<00:01:30.010> excess<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.670> tensioner<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.360> need<00:01:31.660> to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
the excess the tensioner I need to

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.300 
the excess the tensioner I need to
remove

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
remove

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.070 
remove
