 all the hour we start so all three characters 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.480
 quick snacks went to kill by 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.890
 someone needs 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.520
 complexity we put the easiest 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.710
 spawn point leave no music ready 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.430
 let's go hi my friend 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.430

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:56.399
 they should go so 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.869
 hiring him we will sort things out 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.000
 Well, on the light, of course it's easy 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.630
 no brighter and said it seems to me that time 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.070
 all chest games 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.880
 and they are then total strengths yet 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.610
 your weak and collage I'll take a pancake 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.599
 the toilet is just a corner too loud they 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.450
 looking about if they will everywhere they wait 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.480
 in me the sound needs to turn them down too 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.180
 sound foreheads wait for the sound settings and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:33.230
 from i'm through the console turned everything down 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.510
 let's go who does not get around is not exactly horror 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.170
 recorded this card for one was it was 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.569
 very boring jump it is necessary that yes 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.200
 Now there will be a platform author 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.450

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.079
 I thought I for a card with lunge damn it so 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.590

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.780
 disassembly 90 there is another module 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:38.740
