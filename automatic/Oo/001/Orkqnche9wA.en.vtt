grenade of parks have been really random

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.769 
grenade of parks have been really random
compared<00:00:17.150> to<00:00:17.210> other<00:00:17.300> games<00:00:17.540> have<00:00:17.689> been

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
compared to other games have been

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.980 
compared to other games have been
playing<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:18.320> some<00:00:19.279> bad<00:00:20.210> hit<00:00:20.450> reg<00:00:20.630> there<00:00:20.840> but

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
playing and some bad hit reg there but

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.140 
playing and some bad hit reg there but
then<00:00:21.110> I<00:00:21.200> do<00:00:21.260> take<00:00:21.619> out<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.920> c4<00:00:22.310> spammer<00:00:22.610> coming

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
then I do take out the c4 spammer coming

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.290 
then I do take out the c4 spammer coming
for<00:00:23.390> me<00:00:23.570> he<00:00:24.290> had<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.500> c-4<00:00:24.950> in<00:00:25.190> his<00:00:25.460> hand<00:00:25.730> ready

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
for me he had the c-4 in his hand ready

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.900 
for me he had the c-4 in his hand ready
to<00:00:26.510> throw<00:00:26.539> it<00:00:26.930> at<00:00:27.080> my<00:00:27.230> face<00:00:27.500> blow<00:00:28.400> it<00:00:28.550> up<00:00:28.699> and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
to throw it at my face blow it up and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.310 
to throw it at my face blow it up and
while<00:00:29.060> he<00:00:29.300> does<00:00:29.480> kind<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.720> flies<00:00:29.960> away<00:00:30.170> to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
while he does kind of flies away to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.430 
while he does kind of flies away to
safety<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.059> the<00:00:32.059> second<00:00:32.449> one<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:32.840> does<00:00:32.989> get<00:00:33.260> me

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
safety and the second one it does get me

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.009 
safety and the second one it does get me
so<00:00:33.770> how<00:00:34.010> lame<00:00:34.400> is<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:34.640> he<00:00:35.449> doesn't<00:00:35.600> take<00:00:35.809> any

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
so how lame is that he doesn't take any

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.710 
so how lame is that he doesn't take any
damage<00:00:36.610> basically<00:00:37.610> it's<00:00:37.879> almost<00:00:38.150> to<00:00:38.510> his

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
damage basically it's almost to his

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.500 
damage basically it's almost to his
advantage<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.350> use<00:00:39.470> that<00:00:39.650> because<00:00:39.830> then<00:00:40.220> he

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
advantage to use that because then he

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.740 
advantage to use that because then he
gets<00:00:41.949> blown<00:00:42.949> up<00:00:42.979> in<00:00:43.430> such<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:43.699> way<00:00:43.970> that<00:00:44.000> he<00:00:44.540> gets

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
gets blown up in such a way that he gets

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.160 
gets blown up in such a way that he gets
pushed<00:00:45.050> away<00:00:45.229> from<00:00:46.089> the<00:00:47.089> explosion<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.080> if

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
pushed away from the explosion so if

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.780 
pushed away from the explosion so if
someone's<00:00:48.530> like<00:00:48.710> oh<00:00:48.830> there's<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.159> c4<00:00:49.519> spam

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
someone's like oh there's a c4 spam

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.700 
someone's like oh there's a c4 spam
reason<00:00:50.089> be<00:00:50.210> right<00:00:50.360> there<00:00:50.600> he<00:00:51.170> kind<00:00:51.409> of<00:00:51.440> moves

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
reason be right there he kind of moves

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.710 
reason be right there he kind of moves
away<00:00:51.890> or<00:00:52.250> moves<00:00:52.519> up<00:00:52.729> into<00:00:52.909> the<00:00:53.120> air<00:00:53.150> where<00:00:53.540> he

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
away or moves up into the air where he

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.259 
away or moves up into the air where he
can<00:00:53.930> then<00:00:54.049> decide<00:00:54.440> where<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.769> go<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.269> then

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
can then decide where to go and then

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.840 
can then decide where to go and then
awesome<00:00:57.140> spawning<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.159> then<00:00:58.309> getting<00:00:58.460> taken

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850

back spawn for the Walker which is where

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.320 
back spawn for the Walker which is where
that<00:02:32.390> spawns<00:02:32.840> for<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.290> defense<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.010> then

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
it's a I don't know I guess it's legit

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.900 
it's a I don't know I guess it's legit
strategy<00:07:11.800> but<00:07:11.949> once<00:07:12.280> again<00:07:12.400> it<00:07:12.580> is<00:07:12.669> pretty

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910 
strategy but once again it is pretty

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.210 
strategy but once again it is pretty
cheesy<00:07:13.240> so<00:07:14.080> I'm<00:07:14.199> not<00:07:14.289> trying<00:07:14.710> to<00:07:14.740> sound<00:07:14.979> like<00:07:15.160> a

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
cheesy so I'm not trying to sound like a

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.890 
cheesy so I'm not trying to sound like a
whiner<00:07:15.580> or<00:07:16.090> anything<00:07:16.360> like<00:07:16.419> that<00:07:16.539> because

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
whiner or anything like that because

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.689 
whiner or anything like that because
once<00:07:17.500> again<00:07:17.590> this<00:07:17.889> is<00:07:17.949> my<00:07:18.220> favorite

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:18.699 
once again this is my favorite

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:21.090 
once again this is my favorite
battlefield<00:07:18.940> in<00:07:19.479> the<00:07:19.539> series<00:07:19.960> I've<00:07:20.229> had<00:07:21.070> a

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 
battlefield in the series I've had a

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.159 
battlefield in the series I've had a
blast<00:07:21.400> with<00:07:21.820> it<00:07:22.000> when<00:07:22.120> it<00:07:22.150> came<00:07:22.419> out<00:07:22.600> but<00:07:22.900> at

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:23.169 
blast with it when it came out but at

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.770 
blast with it when it came out but at
this<00:07:23.320> point<00:07:23.590> in<00:07:23.740> time<00:07:23.889> with<00:07:24.639> this<00:07:24.820> game<00:07:25.090> like<00:07:25.750> I

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
this point in time with this game like I

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.469 
this point in time with this game like I
think<00:07:25.990> a<00:07:26.139> good<00:07:26.350> word<00:07:26.560> would<00:07:26.680> be<00:07:26.740> decaying<00:07:27.479> with

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 
think a good word would be decaying with

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.689 
think a good word would be decaying with
the<00:07:28.630> current<00:07:28.840> player<00:07:29.260> base<00:07:29.530> and<00:07:29.889> with<00:07:30.580> it

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:30.699 
the current player base and with it

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.150 
the current player base and with it
never<00:07:30.910> being<00:07:31.090> released<00:07:31.479> on<00:07:31.660> Steam<00:07:32.050> a<00:07:32.350> lot<00:07:33.010> of

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160 
never being released on Steam a lot of

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.029 
never being released on Steam a lot of
flaws<00:07:33.789> like<00:07:33.820> that<00:07:34.479> it<00:07:35.229> just<00:07:35.470> seems<00:07:35.650> like<00:07:35.830> I

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 
flaws like that it just seems like I

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.710 
flaws like that it just seems like I
will<00:07:36.430> not<00:07:36.610> be<00:07:36.760> playing<00:07:37.030> anymore<00:07:37.300> because
