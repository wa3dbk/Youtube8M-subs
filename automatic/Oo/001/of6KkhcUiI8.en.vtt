as<00:00:57.660> well<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.020> part<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.559> let's<00:00:58.800> turn<00:00:59.100> off<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
as well this part so let's turn off the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.950 
as well this part so let's turn off the
lights<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.670> bit<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.059> demonstrate<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
lights a little bit just demonstrate the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080 
lights a little bit just demonstrate the
lights<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> sound<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.890> pull<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> trigger<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
lights and sound so pull the trigger it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.719 
lights and sound so pull the trigger it
is<00:01:03.300> instead<00:01:03.840> moans<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.830> stun<00:01:08.100> sound<00:01:08.430> is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
is instead moans so the stun sound is

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.450 
is instead moans so the stun sound is
pretty<00:01:09.330> cool<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.100> bright

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
pretty cool but it's really bright

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
want to switch it back to stem mode you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.590 
want to switch it back to stem mode you
just<00:01:39.659> put<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> lock<00:01:41.509> it's<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
button there yeah it'll lock back into

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.990 
button there yeah it'll lock back into
place<00:01:46.680> therefore<00:01:47.159> some<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:47.939> to
