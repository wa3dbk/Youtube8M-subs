00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.209
 sanaa that consumes good way I think that in outdoor life four times 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.089
 four 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.509
 in this sense ferrer number one 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.509
 if you tell me the nose 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.009
 It is really very cute 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.489
 and they are also created really very nice to be able to easily charge your computer 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:27.769
 or why not watch television 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.500
 or why not another rumor of a gps that the sacrament of this protest 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.760
 as governor in sinaloa the battery 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 can be solved today addressed all the problems absolutely yes it will be a 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.010
 The automobile will be in a boat, practically any vehicle that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.819
 I can not have you 12 votes in an exit due to injury of two 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:50.980
 through these devices call comparisons 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.770
 a converter endeavor in any place electricity to be able to access 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.030
 to electricity today I think it's an absolutely fundamental thing 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.550
 another detail I want to charge the phone and this in the middle of nowhere I can not 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.090
 do yes through this I can use them and perfectly that I arrive already 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 I have an entry k 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.060
 an entry, yes 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.200
 correct the famous ue is given through another way the Cantu tower knows him 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.750
 through this I can not calmly with the card 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.890
 in that place 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.500
 and load it cell calculator end the device a hypothetical music what 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.340
 loves you 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.080
 incisive salaries of these years and if it is the mind that I have been able to very small 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.180
 like this one that is adaptable to the study 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.610
 which has two outputs vs 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.080
 I think the 3d 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.230
 again also to be able to connect it 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.170
 phone what you have left without being able to charge it how much power could reach 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.080
 handle these systems 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.160
 up to 750 watts is perfectly manageable 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.710
 these are solid-state devices luc bessón practically nothing has its 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.920
 own alfredo 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.810
 maybe 150 watts a power 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.600
 fiscally responsible is to say for those who like the outdoors 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.750
 so that for work they were done somewhere and they do not have the peace 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.750
 of being able to connect properly practically any artifact use 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.729
 domestic 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:17.389
 that is not a microwave kitchen a thing of that type 1 electric you with 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:18.569
 this can comment 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.749
 you win 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.149
 the possibility of electric I will be independent and talking about 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.589
 leticia of the uat another thing also 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.389
 electric power 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.779
 electric power 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.779
 a lot of electric power many lingerie boats 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:34.799
 happens that 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.949
 and in the cold light 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.419
 as headquarters the stadium armando dely through the leds 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.340
 they are devices that generate light through a peak cable 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.989
 a conventional incandescent filament bulb 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.349
 loses almost 75 percent of energy in heat generates heat 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.010
 and a little bit of that is transformed into direct light and you can get the rest 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.620
 The government of Cali is issued in which it is not only necessary to pass the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.709
 illumination 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.249
 the power really worked with a lot of energy the encouraging signs 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:11.930
 does that they had a lot more preventative than these systems have over the 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:16.060
 excellent brightness life does not have to be charging batteries 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.899
 ocaña in north center and they get a lot of light time 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.769
 saved from being a director 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.779
 3 watsco rises to 750 well this has truces and has a battery inside you 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:28.769
 regale 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.179
 and he assured that it is practically nothing 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:36.199
 then again electronics comes once again to solve the problems in 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.909
 what it does to our daily life 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.290
 more and more we are also asking for solutions which is what really 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.400
 we need 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.400
 practical solutions and also economic 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:51.569
 A) Yes
