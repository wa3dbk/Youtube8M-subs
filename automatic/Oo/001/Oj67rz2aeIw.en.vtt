00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
another video on that but it's the only

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.890

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.969 
Bass Pro Shops I thought was the seat
sliding<00:01:14.930> down<00:01:15.080> that's<00:01:15.320> kind<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.530> comfortable

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
sliding down that's kind of comfortable

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.980 
sliding down that's kind of comfortable
