 because here we already have sixth network 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.750

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.399
 and with the experience that you have in 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.680
 the sixth week regarding the 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.680
 Respiratory arrives packet 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.130
 but they have not been doing I saw him not 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.369
 I felt better 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.460
 I would paint him one because he said that neither 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.020
 in that sense 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.990
 so you have a good 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.620
 experience with this never learn from 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.620
 updated guide 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.660
 of the vote 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.650
 and honey loving things 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.650
 the world 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.850
 they are as we are as you have seen 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.850
 this new jobs with these products 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:55.000
 the reduction of ammonia load 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.000
 death as normal 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.450
 careless you start to feel slogans 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.239
 to take out and also control 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.170
 and how does chicken see mortality as 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.569
 is 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.670
 I do not have the religious truth 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.560
 of that in the doors of good too 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.350
 there where efe s / a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.540
 the extradites still did not attend 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.650
 that not only the product is a whole 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.240
 integrated management of not doing when 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.610
 you have a state of consciousness of 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.190
 social responsibility you do your 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.200
 I work as if you were the one who is leaving 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.200
 to eat the 15 thousand chickens here 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.990
 Now that you have some products that 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.110
 will offer the image 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.140
 and that's what we're looking for with this one 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.980
 these products what we are looking for is to lower 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.630
 the traceability of antibiotics with the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.820
 problems of 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.070
 breathing and applications because I already 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.200
 before you would be applying 67 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.360
 daily applications and right now is a 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.360
 single application per warehouse 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.730
 having so much god that we are doing 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.710
 two applications to union and evening 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.639
 now with just one application it has been 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.889
 institutions 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.540
 is more let's the cause comes to be a 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.550
 bit 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.890
 with a single application so that I do not 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.650
 has bothered the chicken we will give more 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.110
 better more tranquility 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.940
 because they are fumigating to increase 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.940
 animal also water 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.110
 stretch ion 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.590
 and we put it here in this jar for 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:01.910
 Then put a little water 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.890
 that we make a homogeneous mixture 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.890
 that is always better to use 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.150
 and from that we expose 150 for nothing
