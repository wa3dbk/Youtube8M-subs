00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
what I mean by this level kind of

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.120 
what I mean by this level kind of
defeats<00:01:34.780> all<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:37.680> works<00:01:38.680> against<00:01:39.040> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
defeats all the works against the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.400 
defeats all the works against the
concepts<00:01:39.550> of<00:01:39.670> regular<00:01:40.030> gaming<00:01:40.510> is<00:01:40.630> because

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
concepts of regular gaming is because

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.530 
concepts of regular gaming is because
you<00:01:41.860> because<00:01:42.460> there<00:01:42.610> was<00:01:42.730> a<00:01:42.760> lot<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.120> just

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
you because there was a lot of just

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.860 
you because there was a lot of just
basic<00:01:44.020> concepts<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.680> first<00:01:44.890> concept<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.870> if

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
basic concepts the first concept is if

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.320 
basic concepts the first concept is if
you<00:01:47.350> take<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.590> hit<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.340> idea<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.940> run<00:01:49.120> away

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
you take a hit the idea is to run away

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.060 
you take a hit the idea is to run away
from<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.780> enemy<00:01:49.900> or<00:01:50.320> get<00:01:50.620> away<00:01:50.770> from<00:01:50.830> them<00:01:51.010> as

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
from the enemy or get away from them as

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.580 
from the enemy or get away from them as
fast<00:01:51.130> as<00:01:51.430> possible<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:52.150> this<00:01:53.140> level<00:01:53.470> that's

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
fast as possible in this level that's

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.620 
fast as possible in this level that's
not<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.130> easy<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.580> do<00:01:54.730> sometimes<00:01:55.030> sometimes

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
not so easy to do sometimes sometimes

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.630 
not so easy to do sometimes sometimes
it's<00:01:55.780> just<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:56.020> lot<00:01:56.170> easier<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.710> just<00:01:56.980> take<00:01:57.460> the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
it's just a lot easier to just take the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.180 
it's just a lot easier to just take the
hit<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:57.970> just<00:01:58.150> wait<00:01:58.360> for<00:01:58.390> your<00:01:58.720> moment

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
hit and just wait for your moment

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.320 
hit and just wait for your moment
also<00:02:01.190> some<00:02:01.460> reason<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.729> gives<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.000> bunch<00:02:02.210> of

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
also some reason it gives you a bunch of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.510 
also some reason it gives you a bunch of
marbles<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:02.990> they're<00:02:03.229> useless<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:04.130> can't

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
marbles but they're useless you can't

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:13.059 
marbles but they're useless you can't
hurt<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.180> ghosts<00:02:05.630> with<00:02:05.810> them<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.830> last

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
hurt the ghosts with them the the last

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.720 
hurt the ghosts with them the the last
thing<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.430> actually<00:02:13.580> coming<00:02:13.819> up<00:02:13.940> here<00:02:14.120> shortly

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
thing is actually coming up here shortly

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.010 
thing is actually coming up here shortly
the<00:02:16.730> platforming<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.569> level<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:17.959> a

the platforming in this level is a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.840 
the platforming in this level is a
little<00:02:18.230> bit<00:02:18.350> weird<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> usually<00:02:19.459> when<00:02:19.700> you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
little bit weird to usually when you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.309 
little bit weird to usually when you
deal<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.090> disappearing<00:02:20.660> platforms<00:02:21.230> you

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
deal with disappearing platforms you

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.130 
deal with disappearing platforms you
want<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.590> jump<00:02:21.770> as<00:02:21.950> fast<00:02:22.220> as<00:02:22.459> possible<00:02:23.080> but<00:02:24.080> uh

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
want to jump as fast as possible but uh

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.750 
want to jump as fast as possible but uh
they've<00:02:24.800> actually<00:02:24.950> started<00:02:25.310> with<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.489> lot<00:02:25.730> of

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
they've actually started with a lot of

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.270 
they've actually started with a lot of
timing<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.650> I've<00:02:27.650> noticed<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.069> games

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
timing and I've noticed that this games

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.150 
timing and I've noticed that this games
actually<00:02:28.489> really<00:02:28.910> big<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.830> correct<00:02:30.830> timing

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
actually really big on correct timing

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.020 
actually really big on correct timing
and<00:02:31.520> not<00:02:31.700> rushing<00:02:32.269> things<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:34.850> really

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
and not rushing things which is really

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.370 
and not rushing things which is really
hard<00:02:35.150> for<00:02:35.269> me<00:02:35.330> cuz<00:02:35.480> i<00:02:35.570> watch<00:02:35.750> everything<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.320> do

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
hard for me cuz i watch everything I do

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.250 
hard for me cuz i watch everything I do
and<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:37.220> mean<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.580> about<00:02:37.730> everything<00:02:38.260> but

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
and I mean just about everything but

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.570 
and I mean just about everything but
here<00:02:39.530> here's<00:02:39.830> what<00:02:39.950> i<00:02:40.010> was<00:02:40.130> talking<00:02:40.310> about

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
here here's what i was talking about

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.360 
here here's what i was talking about
jumping<00:02:41.030> on<00:02:41.120> these<00:02:41.269> sewer<00:02:41.510> caps<00:02:41.870> here<00:02:42.340> after<00:02:43.340> a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
jumping on these sewer caps here after a

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.890 
jumping on these sewer caps here after a
little<00:02:43.550> while<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.090> timing<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.630> them<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:44.870> just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
little while the timing on them is just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.560 
little while the timing on them is just
a<00:02:45.140> little<00:02:45.530> bit<00:02:45.680> odd<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.209> kind<00:02:47.450> of

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
a little bit odd you have to kind of

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.300 
a little bit odd you have to kind of
wait<00:02:49.959> until<00:02:50.959> your<00:02:51.170> starts<00:02:51.530> going<00:02:51.830> down<00:02:52.010> before

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
wait until your starts going down before

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.860 
wait until your starts going down before
you<00:02:52.400> can<00:02:52.550> do<00:02:52.760> anything<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.390> same<00:02:53.660> thing

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
you can do anything in the same thing
