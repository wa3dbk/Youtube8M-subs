00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.470

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.209
 ok, this video is going to be pretty 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.800
 I'm just short I want to show you the 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.660
 functions that the camera of the one brings 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.220
 plus one I have left what is the link 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.779
 in the description so you can 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.849
 download it from the forum where I downloaded 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.460
 all you are going to do is lower the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.050
 install regular communication and already 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.400
 you know that this does not require root or 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.769
 none of that will we go into the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.420
 application or on the camera and as you can see is 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.820
 a pretty clean interface does not bring 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.379
 many series or many adjustments brings what 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.690
 essential to record videos to take 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.400
 photos and the mode for a friend in the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.260
 video option we have the function of 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.580
 the samsung or the galaxy is that each 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.950
 Once you record video you can be 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.020
 taking pictures as you see 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.780
 and the photos are pretty fast, 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.190
 it takes a long time that we are going to stop this brings 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.110
 the links here what is the camera 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.850
 after the flash and some effects 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.130
 as what is the location not the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.570
 timer the only thing that 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.760
 you are going to do to activate an effect is 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.290
 lower your finger down 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.940
 kobe ​​if there is brings you all the effects 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.800

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.440

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.630
 megapixels that is the highest resolution 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.030
