kind of pulls on the material and it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.440 
kind of pulls on the material and it
doesn't<00:01:44.159> stretch<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.030> makes<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
doesn't stretch and this makes it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.870 
doesn't stretch and this makes it
uncomfortable<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.500> white<00:01:46.740> feet<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.610> just
