00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.419
 now everyone here this is a new trick 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.450
 energy today the trick 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:12.620
 I'm going to perform is going to be counted 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.259
 exactly 32 a round 2 and 3 and curves 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.789
 they are a glass that is totally empty 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.810
 as you can see 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.599
 empty well for this we need to do 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.079
 the following I take a first down and what 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:31.289
 he let in the lame on the second die and 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.890
 I put it inside the most and the third one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.420
 I wear it 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.920
 you 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:44.120
 once I'm taking the glass and by art 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.239
 magic appear 1 2 and 3 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.460
 I will repeat it but even more difficult 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.100
 I take the first side 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.900
 the second die I feel but I dare 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.170
 to throw it 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:05.400
 all right 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:09.720
 I take the glass and again 1 2 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.580
 interest given very surprising use but 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.980
 now an explanation to understand 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.040
 so there success without the teacher 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.110
 it is empty 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.070
 and we have three dice the two are 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.890
 four 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.120
 42 of webber sum that you can do it with 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.600
 any sponge or material as it is 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.020
 Easy to manipulate in our hands 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.270
 he played the game with which we are going to 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.730
 have in hand in new lace mode 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 lace is to place the side here grab it 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.570
 with these two fingers and bring this back 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.570
 it's worth those who would do something like that 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.750
 we can point and keep both 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.520
 casual doing the same movements 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.980
 always will not be an open hand to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.960
 the other not because it remains suspicious well 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.650
 we show that the glass is totally 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.720
 empty well let's inspect even 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.880
 is the public and I tell him that we are going to 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.320
 press the first degree we put the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.660
 first we actually put it in 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.120
 first grade we take the opportunity to release the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 side that we have in lace and the otter 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.460
 introduced the inside the next 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.160
 way 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.160
 I have a new lace and the other 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.769
 the shots as follows the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.560
 second we take it and do the same 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.959
 gesture so that when the first and the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.670
 third we do not take it to the pocket 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.470
 although we will say that we carry it and this 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.900
 I do not carry it in my pocket 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.060
 and insert it so that the pocket 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.530
 place on the side of the lace mode of 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.709
 the goals 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.810
 and you make me hold your hand and there you 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.500
 is the side seized of the goods 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.330
 lost 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.810
 again you take the glass and there my 12 and 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.110
 32 since when you put the first thing that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.110
 we had 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.640
 we will do the following we repeat the 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.500
 move we'll say we'll do it yet 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.080
 more difficult pulling a dice 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.310
 we put the first new in we put 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.230
 the second given inside and the third one 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.730
 we throw it, we radically throw it 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.340
 we turn anywhere if you want 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.370
 throw down the table to the public me 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.700
 he will say it is an adjective shot in front and 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.660
 then show in the hands 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:40.010
 look what the inside of the glass installs 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.629
 again on February 30 by art magic good 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.500
 I hope you liked a trick uy 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:50.290
 very good I think fairly well 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.290
 explained very well explained and good
