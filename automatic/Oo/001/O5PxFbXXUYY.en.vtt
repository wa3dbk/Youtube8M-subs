00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.950
 how about dear commission they say now 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.110
 with a new minecraft mode this mod 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.759
 is the former rhythm that brings us this 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.560
 mode this way that will add us is 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.720
 that when we deprive ourselves of the atp 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.790
 the x key on our keyboard we're going to 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.649
 be able to see all the minerals that are in 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.290
 minecraft good if all the minerals 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:31.559
 more easily they are the good they are 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.699
 the emerald of lapis lazuli the diamond 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:38.579
 gold redstone iron and coal 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.019
 and also the network block where I finish 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.559
 to find out and also the block of 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:46.199
 rest when we open the r key 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.879
 we will be able to see again 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.010
 Reston roads as we are seeing 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 this one that is activated and the one that is 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.249
 deactivated the two we will be able to see 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 just like this you have to be repeated from 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.050
 reston and the network comparator are at 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.550
 same since they are the cart with 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.649
 dynamite to the cart I think that equal 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.800
 normal and all types of rails to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.659
 equal of the stone pressure plate 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.310
 let pressure plate stone 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.680
 I did not get confused 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.060
 what adds to us that good we 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.040
 we will be able to see our coordinates 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 that is so good we comment seeing of the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.750
 screen in the upper left 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.549
 are our coordinates ordered that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.710
 are x minus 328 10 65 and z 224 so that 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.420
 this would serve us well because this would be useful for us 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.179
 that when we are playing with 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.280
 another person because yes with our friends 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.079
 with our partners I do not know with whom 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.750
 I'm playing or in the games of 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.179
 hunger 'alike, this is why we become more 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.959
 easy not that I'm in position x 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.330
 minus 326 65 and the whole thing that's most 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.100
 it is added that when we good 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.009
 when night falls we put 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.200
 good when the night falls forgiveness or we 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.630
 let's go to a good cave I'll give a 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.130
 small a small here 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.780
 when we are done at night or 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.070
 let's go to a cave ourselves at the moment 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:08.590
 to put the l key let's put 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.060
 to have more illuminates illuminates city that and 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.550
 well let's be able to see in the dark 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.980
 ok let's be able to see the dark with 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.709
 the l key is something good is one of 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.940
 the easiest ways to install 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.620
 and more functional because we can see the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.840
 minerals we can see in the night 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.519
 we can see all the reston changes 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.319
 so that it would serve us to see the roads 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.160
 of registration because I do not know there is a 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.680
 There are explosions there are dynamite 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.030
 and here in the trap and guarantors and then 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.190
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.840
 review of this mod and we go with the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.030
 installation already had time that did not go up 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.069
 videos are I think I'm going to upload then 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.319
 I will try to raise more more 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.730
 videos and let's go with this lesson and we're going 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.440
 with the installation the first thing we're going 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.390
 to do is go to the links that are in 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.090
 the description of the video the first link 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.010
 do not be directional towards the extreme and 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.900
 Well, he says it's for 1.6 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.340
 points but remember that if you are 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.330
 watching this video for future versions 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.610
 do not worry 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.370
 that is, the link is the good one is updated 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.490
 the link is updated but the mod is the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.770
 same installation of this modem yes but 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.140
 good to download the 1.6 point 2 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.280
 let's go here in the little blue button 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.990
 which says download the most version plus the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.770
 last version the last version is worth 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.800
 for the truth is that he tells me 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.020
 language 042 go we're going to click on it and 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.850
 will direct us to a page of 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.430
 aspla and let's wait five seconds 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.650
 of advertising that always have the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.110
 pages of a flight and we will give 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.510
 jump advertising and automatically if 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.880
 our download does not start once 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.709
 that we unload our engine 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.709
 we will locate where we have it 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.590
 are always in the folder of 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.450
 downloads once already located our mod 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.030
 now we are going with the installation myself 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.740
 I always put it then in this that comes 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.540
 being the desktop so for me to 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.720
 make it easier and simple installation 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.780
 because I already have it located and better 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.910
 and let's go to start xp users 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.170
 here they must appear to execute and 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.150
 we wrote 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.709
 app data percentage we're going roaming 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.560

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.630
 folder sorry to the folder version and 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.000
 here we will see this folder that 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.760
 is alone remember that if you already have 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.400
 as many installed should always 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.550
 have this folder that is 1.6 points 2 or 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.190
 is the most but let's not say it's the 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.290
 cleaner folder that we have that is 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.760

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.950

 we, as you can explain it 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.960
 that we do the installation for 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.760
 first time this file is going to 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.410
 appear in the jota file are for 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.540

 let's give notebook and then we're 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.360
 it opens with the notebook because 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.650
 once we have it say let's give 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.720

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.530
 1.6 points 11 this is deleted from 1.6 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.060
 point 2 and we paste what we already had that 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.690
 is 1.6 points 2 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.400
 ex king script script x minus you this 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.590
 but remember that we must leave 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.150
 these meals because if you are not going to 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.720
 serve our installation we are going to 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.970
 give 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.479
 save file and we close this now 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.090
 let's open our our point and 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.650
 we are going to give right click to open with 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.020
 wilder files do not have to open 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.020
 our point already with windows archiver and 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.970
 because this folder this folder no longer the 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.699
 mansion needs we're going to close and 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.130
 well here we have our point we are going 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:51.560
 to eliminate as always he me time to 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.930
 that we do not grow our minecraft and 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.580
 11 open our way that is this from the ex 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.580
 king mod 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:02.000
 the end is worth we close this and 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.979
 we select everything with control and what 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.599
 we move so easy and simple they are going to 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.150
 give to accept and we already have installed 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.699
 our way as I had told you is a 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.020
 of the facilities of the most mod 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.470
 simple 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.110
 in truth and in truth it helps us to 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.620
 a lot of things like seeing minerals 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.599
 but in the night see et cetera etcetera 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.639
 etcetera since it has not been loaded 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.470
 our minecraft let's who says 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:30.979
 profile and then we will do to whom 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:35.090
 says default and here in edit profiles 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:36.949
 edit profile let's look for the one 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.340
 folder that we did that in this 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:44.720
 case tell 11 points 6.2 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:47.750
 ex x a king let's click on that and you 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.360
 let's give 6 profile and let's give it 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.370
 play off line or do not know you have 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.830
 the original and you are good you 

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.889
 same installation are worth the same thing and 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:05.210
 well let's go to good let's check here 

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:07.039
 well we are going to put and always when 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.349
 recorded with constancy and that happens and as 

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:11.030
 they saw then we already have x because we already have 

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:12.229
 all minerals we can see all 

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.349
 minerals and I hope that I have 

00:08:12.229 --> 00:08:17.030
 served to this facility and if not then 

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:20.590
 Do not hesitate to leave your comment and you liked it
