00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.020
 hi friends my name is Dmitry 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.500
 maxims 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.900
 i'm in the store for this old and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.780
 today we are doing a video review of this 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.320
 wonderful combo who 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.630
 called orange theft model 100 run 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.330
 style and little would be important to mention that 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.190
 this combo is 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.530
 the transistor here is 15 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.380
 inch speaker own 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.900
 orange production and capacity 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.180
 this combo amps 100 watts so 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.080
 consider this amplifier closer 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.440
 what do we have here do we have here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.440
 kane adjustment 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.620
 can get overloaded signal 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:51.840
 then there are two filters the first one is called 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.380
 contour that makes the middle of all 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:17.190
 mids are flatter and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:17.760
 strengthens low and high next 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.890
 filter 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.170
 called presence but this is a classic 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:40.140
 presents increasing gain high 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:44.670
 frequencies farther we go 4-band 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.209
 the equalizer is the high frequency upper 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.230
 middle lower middle and groove and then 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.230
 the pen goes loudly 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.390
 own that regulates the level 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.970
 output signal 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.110
 in the back we have the aux-in linear jack 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.410
 exit and di exit with buttons 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.100
 with post equalizer and ground lift 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.450
 grounding also we have two sockets 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.680
 effects loops meaning you can 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.780
 connect effects pedals to this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.710
 combos u and we have a very 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.490
 comfortable built-in tuner with multi-colored 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.490
 flashing lights 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.830
 With on / off button . 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.780
 amplifier combo amps of this series 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.930
 come in a format of 25 watts 50 and 100 watts as 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.080
 Here on the presented example and with the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.450
 the parties want to add this to me 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.390
 amplifier really liked despite 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.200
 the fact that this is such a transistor they 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.510
 tube amp here is pretty 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.890
 pretty good and high quality he 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.890
 transmits low frequencies 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.830
 read 5 string 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.830
 which is quite rare for most 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.170
 similar 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.720
 combo amps are generally excellent 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.720
 I really liked the option 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.710
 above
