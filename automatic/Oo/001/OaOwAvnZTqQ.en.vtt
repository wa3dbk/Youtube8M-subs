constructive about game design now what

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.890 
constructive about game design now what
an<00:00:13.980> event<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.210> thing<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.450> makes<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
an event is is the thing that makes a

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.410 
an event is is the thing that makes a
game<00:00:16.049> fun<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> play<00:00:16.740> it's<00:00:17.430> something<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.240> can

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
game fun to play it's something that can

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.840 
game fun to play it's something that can
happen<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:19.080> your<00:00:19.260> game<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.859> triggers<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
happen in your game that triggers a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.320 
happen in your game that triggers a
result<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.800> game<00:00:23.150> we're<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.269> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
result so in this game we're going to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.880 
result so in this game we're going to
have<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> bunch<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.960> different<00:00:25.140> events<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
have a bunch of different events and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
have a bunch of different events and
every<00:00:26.670> single<00:00:27.000> event<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.810> broken

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
every single event is going to be broken

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.220 
every single event is going to be broken
up<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.560> two<00:00:28.710> parts<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:29.670> part<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.449> called

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
up in two parts the first part is called

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.510 
up in two parts the first part is called
the<00:00:31.320> condition<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> thing<00:00:32.489> that

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the condition it's the thing that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060 
the condition it's the thing that
happens<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:34.020> second<00:00:34.440> part<00:00:34.649> called<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
happens the second part called the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.760 
happens the second part called the
action<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.940> result<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.540> I'll<00:00:37.500> give<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
action is the result so I'll give you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.060 
action is the result so I'll give you
guys<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> couple<00:00:38.100> examples<00:00:38.480> one<00:00:39.480> example<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
guys a couple examples one example is a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.420 
guys a couple examples one example is a
condition<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.260> pressing<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.800> our

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
condition like pressing down on our

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.850 
condition like pressing down on our
mouse<00:00:44.760> well<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> condition<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.710> is

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
mouse well that's the condition what is

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.709 
mouse well that's the condition what is
the<00:00:47.010> result<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> action<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.270> well<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the result or the action of that well it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
the result or the action of that well it
fires<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.230> bullet<00:00:49.579> alright<00:00:50.579> let's<00:00:50.820> talk<00:00:50.940> about

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
fires a bullet alright let's talk about

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.170 
fires a bullet alright let's talk about
another<00:00:51.390> event<00:00:51.719> arm<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:53.280> condition<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:53.969> be

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
another event arm the condition would be

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
another event arm the condition would be
what<00:00:54.840> happens<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.680> dude<00:00:56.010> our<00:00:56.280> player

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
what happens if the dude our player

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.180 
what happens if the dude our player
comes<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.510> contact<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> monster<00:00:58.530> well

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
comes in contact with the monster well

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.889 
comes in contact with the monster well
the<00:00:59.340> result<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.329> our<00:01:00.600> player

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the result of that would be our player

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.729 
the result of that would be our player
dies<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.879> how<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.899> determine<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.650> he

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
dies so this is how we determine when he

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.969 
dies so this is how we determine when he
shoots<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.339> monster<00:01:05.909> give<00:01:06.390> him<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.659> point<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
shoots a monster give him a point when a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.850 
shoots a monster give him a point when a
monster<00:01:08.340> runs<00:01:08.549> into<00:01:08.880> him<00:01:09.000> he<00:01:09.299> dies<00:01:09.560> once<00:01:10.560> he

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
monster runs into him he dies once he

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.240 
monster runs into him he dies once he
reaches<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> end<00:01:11.640> next<00:01:12.540> level<00:01:13.049> those<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:14.070> all

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
reaches the end next level those are all

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.039 
reaches the end next level those are all
the<00:01:14.460> things<00:01:14.490> Oryx<00:01:15.299> using<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> things

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the things Oryx using all the things

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
the things Oryx using all the things
that<00:01:16.140> make<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> game<00:01:16.770> fun<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.130> play<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
those things are events and all of them

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.780 
those things are events and all of them
we<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> event<00:01:22.110> sheet<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.950> again<00:01:23.220> this

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
we put in the event sheet so again this

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
we put in the event sheet so again this
is<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.090> main<00:01:24.299> layout<00:01:24.659> where<00:01:24.930> were<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
is your main layout where were there you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
is your main layout where were there you
can<00:01:26.220> see<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> tab<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:26.970> top<00:01:27.210> call<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> event

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
can see a tab at the top call it event

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.569 
can see a tab at the top call it event
sheet<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.860> where<00:01:29.159> we're<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> be

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sheet that's where we're going to be

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.630 
sheet that's where we're going to be
making<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.210> brains<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> game<00:01:31.640> now

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.510 
it's not movement what an animation is
is<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.240> bunch<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.570> still<00:01:48.930> images<00:01:49.520> put

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
is just a bunch of still images put

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
is just a bunch of still images put
together<00:01:50.700> rapidly<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.200> look<00:01:52.409> at

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
together rapidly so when you look at

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.859 
together rapidly so when you look at
them<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:53.009> after<00:01:53.369> each<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.729> they<00:01:54.360> look<00:01:54.659> like

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
them one after each other they look like

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
them one after each other they look like
a<00:01:54.930> movement<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.740> video<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.759> actually<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
a movement or video so actually if you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.149 
a movement or video so actually if you
ever<00:01:57.509> watched<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.930> movie<00:01:58.140> there's<00:01:58.829> actually

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
ever watched a movie there's actually

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.910 
ever watched a movie there's actually
about<00:01:59.280> 30<00:01:59.790> images<00:02:00.210> every<00:02:00.960> second<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.590> then

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
about 30 images every second and then

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520 
about 30 images every second and then
once<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.399> play<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.200> together<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.500> looks

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
once they play them on together it looks

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.570 
once they play them on together it looks
like<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.219> videos<00:02:05.549> moving<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.899> again

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
like the videos moving so again

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.339 
like the videos moving so again
animation<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.270> computer<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> little<00:02:10.110> bit

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
animation on a computer is a little bit

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.260 
animation on a computer is a little bit
different<00:02:10.770> than<00:02:10.920> movement<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.640> real<00:02:11.849> life<00:02:12.060> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
different than movement in real life so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.240 
different than movement in real life so
just<00:02:12.300> remember<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.110> also

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
just remember that and also

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.980 
just remember that and also
I<00:02:14.340> know<00:02:14.670> I'm<00:02:14.880> overloading<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.690> guys<00:02:15.810> with

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
I know I'm overloading you guys with

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.600 
I know I'm overloading you guys with
tons<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.260> information<00:02:16.500> right<00:02:16.920> here<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.490> this

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
tons of information right here but this

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.910 
tons of information right here but this
is<00:02:17.820> kind<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.570> important<00:02:18.960> most<00:02:19.620> monitors

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
is kind of important most monitors

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.300 
is kind of important most monitors
computer<00:02:20.700> monitors<00:02:21.150> they<00:02:21.930> refresh<00:02:22.890> their

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
computer monitors they refresh their

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.940 
computer monitors they refresh their
framerate<00:02:23.640> which<00:02:24.060> pretty<00:02:24.270> much<00:02:24.360> means<00:02:24.660> put<00:02:25.410> 60

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
framerate which pretty much means put 60

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
framerate which pretty much means put 60
images<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.090> second<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.610> remember<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.880> you

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
images a second so remember that and you

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
images a second so remember that and you
guys<00:02:30.120> are<00:02:30.210> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.420> see<00:02:30.510> later<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.870> this

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
guys are going to see later in this

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.840 
guys are going to see later in this
video<00:02:31.320> why<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.310> told<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.670> guys<00:02:32.790> that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
video why I just told you guys that

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.530 
video why I just told you guys that
random<00:02:33.390> piece<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.690> information<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.180> first

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
random piece of information so the first

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.300 
random piece of information so the first
thing<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.230> could<00:02:37.380> do<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.830> pretty<00:02:38.070> much

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
thing that we could do is pretty much

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.490 
thing that we could do is pretty much
make<00:02:38.970> well<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.540> don't<00:02:39.870> even<00:02:39.959> know<00:02:40.170> what<00:02:40.350> we're

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
make well I don't even know what we're

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.840 
make well I don't even know what we're
going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.770> let's<00:02:41.040> say<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.550> want<00:02:41.730> to

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
going to do let's say that we want to

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.410 
going to do let's say that we want to
say<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:43.470> did<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> user<00:02:44.310> click<00:02:44.730> with<00:02:45.330> your

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
say is the did the user click with your

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.190 
say is the did the user click with your
mouse<00:02:45.480> if<00:02:45.930> they<00:02:46.140> did<00:02:46.380> fire<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.890> bullet<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:48.200> let's

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
mouse if they did fire a bullet so let's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.590 
mouse if they did fire a bullet so let's
go<00:02:49.320> ahead<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.800> create<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.220> very<00:02:51.000> simple<00:02:51.209> event

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
go ahead and create a very simple event

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.780 
go ahead and create a very simple event
right<00:02:51.750> here<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.230> order<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.770> do<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.160> just

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
right here in order to do that just

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.610 
right here in order to do that just
double<00:02:54.090> click<00:02:54.360> anywhere<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.380> event

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
double click anywhere on this event

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.760 
double click anywhere on this event
sheet<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.720> whenever<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:58.020> do<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.380> adds

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
sheet and whenever you do that it adds

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.560 
sheet and whenever you do that it adds
an<00:02:59.010> event<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.610> anytime<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.180> want<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.390> add<00:03:00.540> a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
an event so anytime you want to add a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.510 
an event so anytime you want to add a
new<00:03:00.780> event<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:01.260> check<00:03:01.920> if<00:03:02.070> something<00:03:02.400> is

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
new event or check if something is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.690 
new event or check if something is
happening<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.570> double<00:03:03.870> click<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.380> now

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
happening just double click and now

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.610 
happening just double click and now
let's<00:03:06.230> go<00:03:07.230> ahead<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.560> tell<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:07.739> right<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:09.620> let

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
let's go ahead and tell it right now let

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.870 
let's go ahead and tell it right now let
me<00:03:10.709> think<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:11.010> an<00:03:11.100> event<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:11.760> do

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
me think of an event that we can do

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.290 
me think of an event that we can do
first<00:03:12.120> let's<00:03:12.570> say<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.959> um<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:14.160> player<00:03:14.580> wants

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
first let's say that um the player wants

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.110 
first let's say that um the player wants
to<00:03:15.420> look<00:03:15.630> at<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.050> mouse<00:03:16.230> okay<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.760> for<00:03:18.000> this

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
to look at the mouse okay so for this

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.420 
to look at the mouse okay so for this
event<00:03:18.450> we<00:03:18.660> actually<00:03:18.959> click<00:03:19.200> system<00:03:20.010> right

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
event we actually click system right

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.940 
event we actually click system right
here<00:03:20.600> because<00:03:21.600> we're<00:03:21.810> not<00:03:21.930> actually<00:03:22.320> testing

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
here because we're not actually testing

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.330 
here because we're not actually testing
um<00:03:24.500> it's<00:03:25.500> kind<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.769> hard<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:25.980> explain<00:03:26.220> right

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
um it's kind of hard to explain right

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.520 
um it's kind of hard to explain right
now<00:03:26.549> but<00:03:26.880> we're<00:03:27.360> not<00:03:27.540> actually<00:03:27.900> checking<00:03:28.290> if

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
now but we're not actually checking if

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.440 
now but we're not actually checking if
something<00:03:28.950> ran<00:03:29.160> into<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.580> monster<00:03:30.000> or<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
something ran into the monster or the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.770 
something ran into the monster or the
player<00:03:30.930> or<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.860> bullet<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.940> we're<00:03:33.450> checking

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
player or the bullet what we're checking

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.410 
player or the bullet what we're checking
for<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.769> if<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.250> person<00:03:36.120> who's<00:03:36.269> playing

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
for is just if the person who's playing

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.810 
for is just if the person who's playing
the<00:03:36.660> game<00:03:36.840> did<00:03:37.560> something<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.549> whenever

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
the game did something so whenever

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.699 
the game did something so whenever
you're<00:03:39.030> getting<00:03:39.150> input<00:03:39.510> from<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.019> player<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
you're getting input from the player the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.009 
you're getting input from the player the
player<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.120> input<00:03:42.450> isn't<00:03:42.690> part<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
player or the input isn't part of the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.100 
player or the input isn't part of the
game<00:03:43.049> it's<00:03:43.410> part<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.890> system<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:45.420> now<00:03:45.720> what

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
game it's part of the system so now what

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.350 
game it's part of the system so now what
exactly<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.799> we<00:03:46.829> want<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.190> check<00:03:47.370> for<00:03:47.430> well

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
exactly do we want to check for well

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.220 
exactly do we want to check for well
what<00:03:48.510> we<00:03:48.630> want<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.930> do<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.320> choose<00:03:49.980> every<00:03:50.820> tick

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
what we want to do is choose every tick

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.479 
what we want to do is choose every tick
right<00:03:52.230> here<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.739> this<00:03:53.610> tick<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.299> basically<00:03:55.489> the

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
right here in this tick is basically the

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.060 
right here in this tick is basically the
framerate<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.540> instead<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.290> having<00:03:58.890> a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
framerate so instead of having a

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.500 
framerate so instead of having a
different<00:03:59.220> frame<00:03:59.670> like<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.120> would<00:04:00.299> in<00:04:00.390> a

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
different frame like you would in a

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.289 
different frame like you would in a
movie<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.930> tick<00:04:01.709> which<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.370> going<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.579> happen<00:04:02.850> 60

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
movie a tick which is going to happen 60

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.600 
movie a tick which is going to happen 60
times<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.690> second<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.079> this<00:04:04.200> game<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.680> pretty

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
times a second in this game is pretty

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.080 
times a second in this game is pretty
much<00:04:05.850> on<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:07.560> frame<00:04:07.829> rate<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.280> game<00:04:08.459> so

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
much on the frame rate of the game so

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.660 
much on the frame rate of the game so
whenever<00:04:09.329> we<00:04:09.570> say<00:04:09.780> check<00:04:10.410> every<00:04:10.890> tick<00:04:11.190> what

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
whenever we say check every tick what

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.920 
whenever we say check every tick what
this<00:04:11.820> is<00:04:11.940> going<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.150> do<00:04:12.329> is<00:04:12.510> it's<00:04:12.720> going<00:04:12.750> to

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
this is going to do is it's going to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.860 
this is going to do is it's going to
check<00:04:13.290> for<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.620> event<00:04:13.950> every<00:04:14.820> 60<00:04:15.510> times<00:04:15.750> a

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
check for this event every 60 times a

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.319 
check for this event every 60 times a
second<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.680> it's<00:04:16.829> pretty<00:04:16.979> much<00:04:17.329> constantly

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
second so it's pretty much constantly

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.380 
second so it's pretty much constantly
waiting<00:04:18.660> for<00:04:19.650> something<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.100> happen<00:04:20.250> well<00:04:21.209> now

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
waiting for something to happen well now

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.159 
waiting for something to happen well now
we<00:04:21.450> got<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.780> give<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.700> other<00:04:23.700> information<00:04:24.390> so

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
we got to give the other information so

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.960 
we got to give the other information so
let's<00:04:25.560> go<00:04:25.950> ahead<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.430> add

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
let's go ahead and add

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.550 
let's go ahead and add
in<00:04:27.030> action<00:04:27.570> here<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:29.400> every<00:04:30.090> second<00:04:30.540> what<00:04:31.440> do

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
in action here so every second what do

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.680 
in action here so every second what do
you<00:04:31.650> want<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.950> do<00:04:32.100> well<00:04:32.880> what<00:04:33.030> we<00:04:33.240> want<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.540> do

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
you want to do well what we want to do

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.520 
you want to do well what we want to do
is<00:04:34.490> have<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.670> player<00:04:36.140> probably<00:04:37.140> click<00:04:37.410> that

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
is have the player probably click that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.160 
is have the player probably click that
to<00:04:37.680> fast<00:04:37.920> have<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.580> player<00:04:38.880> look<00:04:39.720> at<00:04:39.930> where

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
to fast have the player look at where

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.260 
to fast have the player look at where
your<00:04:40.320> mouse<00:04:40.560> is<00:04:40.830> on<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.220> screen<00:04:41.520> so<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.000> way

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
your mouse is on the screen so that way

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.030 
your mouse is on the screen so that way
he<00:04:42.480> can<00:04:42.660> rotate<00:04:42.870> so<00:04:43.410> if<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.650> have<00:04:43.800> it<00:04:43.890> up<00:04:44.010> here

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
he can rotate so if I have it up here

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.100 
he can rotate so if I have it up here
he's<00:04:44.400> going<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.580> be<00:04:44.640> looking<00:04:44.970> up<00:04:45.090> if<00:04:45.390> I<00:04:45.810> have<00:04:45.990> it

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
he's going to be looking up if I have it

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.690 
he's going to be looking up if I have it
down<00:04:46.260> here<00:04:46.290> his<00:04:46.710> gun<00:04:46.920> is<00:04:47.010> going<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.250> be<00:04:47.340> pointed

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
down here his gun is going to be pointed

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.520 
down here his gun is going to be pointed
down<00:04:47.730> pretty<00:04:48.570> much<00:04:48.750> where<00:04:48.990> do<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.140> want<00:04:49.320> the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
down pretty much where do you want the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.290 
down pretty much where do you want the
player<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:49.800> aim<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.370> gun<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.970> might<00:04:51.150> be<00:04:51.270> a

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
player to aim the gun that might be a

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.650 
player to aim the gun that might be a
little<00:04:51.510> bit<00:04:51.720> easier<00:04:52.290> to<00:04:52.440> understand<00:04:52.920> so<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
little bit easier to understand so the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.900 
little bit easier to understand so the
result<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.290> checking<00:04:55.920> this<00:04:56.100> every<00:04:56.430> second<00:04:56.820> is

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
result of checking this every second is

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.140 
result of checking this every second is
the<00:04:57.210> player<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.930> going<00:04:58.710> to<00:04:58.920> perform<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.430> certain

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
the player is going to perform a certain

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.660 
the player is going to perform a certain
action<00:05:00.390> well<00:05:01.200> what's<00:05:01.380> he<00:05:01.470> going<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.710> do<00:05:01.860> well

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
action well what's he going to do well

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.940 
action well what's he going to do well
it's<00:05:02.880> actually<00:05:03.090> some<00:05:03.720> of<00:05:03.750> these<00:05:03.870> names<00:05:04.680> are

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
it's actually some of these names are

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.120 
it's actually some of these names are
weird<00:05:05.570> but<00:05:06.570> what<00:05:06.720> we<00:05:06.870> want<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.110> do<00:05:07.290> is<00:05:07.500> set

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
weird but what we want to do is set

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.050 
weird but what we want to do is set
angle<00:05:08.550> towards<00:05:09.360> position<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.820> whenever<00:05:11.820> we

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
angle towards position and whenever we

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.960 
angle towards position and whenever we
double<00:05:12.300> click<00:05:12.510> that<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.900> says<00:05:13.110> okay<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:14.580> every

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
double click that it says okay so every

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.450 
double click that it says okay so every
second<00:05:15.450> look<00:05:16.080> at<00:05:16.320> where<00:05:16.530> your<00:05:16.650> mouse<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:17.190> and

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
second look at where your mouse is and

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.930 
second look at where your mouse is and
set<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.690> player<00:05:19.380> pointing<00:05:20.040> his<00:05:20.220> gun<00:05:20.310> in<00:05:20.669> this

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
set the player pointing his gun in this

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.480 
set the player pointing his gun in this
position<00:05:21.480> so<00:05:22.230> now<00:05:22.260> we<00:05:22.530> have<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.890> give<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.130> an<00:05:23.250> x

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
position so now we have to give it an x

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.950 
position so now we have to give it an x
and<00:05:23.700> y<00:05:23.790> coordinate<00:05:24.240> where<00:05:24.540> it's<00:05:24.660> pretty<00:05:24.840> much

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
and y coordinate where it's pretty much

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.040 
and y coordinate where it's pretty much
saying<00:05:25.230> okay<00:05:25.650> well<00:05:26.280> what<00:05:26.790> angle<00:05:27.210> do<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:27.840> want

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
saying okay well what angle do you want

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.470 
saying okay well what angle do you want
the<00:05:28.169> player<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.410> point<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.070> gun<00:05:29.120> well<00:05:30.120> for<00:05:30.360> the

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
the player to point the gun well for the

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.230 
the player to point the gun well for the
x<00:05:30.690> coordinate<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:31.460> this<00:05:32.460> is<00:05:32.640> it's<00:05:32.940> kind<00:05:33.180> of

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
x coordinate and this is it's kind of

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.000 
x coordinate and this is it's kind of
helpful<00:05:33.480> if<00:05:33.720> you<00:05:33.840> know<00:05:34.020> programming<00:05:34.770> or

helpful if you know programming or
JavaScript<00:05:35.580> particular<00:05:36.560> what<00:05:37.560> we're<00:05:37.680> going

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
JavaScript particular what we're going

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.830 
JavaScript particular what we're going
to<00:05:37.860> do<00:05:38.040> is<00:05:38.160> put<00:05:38.400> mouse<00:05:38.640> X<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.510> hit<00:05:39.960> enter<00:05:40.260> and

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
to do is put mouse X and hit enter and

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.270 
to do is put mouse X and hit enter and
for<00:05:42.840> Y<00:05:42.990> just<00:05:43.050> hit<00:05:43.590> mouse<00:05:43.890> Y<00:05:44.310> and<00:05:45.680> hit<00:05:46.680> done<00:05:47.010> and

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
for Y just hit mouse Y and hit done and

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.490 
for Y just hit mouse Y and hit done and
now<00:05:47.370> it's<00:05:48.360> probably<00:05:48.780> going<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.080> be<00:05:49.140> really

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
now it's probably going to be really

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.580 
now it's probably going to be really
easy<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:50.100> see<00:05:50.310> if<00:05:50.460> you<00:05:50.580> just<00:05:50.610> read<00:05:51.000> this<00:05:51.590> so

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
easy to see if you just read this so

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.650 
easy to see if you just read this so
again<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:53.280> first<00:05:53.520> thing<00:05:53.729> right<00:05:53.880> here<00:05:54.090> system

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
again this first thing right here system

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.650 
again this first thing right here system
is<00:05:54.840> pretty<00:05:54.990> much<00:05:55.110> saying<00:05:55.320> okay<00:05:56.030> from<00:05:57.030> the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
is pretty much saying okay from the

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.840 
is pretty much saying okay from the
computer<00:05:58.169> or<00:05:58.350> you<00:05:58.979> know<00:05:59.100> whatever<00:05:59.400> thing

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
computer or you know whatever thing

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.130 
computer or you know whatever thing
you're<00:05:59.970> running<00:06:00.120> this<00:06:00.390> on<00:06:00.570> your<00:06:00.780> phone<00:06:00.930> or

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
you're running this on your phone or

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.740 
you're running this on your phone or
whatever<00:06:01.520> every<00:06:02.520> single<00:06:02.850> tick<00:06:03.150> which<00:06:03.450> is

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
whatever every single tick which is

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.780 
whatever every single tick which is
pretty<00:06:04.110> much<00:06:04.200> equal<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.770> constantly<00:06:05.310> so

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
pretty much equal to constantly so

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
pretty much equal to constantly so
constantly<00:06:06.479> check<00:06:06.900> for<00:06:08.150> where<00:06:09.150> your<00:06:09.390> mouse<00:06:09.570> is

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
constantly check for where your mouse is

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.990 
constantly check for where your mouse is
the<00:06:10.020> X&amp;Y<00:06:10.380> coordinates<00:06:11.250> of<00:06:11.370> your<00:06:11.400> mouse<00:06:11.669> and

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
the X&amp;Y coordinates of your mouse and

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.070 
the X&amp;Y coordinates of your mouse and
set<00:06:12.660> the<00:06:12.780> angle<00:06:13.229> of<00:06:13.410> your<00:06:13.650> player<00:06:14.570> towards<00:06:15.570> the

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
set the angle of your player towards the

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.860 
set the angle of your player towards the
mouse<00:06:16.290> so<00:06:16.890> it's<00:06:17.160> probably<00:06:17.550> really<00:06:17.940> easy<00:06:18.090> if<00:06:18.300> I

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
mouse so it's probably really easy if I

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.740 
mouse so it's probably really easy if I
just<00:06:19.050> show<00:06:19.200> you<00:06:19.260> guys<00:06:19.350> so<00:06:20.190> right<00:06:20.400> now<00:06:20.580> if<00:06:21.330> I<00:06:21.540> put

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
just show you guys so right now if I put

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.560 
just show you guys so right now if I put
my<00:06:21.900> mouse<00:06:22.110> up<00:06:22.380> it's<00:06:23.100> constantly<00:06:23.880> refreshing

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
my mouse up it's constantly refreshing

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.719 
my mouse up it's constantly refreshing
and<00:06:24.720> saying<00:06:24.930> okay<00:06:25.320> set<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.070> angle<00:06:26.490> of<00:06:26.669> that

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
and saying okay set the angle of that

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.820 
and saying okay set the angle of that
player<00:06:27.450> and<00:06:27.810> have<00:06:28.050> them<00:06:28.140> point<00:06:28.350> towards<00:06:28.710> the

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
player and have them point towards the

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.000 
player and have them point towards the
mouse<00:06:28.979> and<00:06:30.140> even<00:06:31.140> though<00:06:31.260> it<00:06:31.410> looks<00:06:31.590> like<00:06:31.740> one

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
mouse and even though it looks like one

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.250 
mouse and even though it looks like one
continual<00:06:32.610> motion<00:06:33.060> this<00:06:33.570> is<00:06:33.630> actually

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
continual motion this is actually

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.850 
continual motion this is actually
checking<00:06:34.760> 60<00:06:35.760> times<00:06:36.030> every<00:06:36.599> second<00:06:37.110> so

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
checking 60 times every second so

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.559 
checking 60 times every second so
therefore

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
therefore

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.070 
therefore
you<00:06:40.169> know<00:06:40.289> we<00:06:40.469> could<00:06:40.889> set<00:06:41.129> it<00:06:41.219> like<00:06:41.580> um<00:06:42.080> just

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
you know we could set it like um just

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.989 
you know we could set it like um just
like<00:06:43.559> once<00:06:43.919> every<00:06:44.219> second<00:06:44.550> but<00:06:44.699> then<00:06:44.849> he's

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:44.999 
like once every second but then he's

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.489 
like once every second but then he's
going<00:06:45.119> to<00:06:45.179> be<00:06:45.300> all<00:06:45.389> jerky<00:06:45.839> so<00:06:46.080> that's<00:06:46.259> why<00:06:46.439> I

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.499 
going to be all jerky so that's why I

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.909 
going to be all jerky so that's why I
want<00:06:46.979> to<00:06:47.069> teach<00:06:47.279> you<00:06:47.399> guys<00:06:47.490> about<00:06:47.550> ticks<00:06:48.119> and

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
want to teach you guys about ticks and

how to pretty much make a very basic

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.529 
how to pretty much make a very basic

tutorials we have to add a bunch more
events<00:07:09.569> like<00:07:09.659> what<00:07:10.319> happens<00:07:10.649> when<00:07:10.830> a<00:07:10.889> bullet

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:11.159 
events like what happens when a bullet

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.549 
events like what happens when a bullet
shoots<00:07:11.729> a<00:07:11.909> monster<00:07:12.389> what<00:07:13.020> happens<00:07:13.349> when<00:07:13.529> a

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:13.559 
shoots a monster what happens when a
