00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
 the editorial 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.840
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.240
 look at 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.929
 I'll show you a little hedge today 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.109
 flower 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.150
 I crocheted them on the grammys 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.939
 also be explained in the channel 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 i use it for junghans wool 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:35.610
 the grande the 100 grams up and new ones 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:39.590
 and the 100 grams running 60 meters me 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.180
 use crochet hook number 10 and 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.180
 start with a threadbare ring 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.770
 So send a sling with you 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.040
 the needle and go through the thread 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.790
 then crochet an additional air mass 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.900
 and in this ring now six fixed ones 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.900
 people work 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.960
 slightly tighten the ring and in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.310
 the world's first solid mass a kit 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:29.100
 crochet crochet and then the ring polens 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:32.190
 contract two air most 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 work and in the first solid mass 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.820
 So where synonymous where the kit mesh 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.580
 was stung 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.460
 two mixed sticks together 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.280
 Crochet each an envelope a 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.979
 sting paths and get the thread through 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.770
 two loops then pull the stitches 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.610
 do together, and does so again two 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 air masses in the same injection point 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.069
 again a kick mesh the first 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.390
 flowers flat is ready now in the 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:07.200
 second solid mesh again a kippa 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:12.540
 two air masses 2 mixed together 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.800
 rod this mix together again 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.799
 and make two air and finally 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.120
 the kit mesh and the second 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:28.320
 petal finished and so every solid 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.680
 musher with a chain two air masses 2 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.980
 blended chopsticks again 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.980
 make two air masses and one kick 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.140
 Now we are at the last petal 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:27.960
 We are closing the round with 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.960
 a carriage in the first solid mass 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.720
 and then cut the thread 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.190
 pull through from behind a sting in 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.280
 the same puncture site and the thread 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.510
 by picking 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.510
 finished is the little flower 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.180
 I wish you much fun with it
