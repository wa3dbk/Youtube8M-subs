00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.420 

okay<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:01.740> what<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.220> autosomal<00:00:03.000> gene<00:00:03.330> linkage

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay so what is autosomal gene linkage

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.559 
okay so what is autosomal gene linkage
before<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.520> can<00:00:05.700> start<00:00:05.910> regarding<00:00:06.359> all<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
before we can start regarding all the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.190 
before we can start regarding all the
simple<00:00:06.930> definitions<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.840> autosomes<00:00:09.840> and

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
simple definitions that of autosomes and

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.400 
simple definitions that of autosomes and
linkage<00:00:10.530> group<00:00:12.080> autosomes<00:00:13.080> are<00:00:13.290> all

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
linkage group autosomes are all

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.930 
linkage group autosomes are all
chromosomes<00:00:14.009> which<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.400> not<00:00:14.580> sex

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
chromosomes which are not sex

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.660 
chromosomes which are not sex
chromosomes<00:00:15.770> linkage<00:00:16.770> group<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.250> group<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
chromosomes linkage group a group of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.640 
chromosomes linkage group a group of
genes<00:00:17.910> whose<00:00:18.570> loci<00:00:19.050> are<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> same

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
genes whose loci are on the same

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.029 
genes whose loci are on the same
chromosome<00:00:20.810> now<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.439> sorted

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
chromosome now that we got that sorted

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:33.760 
chromosome now that we got that sorted
out<00:00:23.130> let's<00:00:24.060> start<00:00:24.590> with<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> explanation

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.010 

okay<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> basic<00:00:36.300> assumption<00:00:36.780> that

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
okay so we have a basic assumption that

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.529 
okay so we have a basic assumption that
a<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:38.180> b<00:00:39.180> b<00:00:39.320> that<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:43.550> produces<00:00:44.550> gamete<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
a a b b that is this produces gamete of

00:00:45.539 --> 00:01:01.540 
a a b b that is this produces gamete of
four<00:00:45.809> types<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> equal<00:00:46.559> proportions

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.000 

right<00:01:03.470> but<00:01:05.540> there's<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> big<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
right but there's a big what if in the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.890 
right but there's a big what if in the
middle<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:11.210> we<00:01:12.210> know<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.450> each

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
middle of it we know that each

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.609 
middle of it we know that each
chromosome<00:01:13.350> holds<00:01:14.190> numerous<00:01:14.670> genes<00:01:15.380> what<00:01:16.380> if

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
chromosome holds numerous genes what if

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:28.510 
chromosome holds numerous genes what if
the<00:01:16.920> two<00:01:17.130> genes<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:19.430> B

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.050 

are<00:01:28.609> held<00:01:29.450> on<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.049> same<00:01:30.320> chromosome<00:01:31.060> we

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
are held on the same chromosome we

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:54.370 
are held on the same chromosome we
realize<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:33.079> a<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:34.509> B<00:01:36.039> could<00:01:37.039> be<00:01:40.509> this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.920 

and<00:01:54.530> at<00:01:55.220> meiosis<00:01:56.979> each<00:01:57.979> pair<00:01:58.430> of<00:01:58.460> homologous

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
and at meiosis each pair of homologous

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.090 
and at meiosis each pair of homologous
chromosomes<00:01:59.930> separate<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.560> one<00:02:00.740> from<00:02:00.950> each

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
chromosomes separate and one from each

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.910 
chromosomes separate and one from each
pair<00:02:01.369> goes<00:02:01.580> into<00:02:01.880> each<00:02:02.030> gamete<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.590> basically

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
pair goes into each gamete so basically

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:21.130 
pair goes into each gamete so basically
becomes<00:02:04.250> like<00:02:04.430> this

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.550 

their<00:02:21.740> gametes<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.280> course
