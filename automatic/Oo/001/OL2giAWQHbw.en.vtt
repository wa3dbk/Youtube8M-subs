00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.830

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.110
 Well, if we must, then we must wait 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.809

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.719
 dangerous and now gusto players also 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.280
 dwell with us in the same universe 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.170
 versioning for mac os allowed 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.160
 developers to optimize elite on 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.560
 both platforms 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.720
 after all, we will see changes together with 1.3 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.390
 One important change in 1.3 will be 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.040
 change the mode of operation of the turret first 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.560
 they will interact with groups 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.530
 weapons and turrets in an inactive group 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.540
 weapons will not shoot in the second 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.759
 changed the mode of the turret mode 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.860
 only the goal is now possible 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.920
 shoot a turret working in this 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.450
 mode, thereby starting the attack 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.549
 the trills will continue to attack the target until those 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.530
 until the sensors are lost or reduced 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.770
 or will not change the active group 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.420
 arming the third change turret in 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.950
 fire mode on alert no longer 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.799
 will be able to commit crimes 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.929
 they will check on their own 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.420
 using the onboard computer is 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.069
 their target is wanted or not and do not shoot 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.929
 on purpose if it triggers new 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.490
 the crime 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.700
 any ships accidentally caught 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.350
 line of fire and will attack you back 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.360
 small tours or will be faster 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.700
 tracks a goal rather than a big one 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.429
 will allow to attack or more successfully smaller ones 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.170
 ships in general developers are extremely 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.329
 want to diversify the game with 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.820
 turrets also see how they have it 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.649

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.909
 see the developers next if 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.090
 the result of the collision is damaged only 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.729
 shield performance no if damaged 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.840
 the body is then imposed fine if 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.000
 ship destroyed 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.430
