 hello the mysteries life 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.410
 I'm going to talk to you about something that I 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.420
 will you notice on my matt book 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.420
 because yes I did my homework 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.660
 and am I going to talk to state 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.430
 exercises they have inside 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.590
 which are suitable 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.090
 original one game opposes two players 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.490
 pedro and hippolyte 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.030
 we throw four times a piece well 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.400
 balanced if the result is ppppp 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.430
 so pedro wins if the result is 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.330
 ffpb then hippolyte wins if we get 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.650
 another result 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.650
 then there is no winner 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.470
