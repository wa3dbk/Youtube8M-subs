god<00:00:24.920> we've<00:00:25.580> added<00:00:26.060> anything<00:00:26.450> we're<00:00:27.020> just

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050

we're<00:00:27.529> just<00:00:27.680> cruising<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.010> other<00:00:28.099> only<00:00:28.689> they

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
got the snow pretty hard and probably

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.479 
got the snow pretty hard and probably
thought<00:00:33.380> maybe<00:00:33.620> we'd<00:00:33.830> connect<00:00:34.100> up<00:00:34.220> the<00:00:34.280> heated

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
thought maybe we'd connect up the heated

windshield<00:00:34.670> today's<00:00:35.150> we<00:00:35.270> hadn't<00:00:35.480> done<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:35.660> yet

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840

I'm<00:00:36.770> figuring<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:37.400> know<00:00:38.239> we<00:00:38.390> won't<00:00:38.480> need<00:00:38.690> that

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
I'm figuring you know we won't need that

I'm figuring you know we won't need that
the<00:00:40.820> problem<00:00:41.239> is<00:00:42.160> we<00:00:43.160> have<00:00:43.190> four<00:00:43.519> circuits<00:00:43.940> and

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
the problem is we have four circuits and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.360 
the problem is we have four circuits and
a<00:00:44.809> heck<00:00:45.110> of<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.350> lot<00:00:45.470> electrical<00:00:45.890> devices<00:00:46.129> in

we<00:01:48.999> now<00:01:49.119> have<00:01:49.359> heated<00:01:49.659> windshields<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:50.079> there

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
we now have heated windshields in there

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.779 
we now have heated windshields in there
online<00:01:50.469> however<00:01:51.159> they're<00:01:51.399> on<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.609> same

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.830 
circuit into the wipers so if the wafer
stopped<00:01:54.399> working<00:01:54.789> we'll<00:01:54.969> know<00:01:55.149> it's<00:01:55.509> because

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840
