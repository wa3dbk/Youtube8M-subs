runner<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:39.870> pretty<00:00:40.110> unique<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.649> does

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
runner that's pretty unique and does

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.830

endless runner as you get further and

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.449 
endless runner as you get further and
further<00:04:01.360> yeah<00:04:02.770> objects<00:04:03.770> that<00:04:04.100> you<00:04:04.220> got<00:04:04.370> to

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
further yeah objects that you got to

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.580 
further yeah objects that you got to
dodge<00:04:04.640> do<00:04:05.120> get<00:04:05.300> a<00:04:05.420> lot<00:04:05.660> more<00:04:05.870> difficult

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590
