they're<00:05:20.000> so<00:05:20.800> wildly<00:05:21.800> different<00:05:23.080> that<00:05:24.080> there's

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
they're so wildly different that there's

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.740 
they're so wildly different that there's
never<00:05:24.470> any<00:05:24.770> any<00:05:25.130> fear<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:25.760> that<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.660> then

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
never any any fear of that and then

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.990 
never any any fear of that and then
we've<00:05:26.870> got<00:05:27.020> great<00:05:27.289> stuff<00:05:27.500> like<00:05:27.710> netflix<00:05:28.280> which

something<00:06:55.460> oh<00:06:55.550> yeah<00:06:55.970> I<00:06:56.000> mean<00:06:56.360> I<00:06:56.450> hope<00:06:56.660> so<00:06:57.020> I've

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
something oh yeah I mean I hope so I've

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.460 
something oh yeah I mean I hope so I've
just<00:06:57.680> done<00:06:57.890> a<00:06:58.090> show<00:06:59.260> for<00:07:00.260> BBC<00:07:00.440> one<00:07:02.350> which<00:07:03.350> I

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
just done a show for BBC one which I

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.710 
just done a show for BBC one which I
can't<00:07:03.500> actually<00:07:03.890> talk<00:07:04.310> about<00:07:04.700> at<00:07:05.240> the<00:07:05.360> minute

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
can't actually talk about at the minute

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.910 
can't actually talk about at the minute
but<00:07:06.050> it's<00:07:06.380> uh<00:07:06.800> I<00:07:07.870> think<00:07:08.870> that<00:07:09.110> that<00:07:09.710> might<00:07:09.890> be

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920 
but it's uh I think that that might be

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.220 
but it's uh I think that that might be
on<00:07:10.160> in<00:07:10.280> Germany<00:07:10.600> that<00:07:11.600> might<00:07:11.780> come<00:07:11.960> on<00:07:12.110> in

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230 
on in Germany that might come on in

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.470 
on in Germany that might come on in
Germany<00:07:12.440> and<00:07:12.890> then<00:07:13.640> hopefully<00:07:13.940> fingers

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480 
Germany and then hopefully fingers

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.220 
Germany and then hopefully fingers
crossed

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230 
crossed

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.930 
crossed
