 a back to school to propose you 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 three lench to take away for school or 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.889
 at work no matter I think that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.960
 it's a good idea to show you some 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.400
 healthy little recipes won because 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960
 that finally we do not always have 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.630
 the opportunity to eat healthy 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.340
 the first recipe is a wrap of the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.859
 spring you will have obviously posing 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 wrap of cucumbers of annette of 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 trout or cottage cheese salmon or 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.429
 whipping cheese or saint moret and for 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.160
 the dessert of some cut fruits 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.710
 tired of the melon I come to take a wrap 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 and I just spread it with 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 madam loÃ¯k obviously you put the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.410
 ingredients that you want following your 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 tastes you can adapt the recipes 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.550
 I then add the slices of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.140
 salmon personally I do not eat anymore 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.750
 of people so here I chose the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.789
 to fish I take my 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.610
 cucumber and jean cut some fine 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.960
 slices to add some crunch to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.000
 to strike the colors 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.710
 together are just gorgeous when 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.870
 you have something colorful and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.899
 Pretty, it really makes you want to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 to eat better I then add 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.260
 dill because it all gets married 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.260
 really good together 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.070
 and now I just roll 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.540
 my rap you can make one two 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.060
 three or even four if you are 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.700
 big eat me personally only one 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.950
 I'm enough I cut the mud and I 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.530
 cut in half that allows me to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.090
 transport much more easily and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.180
 then in another little bowl I come 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.530
 add the melon is really 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.630
 a way of eating fruit 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 simply and then here's cut them in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.350
 little tips you take some Kurds 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.300
 years and it makes you your lunch 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.290
 that's all for the first young I 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.330
 sometimes add little bits of 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.110
 cucumbers when really I find that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.110
 it's not enough 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.160
 second recipe I love over 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.980
 I think it's my favorite 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.870
 it's really the food is sports 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.070
 is going to need some good pasta 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.010
 personally months of paws 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.620
 tomato colors of olive pesto and 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.640
 feta for dessert will include a 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.110
 small mixture of seeds 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.090
 I come to boil some water 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 simply in a saucepan and cook 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.620
 my paws as usual 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.490
 1 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.500
 I then pour the paws into a 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:31.060
 little tupperware or a lunch box like 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.650
 you have on hand 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.000
 personally me it was in my 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.189
 new apartment so I did not have 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.930
 great thing I then cut small 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.230
 cherry tomatoes find that so much more 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.409
 delicious more tasted sweeter and I 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.269
 so put them on to do a lot 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.900
 of colors I do the same thing with 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.900
 black olives 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.900
 I then add a small spoon to 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.069
 pesto soup besides I made a 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.010
 task I do not know if you have 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.959
 noticed but do not make fun of it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.430
 I am a disaster in this 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.870
 which concerns the tasks tell me that I 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.170
 I'm not the only one I add you 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.599
 of feta and that's my little salad is 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.110
 finished ready-to-wear and especially with 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.209
 taste I'm fine added some 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.920
 small seeds with goji 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.470
 raisins I find it really 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.019
 good for dessert or years lake for the 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.150
 day not to be abused 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.190
 obviously like everything but frankly 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.299
 it's a lot more 5 of the bars of 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.739
 chocolate or whatever, and 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.930
 this is our second recipe is already 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.930
 finished we go flat third 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.720
 last recipe but not least 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.480
 a little sandwich bedji you'll have 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.280
 need full bread from the uby carrots 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.160
 of cheese everything was once again 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.209
 of lemon chives cucumber yoghurt 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.650
 Greek and mute crispy sli 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.690
 to start I put little baby 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.630
 carrots in a tupperware that's coming 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.700
 accompany sandwich game sandwich tartine 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.859
 origin of bread the full bread I 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.700
 find it really better and that's 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.790
 better for health 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.620
 so instead of eating dry bread from 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.150
 dry bread anything white bread 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.729
 I prefer to take bread with seeds 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.060
 or whole bread I add small 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:25.340
 cucumbers a trickle of lemon juice and 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.340
 chives on 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.710
 the combo the wedding is done perfectly 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.060
 so if you are a big eater 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.740
 do not tell me that may not have you 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.470
 not enough you can add the 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.310
 meat of teeth or salmon like you 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.800
 prefer it 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.449
 and that's our sandwich is cut in 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.520
 two and beautiful it really gives 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.770

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.020

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.610
 endless for dessert we come 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.580
 take a small Greek yoghurt 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.840

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.470

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.880
 I put granola on it and it's already 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.970
