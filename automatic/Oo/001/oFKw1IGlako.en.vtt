where I'm gonna be after I finish the
2.0<00:05:07.320> training<00:05:07.710> guide<00:05:07.830> because<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.639> think<00:05:09.060> that

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
2.0 training guide because I think that

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.060 
2.0 training guide because I think that
the<00:05:09.419> transformation<00:05:10.080> is<00:05:10.260> going<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.740> be<00:05:10.830> crazy

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
the transformation is going to be crazy

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.800 
the transformation is going to be crazy
and<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.850> can't<00:05:11.910> wait<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.270> share<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.570> with<00:05:12.690> you

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
and I can't wait to share it with you

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.540 
and I can't wait to share it with you
all<00:05:12.840> now<00:05:13.440> as<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.830> was<00:05:13.949> saying<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.250> number<00:05:14.460> on

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
all now as I was saying the number on

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.890 
all now as I was saying the number on
the<00:05:14.610> scale<00:05:14.789> doesn't<00:05:15.090> mean<00:05:15.180> much<00:05:15.449> to<00:05:15.630> me<00:05:15.750> I

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
the scale doesn't mean much to me I

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.110 
the scale doesn't mean much to me I
really<00:05:16.410> think<00:05:16.710> that<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.220> percent<00:05:17.729> of<00:05:17.910> body

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
really think that the percent of body

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.330 
really think that the percent of body
fat<00:05:18.389> that<00:05:18.449> I've<00:05:18.750> lost<00:05:19.020> matters<00:05:19.620> most<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.250> I'd

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
fat that I've lost matters most and I'd

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.370 
fat that I've lost matters most and I'd
never<00:05:20.639> measured<00:05:21.419> that<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:21.840> I<00:05:21.900> kinda<00:05:22.260> wanna

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
never measured that and I kinda wanna

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.749 
never measured that and I kinda wanna
start<00:05:22.590> measuring<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:22.979> now<00:05:23.190> so<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.400> might<00:05:23.610> go

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
start measuring that now so I might go

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.540 
start measuring that now so I might go
see<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.449> nutritionist<00:05:25.080> or<00:05:25.289> a<00:05:25.650> trainer<00:05:26.130> at<00:05:26.520> my

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
see a nutritionist or a trainer at my

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.219 
see a nutritionist or a trainer at my
gym<00:05:26.639> or<00:05:26.970> something<00:05:27.000> cuz<00:05:27.539> I<00:05:27.599> think<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:28.020> counts

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
gym or something cuz I think that counts

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.560 
gym or something cuz I think that counts
more<00:05:28.590> so<00:05:29.099> that<00:05:29.280> is<00:05:29.490> my<00:05:29.699> latest<00:05:29.940> update<00:05:30.360> video
