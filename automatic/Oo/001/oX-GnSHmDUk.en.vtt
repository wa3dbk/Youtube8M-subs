00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.360
 hello is on the air another picture of the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 nutrition program and is a 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.529
 pleasure is every week with you 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.900
 Today 's theme is very interesting is 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.079
 combined oven which is a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.369
 wonder in terms of taste quality and 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.070
 healthy life 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.579
 the combined fire it is capable of grilling 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.570
 the water bath gratin gratin and a lot 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.030
 more things 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.030
 this is all automatically controlled 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.199
 this as a cooking 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.539
 it may be well past badly spent and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.149
 to the point and still with several 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.120
 food at the same time this is not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.859
 miracle people is pure technology 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.170
 the combined oven it works 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.850
 combining his name there with air 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.680
 hot and dry steam 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.110
 this combination is controlled by a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.090
 computer that exists in it all it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.370
 receives information and sensors 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.370
 distributed within the coercive chamber 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.880
 now I'll tell you a bit about the history of 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.240
 How it all began 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 This started in Germany. 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.579
 researchers the neca technologists of 1970 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.409
 there is an evolution of the forums of 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.509
 convention and incentives 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 the first models were complicated 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.640
 to use yet is very worthwhile for 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.130
 cause of energy saving the quality of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.439
 the taste of food the quality of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.799
 own corruption and the speed of 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.799
 cooking 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.200
 this made them quickly 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.360
 conquer the space in the kitchens 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.070
 conventional and commercial 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.259
 over time it was becoming 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.960
 easier and more accessible but still 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.250
 still a bit expensive, it allows 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.259
 that we can cook 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.420
 concomitantly several types of 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.940
 food like rice beans meat 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.280
 vegetables all at the same time as in 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.010
 combined with the production of steam and 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.170
 cleans with this does not change the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.360
 taste of the food each one stays with the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.100
 its aroma and quality taste 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.230
 they do not mix keeping their 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:35.720
 taste and its nutrients 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:38.030
 another important advantage is 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.910
 possible you make breaded foods 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.400
 in fat you can make french fries 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.069
 a gray breaded steak a drop of 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.200
 guru and gets crunchy tasty 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.600
 besides decreasing the amount of eyes 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.090
 healthier foods 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.910
 cooking with a combination of heat 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.130
 and dry heat is fascinating and if the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.590
 state- of-the-art technology with this 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.600
 cooking process , the meat keeps its 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.329
 characteristics makes them 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.450
 succulents inside and golden by photo 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.459
 with this technology to the result of 20 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.860
 per cent of the losses of 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:20.720
 raw material because in this function at 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.390
 moment the camera of corruption receives 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.640
 unit and thus the meats are not received 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.760
 as in traditional processes plus one 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.390
 Did I mention it's possible for you to cook? 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.430
 vegetables meats of all kinds chicken 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.640
 fish caught without favors 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.500
 semester because it 's every moment happens 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.500
 an air renewal inside the camera 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.680
 important is an accessory that comes with the 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.390
 binary format is the core sensor with 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.210
 which is the temperature control 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.160
 within the load allowing a connection 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.560
 perfect because with him it is possible 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.660
 control the temperature where it does not 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.970
 from the point she does not receive or not 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.340
 stay raw and she also does not lose her 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.050
 taste and weight in the same way as it is 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.770
 possible to prevent it from becoming raw 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.170
 inside 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.480
 so look how important it is to avoid 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.700
 proliferation of bacteria who were the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.769
 you normally assume the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.870
 less than 30 percent of the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.049
 its size does not happen in the oven 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.049
 Combined 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.010
 The combined oven also allows 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.900
 ready and semi-prepared foods are 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.820
 regenerated because it maintains its 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.060
 features and original properties 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.920
 without drying out and also leaving deposits 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.360
 water in the dish or any other 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.580
 container with food is 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.970
 condition in this function is possible 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.120
 reprogram or program a function of 5 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.250
 to 50 percent the regeneration of food 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.230
 What are you using depending on this? 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.230
 of the need for each food is not 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.120
 all that I'm talking about 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.640
 You are to tell me to enlighten you. 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.800
 is here in the house of silva we use only 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.600
 combined furnace for the preparation 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.880
 we prepared a banquet the dishes 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.420
 combined that comes out on delivery and 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.250
 more 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.920
 I think you've all noticed the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.330
 difference in taste of quality and 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.330
 nutrients they maintain is 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.369
 I'm here with the boss and vanderson da 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.649
 He's going to show you guys house. 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:34.199
 some dishes in the combined oven roll 

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:35.939
 all good with it already told you I will 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.959
 kill the game benefit of having an oven 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.969
 combined right? 

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:40.860
 I'm going to prepare some dishes today. 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.469
 Specific you are a little lamb 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.699
 It is a traditional dish from our 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.159
 menu here right? 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.479
 while the preface dish will take time 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.479
 for others for you 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.680
 now you 're going to prepare our famous kibbe 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.050
 raw and look I was for you it's meat 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.240
 raw but it's reliable we make a 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.800
 I will prepare a sepsis on the spot for 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.539
 you can do the preparation and you have a 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.060
 confidence to consume 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.580
 as all our products are doing 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.620
 all at fresh time to ensure the 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.960
 quality and customer trust 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.080
 also in case they are making a chemical 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.400
 duckling the fresh meat has just been 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.819
 ground 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.909
 makes a good quality little girl one aspect 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:31.419
 very beautiful this coloration ensures that 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:36.240
 the product is fresh giving even more 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.240
 more original flavor the meat, right? 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.789
 this nutritionally speaking dish is 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:47.249
 fantastic that it is rich in iron 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:50.009
 This avoids sent to anyone with 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:52.559
 anemia is very good and I served Indian with 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.329
 the disappearance of it along with a vitamin c a 

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:57.239
 little orange suquinho de limÃ£o 

00:06:54.329 --> 00:07:06.329
 Cashew but any amount guava 

00:06:57.239 --> 00:07:08.969
 also our lamb in the oven is already 

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:12.829
 almost leaving the almost ready hour to

 the good of all this you see that he is 

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:22.799
 golden on the outside but inside juicy 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.719
 it's delicious 

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:27.719
 Look, people give even the desire to have a 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:30.269
 I'm at home, but I still can not 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:32.849
 they are capacity for restaurant 

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:35.009

 fought until the next program 

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.170
 Hey
