hmm ok I i get this Brucie I get that

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.440 
hmm ok I i get this Brucie I get that
hop<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.550> it's<00:03:20.730> got<00:03:21.730> more<00:03:22.030> of<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.330> hop

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
hop it's it's got more of a hop

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:30.660 
hop it's it's got more of a hop
bitterness<00:03:22.690> than<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.140> expected<00:03:29.489> it's<00:03:30.489> very

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
bitterness than I expected it's very

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.130 
bitterness than I expected it's very
light

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.240 

I<00:03:36.250> don't<00:03:37.250> know<00:03:37.370> how<00:03:37.490> could<00:03:37.700> say<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:39.220> got<00:03:40.220> a

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
I don't know how could say that got a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.640 
I don't know how could say that got a
very<00:03:43.000> astringent<00:03:44.000> hop<00:03:44.510> quality<00:03:45.080> it's<00:03:45.319> getting

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
very astringent hop quality it's getting

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.890 
very astringent hop quality it's getting
that<00:03:45.740> effect<00:03:46.580> on<00:03:46.760> my<00:03:46.880> time<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:50.360> multi

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
that effect on my time but the multi

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.699 
that effect on my time but the multi
pneus<00:03:51.080> underneath<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:52.720> just<00:03:53.720> there<00:03:54.260> enough

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
pneus underneath it is just there enough

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.410 
pneus underneath it is just there enough
to<00:03:54.740> kind<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.370> offset<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:56.030> hops<00:03:56.240> are

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
to kind of offset the hops are

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.199 
to kind of offset the hops are
definitely<00:03:56.840> overpowering<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:58.850> multi

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
definitely overpowering the the multi

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.240 
definitely overpowering the the multi
pneus<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.660> but<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:03.140> maltiness<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:04.010> is

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
pneus of it but that maltiness is is

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.780 
pneus of it but that maltiness is is
just<00:04:04.550> weak<00:04:04.850> enough<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.180> kind<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:06.610> underscore<00:04:07.610> I

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
just weak enough to kind of underscore I

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.350 
just weak enough to kind of underscore I
guess<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.390> hop<00:04:08.900> flavor<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:10.070> was<00:04:10.360> probably

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
guess the hop flavor that was probably

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.580 
guess the hop flavor that was probably
made<00:04:11.750> no<00:04:11.930> sense<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.350> anyone

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.450 

very<00:04:20.280> clean<00:04:20.959> it's<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.139> very<00:04:22.350> clean<00:04:22.800> taste<00:04:23.160> very

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
very clean it's a very clean taste very

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.530 
very clean it's a very clean taste very
clean<00:04:23.730> hot<00:04:24.060> bitter<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:26.430> hop<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:27.419> I'm

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
clean hot bitter the hop that I'm

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.680 
clean hot bitter the hop that I'm
tasting<00:04:31.669> seems<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.820> be<00:04:32.940> stronger<00:04:33.419> than<00:04:33.540> what

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
tasting seems to be stronger than what

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.840 
tasting seems to be stronger than what
what<00:04:34.229> was<00:04:34.380> used<00:04:34.590> for<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:34.919> aroma<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.639> would

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
what was used for the aroma I would

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.210 
what was used for the aroma I would
imagine<00:04:36.500> because<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.650> doesn't<00:04:37.949> have<00:04:37.979> that

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
imagine because it doesn't have that

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.820 
imagine because it doesn't have that
same<00:04:38.630> citrusy<00:04:42.139> it<00:04:43.139> doesn't<00:04:43.380> have<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.590> same

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
same citrusy it doesn't have that same

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.480 
same citrusy it doesn't have that same
citrusy<00:04:44.400> quality<00:04:44.880> that<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.180> aroma<00:04:45.449> did<00:04:46.490> of

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
citrusy quality that the aroma did of

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.890 
citrusy quality that the aroma did of
the<00:04:47.729> flavors<00:04:48.090> got<00:04:48.570> more<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.199> a<00:04:49.410> bitter<00:04:49.770> thing

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
the flavors got more of a bitter thing

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.890 
the flavors got more of a bitter thing
they<00:04:51.900> pegged<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:52.350> really<00:04:52.590> well<00:04:52.710> sprue<00:04:53.190> see

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
they pegged it really well sprue see
