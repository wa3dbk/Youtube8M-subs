your frosting for your cupcakes I like
to<00:01:47.000> usually<00:01:47.330> use<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.570> pastry<00:01:48.080> bag<00:01:48.320> because<00:01:48.649> I

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
to usually use a pastry bag because I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.050 
to usually use a pastry bag because I
think<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.979> gives<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.310> little<00:01:49.430> bit<00:01:49.640> more<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:49.970> a

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
think it gives it a little bit more of a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.030 
think it gives it a little bit more of a
bakery<00:01:50.420> finish<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.290> we've<00:01:51.409> already<00:01:51.649> loaded
