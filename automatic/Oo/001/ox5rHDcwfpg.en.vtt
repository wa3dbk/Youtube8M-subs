00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
rack before we go on to the next step

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.619 
rack before we go on to the next step
okay<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.280> squares<00:02:57.579> are<00:02:57.790> cooled<00:02:58.030> now<00:02:58.299> and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
we're going to go on to the next step

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.429 
we're going to go on to the next step
which<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.400> spread<00:03:00.849> 1<00:03:01.150> cup<00:03:01.569> of<00:03:01.599> seedless

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
which is to spread 1 cup of seedless

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:08.069 
which is to spread 1 cup of seedless
raspberry<00:03:02.739> jam<00:03:03.209> over<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.299> top<00:03:04.829> evenly<00:03:07.079> you

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
raspberry jam over the top evenly you

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:16.510 
raspberry jam over the top evenly you
want<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.349> make<00:03:08.470> sure<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.919> use<00:03:08.950> seedless<00:03:09.579> down

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.550 

so<00:03:17.060> we'll<00:03:17.180> just<00:03:17.210> spread<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.720> evenly<00:03:17.900> all
