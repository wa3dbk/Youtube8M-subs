millimeter f-14 lens on the camera I've

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.289 
millimeter f-14 lens on the camera I've
got<00:03:28.680> three<00:03:29.489> or<00:03:29.579> four<00:03:29.700> different<00:03:29.819> objects

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
got three or four different objects

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.210 
got three or four different objects
sitting<00:03:30.750> out<00:03:30.900> in<00:03:30.930> front<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.410> camera<00:03:31.709> so

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
sitting out in front of the camera so

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.009 
sitting out in front of the camera so
let's<00:03:32.549> see<00:03:32.760> how<00:03:33.000> well<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.359> V<00:03:33.480> control<00:03:33.810> or

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
let's see how well the V control or

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.080 
let's see how well the V control or
pulls<00:03:34.290> focus<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:34.859> those<00:03:34.980> items<00:03:35.370> right<00:03:35.880> now<00:03:36.060> I

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
pulls focus on those items right now I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.909 
pulls focus on those items right now I
found<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.720> step<00:03:36.989> size<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.230> works<00:03:37.500> best

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
found that the step size that works best

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.789 
found that the step size that works best
for<00:03:38.099> this<00:03:38.310> lens<00:03:38.669> seems<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.630> be<00:03:39.840> step<00:03:40.560> size

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
for this lens seems to be step size

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.339 
for this lens seems to be step size
number<00:03:41.310> two<00:03:41.609> so<00:03:42.299> let's<00:03:42.540> start<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.930> recording

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
number two so let's start the recording

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.520 
number two so let's start the recording
by<00:03:43.500> hitting<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.160> red<00:03:44.370> button<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.569> let's

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
by hitting to the red button and let's

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.780 
by hitting to the red button and let's
pull<00:03:46.859> some<00:03:46.889> focus

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
pull some focus

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.819 
pull some focus
alright<00:03:48.299> testing<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.780> focus<00:03:49.230> we've<00:03:49.440> got<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
alright testing the focus we've got the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.300 
alright testing the focus we've got the
Canon<00:03:50.840> 7200<00:03:51.840> box<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.319> focus<00:03:52.680> right<00:03:52.889> now<00:03:53.040> let's

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
Canon 7200 box in focus right now let's

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.789 
Canon 7200 box in focus right now let's
go<00:03:53.519> ahead<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:54.120> move<00:03:54.599> this<00:03:54.930> out<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.739> little

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
go ahead and move this out just a little

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.830 
go ahead and move this out just a little
bit<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.370> now<00:03:57.000> we<00:03:57.060> have<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:59.239> 7200<00:04:00.239> lens<00:04:00.599> in

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
bit and now we have the 7200 lens in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.440 
bit and now we have the 7200 lens in
focus<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.560> if<00:04:01.829> we<00:04:01.980> do<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> little<00:04:02.730> bit<00:04:03.060> more<00:04:03.269> of

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
focus and if we do a little bit more of

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.020 
focus and if we do a little bit more of
a<00:04:03.540> motion<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.319> can<00:04:04.440> see<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.980> Christmas<00:04:05.760> hat

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
a motion you can see that Christmas hat

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.629 
a motion you can see that Christmas hat
with<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.510> head<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.620> little<00:04:07.829> bag<00:04:08.040> are<00:04:08.430> now

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
with the head and the little bag are now

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.970 
with the head and the little bag are now
in<00:04:08.790> focus<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.419> then<00:04:09.989> we<00:04:10.109> can<00:04:10.260> roll<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.709> all

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
in focus and then we can roll this all

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.580 
in focus and then we can roll this all
the<00:04:11.129> way<00:04:11.220> back<00:04:11.489> until<00:04:11.760> we<00:04:12.660> see<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:13.349> course

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
the way back until we see that of course

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.750 
the way back until we see that of course
again<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.760> 70<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.329> 200<00:04:15.540> box<00:04:16.349> and<00:04:16.739> lens<00:04:17.310> next<00:04:17.669> to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
again the 70 to 200 box and lens next to

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.020 
again the 70 to 200 box and lens next to
it<00:04:17.880> are<00:04:18.120> again<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.900> focus<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:20.039> moves<00:04:20.459> pretty

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
it are again in focus that moves pretty

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.960 
it are again in focus that moves pretty
smooth<00:04:21.599> at<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.260> step<00:04:22.740> number<00:04:22.950> of<00:04:23.310> two

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
smooth at a step number of two

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.950 
smooth at a step number of two
and<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.840> motion<00:04:25.050> looks<00:04:25.530> fairly<00:04:26.160> nice<00:04:26.550> as<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
and the motion looks fairly nice as you

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.540 
and the motion looks fairly nice as you
can<00:04:27.990> see<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.560> V<00:04:28.710> controller<00:04:29.070> does<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.250> pretty

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
can see the V controller does a pretty

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.790 
can see the V controller does a pretty
good<00:04:29.700> job<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:29.910> pulling<00:04:30.270> focus<00:04:30.540> on<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.440> 35

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
good job of pulling focus on the 35

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.070 
good job of pulling focus on the 35
millimeter<00:04:31.980> f-14<00:04:32.850> lens<00:04:32.880> it's<00:04:33.660> really<00:04:33.900> nice<00:04:34.050> to

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
millimeter f-14 lens it's really nice to

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.320 
millimeter f-14 lens it's really nice to
be<00:04:34.320> able<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.650> see<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.010> step<00:04:35.280> size<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:36.120> kind<00:04:36.270> of

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
be able to see the step size and kind of

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.420 
be able to see the step size and kind of
figure<00:04:36.570> out<00:04:36.630> what<00:04:37.140> step<00:04:37.410> size<00:04:37.620> works<00:04:37.890> best<00:04:38.250> for

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
figure out what step size works best for

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.060 
figure out what step size works best for
the<00:04:39.120> lens<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.600> you're<00:04:39.720> using<00:04:39.990> keep<00:04:40.710> in<00:04:40.860> mind

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
the lens that you're using keep in mind

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.030 
the lens that you're using keep in mind
that<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.790> quality<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.540> focus<00:04:43.290> pulling<00:04:43.740> with<00:04:44.010> a

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
that the quality of focus pulling with a

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.460 
that the quality of focus pulling with a
device<00:04:44.490> like<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.150> dependent<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.230> the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
device like this is dependent on the

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.290 
device like this is dependent on the
motor<00:04:46.740> that's<00:04:47.010> built<00:04:47.250> into<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.580> lens<00:04:47.820> this<00:04:48.240> is

motor that's built into the lens this is
an<00:04:48.480> L<00:04:48.600> Series<00:04:48.870> lens<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:49.950> works<00:04:50.250> nice<00:04:50.490> and

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
an L Series lens so it works nice and

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.880 
an L Series lens so it works nice and
smooth<00:04:51.090> but<00:04:51.570> if<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.750> have<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.900> cheap<00:04:52.470> lens<00:04:52.650> with

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
smooth but if you have a cheap lens with

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.430 
smooth but if you have a cheap lens with
a<00:04:52.950> really<00:04:53.250> loud<00:04:53.460> motor<00:04:53.910> that<00:04:54.510> loud<00:04:54.780> motor<00:04:55.110> will

after spending some time with the V
controller<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.419> can<00:05:54.540> safely<00:05:54.960> say<00:05:55.410> that<00:05:55.440> it's

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
controller I can safely say that it's

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.590 
controller I can safely say that it's
got<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.100> lot<00:05:56.280> of<00:05:56.310> improvements<00:05:57.000> over<00:05:57.090> some<00:05:57.510> of

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
got a lot of improvements over some of

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.170 
got a lot of improvements over some of
the<00:05:57.690> earlier<00:05:58.050> USB<00:05:58.620> controllers<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.640> two<00:05:59.850> USB

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
the earlier USB controllers the two USB

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.120 
the earlier USB controllers the two USB
ports<00:06:00.540> make<00:06:00.690> mounting<00:06:01.200> a<00:06:01.320> lot<00:06:01.530> easier<00:06:01.950> for

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
ports make mounting a lot easier for

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.990 
ports make mounting a lot easier for
this<00:06:02.280> because<00:06:02.520> you<00:06:02.580> don't<00:06:02.700> have<00:06:02.790> to<00:06:02.880> worry

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
this because you don't have to worry

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.909 
this because you don't have to worry
about<00:06:03.120> the<00:06:03.270> cable<00:06:03.450> sticking<00:06:04.230> out<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.440> only<00:06:04.680> one

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
about the cable sticking out of only one

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.530 
about the cable sticking out of only one
place<00:06:05.220> you<00:06:05.250> can<00:06:05.550> set<00:06:05.730> it<00:06:05.820> on<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.000> side<00:06:06.240> if<00:06:06.419> you

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
place you can set it on the side if you

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.540 
place you can set it on the side if you
want<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:07.169> window<00:06:07.590> that<00:06:07.740> displays<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:08.130> step

want the window that displays the step

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.670 
want the window that displays the step
size<00:06:08.760> is<00:06:09.060> really<00:06:09.360> handy<00:06:09.810> for<00:06:09.960> seeing<00:06:10.230> where

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
video switch is extremely handy because

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.159 
video switch is extremely handy because
it<00:06:17.880> sets<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.210> controller<00:06:18.600> up<00:06:18.810> to<00:06:18.990> work

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
it sets the controller up to work

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.290 
it sets the controller up to work
specifically<00:06:19.770> for<00:06:19.890> Stills<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.850> changes<00:06:21.210> the

functionality for video when you're just

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.820 
functionality for video when you're just
using<00:06:23.370> it<00:06:23.580> for<00:06:23.760> video<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.780> unit<00:06:25.230> is<00:06:25.440> made<00:06:25.470> out

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
using it for video the unit is made out

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.880 
using it for video the unit is made out
of<00:06:25.860> plastic<00:06:26.160> but<00:06:27.030> at<00:06:27.330> half<00:06:27.660> the<00:06:27.870> price<00:06:28.169> of<00:06:28.500> some

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
of the other options on the market I

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.960 
of the other options on the market I
think<00:06:31.290> a<00:06:31.350> lot<00:06:31.500> of<00:06:31.530> people<00:06:31.950> will<00:06:32.160> be<00:06:32.280> ok<00:06:32.729> with

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
think a lot of people will be ok with

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.680 
think a lot of people will be ok with
the<00:06:33.180> build<00:06:33.419> versus<00:06:34.260> the<00:06:35.090> machined<00:06:36.090> aluminum

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
the build versus the machined aluminum

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.060 
the build versus the machined aluminum
that's

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
that's

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.500 
that's
the<00:06:37.130> other<00:06:37.280> ones<00:06:37.430> are<00:06:37.550> made<00:06:37.670> out<00:06:37.820> of<00:06:37.850> those<00:06:38.360> are

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
the other ones are made out of those are

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.480 
the other ones are made out of those are
$400<00:06:39.200> this<00:06:39.500> is<00:06:39.650> a<00:06:39.680> hundred<00:06:39.950> and<00:06:40.100> eighty-nine

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
$400 this is a hundred and eighty-nine

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.670 
$400 this is a hundred and eighty-nine
dollars<00:06:40.640> so<00:06:41.510> this<00:06:41.810> is<00:06:41.990> definitely<00:06:42.260> a<00:06:42.440> lot<00:06:42.530> more

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
dollars so this is definitely a lot more

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.100 
dollars so this is definitely a lot more
attractive<00:06:42.980> if<00:06:43.430> you're<00:06:43.550> on<00:06:43.820> a<00:06:44.210> budget<00:06:44.540> it's

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
attractive if you're on a budget it's

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.630 
attractive if you're on a budget it's
also<00:06:45.230> nice<00:06:45.530> that<00:06:45.590> you<00:06:46.070> can<00:06:46.220> get<00:06:46.370> to<00:06:46.520> the

also nice that you can get to the
