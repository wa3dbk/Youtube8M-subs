00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:11.540
 Hello, today I will tell you how 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.710
 put the slider using extension 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.750
 This is of course an undesirable option. 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.970
 still violations runners anyway 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.160
 happen but there are such situations 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.390
 when it is necessary to deliver very urgently without 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.460
 expansion or 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.650
 There are such moments where to get hold of almost 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.860
 impossible or very difficult to build 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.370
 it will be pretty you difficult that place will 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.559
 collect where we send cotton or 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.990
 really quick man 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.290
 explain what to do and man 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:43.310
 says yes still not important fast 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.240
 Here in this case, see I use 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.120
 such a medical clip chick then so 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.780
 comfortably grabs his own for this 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.340
 backrest 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.890
 lateral main cinnamon and to still 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.620
 we did our best 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.980
 the task of heating it when metals 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.789
 it warms up during bending not so 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.840
 damaged well that's ruined anathema 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:13.050
 there are 2 and 3 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.140
 burner especially well 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.540
 when it is repaired but still 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.159
 benny so damage for example paints 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:26.909
 runner there and not looking then our task 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.920
 warm up the lower wall of the runner either 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.159
 I can see the game myself and my lower wall 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.159
 dybenko 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.579
 it is her and wet ordinate the rest of us 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.380
 should not move at all 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.020
 even 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.770
 little wall behind which i hold 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.369
 runner it should remain with us 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.369
 fixed state 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.189
 there is essentially no overheating 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.890
 do not overheat baby 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.299
 nurse he is of normal quality 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.299
 desirable to deliver the forehead well 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.460
 then we take scissors and see here 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.340
 have scissors when screwdriver and 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.560
 start to draw stenochku look these 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.510
 bottom wall 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.970
 starts to move away a little bit more 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.000
 this edge 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.130
 that we will need to try to start it 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.320
 Italian runner he of course isn't he 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.990
 will go bad but 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.420
 but here you can see how I turned down 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:43.700
 stenochku before 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:45.410
 it is desirable to cool some water like 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.390
 sometimes she sometimes happens 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.450
 it is necessary to unbend because 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.459
 it is not enough we will try 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.410
 put on the bag here is the situation 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.890
 see see expand with edging 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.930
 it is very difficult to bag a rather coarse and 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.820
 from the roof the edge of the zipper to insert 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.610
 the slider is really the moment 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.190
 hard in open state see i 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.330
 put it on one side well nudged 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.550
 still a screwdriver that is not 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.130
 completely smashed him and now mine 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:24.830
 task to put insert the second side 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.720
 it will be more difficult too I insert it 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.330
 why are we putting in this side 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.310
 because sometimes you can still 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.410
 bring lightning lightning damage 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.110
 which are undesirable but better done on 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.470
 closing where we will have 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.150
 confine someone on our pops 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.150
 to here the runner only comes 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.260
 here you go 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:59.610
 See with a screwdriver pushing everything fly 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.530
 rub and she went now need to gently 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.070
 lest she jump out inflict on us 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.620
 the right position ie finally the lightning 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:12.780
 where it starts here will be 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.120
 begin to fasten as we 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.820
 runners are now clamped we can calmly 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.580
 runner this reduce it well only 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.080
 our our situation with our handbag but 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:29.280
 preferably 3 6 apparatus so that he again 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:31.610
 I didnâ€™t jump out now 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.610
 the side 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.400
 when you do not hurry 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.189
 the situation is that you need to move at all 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.659
 one pier nickname one side of 2 all 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:10.039
 bring him to the extreme position here 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:16.580
 see brought him to the extreme 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:21.289
 now my task is to preload it 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:26.110
 we will be pliers but not how does 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:35.419
 this is the most we will press 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:39.520
 it is to crush the town the emphasis should 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:42.099
 be one hundred percent good stop 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:49.189
 they say it is not desirable to reduce 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:51.409
 maximum-maximum edge here 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:53.810
 as much as possible the edge of opinion will turn out so 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.259
 look at the camera because i 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.099
 will have to push the power of his body here 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:04.900
 look i put in the area 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:07.099
 pliers from see yes here is this place i 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.189
 I open a little pliers and I have them 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.800
 two lips of these pliers become 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:17.599
 becomes on the sides of the slider and start 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.569
 quietly push him 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:23.169
 must take its place as 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.169
 frost 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.580
 it is not easy of course but 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:47.480
 our task is to make children not ready yet 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.480
 neither closes 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.940
 here look see now we put 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.350
 it covers its place and this one 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:15.710
 edges where we have here slightly converged 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.710
 and newton came together all ate them awards 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.840
 such a runner as we would a little bit of it 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.860
 violated indisputably but we violated it 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.250
 under the temperature 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.910
 that is , our metal must still hold on 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.250
 and hold on 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.140
 if you just bend it, you can just 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.610
 his eyebrows 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.030
 Well, press it as I said it is necessary 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.800
 don't forget to press correctly 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:45.930
 pliers watching them uncovering and 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.000
 crush a good pair of bottom and crush with this 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.610
 the sides are just the bottom wall 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.580
 snuggles up to lightning takes its 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:56.040
 the form takes its place to the buttock 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:59.610
 lightning thickness and 

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.100
 inside cynaid work again everything will be 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.140
 ok everyone i'm sure you this 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.550
 will come in handy 

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.030
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.020
 huskies 

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.020
 happily
