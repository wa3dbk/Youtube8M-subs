00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.259
 whatsapp raises the right staples arden 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.210
 well found for this episode of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.790
 danger dott 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.599
 today we will do the third tutorial on 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.330
 the use of butterfly knives also 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.539
 said several songs today more 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.539
 precisely I want to show you 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.080
 we said an upgrade of the first tutorial 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.900
 that I showed you or the pen dow 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.739
 this trip I like to call it 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.070
 tactics hang because you end up 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.680
 that hold the knife in this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.899
 position like when someone was standing 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.550
 let's say, however, the point of construction, why not 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.989
 we can use both say for one 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.930
 guard position that if yes 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.000
 wants to hold a gun and a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.000
 knife with say this 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.580
 so we said the tactical configuration is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.210
 a very comfortable trick and I don't 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.479
 quickly see how you can see 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.479
 also quite fast to accomplish e 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 so okay sorry you the tutorial 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.650
 good guys in this bari video 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 zong we will treat a trick let's say a little 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.990
 more serious than last time 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.079
 I remember that last time was 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.790
 let's just say an explanation of the basic 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.700
 opening this what I will show you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.850
 today is what I like to call the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.990
 tactical appeno dow is let's say a species 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.060
 of modification of the hang a normal that 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.880
 allows you to find yourself with the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.640
 knife in this position as per 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.530
 uncorking no is a very simple trick 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.180
 this too we say the first tricks 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.030
 they will always be simple we used to say level 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.610
 beginners so if you want more trick 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.840
 complicated make sure they will arrive 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.660
 also those 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.270
 anyway for today's trip 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.060
 we will always start with explaining to you 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.760
 the handle the handle for the first 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.140
 trick is always the same or palm 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.200
 open and handle without secure that 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.720
 rests in the palm of your hand in 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.319
 diagonally then close the grip 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.030
 as if you are holding a key of 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.209
 a car and you want to open it 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.260
 I like to describe it like that 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.800
 this sort of good grip for the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.910
 three-day today you will have to do the following 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.150
 movements 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.750
 the first step will be practically the same as 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:58.560
 what you do during the basic 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:02.550
 opening or leave the handle with the 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.989
 safe and the blade and to turn the wrist in 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.690
 this way so that the palm of the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.909
 your hand points upwards by doing 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.440
 however this movement will have to do that 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:16.080
 you will have to do something physically 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.980
 penney normally is not done ie 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.060
 you will have to place it on the inner side 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.810
 of the handle without the safety of your finger 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.480
 index 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.450
 in this way so that the thumb e 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.040
 the index are resting on the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.129
 same side of the handle 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.750
 while the remaining three fingers are 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.430
 on the other side of the handle 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.430
 I'll show you again 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.760
 once this is achieved 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.310
 configuration we can move to 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.959
 next step or throw back 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.269
 the handle with the safety and the blade on 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.549
 these two fingers obviously if you have 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.290
 followed my instructions on how 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.970
 hold the knife at the beginning of 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.489
 trick you will end up with the non part 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.460
 sharp of the blade that will end 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.110
 on the fingers if you have followed badly 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.620
 the instructions are likely there 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.630
 you will leave your thumb at each 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.009
 so reached at this point you will have to 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.780
 simply throw back the blade 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.599
 the handle with the safety in this way 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.599
 how to do a normal in the tent 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:57.080
 ok once this point is reached le 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.780
 things get quite complicated 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.300
 you will have to do more movements in a short 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.050
 time frame the first move from 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:10.490
 do will be to push with the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:14.050
 index the blade and the handle with the safety 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.050
 down like this 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.950
 while doing this you will have to rotate the 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:38.720
 so you can take it in 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:42.380
 this way you will have to push on the blade 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.240
 and meanwhile turn it so as to 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.070
 being able to pass with the thumb 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.070
 on the other side of the handle 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.699
 while doing all these steps 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:04.789
 you will have to take advantage of the swing that 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:08.449
 is generated by dropping the 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:12.289
 handle and the blade to be able to say 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:18.529
 complete the turn of the knife a 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:21.159
 butterfly and join the two handles into 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.159
 this way 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:59.549
 ok now i don't do it all again 

00:06:56.549 --> 00:07:02.599
 slow motion so you can understand 

00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:02.599
 all movements well
