wouldn't<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.599> l5<00:05:17.930> have<00:05:18.110> had<00:05:18.289> that<00:05:18.500> floating

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
wouldn't the l5 have had that floating

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.189 
wouldn't the l5 have had that floating
pickup<00:05:19.220> here<00:05:19.460> some<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:19.970> them<00:05:20.150> did<00:05:20.270> okay<00:05:20.780> so

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
pickup here some of them did okay so

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.779 
pickup here some of them did okay so
this<00:05:21.289> is<00:05:21.440> just<00:05:21.530> a<00:05:21.650> straight<00:05:21.830> acoustic<00:05:22.400> pretty

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
this is just a straight acoustic pretty

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.010 
this is just a straight acoustic pretty
much<00:05:23.409> and<00:05:24.409> then<00:05:24.770> you<00:05:25.190> have<00:05:25.370> here<00:05:25.849> the<00:05:26.539> cutaway

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
much and then you have here the cutaway

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.010 
much and then you have here the cutaway
so<00:05:27.770> you've<00:05:27.949> got<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.280> l5<00:05:28.610> cutaway<00:05:29.270> prototype

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
so you've got the l5 cutaway prototype
