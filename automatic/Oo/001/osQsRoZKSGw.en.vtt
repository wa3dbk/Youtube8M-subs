going to do because i feel it's

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.720 
going to do because i feel it's
important<00:03:28.590> for<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.250> have<00:03:29.370> visual<00:03:31.609> so<00:03:32.609> this

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
important for you to have visual so this

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.610 
important for you to have visual so this
is<00:03:32.760> basically<00:03:33.090> about<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.780> size<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.200> my<00:03:34.260> locker

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
is basically about the size of my locker

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.670 
is basically about the size of my locker
it's<00:03:35.100> pretty<00:03:36.030> small<00:03:36.150> um<00:03:38.630> yeah<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.440> like

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
it's pretty small um yeah this is like

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.740 
it's pretty small um yeah this is like
the<00:03:41.130> exact<00:03:41.549> size<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:41.940> my<00:03:42.030> locker<00:03:42.180> maybe<00:03:42.630> a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
the exact size of my locker maybe a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.819 
the exact size of my locker maybe a
little<00:03:43.019> taller<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.519> little<00:03:45.230> skinnier<00:03:46.230> like

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
little taller and a little skinnier like

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.699 
little taller and a little skinnier like
that's<00:03:47.400> why<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.670> guess<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:49.200> what<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.470> would<00:03:49.560> be

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
that's why I guess so what I would be

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.670 
that's why I guess so what I would be
doing<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.090> put<00:03:51.420> this<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.989> if<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.200> have<00:03:52.440> a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680

just<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.520> that<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.390> doesn't<00:04:16.750> take<00:04:16.900> up<00:04:16.930> as

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
just like that and it doesn't take up as

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.930 
just like that and it doesn't take up as
much<00:04:17.200> room<00:04:17.410> as<00:04:17.739> your<00:04:17.890> button<00:04:18.220> your<00:04:18.400> binder<00:04:18.760> and

much room as your button your binder and

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.610 
much room as your button your binder and
then<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:20.530> would<00:04:20.739> just<00:04:20.769> take<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:22.470> with<00:04:23.470> your

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
will be at the very front of the stack

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.400 
will be at the very front of the stack
just<00:04:30.460> like<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.820> would<00:04:31.810> take<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:34.080> drab<00:04:35.080> your

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410
