 It is a description 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:31.250

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.829
 let's 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.640
 the truth depends on how good they are 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.350

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:43.909

 Now let's try it 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.150

 more ram memory 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.530
