black<00:00:40.020> ops<00:00:40.379> compared<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.160> even<00:00:41.610> modern

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
black ops compared to even modern

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.569 
black ops compared to even modern
warfare<00:00:42.239> 2<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:43.230> did<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> quick<00:00:44.129> scope<00:00:44.370> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
warfare 2 I think did a quick scope in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.040 
warfare 2 I think did a quick scope in
this<00:00:45.329> game<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> easy<00:00:47.570> for<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.629> guys<00:00:48.809> that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
this game is easy for the guys that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.540 
this game is easy for the guys that
doesn't<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> quickscope<00:00:50.190> don't

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
doesn't know how to quickscope don't

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.360 
doesn't know how to quickscope don't
worry<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.120> uh<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.890> sounds

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
worry it's uh it's not what it sounds

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.299 
worry it's uh it's not what it sounds
it's<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:55.140> basically<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> quick

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it's not it it's basically not a quick

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.290 
it's not it it's basically not a quick
scope<00:00:58.039> first<00:00:59.039> time<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.460> heard<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.670> quick<00:00:59.969> scope

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
scope first time I heard a quick scope

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.000 
scope first time I heard a quick scope
or<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> term<00:01:01.500> quick<00:01:01.949> scope<00:01:02.250> word<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.210> well<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
or the term quick scope word as well I

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.109 
or the term quick scope word as well I
thought<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.250> should<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.909> in

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
thought you should do like in

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.310 
thought you should do like in
counter-strike<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> play

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
counter-strike if you play

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.070 
counter-strike if you play
counter-strike<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:08.790> sim<00:01:09.090> simultaneously

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
counter-strike you sim simultaneously

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.240 
counter-strike you sim simultaneously
push<00:01:10.409> both<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:11.369> both<00:01:11.580> mouse<00:01:11.970> buttons<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.720> in

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
push both at both mouse buttons or in

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.690 
push both at both mouse buttons or in
console<00:01:14.330> cases<00:01:15.330> both<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:17.150> triggers<00:01:19.159> but<00:01:20.159> if

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
console cases both that triggers but if

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
console cases both that triggers but if
you<00:01:20.880> take<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.689> back<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> notch<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.710> slow

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you take it back a notch you know slow

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
you take it back a notch you know slow
it<00:01:23.220> down<00:01:23.330> you'll<00:01:24.330> find<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.869> quick<00:01:25.259> scoping

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it down you'll find that quick scoping

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.370 
it down you'll find that quick scoping
is<00:01:25.770> really

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
is really

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.780 
is really
you<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:28.980> be<00:01:29.130> fast<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:29.550> it's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
you don't have to be fast because it's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
you don't have to be fast because it's
fast<00:01:30.060> either<00:01:30.300> way<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.440> I<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.920> sounds

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
fast either way and I know it sounds

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.010 
fast either way and I know it sounds
stupid<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.930> take<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:33.960> time<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.650> min<00:01:34.890> draw
