information on what the ancient evil
appears<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.310> be<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.910> this<00:01:10.060> might<00:01:10.240> be<00:01:10.270> worth

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600

paying<00:01:10.990> close<00:01:11.619> attention<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.570> ancient

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
paying close attention to so the ancient

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.219 
paying close attention to so the ancient
evil<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.830> just<00:01:15.310> like<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.060> flood<00:01:16.300> I'd<00:01:16.540> scarier

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
evil is just like the flood I'd scarier

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.040 
evil is just like the flood I'd scarier
so<00:01:17.950> we<00:01:18.160> have<00:01:18.250> those<00:01:18.490> flood<00:01:18.940> spores<00:01:19.420> at<00:01:19.930> the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
so we have those flood spores at the

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.950 
so we have those flood spores at the
bottom<00:01:20.410> and<00:01:20.590> then<00:01:20.830> we<00:01:20.950> have<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.430> huge<00:01:22.420> guy<00:01:22.720> which

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
bottom and then we have a huge guy which

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.380 
bottom and then we have a huge guy which
is<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.440> great<00:01:23.619> mind<00:01:23.890> which<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.550> biggest<00:01:25.119> form

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
is the great mind which the biggest form

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.080 
is the great mind which the biggest form
of<00:01:25.660> flood<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:26.950> basically<00:01:27.369> that's<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.790> same

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
of flood so basically that's the same

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.930 
of flood so basically that's the same
way<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.450> works<00:01:28.690> with<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.890> ancient<00:01:30.040> evil<00:01:30.490> with

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940

ancient<00:01:39.909> evil<00:01:40.390> died<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.200> basically<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:41.740> works

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
ancient evil died so basically it works

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.420

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.090

point so katana is gonna get evil unless

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.280 
point so katana is gonna get evil unless
much<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:18.640> does<00:05:18.880> something<00:05:19.270> about<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.540> I<00:05:19.780> highly

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
much it does something about it I highly

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.680 
much it does something about it I highly
doubt<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:20.560> massive<00:05:21.310> can<00:05:21.730> do<00:05:22.030> anything<00:05:22.450> about

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
doubt that massive can do anything about

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.230 
doubt that massive can do anything about
it<00:05:23.100> but<00:05:24.100> it<00:05:24.280> might<00:05:24.430> be<00:05:24.550> possible<00:05:24.700> you<00:05:25.120> know

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
it but it might be possible you know

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.080 
it but it might be possible you know
they're<00:05:25.450> on<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.660> foreigner<00:05:26.350> world<00:05:26.910> maybe<00:05:27.910> they

they're on a foreigner world maybe they

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.000 
they're on a foreigner world maybe they
