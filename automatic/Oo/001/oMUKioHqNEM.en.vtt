00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello girls today I'm coming back 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809
 to tell you about a good brushes plan 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.940
 so if you follow me 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.070
 to keep my tutorial you regularly 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.430
 must have seen for a few months 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.269
 new white or black brushes 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.730
 that is to say of this style and I 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.289
 use a lot to make my complexion 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.000
 I thought it was time 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.140
 to talk about it 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.880
 so for those who are used to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 brushes are simply 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.380
 dupes of sigma brushes and it turns out 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.370
 that as we find in plenty of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.680
 different shops 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 I ordered a kit in a shop 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 and one who are in a watch in order to 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.110
 to be able to compare them and to be sure of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.539
 to make a difference I chose a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.300
 black and silver kit and white kit and 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.250
 golden just at sight of the eye like that you 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
 you can see that if there exits 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.440
 the brushes are shorter than the one 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.149
 on the other hand not having the real 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.519
 sigmar i do not know if the fees are 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.350
 rather of his paella or this one what 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.600
 be it the brushes are the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 same at the level of shapes so I'm going 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.840
 show you a kit in details and I 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.330
 will you then tell what is the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.119
 difference that I could notice I you 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.640
 so presents the white kit that includes 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.710
 five big brush reaches and five small 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.189
 in fact you have exactly the same 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.770
 form 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.360
 wholesale and small whenever I 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.280
 so start with this brush which is 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.750
 round and pointed and that I like 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.369
 especially for the contour in 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.619
 since it will allow really good 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.649
 draw the line and then e health 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.780
 on the top and you also have the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.290
 small model that is very convenient for 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.210
 the nest then we have the beveled 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.130
 rounded so this is really a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.170
 question of taste some are going 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.610
 want to apply bluff with others 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.770
 preferred to apply the products 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.170
 creams like the foundation so there 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.560
 really it is according to your tastes according to your 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.689
 cravings 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.310
 and of course you have the little one on 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.599
 the same model is this one on the other hand 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.569
 is just super convenient to fade 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.069
 the concealer I then go with a brush 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.780
 totally flat so there me 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.690
 personally the big one I use for 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.239
 my compact powder but I also like 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.800
 use the beveled dish for 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.709
 compact powders so the device 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.180
 really it's up to you 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.489
 decide in any case they are very 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.190
 practices and what I can not 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.260
 blame it's their sweetness are just 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.110
 super us and like the brushes 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.269
 previous we also have the same ones in 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.519
 very small then both there whatever 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.090
 one or the other as they are flat and 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.500
 how to say quite dense but airy at the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.390
 I do not know how to say it 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.340
 do I like them a lot to place 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.019
 leiter here I do not know why seen 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.420
 they are flat I think that's it 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.519
 in these areas it's not bad it's 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.819
 yeah I like them for readers 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:04.380
 and I finish with the simple kabuki 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.660
 rounded like that where we see she's going 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.370
 powder in with the same pattern in 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.430
 smaller so this one of course 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.420
 it's for my powder or but fond of 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.829
 liquid complexion 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.780
 it depends a little bit on my mood 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.180
 that's why that advantage actually 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.280
 to have several brushes that can 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.720
 serve more or less the same 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.000
 because in fact you can decide that 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.340
 this one will be for powders 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.310
 this one it will be for the foundations 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.620
 this cream for free powders 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.019
 this is really you who decide 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.120
 more or less of the destination according to the 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.250
 how you feel about your skin and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.590
 suddenly this one has it at all 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.209
 small rounded I confess it's the one 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.609
 that I use the least I do not have 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.549
 still specially found of how 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.940
 say two goals own but that would not know 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.940
 delay 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.860
 so already to start to compare 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.269
 size as I told you all to 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.590
 the hour in the black pic the brushes 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.299
 are smaller than in the kit 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.269
 doubling then by cons after at 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.470
 form level it's slightly 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.439
 similar then I say slightly in 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.500
 done at the base these are the same a jump 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.530
 here we have two pointed small size on 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.720
 there are two cases but which bigger but if 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.229
 you look good the diameters are only 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.120
 not the same the amount of hair so 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.769
 suddenly it's not the same for example 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.750
 between the two there we see that the 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.880
 base is wider so a priori there is 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.970
 more hair for example if I take 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.470
 the two that I have therefore allocated to the anti 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.240
 rings you can see who appears a 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.740
 big difference in size and 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.510
 the arrival when I apply my anti 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.449
 dark circles with this one I have the impression 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.669
 that this is it really fits more to the 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.050
 part to the area below the eye of the 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.900
 make it a little bigger 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.760
 while with this one there is a lot 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.500
 smaller so I'm going to spend more than 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.460
 time to chat plus he is a small 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.380
 little more rigid 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.889
 so here I have a small preference 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.620
 for black after usually mostly 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.080
 the brushes that I compared I have a 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.210
 preference for the black kit really from 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.310
 general way but then again I think 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.630
 it really depends on the tastes and 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.610
 by the way if you look at my videos 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.080
 you see me more often used the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.270
 brushes that have the black handle that this 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.360
 creaming white game so talk a little 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.479
 little price now black brushes 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:22.300
 I saw them on the colorful site 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:27.380
 onlive and I paid the ten brushes 25 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.919
 euros that 's 25 euros and brushes 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.840
 whites 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.500
 I had them on ebay simply 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.970
 and I paid a little slips 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.550
 less than 17 dollars 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.110
 so not even 15 euros which is not 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.539
 really cheap considering the 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.340
 quality as well 25 euros for that 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.949
 kane euros for that it's really 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.780
 very very very reasonable prices even 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.780
 more than that for this kind of brush 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.740
 so to conclude if you want some 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:58.349
 specific brushes for the complexion and that 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.330
 his brushes interest you my opinion 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.909
 personal is that the kit that I paid 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.169
 25 euros fits me better compared 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.330
 to my expectations 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.919
 hamoir messi 25 euros is too expensive 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.580
 for you or prefer to order 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:14.009
 on ebay than on the website colorful online 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.099
 get away there for less than 15 euros is 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.020
 just perfect also it will make very 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.189
 very well do it so that's all for 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.080
 this little video on my brushes 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.309
 dyed as you will have noticed I 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.689
 put a little bit of time to make you 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:26.369
 this video but I really wanted 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.080
 have some perspective on the quality 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.610
 brushes it's true when we 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.259
 use a week we can not 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.089
 necessarily realize if really 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.469
 they will lose their hair or not there in 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:36.599
 the occurrence I washed them several 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:38.339
 time it did not happen so really 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:40.499
 at the level value for money has nothing to 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:42.389
 to say then you'll understand I 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:44.639
 prefers blacks but maybe that 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.399
 you in my place would prefer the whites 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.360
 it really is everyone each his 

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:50.939
 tastes simply 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.649
 and so I put you the broad links 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:55.139
 and find the two kits under the video 

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:56.490
 course and then waiting for my 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.620
 next refusal I send you lots of 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.620
 Big kisses and see you soon cha
