00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.660 
updating and then but it would like what
I<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.930> watching<00:01:46.380> was<00:01:46.530> behind<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.280> seven

I was watching was behind like seven
seconds<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.720> really<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> big<00:01:49.079> deal

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
seconds and that's not really a big deal

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
seconds and that's not really a big deal
until<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.310> comes<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.850> someone<00:01:51.210> gets

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
until it comes out like someone gets

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
until it comes out like someone gets
knocked<00:01:51.570> out<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:52.170> submission<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.250> something

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
knocked out or submission or something

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
knocked out or submission or something
and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.360> find<00:01:54.689> out<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.689> your

and then you find out on the on your

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
and then you find out on the on your
phone<00:01:58.649> before<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.850> don't<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.380

but<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.709> do<00:03:05.800> think<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.670> even<00:03:07.180> though<00:03:07.390> I'm<00:03:07.570> not

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.150 
but I do think that even though I'm not
gonna<00:03:07.900> buy<00:03:08.080> five<00:03:08.290> pounds<00:03:08.560> i<00:03:08.650> do<00:03:08.709> think<00:03:09.010> it's<00:03:09.100> a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
gonna buy five pounds i do think it's a

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.310 
gonna buy five pounds i do think it's a
good<00:03:09.310> thing<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.520> they're<00:03:09.790> expanding<00:03:10.540> to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
good thing that they're expanding to

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.990 
good thing that they're expanding to
other<00:03:11.350> countries<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:12.550> way<00:03:12.700> other<00:03:12.910> people

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
other countries that way other people

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.360 
other countries that way other people

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
like as we watch the Fox over here in

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.949 
like as we watch the Fox over here in
the<00:03:26.650> United<00:03:26.920> States<00:03:26.980> we<00:03:27.910> watch<00:03:28.150> Fox<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.750> free

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
the United States we watch Fox on free

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.750 
the United States we watch Fox on free
TV<00:03:29.140> they<00:03:29.530> were<00:03:29.590> able<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:29.920> watch<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.580> free

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
TV they were able to watch that on free

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.880 
TV they were able to watch that on free
TV<00:03:30.970> or<00:03:31.360> at<00:03:31.750> least<00:03:31.959> like<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.260> main<00:03:32.410> event<00:03:32.590> or<00:03:32.860> a

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
TV or at least like the main event or a

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.229 
TV or at least like the main event or a
couple<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.280> fights<00:03:33.430> but<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:33.940> think<00:03:34.150> that's

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
couple of fights but I think that's

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.300 
couple of fights but I think that's
pretty<00:03:34.420> cool<00:03:34.660> because<00:03:34.810> UFC<00:03:35.350> expanding<00:03:35.860> then

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
pretty cool because UFC expanding then

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.770 
pretty cool because UFC expanding then
that's<00:03:36.549> going<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.760> add<00:03:36.850> more<00:03:37.060> people<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.600> it

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
that's going to add more people to it

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.890 
that's going to add more people to it
like<00:03:38.620> fighters<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:40.090> more<00:03:40.540> people<00:03:40.750> are

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
like fighters and and more people are

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
MMA world wide so i think that's a

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.030 
MMA world wide so i think that's a
pretty<00:03:45.100> cool<00:03:45.370> thing<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:46.570> yeah<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.230> mean<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.769> I

other day or something like that but I

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.440 
other day or something like that but I
think<00:04:33.830> everything<00:04:34.400> will<00:04:34.580> be<00:04:34.730> worked<00:04:34.940> out<00:04:35.150> I

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
think everything will be worked out I

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.170 
think everything will be worked out I
think<00:04:36.260> they'll<00:04:36.380> add<00:04:36.530> more<00:04:36.800> stuff<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:37.580> I

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
think they'll add more stuff to it and I

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.629 
think they'll add more stuff to it and I
think<00:04:38.240> when<00:04:38.900> they<00:04:39.020> do<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.530> every<00:04:40.310> all<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
think when they do and every all the

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.670 
think when they do and every all the
kinks<00:04:40.910> are<00:04:41.000> worked<00:04:41.030> out<00:04:41.360> then<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:41.840> might<00:04:42.410> buy<00:04:42.650> it

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
kinks are worked out then I might buy it

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.260 
kinks are worked out then I might buy it
because<00:04:43.669> I<00:04:44.000> really<00:04:44.270> do<00:04:44.389> like<00:04:44.540> FML<00:04:45.020> like<00:04:45.290> UFC<00:04:46.270> so

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
because I really do like FML like UFC so

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.680 
because I really do like FML like UFC so
yeah<00:04:47.690> I'd<00:04:48.500> be<00:04:48.710> intrigued<00:04:49.130> by<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.400> if<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:50.000> worked

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
yeah I'd be intrigued by it if it worked

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.190 
yeah I'd be intrigued by it if it worked
out<00:04:50.840> all<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.020> kinks<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:53.180> I<00:04:53.210> mean<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.750> did<00:04:54.020> yeah

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
should buy it if they're not hardcore

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.159 
should buy it if they're not hardcore
MMA<00:04:57.260> fan<00:04:57.800> or<00:04:58.540> hardcore<00:04:59.540> UFC<00:05:00.020> fan<00:05:00.970> or<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:03.050> would

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169
