they can find it a bit troublesome like

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.990 
they can find it a bit troublesome like
the<00:00:22.650> distance<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.369> zoom<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
the distance that you can zoom out and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
the distance that you can zoom out and
this<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.180> basically<00:00:27.510> all<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.750> looks<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.160> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
this is basically all it looks like it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.429 
this is basically all it looks like it
is<00:00:29.220> basically<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.240> small<00:00:30.510> little

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
window so i'll do is i will load up a

lottery play but and see that's what it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.030 
lottery play but and see that's what it
would<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.189> look<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.330> game<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.040> can

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
would then look like and in game I can

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.460 
would then look like and in game I can
now<00:01:14.250> zoom<00:01:14.820> out<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.750> distance<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.700> easy

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
now zoom out this distance so so easy

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.789 
now zoom out this distance so so easy
you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.770> quite<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.700> lot<00:01:20.790> more<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> map

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
you can see quite a lot more of the map

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.420 
you can see quite a lot more of the map
compared<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> its<00:01:23.790> normally<00:01:24.240> around<00:01:24.479> here

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
compared to its normally around here

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.580 
compared to its normally around here
it's<00:01:26.430> normally<00:01:26.729> run<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:26.970> distance<00:01:27.590> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it's normally run this distance so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
it's normally run this distance so
that's<00:01:29.130> where<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.430> normally<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that's where you can normally see and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
that's where you can normally see and
then<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.450> zoom<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.200> look<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
then you can zoom out you can look now I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.640 
then you can zoom out you can look now I
can<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.100> guy<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.340> there<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> bush

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
can see that guy down there in the bush

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.370 
can see that guy down there in the bush
which<00:01:34.650> normally<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> won't<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.520> able<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> see

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
which normally you won't be able to see

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.960 
which normally you won't be able to see
now<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.890> saying<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.430> should<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
download this program and use it because

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
download this program and use it because
it's<00:01:40.680> against<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.040> rules<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.610> i<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.150> summon

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's against the rules and i can summon

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.389 
it's against the rules and i can summon
a<00:01:42.479> code<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:44.869> it<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.290> helpful<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.979> when

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
a code but it can be helpful like when

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
a code but it can be helpful like when
you're<00:01:47.520> recording<00:01:47.790> videos<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:49.229> i'm<00:01:49.380> doing

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you're recording videos like i'm doing

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.469 
you're recording videos like i'm doing
now<00:01:49.729> business<00:01:50.729> I've<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.000> zoomed<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
now business I've just zoomed out you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.609 
now business I've just zoomed out you
can<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.750> pretty<00:01:51.869> much<00:01:52.020> everything<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.560> the

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
i'm only using this in a recorded game

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.020 
i'm only using this in a recorded game
and<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.409> don't<00:02:04.649> use<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.040> games<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.579> all<00:02:05.759> anymore

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and I don't use in games at all anymore

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.359 
and I don't use in games at all anymore
I<00:02:06.329> did<00:02:07.020> when<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> first<00:02:07.320> started<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:08.039> but

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
I did when I first started out but

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.300 
I did when I first started out but
there's<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.509> no<00:02:09.720> need<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.190> you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
there's really no need for but if you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.710
