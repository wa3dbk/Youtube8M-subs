we<00:01:25.770> don't<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> calculate<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.850> whole<00:01:27.030> lot

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
of performance for doing this we could

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
of performance for doing this we could
just<00:01:28.950> calculate<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.579> rpm<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
just calculate one rpm so I'm going to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.569 
just calculate one rpm so I'm going to
cancel<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.079> calculations<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.040> save<00:01:32.250> time

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
cancel the calculations to save time

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
stuff to to watch but since we're not

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.800 
stuff to to watch but since we're not
interested<00:04:30.940> in<00:04:31.000> performance<00:04:31.390> right<00:04:31.570> now<00:04:31.690> is

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
interested in performance right now is

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.020 
interested in performance right now is
pissing<00:04:32.080> about<00:04:32.320> Clarence<00:04:32.680> we'll<00:04:32.860> just<00:04:33.100> go

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
pissing about Clarence we'll just go

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.730 
pissing about Clarence we'll just go
over<00:04:34.060> here<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.780> like<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:35.050> said<00:04:35.110> well<00:04:35.470> we

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
over here and like I said well we

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.170 
over here and like I said well we
calculated<00:04:36.220> all<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.400> performance<00:04:36.940> for<00:04:37.120> all

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
calculated all the performance for all

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.140 
calculated all the performance for all
eight<00:04:38.080> or<00:04:38.260> ten<00:04:38.410> hour<00:04:38.560> PMS<00:04:39.130> we'll<00:04:39.730> go<00:04:39.940> back<00:04:40.120> and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
eight or ten hour PMS we'll go back and

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.110 
eight or ten hour PMS we'll go back and
click<00:04:40.450> on<00:04:40.630> see<00:04:40.810> engine<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:42.580> now<00:04:42.730> you<00:04:42.790> can<00:04:43.000> see

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
click on see engine and now you can see

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.840 
click on see engine and now you can see
the<00:04:43.240> valve<00:04:43.420> clearances<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:45.490> new<00:04:45.670> valve

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
the valve clearances this new valve

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.370 
the valve clearances this new valve
clearance<00:04:46.240> has<00:04:46.360> changed<00:04:46.750> I<00:04:46.840> think<00:04:46.870> this<00:04:47.230> was<00:04:47.350> a

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
clearance has changed I think this was a

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.830 
clearance has changed I think this was a
hundred<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.770> fourteen<00:04:48.160> thousand<00:04:48.670> before<00:04:49.090> now

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
hundred and fourteen thousand before now

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.110 
hundred and fourteen thousand before now
it<00:04:50.020> only<00:04:50.110> goes<00:04:50.410> into<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.770> piston<00:04:51.120> ninety

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
it only goes into the piston ninety

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.990 
it only goes into the piston ninety
thousands<00:04:52.630> but<00:04:53.290> over<00:04:53.560> here<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.830> intake<00:04:54.250> it

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
thousands but over here in the intake it

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.670 
thousands but over here in the intake it
was<00:04:55.270> going<00:04:55.660> into<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.930> piston<00:04:56.110> twenty<00:04:56.530> two

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
was going into the piston twenty two

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.250 
was going into the piston twenty two
thousand<00:04:57.190> now<00:04:57.280> it's<00:04:57.430> going<00:04:57.730> into<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:58.000> piston

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
thousand now it's going into the piston

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.870 
thousand now it's going into the piston
fifty<00:04:59.260> thousand<00:04:59.740> so<00:04:59.950> if<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.130> advance<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.640> cam

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
fifty thousand so if you advance the cam

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.620 
fifty thousand so if you advance the cam
on<00:05:00.910> this<00:05:01.270> your<00:05:01.840> intake<00:05:02.320> is<00:05:02.560> gonna<00:05:03.160> have<00:05:03.630> less

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
on this your intake is gonna have less

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.240 
on this your intake is gonna have less
piston<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.140> valve<00:05:05.169> clearance<00:05:05.830> by<00:05:05.980> about

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
piston to valve clearance by about

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.230 
piston to valve clearance by about
twenty<00:05:06.669> five<00:05:06.760> thousands<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:09.880> is<00:05:10.060> how<00:05:10.180> you

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
twenty five thousands so that is how you

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.060 
twenty five thousands so that is how you
can<00:05:10.419> use<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.750> engine<00:05:11.020> analyzer<00:05:11.169> Pro<00:05:11.770> to

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
can use the engine analyzer Pro to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.950 
can use the engine analyzer Pro to
evaluate<00:05:12.669> piston<00:05:13.030> valve<00:05:13.300> clearance

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
evaluate piston valve clearance

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.610 
evaluate piston valve clearance
