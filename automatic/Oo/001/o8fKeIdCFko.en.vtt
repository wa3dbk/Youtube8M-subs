sorry<00:02:56.770> that<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:58.590> looks<00:02:59.590> like<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.860> fits<00:03:00.010> very

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
sorry that and looks like it fits very

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.520 
sorry that and looks like it fits very
good<00:03:00.520> I'm<00:03:01.090> guessing<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.599> little<00:03:01.959> slip<00:03:02.260> car

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
good I'm guessing this little slip car

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.690 
good I'm guessing this little slip car
goes<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.280> hole<00:03:03.520> right<00:03:03.760> there<00:03:05.700> pull

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
goes to the hole right there pull

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.490 
goes to the hole right there pull
through<00:03:07.000> there<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.560> there<00:03:08.560> we<00:03:08.680> go<00:03:10.380> I'm<00:03:11.380> not

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
through there and there we go I'm not

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.850 
through there and there we go I'm not
sure<00:03:11.709> about<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:12.040> would<00:03:12.190> be<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.370> problem<00:03:13.860> and

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
sure about that would be a problem and

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.390 
sure about that would be a problem and
it<00:03:15.700> looks<00:03:15.910> like<00:03:16.000> now<00:03:16.989> that<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.380> ipad<00:03:17.920> is<00:03:17.950> in

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it looks like now that the ipad is in

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.430 
it looks like now that the ipad is in
the<00:03:18.489> case<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.120> magnet<00:03:19.599> doesn't<00:03:19.989> want<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.200> stay

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
the case the magnet doesn't want to stay

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.210 
the case the magnet doesn't want to stay
on<00:03:21.810> hmm<00:03:23.880> there<00:03:24.880> we<00:03:25.000> go<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.319> really<00:03:26.620> easy

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
on hmm there we go but it's really easy

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.449 
on hmm there we go but it's really easy
to<00:03:27.459> knock<00:03:27.730> off<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.780> don't<00:03:28.959> know<00:03:29.049> what<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.459> see

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
to knock off so I don't know what to see

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.030 
to knock off so I don't know what to see
if<00:03:30.580> maybe<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:31.000> can<00:03:31.269> break<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:31.959> or<00:03:32.200> something<00:03:32.410> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
if maybe I can break in or something and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.729 
if maybe I can break in or something and
it<00:03:33.610> looks<00:03:33.730> like<00:03:33.790> we<00:03:34.030> have<00:03:34.060> one<00:03:34.330> access<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:35.200> one

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
it looks like we have one access to one

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.030 
it looks like we have one access to one
little<00:03:35.950> cutout<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.940> has<00:03:37.120> access<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.040> dock

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
little cutout it has access to the dock

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.729 
little cutout it has access to the dock
connector<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:40.299> first<00:03:41.019> impressions<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.590> looks

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
connector so first impressions it looks

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.920 
connector so first impressions it looks
like<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.920> pretty<00:03:42.220> nice<00:03:42.370> case<00:03:42.700> but<00:03:43.599> I'm<00:03:43.690> not<00:03:43.810> too

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
like a pretty nice case but I'm not too

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.449 
like a pretty nice case but I'm not too
sure<00:03:44.080> about<00:03:44.110> this<00:03:44.410> magnet<00:03:44.709> because<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.340> does

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
sure about this magnet because it does

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.960 
sure about this magnet because it does
single<00:03:45.730> loose<00:03:46.090> now<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.810> ipad<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.970> inside

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
single loose now that the ipad is inside

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.259 
single loose now that the ipad is inside
this<00:03:49.299> little<00:03:49.630> envelope<00:03:49.900> type<00:03:50.560> case<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:52.090> we'll

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
this little envelope type case so we'll

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.039 
this little envelope type case so we'll
have<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.540> see<00:03:52.720> how<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:53.200> holds<00:03:53.560> up<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:55.049> we'll

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
have to see how that holds up and we'll

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.449 
have to see how that holds up and we'll
see<00:03:56.230> maybe<00:03:56.410> if<00:03:56.620> i<00:03:56.709> can<00:03:56.799> get<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:56.950> broken<00:03:57.340> and

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
see maybe if i can get a broken and

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.770 
see maybe if i can get a broken and
maybe<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.790> magnet<00:03:58.150> will<00:03:58.299> stay<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.570> little

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
maybe the magnet will stay a little

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.920 
maybe the magnet will stay a little
better<00:03:59.079> I<00:03:59.320> don't<00:03:59.799> know<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.579> we'll<00:04:00.730> see<00:04:00.940> but<00:04:01.900> I
