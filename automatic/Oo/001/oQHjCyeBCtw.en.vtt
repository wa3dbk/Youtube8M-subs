you<00:04:12.359> use<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> P<00:04:13.159> so<00:04:14.159> there's<00:04:15.000> our<00:04:15.150> folder<00:04:16.039> open

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
you use a P so there's our folder open

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.300 
you use a P so there's our folder open
this<00:04:17.130> guy<00:04:17.370> up<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.359> file<00:04:18.539> we<00:04:18.720> downloaded

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
this guy up and the file we downloaded

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.490 
this guy up and the file we downloaded
which<00:04:20.310> should<00:04:20.789> be<00:04:20.940> data<00:04:21.299> dot<00:04:21.599> bin<00:04:21.930> if<00:04:22.229> you

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
which should be data dot bin if you

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.730 
which should be data dot bin if you
downloaded<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:23.070> bottle<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:25.650> take<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.979> guy

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
downloaded the bottle you take that guy

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.760 
downloaded the bottle you take that guy
copy<00:04:27.729> them<00:04:27.940> into<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.240> folder<00:04:28.570> you're<00:04:29.440> all<00:04:29.560> set
