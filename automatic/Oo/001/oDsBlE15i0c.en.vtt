 such as 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.589
 dacha 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.659
 we are very close to our company 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.240
 we see 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.890
 we can activate the macro functionality 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.700
 first click focus 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.450
 very precise even if background comes out click 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.260
 click 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 sabtu options we have on the photographic part of course we can then 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.640
 send it to share it 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.560
 tarsu and we have the possibility to change the resolution 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.380
 the jog to change the mode of cans and shen water boxes are there 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.479
 several preset quacosa before the resolution 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.380
 the automatic flash speech active flash example very powerful 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.850
 despite being a flash LED I am aiming at xenon spots and allows us to take photographs 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.039
 very very good even in the evening 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.960
 night thing interesting video camera mode 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.980
 you pass this mode of contagion of possible resolutions 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 four deaths last 3g for you when we have not tested the certificate 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.180
 the first 3 and this because the result that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.690
 all we got I show you how 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.730
 theme on television as you see videos and photos 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.960
 and then I'll show you directly mounted on premiere 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.220
 abc telephony. report in front of our prediction of fate samsung 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.690
 we have web cam sd links with inside the file shot by omnia hd tv via 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.159
 mounts am movies as they are displayed directly on TV 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.190
 the first video 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.469
 which is what I show you was turned 640 to 480 pixels 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:14.949
 from the TV does not support the audio hill with which the mind of a director. the part 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:15.630
 audio 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.969
 safe TV exporting programs that 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:23.069
 the zoom of the set the book pan and good moon are there 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.140
 we don't have shots 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.050
 having the problems of course the definition 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.910
 it was quite limited to the lie club 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.589
 let's see now 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.760
 the second video let's go back 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:39.630
 and see 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.920
 video number 2 here it is that we shot a solution 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.439
 DVD 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
 hence the 720 by 480 pixels 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.749
 as you see youtube always a little bit holland 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.370
 what the definition is increased 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.730
 it's noticeably if we're a little zoomed 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.700
 a1 for 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.750
 and even when we have a panning problem we see more details we notice 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.400
 how the windows are more 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.620
 defined ums and also the people who walk therefore with this instruction 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.149
 we have an improvement of the image 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:24.219
 in the last video we have turned the third person reported to the resolution of 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.589
 720p then 1002 so much for 720 pixels 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.069
 someone's mind fills the whole screen for you and the sixteen ninths 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.790
 but let's see how 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.309
 the panning has some problems of waste is therefore 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:43.960
 take some trouble with this kind of resolution if we do 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.610
 bl panoramas and cody the movements I must surely have more defined details 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.900
 more marked though 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.380
 we have this the problem when we go with new ones 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.040
 with our phone, the zoom even here 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.689
 it's really powerful in diets 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.989
 we succeed in a straight line 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.939
 let's see the 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.650
 photographs that we have to say are really all respect are photographs 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.839
 that we took 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.390
 8 megapixels I start the TV momentum 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.810
 and how do you see the definition really connected with mine for video cameras 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.280
 then someone filtering through the camera then 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.910
 quad naked eye even better 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.240
 fast television and 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.559
 if you log me in as here 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.469
 very good detail 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.340
 of the photographs 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.770
 discarded 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.449
 with this on my own 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.110
 then there was a lot of light but also in the presence of darkness thanks to the zoom 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.080
 powerful see episode omnia we can do photo decidedly districts 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.280
 as the film monte remo su alm premier the ellen continues 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.069
 topless movie from omnia hd to make you realize the blame without a tv filter 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.069
 of these movies 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.699
 here we are back your friend you saw the resolution of the videos a lot 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.090
 good especially for scuba diving 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.020
 some shots regarding 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.180
 the laccadive then high definition video 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.560
 always staying with the death note text - I'm going to see the music player 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.539
 which does not differ much from the classic music player of 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.650
 even if you are looking for all the multimedia contents 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.520
 present in the phone 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.779
 guess what i do listen to 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.089
 Jokes aside 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:36.089
 we can leave 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.279
 you hear me the audio is really good the first the possibility of 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:48.719
 activate the sound channel 1 headphone and really the quality simplifies production 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.199
 with the audio it is very high and we go out to listen to it quietly even in 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:57.539
 machine no type of problem from this point of view also the 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:03.019
 viewing the art gallery so we send you in the video images 

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:08.539
 we have a small preview of all the images we have on ours 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.099
 phone we want to open one 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.629
 double click on the image that this is olmetec text also here 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:18.979
 the accelerometer works flawlessly that even the browse of the 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:23.560
 photographs take place in a very very simple way you want to put us some 

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:27.009
 second on particularly heavy photographs this a jalta photo 8 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:27.930
 megapixel 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.930
 we can consume photography 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.159
 so that we can catch everyone 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:38.610
 especially that I love photography of about 4 megabytes because it's a photo 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.090
 so after the megapixel colette the zoom is particularly interesting 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.610
 the tvt proposal the multimedia part of this samsung omnia hd
