we're combining beans right now we just
got<00:00:48.810> started<00:00:49.020> yesterday<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.890> them

got started yesterday on them

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.830 
got started yesterday on them
the<00:00:50.340> beans<00:00:50.790> are<00:00:50.940> put<00:00:51.120> into<00:00:51.240> the<00:00:51.420> green<00:00:51.600> tank

the beans are put into the green tank
and<00:00:52.080> back<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.380> me<00:00:52.500> they're<00:00:53.040> loaded<00:00:53.370> onto<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and back of me they're loaded onto a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.460 
and back of me they're loaded onto a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
livestock and soybean oil I would much

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.040 
livestock and soybean oil I would much
rather<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.500> crop<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.580> GMO<00:01:03.120> where<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
rather have the crop be a GMO where the

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.410 
rather have the crop be a GMO where the
amino<00:01:04.440> acid<00:01:04.949> has<00:01:05.010> changed<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.030> little<00:01:06.240> bit

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
amino acid has changed just a little bit

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.219 
amino acid has changed just a little bit
and<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.760> kill<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.210> specific<00:01:09.869> bug<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and it would kill the specific bug that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.070 
and it would kill the specific bug that
we're<00:01:10.410> going<00:01:10.590> after<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.840> spray

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
we're going after if I have to spray

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.650 
we're going after if I have to spray
that<00:01:13.320> field<00:01:13.640> hung<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.910> spray<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.360> field

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
that field hung out to spray that field

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.300 
that field hung out to spray that field
with<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:15.990> chemical<00:01:16.440> I<00:01:16.619> can't<00:01:16.920> go<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.190> that

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
with the chemical I can't go in that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760 
with the chemical I can't go in that
field<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.850> 48<00:01:18.630> hours<00:01:18.810> even<00:01:19.470> though<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
GMO and people say that's not natural so

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.130 
GMO and people say that's not natural so
much<00:01:22.500> better<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.979> me<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> crop<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
much better for me and for the crop and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.749 
much better for me and for the crop and

but we don't change in agriculture

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.039 
but we don't change in agriculture
overnight<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:53.099> takes<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.670> matter<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.269> years<00:03:54.569> to

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
overnight it takes a matter of years to

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.050 
overnight it takes a matter of years to
develop<00:03:55.680> new<00:03:55.799> technologies<00:03:56.549> or<00:03:56.700> new<00:03:56.730> ideas

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.839 
develop new technologies or new ideas
things<00:03:57.689> like<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.319> it<00:03:59.280> goes<00:03:59.519> through<00:03:59.730> a

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
things like that so it goes through a

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.330 
things like that so it goes through a
process<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.420> trial<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.900> error<00:04:01.139> so<00:04:01.319> if<00:04:02.010> someone

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
process of trial and error so if someone

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.580 
process of trial and error so if someone
doesn't<00:04:02.639> understand<00:04:03.090> what<00:04:03.329> we're<00:04:03.510> doing<00:04:03.659> it's
