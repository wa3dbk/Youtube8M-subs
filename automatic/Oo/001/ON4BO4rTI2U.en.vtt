00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.850 
some winning mini twists in my hair I
complained<00:00:12.360> by<00:00:12.509> three<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.780> them<00:00:12.900> being<00:00:13.139> too

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
complained by three of them being too

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.960 
complained by three of them being too
thin<00:00:14.549> due<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.740> lack<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.949> density<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.789> my

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
thin due to the lack of density in my

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.920 
thin due to the lack of density in my
hair<00:00:18.240> um<00:00:18.770> but<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.400> know<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.760> wet<00:00:21.090> them<00:00:21.359> up<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
hair um but you know I wet them up and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.220 
hair um but you know I wet them up and
it<00:00:22.500> shrunk<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.640> trunk<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.720> guess<00:00:25.109> that's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
it shrunk your trunk so I guess that's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.529 
it shrunk your trunk so I guess that's
the<00:00:25.350> negative<00:00:25.920> side<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.390> also

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the negative side of it but it also

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.560 
the negative side of it but it also
fluffed<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:29.160> bit<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:30.000> gave<00:00:30.240> me

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
fluffed out a little bit so it gave me

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
fluffed out a little bit so it gave me
some<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> body<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.619> looking<00:00:31.920> for

addition<00:03:21.160> petitioner<00:03:21.850> after<00:03:22.860> my<00:03:24.570> oil<00:03:25.570> this<00:03:26.440> is

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
addition petitioner after my oil this is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.910 
addition petitioner after my oil this is
because<00:03:27.130> I<00:03:27.900> want<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.110> oil<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.530> be<00:03:29.680> able<00:03:29.739> to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
because I want the oil to be able to

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.729 
because I want the oil to be able to
penetrate<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.700> don't<00:03:30.910> want<00:03:31.180> these<00:03:31.739> foreign

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
penetrate and I don't want these foreign

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.070 
penetrate and I don't want these foreign
chemicals<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.549> be<00:03:33.670> impeding<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.690> oil<00:03:34.900> from

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
chemicals to be impeding the oil from

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.410 
chemicals to be impeding the oil from
being<00:03:35.380> able<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.769> penetrate<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:36.850> ceiling

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
being able to penetrate so it is ceiling

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.850 
being able to penetrate so it is ceiling
but<00:03:37.570> if<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> right<00:03:38.049> oil<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.620> also

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
but if it's the right oil it's also

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.850 
but if it's the right oil it's also
penetrating<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.670> shaft<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:41.049> this<00:03:41.380> helps<00:03:41.590> to

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
penetrating a shaft and so this helps to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.780 
penetrating a shaft and so this helps to
help<00:03:42.760> seal<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.299> oil<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:45.040> water<00:03:45.340> and

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
help seal the oil and and the water and

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.340 
help seal the oil and and the water and
all<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.030> other<00:03:46.150> bits<00:03:46.360> of<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.720> put<00:03:46.900> in<00:03:47.049> at
