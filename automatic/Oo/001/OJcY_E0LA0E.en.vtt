00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and that's all good technical reinaldo 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.690
 andrade requests and today I'm here with 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.519
 test more interesting than putting 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.570
 simply a device inside 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.500
 water 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 this is the video showing the drop 10 of the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.039
 motorola moto and motorola motogp 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.140
 good folks how do you both know 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.920
 moto g4 moto and use the technology 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.970
 conif gorilla glass 3 ie they 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.759
 supposedly indestructible and also 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.460
 they resist very well scratches 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 We'll check it today, I'll check it out. 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.670
 I would like to say that I am not doing 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.040
 this test just because the motorola 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.559
 sent the two devices up because 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 this is my personal device and I 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.520
 I paid for it and I'm hoping that 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.550
 in the end I can I can continue 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.489
 using the screen normally without any 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.280
 good, the first test I'm going to do 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.890
 with device falling out of my pocket 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.100
 the second as if you had a call and the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.650
 third with the screen 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.890
 directed to the ground 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.560
 Let's see if the devices can 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.080
 handle this test well 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.080
 What do you think, let's go 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.079
 good folks how could you see the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.740
 bike g 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.469
 he had greater damages he must have fallen 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.429
 probably with this part here in the 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.750
 floor and how you can see the screen 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.020
 it broke 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.979
 not quite simply she opened 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:54.079
 here where he hit the first and he fell 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.539
 a position and I believe I'm not so sure 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.459
 how much the bush fell is the only problem is 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.299
 that we can see that on the bike and he 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:04.549
 opened at the time it fell and it hit 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.060
 right here in the back 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:12.640
 so it did not have any damage with the screen 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.640
 For now, let's continue our test. 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.550
 now it's our turn to take the test 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.410
 dropping the device from the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.990
 height of my head or be a meter 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.130
 and sixty to one meter and one meter and 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.920
 70 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.120
 the two devices they fell with the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.670
 bottom of the floor here you can 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.280
 see that part of the device frame 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.640
 was damaged as it already had 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.970
 happened with the bike and the part of the screen 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.320
 of the bike and so far it remains intact 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.360
 already the bike g passed by the first 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.600
 problem for the first drop of a 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.390
 way is not as easy as the bike and 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.810
 As you can see the screen is 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.250
 broken but it responds to the touch 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.460
 here I'm touching the device 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.650
 normally 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.360
 Of course it hurts a little because 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.730
 the screen is really shattered 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.900
 here you can see on my finger how 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.300
 It is the screen and suddenly to hurt 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.690
 user 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.690
 good good for the third and last test 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.010
 good staff this was the last test as 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.720
 you could see any of the screens 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.490
 could resist to fall with the screen 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.220
 facing the ground 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:19.310
 how can you see the bike here and he? 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:22.130
 including lost part of the and I do not even know 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.230
 say what this is but anyway is the screen 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.830
 It is also clear that the party 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:31.130
 white is the part of the edges that 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:34.490
 appears but here you can see that a 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.750
 piece of glass left here on the bike gp 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.650
 also almost left he is completely 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.540
 destroyed 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:50.540
 I would say not to touch the screen in that 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:55.060
 I was first passing a cloth to the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.060
 g bike is no longer working 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.990
 maybe a little pressure not no 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.460
 it works 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:11.410
 the motor screen and still maintained the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.900
 touch feature and this was my 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:19.390
 test the best 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.530
 this was the test drop of the bike and and from 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.220
 bike g 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:29.430
 as you can see, none of them 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.430
 kept resistant to falling until the next 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.510
 O
