00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.710 
so all i read in the board was cut a
hole<00:03:11.069> cut<00:03:12.069> to<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:12.910> drilled<00:03:13.180> two<00:03:13.330> holes<00:03:13.360> in

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
hole cut to like drilled two holes in

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.240 
hole cut to like drilled two holes in
its<00:03:13.870> over

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.530 

come<00:03:19.250> back<00:03:19.550> here<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:20.380> pretty<00:03:21.380> much<00:03:22.510> instead<00:03:23.510> of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
come back here I pretty much instead of

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.520 
come back here I pretty much instead of
using<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:25.930> smaller<00:03:26.930> one<00:03:27.200> here<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.910> used<00:03:29.530> that's

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
using the smaller one here I used that's

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.100 
using the smaller one here I used that's
not<00:03:30.770> alone<00:03:32.170> now<00:03:33.170> this<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.440> mountain<00:03:33.800> bike<00:03:35.110> so

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
not alone now this is a mountain bike so

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.440 
not alone now this is a mountain bike so
that's<00:03:36.950> why<00:03:37.070> I<00:03:37.130> use<00:03:37.160> another<00:03:37.550> life<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:38.000> would

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
that's why I use another life I would

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.710 
that's why I use another life I would
have<00:03:38.750> used<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.050> plastic<00:03:39.440> one<00:03:39.590> if<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:41.570> was

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
have used the plastic one if it was

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.690 
have used the plastic one if it was
being<00:03:41.990> max<00:03:42.200> for<00:03:42.350> something<00:03:42.680> doesn't<00:03:43.490> have

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
being max for something doesn't have

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.510 
being max for something doesn't have
enough<00:03:43.880> room<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:45.190> everything<00:03:46.190> fits<00:03:46.400> really

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
enough room so everything fits really

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.120 
enough room so everything fits really
well<00:03:46.670> just<00:03:47.590> with<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> couple<00:03:48.680> of<00:03:48.920> wash

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
well just with a couple of wash

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
well just with a couple of wash
generally<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.660> same<00:03:50.990> idea<00:03:51.290> except<00:03:52.150> instead

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
generally and same idea except instead

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.010 
generally and same idea except instead
of<00:03:53.300> drilling<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.800> couple<00:03:55.010> holes<00:03:55.430> there

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
of drilling it in a couple holes there

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.460 
of drilling it in a couple holes there
in<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.350> last<00:03:57.740> tools<00:03:58.100> leave<00:03:58.910> orals<00:03:59.470> very

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
in the last tools leave orals very

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.360 
in the last tools leave orals very
credible<00:04:00.770> front<00:04:01.130> I<00:04:01.340> had<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.210> cut<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.420> little<00:04:02.600> bit

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
credible front I had to cut a little bit

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.720 
credible front I had to cut a little bit
so<00:04:05.260> yeah<00:04:06.260> that's<00:04:06.920> just<00:04:07.160> in<00:04:07.280> case<00:04:07.460> you<00:04:07.610> might

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
so yeah that's just in case you might

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.910 
so yeah that's just in case you might
want<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.030> put<00:04:08.570> up<00:04:08.600> a<00:04:08.780> little<00:04:08.960> bit<00:04:09.080> more<00:04:09.290> for<00:04:09.350> me

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
want to put up a little bit more for me

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.050 
want to put up a little bit more for me
instead<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.280> trying<00:04:10.550> to<00:04:10.580> put<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:10.820> in<00:04:10.940> dead

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
instead of trying to put it in dead

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.180 
instead of trying to put it in dead
center<00:04:12.430> but<00:04:13.430> yeah<00:04:14.290> that's<00:04:15.290> pretty<00:04:15.650> simple<00:04:16.130> to

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
center but yeah that's pretty simple to

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.399 
center but yeah that's pretty simple to
make

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.790 

motion<00:04:19.409> like<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.129> worst<00:04:20.340> part<00:04:20.669> was<00:04:21.800> taking

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
motion like the worst part was taking

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.439 
motion like the worst part was taking
all<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:22.949> stuff<00:04:23.250> off<00:04:23.430> what<00:04:23.699> taking<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.210> gear

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
all the stuff off what taking the gear

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.909 
all the stuff off what taking the gear
was<00:04:24.780> like<00:04:24.990> forest<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:26.069> could<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.150> do<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:27.419> because

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
was like forest I could to do it because

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.330 
was like forest I could to do it because
like<00:04:28.919> until<00:04:29.159> finally<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.330> managed<00:04:31.319> to<00:04:31.409> undo<00:04:32.159> it

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
like until finally I managed to undo it

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.559 
like until finally I managed to undo it
but<00:04:33.770> wasn't<00:04:34.770> worth<00:04:34.889> trying<00:04:35.550> like<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.300> wouldn't

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
but wasn't worth trying like I wouldn't

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:43.429 
but wasn't worth trying like I wouldn't
do<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:36.900> if<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:39.050> just<00:04:40.050> get<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.259> thankful<00:04:42.439> the

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439 
do it if I just get a thankful the

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.399 
do it if I just get a thankful the

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 
but yeah

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.189 
but yeah
oh<00:07:11.150> I<00:07:12.680> was<00:07:13.680> thinking<00:07:13.949> of<00:07:14.039> putting<00:07:14.219> those<00:07:14.490> in<00:07:14.729> I

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199

oh I was thinking of putting those in I
don't<00:07:16.199> know<00:07:16.319> if<00:07:16.379> I<00:07:16.560> said<00:07:17.270> because<00:07:18.270> if<00:07:18.389> I<00:07:18.539> do

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 
don't know if I said because if I do

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.129 
don't know if I said because if I do
would<00:07:20.639> probably<00:07:21.029> take<00:07:21.150> a<00:07:21.180> while<00:07:21.330> like<00:07:21.870> another

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 
would probably take a while like another

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:25.999 
would probably take a while like another
day<00:07:22.409> just<00:07:23.400> cause<00:07:24.289> settle<00:07:25.289> half<00:07:25.409> apart<00:07:25.710> so<00:07:25.889> I'm

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.009 
day just cause settle half apart so I'm

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:33.349
