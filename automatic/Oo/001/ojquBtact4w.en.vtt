00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.860
 what happens to know that always charges and you 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:05.509
 I bring a new tutorial of how 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.490
 update your minecraft server 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.160
 a question that you have also asked me 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.990
 very much in the tutorial how to create 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.870
 a minecraft server which you have 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.539
 in the description and in a notation by 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.339
 the screen 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.349
 how to update your server 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.929
 minecraft as you see I have the server in 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:27.640
 the 1.6 point 2 and currently minecraft 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:29.050
 is in the 1.6 point 4 that I want to make 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.750
 If I want to update my server, 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.690
 we have to erase none of this except 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.100
 this except the minecraft cube that is 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.350
 in 1.6 point 2 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.019
 the server everything else stays like 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.990
 are we going to minecraft dot net and 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:48.320
 we just have to go to download 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.800
 and on multiplayer server we download 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.600
 version 1.6 point 4 of the server already 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.920
 we do not have to do anything else 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 then we replace it with the good one we 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.230
 we replace what we copy and paste it into 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.030
 the folder of our server and no longer 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.210
 has more now as ends 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.610
 download see it 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.799
 has already been downloaded and you will get this 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.670
 square that you will have downloaded 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.650
 in the download show download folder 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.940
 where you have the download folder 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.759
 basically then the only thing that 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.800
 we have to do is cut to open the 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.690
 folder where we have the server and 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.100
 pasting is already we can start and the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.869
 server is updated to there has not been 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.720
 that we did not have to do anything 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.850
 just download a new cube 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.440
 of minecraft by itself and until the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.149
 server is updated in 1.6 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.340
 point 4 you can continue playing at the same 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.600
 map the same players and everything like 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.270
 it was before we did not have to change 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.590
 nothing because it is already there was a lot 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 people telling me that I had to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.890
 erase everything to update no no 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.160
 you do not have to erase anything 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.369
 simply in version 1.6 point 2 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.810
 of the server in this case and download the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.340
 new version serves for any 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.500
 version I say it in all the videos but 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.080
 good in case someone has not 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.869
 seen serves for any version is 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 so you are in 1.7 you can remove the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.840
 1.6 point 4 delete it and download 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.340
 the cube of 1.7 and put it in the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.300
 folder where you have the server not 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.490
 have more I hope you liked it 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.630
 I hope it is served a greeting and 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.230
 see you in the next 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.230
 goodbye kids
