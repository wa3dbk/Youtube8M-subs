that<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.939> second<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.479> then<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.869> know<00:01:53.990> some

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
that in a second and then you know some

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.450 
that in a second and then you know some
of<00:01:54.350> these<00:01:54.470> some<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.740> these<00:01:54.799> other<00:01:54.979> ones<00:01:55.189> and

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
of these some of these other ones and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.980 
of these some of these other ones and
I'm<00:01:55.820> again<00:01:56.240> will<00:01:56.420> bring<00:01:56.630> stuff<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.899> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
I'm again will bring stuff in the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.380 
I'm again will bring stuff in the
description<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:57.860> judge<00:01:58.280> for<00:01:58.610> yourself<00:01:59.119> and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
description you judge for yourself and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.789 
description you judge for yourself and
make<00:01:59.509> your<00:01:59.689> own<00:01:59.719> conclusions<00:02:00.439> what<00:02:00.619> do<00:02:00.680> I

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
make your own conclusions what do I

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.330 
make your own conclusions what do I
think<00:02:01.270> look<00:02:02.270> I'm<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:03.140> super<00:02:03.619> genius<00:02:03.829> but<00:02:04.310> I

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
think look I'm a super genius but I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.830 
think look I'm a super genius but I
don't<00:02:04.579> think<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.850> takes<00:02:05.030> super<00:02:05.450> genius<00:02:05.719> to

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
don't think it takes super genius to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.149 
don't think it takes super genius to
figure<00:02:05.869> this<00:02:06.200> stuff<00:02:06.259> out<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:06.799> my<00:02:06.920> personal

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
figure this stuff out in my personal

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.279 
figure this stuff out in my personal
opinion<00:02:07.430> if<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:08.269> look<00:02:08.479> at<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.720> image<00:02:08.989> that<00:02:09.170> we

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
opinion if you look at the image that we

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.949 
opinion if you look at the image that we
have<00:02:09.470> here<00:02:09.830> you<00:02:10.099> can<00:02:10.369> see<00:02:10.729> there's<00:02:11.660> rocks

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
have here you can see there's rocks

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.100 
have here you can see there's rocks
everywhere

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
everywhere

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.170 
everywhere
okay<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:13.950> obviously<00:02:14.280> I'm<00:02:14.790> sure<00:02:14.970> different

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
okay now obviously I'm sure different

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.790 
okay now obviously I'm sure different
terrain<00:02:15.660> different<00:02:15.840> places<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.350> Mars<00:02:16.650> have

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
terrain different places in Mars have

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.260 
terrain different places in Mars have
different<00:02:17.100> things<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.460> can<00:02:17.580> see<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.850> rocks

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
different things you can see that rocks

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.290 
different things you can see that rocks
actually<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:18.780> quite<00:02:19.290> common<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:21.000> Mars

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
actually are quite common here on Mars

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.480 
actually are quite common here on Mars
so<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.350> have<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> rock<00:02:22.860> that's<00:02:23.070> out<00:02:23.280> there

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
so if you have a rock that's out there

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.650 
so if you have a rock that's out there
in<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.610> distance<00:02:23.790> you've<00:02:24.240> got<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.630> know

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
in the distance you've got you know

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.450 
in the distance you've got you know
you're<00:02:25.260> over<00:02:25.560> curiosity<00:02:26.160> you've<00:02:26.250> got<00:02:26.430> a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
you're over curiosity you've got a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.060 
you're over curiosity you've got a
fairly<00:02:26.790> flat<00:02:27.390> landscape<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.740> see<00:02:28.920> this

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
fairly flat landscape as you see this

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.310 
fairly flat landscape as you see this
here<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.550> fairly<00:02:30.360> flat<00:02:30.720> okay<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.110> got<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
here is fairly flat okay you got the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.050 
here is fairly flat okay you got the
peaks<00:02:31.530> over<00:02:31.680> there<00:02:31.950> off<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.520> right<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:33.000> I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
peaks over there off to the right but I

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.910 
peaks over there off to the right but I
mean<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:33.540> we're<00:02:33.900> curiosity<00:02:34.530> was<00:02:34.680> where

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
mean I think we're curiosity was where

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.890 
mean I think we're curiosity was where
that<00:02:35.040> one<00:02:35.220> image<00:02:35.490> was<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:35.880> looked<00:02:36.120> pretty<00:02:36.360> flat

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
that one image was it looked pretty flat

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.320 
that one image was it looked pretty flat
to<00:02:37.260> me<00:02:37.290> relatively<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.090> have

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
to me relatively and so you have

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.460 
to me relatively and so you have
something<00:02:39.570> in<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> distance<00:02:39.930> there<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.380> could

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
something in the distance there it could

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.830 
something in the distance there it could
either<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.950> iraq<00:02:41.520> in<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.390> case<00:02:42.660> I

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
either be a iraq in that in this case I

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.890 
either be a iraq in that in this case I
think<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.140> probably<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.740> rock<00:02:44.040> or<00:02:44.280> be<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.630> can

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
think it probably is a rock or be it can

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.820 
think it probably is a rock or be it can
be<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:47.660> pixel<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:48.900> messed<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.740> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
be a pixel that's messed up in the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.460 
be a pixel that's messed up in the
digital<00:02:50.010> image<00:02:50.459> now<00:02:50.880> am<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.840> fossil<00:02:52.200> pain<00:02:52.320> and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
digital image now am I fossil pain and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.930 
digital image now am I fossil pain and
that's<00:02:52.530> also<00:02:53.010> something<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:53.400> extremely

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
that's also something that's extremely

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.920 
that's also something that's extremely
common<00:02:54.840> okay<00:02:55.620> whether<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.220> are<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.600> had

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
common okay whether you are have had

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.410 
common okay whether you are have had
issues<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.800> computer<00:02:59.190> monitor<00:02:59.640> or<00:02:59.820> you

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
issues on the computer monitor or you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.240 
issues on the computer monitor or you
know<00:03:00.540> you're<00:03:00.810> watching<00:03:00.930> digital<00:03:01.560> TV<00:03:01.890> or<00:03:02.160> you

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
know you're watching digital TV or you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.640 
know you're watching digital TV or you
played<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.520> video<00:03:02.820> game<00:03:02.850> we've<00:03:03.540> all<00:03:03.720> seen<00:03:04.050> you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
played a video game we've all seen you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.770 
played a video game we've all seen you
know<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.820> pixel<00:03:05.820> here<00:03:06.030> pixel<00:03:06.420> there<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.720> don't

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
know a pixel here pixel there you don't

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.630 
know a pixel here pixel there you don't
look<00:03:06.930> messing<00:03:07.830> up<00:03:07.980> or<00:03:08.220> something<00:03:08.520> like<00:03:08.580> that

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
look messing up or something like that

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.600 
look messing up or something like that
that<00:03:09.330> doesn't<00:03:09.600> make<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.260> UFO<00:03:10.890> what<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.400> now

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
that doesn't make for a UFO what not now

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.000 
that doesn't make for a UFO what not now
all<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.239> people<00:03:12.390> might<00:03:12.750> think<00:03:13.010> differently

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
all the people might think differently

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.370 
all the people might think differently
but<00:03:14.190> that's<00:03:14.370> my<00:03:14.640> take<00:03:14.910> my<00:03:15.150> take<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.959> don't

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
but that's my take my take is I don't

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.620 
but that's my take my take is I don't
think<00:03:16.440> there's<00:03:16.739> been<00:03:16.800> any<00:03:16.920> UFOs<00:03:17.640> actually

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
think there's been any UFOs actually

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.740 
think there's been any UFOs actually
cited<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.170> Mars<00:03:19.500> since<00:03:20.070> curiosity<00:03:20.850> has<00:03:21.150> landed

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
cited on Mars since curiosity has landed

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.390 
cited on Mars since curiosity has landed
I<00:03:21.900> think<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.350> this<00:03:22.500> other<00:03:22.769> stuff<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.160> very

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
I think that this other stuff is very

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.310 
I think that this other stuff is very
explainable<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.690> other<00:03:24.870> thing<00:03:24.900> too<00:03:25.290> is

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
explainable and the other thing too is

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.990 
explainable and the other thing too is
like<00:03:25.530> okay<00:03:25.830> with<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> black<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.610> white<00:03:26.760> thing

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
like okay with the black and white thing

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.780 
like okay with the black and white thing
all<00:03:27.360> over<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.690> way<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.400> supposedly<00:03:29.400> stuff

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
all over the way like supposedly stuff

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.880 
all over the way like supposedly stuff

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
flies around when you have the really

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.090 
flies around when you have the really
grainy<00:03:32.370> bad<00:03:33.000> images<00:03:33.630> its<00:03:33.870> net<00:03:34.140> whatever<00:03:34.530> and

Crater<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.780> think<00:04:10.140> there's<00:04:10.320> some<00:04:10.500> real

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
Crater I think there's some real

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.830 
Crater I think there's some real
potential<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.820> think<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.180> read<00:04:12.360> something<00:04:12.600> where

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
potential I think I read something where

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.530 
potential I think I read something where
you<00:04:13.260> know<00:04:13.350> maybe<00:04:13.590> curiosity<00:04:14.579> was<00:04:14.850> laser<00:04:15.209> in<00:04:15.480> a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
you know maybe curiosity was laser in a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.759 
you know maybe curiosity was laser in a
rock<00:04:15.750> or<00:04:15.959> something<00:04:16.019> like<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.320> maybe<00:04:16.590> I'm

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
rock or something like that maybe I'm

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.920 
rock or something like that maybe I'm
getting<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.010> wrong<00:04:17.190> but<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.790> any<00:04:17.970> event<00:04:18.060> you

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
getting that wrong but in any event you

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.330 
getting that wrong but in any event you
tell<00:04:19.200> me<00:04:19.290> what<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.500> think<00:04:19.680> about<00:04:19.739> this<00:04:20.040> my

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
tell me what you think about this my

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.089 
tell me what you think about this my
take<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.700> on<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.989> one<00:04:22.200> image<00:04:22.530> thing<00:04:22.800> whatever

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
take is on the one image thing whatever

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.970 
take is on the one image thing whatever
I<00:04:23.340> think<00:04:23.789> that<00:04:24.060> is

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
I think that is

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.890 
I think that is
my<00:04:25.980> best<00:04:26.250> guess<00:04:26.400> is<00:04:26.580> at<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.060> rocket<00:04:27.510> distance

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
my best guess is at the rocket distance

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.240 
my best guess is at the rocket distance
maybe<00:04:28.110> that's<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.350> pixelation<00:04:28.860> messed<00:04:29.040> up

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
maybe that's the pixelation messed up

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.630 
maybe that's the pixelation messed up
