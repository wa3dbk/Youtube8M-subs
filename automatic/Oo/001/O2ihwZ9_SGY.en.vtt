morning<00:00:06.890> in<00:00:08.179> innovation<00:00:09.179> labs<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:10.969> it's<00:00:11.969> it's

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
morning in innovation labs and it's it's

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.950 
morning in innovation labs and it's it's
literally<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.580> problem-solving<00:00:14.960> methodology

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
literally a problem-solving methodology

literally a problem-solving methodology
looking<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.859> natural<00:00:17.279> world<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.789> models

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
looking to the natural world for models

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.980 
looking to the natural world for models
for<00:00:19.380> new<00:00:20.340> ways<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.730> growing<00:00:21.000> food<00:00:21.119> building

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
for new ways of growing food building

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.519 
for new ways of growing food building
buildings<00:00:23.779> harnessing<00:00:24.779> solar<00:00:25.019> energy

buildings harnessing solar energy
purifying<00:00:26.279> water<00:00:27.289> it's<00:00:28.670> it's<00:00:29.670> not<00:00:31.369> growing

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
purifying water it's it's not growing

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.240 
purifying water it's it's not growing
algae<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:34.020> using<00:00:34.250> organisms

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
algae it's not actually using organisms

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.190 
algae it's not actually using organisms
so<00:00:35.880> there's<00:00:36.059> there's<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.510> differentiation

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
so there's there's a differentiation

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.440 
so there's there's a differentiation
it's<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.489> borrowing

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's at this is actually borrowing

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.959 
it's at this is actually borrowing
nature's<00:00:39.899> ideas<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.129> what<00:00:41.280> I'll<00:00:41.370> do<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
nature's ideas so what I'll do to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.940 
nature's ideas so what I'll do to
explain<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.870> since<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.379> new<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.770> many

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
explain this since it's new to many

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.819 
explain this since it's new to many
people<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.820> give<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.030> some<00:00:45.210> examples

is not Kohler or nuclear or fossil fuels

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.420 
is not Kohler or nuclear or fossil fuels
it's<00:01:02.850> photosynthesis<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.220> there's<00:01:05.220> an

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it's photosynthesis and there's an

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.820 
it's photosynthesis and there's an
enormous<00:01:05.760> body<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.510> work<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.290> decades

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
enormous body of work going on decades

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.250 
enormous body of work going on decades
now<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:09.150> what's<00:01:09.689> called<00:01:09.810> artificial

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
now in what's called artificial

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.719 
now in what's called artificial
photosynthesis<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:13.159> we<00:01:14.159> basically<00:01:14.610> are

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
photosynthesis in which we basically are

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.780 
photosynthesis in which we basically are
looking<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.270> how<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> leaf<00:01:15.689> works<00:01:16.790> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
looking at how a leaf works and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.870 
looking at how a leaf works and
surprisingly<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.070> photovoltaics<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.759> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
surprisingly the photovoltaics that we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.289 
surprisingly the photovoltaics that we
know<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:22.439> most<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.640> do

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
know of the most of you know of now do

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.980 
know of the most of you know of now do
not<00:01:24.479> work<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.930> photosynthesis<00:01:25.799> they're<00:01:26.100> not

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
not work like photosynthesis they're not

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.210 
not work like photosynthesis they're not
photosynthesis<00:01:27.990> works<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> die

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
photosynthesis works with actually a die

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.690 
photosynthesis works with actually a die
with<00:01:29.610> chlorophyll<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> pigment<00:01:31.700> there

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
with chlorophyll with a pigment there

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.410 
with chlorophyll with a pigment there
now<00:01:32.939> our<00:01:33.299> solar<00:01:33.960> cells<00:01:34.409> based<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.030> called

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
now our solar cells based on it's called

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.819 
now our solar cells based on it's called
the<00:01:36.509> grid<00:01:36.720> cell<00:01:37.020> cell<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.590> dye-sensitized

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the grid cell cell or the dye-sensitized

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
the grid cell cell or the dye-sensitized
solar<00:01:38.070> cell<00:01:39.030> which<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> based<00:01:39.840> on

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
solar cell which is based on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.609 
solar cell which is based on
photosynthesis<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.630> other<00:01:42.840> work<00:01:43.290> that's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
photosynthesis the other work that's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.230 
photosynthesis the other work that's
really<00:01:44.070> promising<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
really promising I think in the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.920 
really promising I think in the
photosynthesis<00:01:45.990> realm<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:47.750> looking<00:01:48.750> at

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
photosynthesis realm is looking at

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.289 
photosynthesis realm is looking at
because<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> leaf<00:01:49.680> does<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
because what a leaf does is it it

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.730 
because what a leaf does is it it
doesn't<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.720> take<00:01:51.930> sunlight<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.439> turn<00:01:52.619> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
doesn't really take sunlight and turn it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.469 
doesn't really take sunlight and turn it
into<00:01:52.890> electricity<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.759> takes<00:01:53.970> sunlight<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
into electricity it takes sunlight and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.959 
into electricity it takes sunlight and
turns<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.810> into<00:01:54.930> fuel<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:56.070> fact<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.759> every

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
turns it into fuel in fact out of every

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270 
turns it into fuel in fact out of every
hundred<00:01:57.000> photons<00:01:57.750> 97<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.770> them<00:01:58.829> are<00:01:59.070> turned

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
hundred photons 97 of them are turned

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.410 
hundred photons 97 of them are turned
into<00:01:59.670> fuel<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.500> photon<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.280> fuel<00:02:02.640> idea<00:02:03.149> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
into fuel so the photon to fuel idea is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
into fuel so the photon to fuel idea is
really<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> think<00:02:05.040> where<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
really is really I think where the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.229 
really is really I think where the
research<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.360> very<00:02:06.390> powerful

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
research is going to be very powerful

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.040 
research is going to be very powerful
the<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.569> Holy<00:02:09.780> Grail<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.679> solar<00:02:11.640> cell

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
the the Holy Grail is is a solar cell

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.240 
the the Holy Grail is is a solar cell
that<00:02:13.050> would<00:02:13.319> do<00:02:13.530> what<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.860> leaf

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
that would do what a leaf

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.420 
that would do what a leaf
which<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.760> split<00:02:15.030> water<00:02:15.890> perhaps<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.190> bubble

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
which is split water perhaps to bubble

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.040 
which is split water perhaps to bubble
off<00:02:17.550> hydrogen<00:02:18.440> or<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:20.310> solar<00:02:21.060> cell<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:22.440> would

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
off hydrogen or a solar cell that would

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.720 
off hydrogen or a solar cell that would
split<00:02:25.050> water<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:26.090> would<00:02:27.090> then<00:02:27.690> go<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.200> to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
split water and would then go on to

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.850 
split water and would then go on to
create<00:02:29.730> some<00:02:30.240> sort<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.720> long-lasting<00:02:31.410> fuel

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
create some sort of a long-lasting fuel

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.880 
create some sort of a long-lasting fuel
some<00:02:32.070> sort<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.370> an<00:02:32.490> energy<00:02:32.790> storage<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:34.170> fuel

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
some sort of an energy storage in fuel

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.220

co2 the rest of the natural world
besides<00:03:12.360> us<00:03:12.540> don't<00:03:12.750> they<00:03:12.959> don't<00:03:13.200> see<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.530> as<00:03:13.620> a

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
besides us don't they don't see it as a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.490 
besides us don't they don't see it as a
poison<00:03:14.100> they<00:03:14.670> see<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.850> as<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> building<00:03:15.360> block

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
poison they see it as a building block

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.440 
poison they see it as a building block
so<00:03:16.500> some<00:03:16.830> really<00:03:17.160> interesting<00:03:17.400> work<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.120> going

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
so some really interesting work is going

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.449 
so some really interesting work is going
on<00:03:18.570> with<00:03:18.930> co2<00:03:19.590> as<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.250> feedstock<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:22.459> building

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
on with co2 as a feedstock for building

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.380 
on with co2 as a feedstock for building
materials<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.180> for<00:03:24.600> plastics<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.090> just

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
materials and for plastics so it's just

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.140 
materials and for plastics so it's just
another<00:03:27.780> thing<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.260> do<00:03:28.560> with<00:03:28.769> co2<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.910> there's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
another thing to do with co2 so there's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.610 
another thing to do with co2 so there's
a<00:03:30.209> company<00:03:30.540> right<00:03:30.989> now<00:03:31.140> that's<00:03:31.380> got<00:03:31.530> an

is a part of concrete that cause it's

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.449 
is a part of concrete that cause it's
literally<00:04:02.690> concrete<00:04:03.690> which<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.170> largest

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
literally concrete which is the largest

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.520 
literally concrete which is the largest
building<00:04:05.459> material<00:04:05.880> in<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.510> world<00:04:06.720> causes

building material in the world causes

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.380 
building material in the world causes
six<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.860> eight<00:04:07.920> percent<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.430> co2<00:04:08.880> emissions

six to eight percent of co2 emissions

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.360 
six to eight percent of co2 emissions
and<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:10.110> reason<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> way<00:04:11.130> we

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
and the reason is because in the way we

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.370 
and the reason is because in the way we
manufacture<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.180> we<00:04:12.329> actually<00:04:12.810> release<00:04:13.140> co2

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
manufacture it we actually release co2

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.360 
manufacture it we actually release co2
because<00:04:13.829> we<00:04:13.950> heat<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.130> up<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.489> much<00:04:15.769> what<00:04:16.769> the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
because we heat it up so much what the

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.090 
because we heat it up so much what the
calera<00:04:17.850> process<00:04:18.840> does<00:04:19.140> based<00:04:19.620> on<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:19.859> coral

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
calera process does based on the coral

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.480 
calera process does based on the coral
reef<00:04:20.310> which<00:04:20.579> makes<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:21.000> cement-like<00:04:21.359> reef<00:04:22.490> it
