00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
bake up but you've got to need to leave

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.740 
bake up but you've got to need to leave
it<00:03:54.479> like<00:03:55.639> 5<00:03:56.639> 10<00:03:56.819> minutes<00:03:57.120> before<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.479> put<00:03:57.659> it

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
it like 5 10 minutes before you put it

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.569 
it like 5 10 minutes before you put it
on<00:03:57.810> because<00:03:58.109> once<00:03:58.259> it<00:03:58.439> dries<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:59.009> is<00:03:59.159> a<00:03:59.189> really

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
on because once it dries it is a really

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.569 
on because once it dries it is a really
nice<00:03:59.699> Mac<00:04:00.030> fridge<00:04:00.389> um<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:01.979> quite<00:04:02.250> thick

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
nice Mac fridge um but it's quite thick

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.219 
nice Mac fridge um but it's quite thick
and<00:04:02.939> it<00:04:03.030> takes<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.329> little<00:04:03.389> while<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.659> dry<00:04:03.989> I

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
and it takes a little while to dry I

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.039 
and it takes a little while to dry I
probably<00:04:05.129> leave<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.519> like<00:04:05.699> 5<00:04:06.569> minutes<00:04:06.810> and

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
probably leave it like 5 minutes and

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.780 
probably leave it like 5 minutes and
before<00:04:07.439> you<00:04:07.680> put<00:04:07.829> make<00:04:08.009> them<00:04:08.189> but<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.459> really

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
before you put make them but I do really

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.929 
before you put make them but I do really
like<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.169> feels<00:04:10.519> fresh<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.819> it's

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
like this and it feels fresh and it's

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.469

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.580 
you feel like you're treating it which
you<00:04:19.289> should<00:04:19.530> because<00:04:19.889> it's<00:04:20.539> not<00:04:21.539> cheap<00:04:21.590> but

00:04:53.349 --> 00:05:00.570 
comes out much the same again kind of
like<00:04:53.470> a<00:04:53.500> blue<00:04:54.130> gel<00:04:58.740> but<00:04:59.740> I<00:04:59.919> feel<00:05:00.190> like<00:05:00.280> this<00:05:00.430> one

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
like a blue gel but I feel like this one

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:08.370 
like a blue gel but I feel like this one
rubs<00:05:00.759> in<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.940> bit<00:05:01.060> quicker<00:05:06.449> now<00:05:07.449> the<00:05:08.020> difference

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
rubs in a bit quicker now the difference

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.839 
rubs in a bit quicker now the difference
is<00:05:08.590> this<00:05:08.919> one<00:05:08.979> sinks<00:05:09.370> in<00:05:09.490> really<00:05:09.669> really

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.469 
is this one sinks in really really
nicely<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.419> one<00:05:11.380> alone<00:05:11.740> I<00:05:12.070> think<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:13.330> can

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
nicely and one alone I think you can

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.620 
nicely and one alone I think you can
kind<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.690> go<00:05:13.900> away<00:05:14.169> and<00:05:14.470> you<00:05:14.800> done<00:05:15.039> quicker<00:05:15.630> so

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
kind of go away and you done quicker so

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.089 
kind of go away and you done quicker so
it's<00:05:16.660> nice<00:05:16.960> worn<00:05:17.409> alone<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:19.530> mattifying<00:05:20.530> so

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
it's nice worn alone and mattifying so

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.589 
it's nice worn alone and mattifying so
if<00:05:21.159> you<00:05:21.310> were<00:05:21.460> going<00:05:21.940> out<00:05:22.120> we<00:05:22.240> weren't<00:05:22.419> wearing

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
if you were going out we weren't wearing

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.570 
if you were going out we weren't wearing
makeup<00:05:26.340> anyway

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
makeup anyway

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.589 
makeup anyway
if<00:05:27.729> you<00:05:27.880> were<00:05:27.970> going<00:05:28.120> out<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:28.270> not<00:05:28.419> wearing

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
if you were going out and not wearing

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.839 
if you were going out and not wearing
makeup<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.770> will<00:05:29.919> probably<00:05:30.340> be<00:05:30.490> choice

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
makeup and that will probably be choice

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.790 
makeup and that will probably be choice
if<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.810> want<00:05:32.020> something<00:05:32.289> to<00:05:32.349> go<00:05:32.380> under<00:05:32.770> your

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
and its pop fighting I would say this

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.110 
and its pop fighting I would say this
one<00:05:36.460> because<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.570> used<00:05:38.470> this<00:05:38.820> yesterday<00:05:39.820> all

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
one because I used this yesterday all

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.959 
one because I used this yesterday all
over<00:05:40.270> my<00:05:40.419> face<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:41.919> another<00:05:42.460> makeup<00:05:42.729> on<00:05:42.880> as

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
over my face and another makeup on as

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.550 
over my face and another makeup on as
long<00:05:43.210> as<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.419> could<00:05:43.509> possibly<00:05:43.960> leave<00:05:44.139> it<00:05:44.259> on<00:05:44.320> as

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
long as it could possibly leave it on as

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.920 
long as it could possibly leave it on as
a<00:05:44.740> true<00:05:45.039> test<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.729> it<00:05:45.909> just<00:05:46.060> was<00:05:46.210> not<00:05:46.509> shifting

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
a true test and it just was not shifting

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.370 
a true test and it just was not shifting
it<00:05:47.050> was<00:05:47.169> there<00:05:47.500> it<00:05:47.949> was<00:05:48.460> like<00:05:49.229> incredible

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
it was there it was like incredible

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.409 
it was there it was like incredible
so<00:05:50.590> no<00:05:51.190> probably<00:05:51.490> knew<00:05:51.639> nothing<00:05:51.820> that<00:05:52.180> was<00:05:52.330> the

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
so no probably knew nothing that was the

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.430 
so no probably knew nothing that was the
only<00:05:52.479> thing<00:05:52.659> that<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:52.870> use<00:05:53.080> that<00:05:53.229> I<00:05:53.289> use<00:05:53.409> a
