00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.230
 very pleased with the service and theme 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.740
 numerous products that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.360
 presented on this site I will immediately say 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.970
 that the package arrived in three weeks and 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.310
 as they wrote to me in the soap that will come 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.610
 sending exactly the number of which they 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.090
 wrote exactly that number she came 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:56.220
 and so I ordered two hair products 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.370
 and this means brand kerastase shampoo 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:02.700

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.090

 normal and prone to dry hair 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:27.030
 not yet used but I hope that this 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.280
 rattling on the internet 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 I will not disappoint the product was 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.560
 purchased by necessity 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 and this is a depilatory cream brand 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.679

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.139

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.679
 it really is so very easy 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:55.380
 apply you need to wait 7 10 minutes and 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.200
 then a spatula which is in composition 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.969

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.509
 epilation no problems with it 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:10.170
 slows hair growth after depilation 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:15.600
 I can tell you that this cream to me 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:19.590
 enough literally probably at the bottom of 7 and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.420
 then I already felt that hair 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 started to break through 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.430
 other creams still up to two weeks 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.920
 it's a hundred percent 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.849
 it contains the queen in the winter of youth q10 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.980
 aloe vera extract and silk proteins 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:38.580
 enriched with antioxidants smooths 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.069
 moisturizes and refreshes like a cream for 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.350
 depilation he is quite good he 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.190
 really didn't cause any allergies 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.010
 easy to apply hair easy to clean 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.430
 no skin problems , by the way 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.120
 without these red dots 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.130
 there have been very gentle and pleasant but to 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.080
 Unfortunately the result is not very 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.049
 satisfactory because all the same 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.630
 the week is probably too short 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.290
 term to use here 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.850
 so here 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:19.049
 cream creams such I really, really love 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.299
 you asked me to show this cream video 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.519
 tell how to sleepy panel or not 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.609
 because I posted the picture in 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.489
 instagram and I can say that such 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.600
 treshechka probably with the advantage of this cream 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.940
 nothing more I will buy and some 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.100
 other creams and the next two products i 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.579
 I bought a fly-in at the store 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:46.739
 and in their online store and it was two 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:48.810
 h2o plus brand and these are both 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 face masks 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.769
 so now about each separately 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:59.700
 the first mask is a face mask 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.430
 cleansing restoring balance here 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.269
 100 milliliters and how you can 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.440
 watch 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.209
 she is such a violet 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.819
 colors 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.519
 when I applied it you can of course 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.160
 imagine what a shock i was i 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.450
 very afraid that the face will remain 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.700
 same color but no mask is very easy 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.729
 put it smells quite nice 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.940
 she practically did not dry easily 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:33.009
 washed off this terrible color did not stay 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.369
 my skin was very smooth 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.099
 there was already a gentle velvety some 

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:41.169
 I do not have a special cleansing action. 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.659
 noticed as applied this mask 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:48.990
 just for the time being and the second mask 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:51.399
 it is a face mask 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.149
 weekly application which 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:05:00.180
 designed to improve 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:05:03.309
 complexion to stimulate 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.770
 oxygen saturation of the skin itself 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:09.969
 masochka looks like in this way in 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.370
 her here and the dispenser and I still honestly 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.349
 saying never tried but here 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.939
 now when you try what is it 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:22.330
 happen now i'm pumping it 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:24.639
 squeeze the mask on his arm in order 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.759
 to understand how it works at all 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.339
 So you see that the gel mask 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.330
 she's so know pretty thick but 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:36.909
 it is very pleasant and very, very 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.149
 easy to apply now let's see 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:43.539
 whether the effect is like a mask near because 

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:45.219
 it seemed to me that the oxygen mask then 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.819
 there is a mask which positions itself 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.729
 as 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.370
 oxygen saturation she must 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.999
 become like a foam that is you 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:58.330
 remember sometime in boxes and gm box 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:06:00.939
 boxing was a mask from near which is just 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.639
 did nourish the skin with oxygen which 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:06.370
 there was an awesome mask that is straight 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.979
 There was such a know a childish blush 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.189
 on the cheeks and the skin was very pleasant and 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.169
 here yes indeed this mask on the very 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.999
 really has the same 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.019
 action and here it is little by little 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:20.860
 starts to turn white 

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:23.620
 And I hope to turn into such a foam 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.129
 I like this mask as much as 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.830
 and a mask from near as she saturate 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:31.779
 I hope the skin is oxygen, I hope that 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.399
 she will stimulate some internal 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:39.519
 skin processes will improve complexion 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:41.769
 I will improve on all this of course 

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:43.870
 very much hopes and now yes you see 

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:44.490
 That's exactly this masochka she just did 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.180
 is an 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:52.139
 such a mask mousse mask foam which 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:55.289
 and when applied here it is the top layer 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:57.870
 she was all over for foaming and downstairs she 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:01.110
 gel texture remained 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.050
 I will very much hope that this 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.919
 the mask will work on the face and 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.490
 turns me into a queen and so this 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:15.180
 were my last summer grooming and 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.460
 such a few purchases if you 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.949
 something used something very important to me 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.979
 Please write your opinion that you are 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:26.039
 think about these products in the comments 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:28.349
 and that's all I'm saying goodbye to us 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:30.560
 see you in the next videos and bye 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:30.560
 until
