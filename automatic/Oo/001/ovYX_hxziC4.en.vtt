00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.130
 good friends of the foam system in this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.010
 occasion we bring you the review of this 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.070
 mini pinter min brand printer 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.070
 epson is a printer 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:28.870
 model t m 1 220 d 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.870
 this series 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.530
 220 to 16 200 are the candles 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.899
 series of epson printers more 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.230
 used for what are points of 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.530
 sale are quite easy to install and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.480
 the truth that very practical are prevail 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.040
 in this case this model that printer 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.190
 We are going to raise the dot matrix 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.430
 here it has the advantage that 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.670
 Can print with auto paper lime cable 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.019
 ingoal and what is original and copy to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.780
 lift this cover uses a tape 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:09.020
 continuous for what is printing and 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.600
 for what is the ink and then it is 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.410
 very economical also in terms of what 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.280
 is the consumables quite easy and 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.619
 practice of cleaning if you do not have 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.130
 auto cut in this case one has to 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.319
 be the hit manually through what 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.340
 which is a cutter that has here in 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:35.030
 this villa this model that we have here 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.750
 it's a model that comes with 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.560
 and usb connection 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:46.100
 and this connector that we have here this 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.530
 telephone type is to connect what 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.110
 is the money drawer and this what is 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.380
 the connector of what is the source of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.930
 power of feeding 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.909
 These equipments are usually modular for 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.520
 to be able to connect our type of cards 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.010
 the only problem then is to get the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.850
 module 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.800
 well the price in the market this 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.740
 type of equipment the truth is that they are not 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.680
 economic yes then the investment 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.530
 initial is a bit strong but what 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.020
 compensate with the low consumption of paper 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.570
 the low power consumption and obviously 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.220
 the cost the very economic truth of the 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.410
 consumables for these equipments 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.270
 is one of the most compatible printers 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.850
 65 mm paper 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.700
 reach very well for any receipt or 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.560
 tickets that you want to print and the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.720
 truth as I said is one of the most 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.930
 usual at point of sale because the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.939
 most of the programmers that 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.049
 create systems for point of sale 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.909
 use or create 75 tickets 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.209
 millimeters to be able to accommodate all the 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:55.280
 information so it worked very well 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.810
 with programs like my business post that 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.879
 they are the most used in four blocks 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.670
 point of sale or any other program 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.690
 of point of sale that you have 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.730
 installed 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.250
 Well, the truth is that it is a team 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.290
 quite recommendable is fast is not 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.480
 silent because there are dot matrixes 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.300
 so they will have to listen to the sound 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.810
 of the impression but as we tell you 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.100
 Although the initial investment is strong, 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.470
 because it is elevated and he 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.690
 consumption what is energetic of the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.960
 thousands and all the truth that they found 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.780
 quite economical in the long term well 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.620
 well this is our review of this 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.620
 type of printers 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.579
 We hope that the information will be of 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.790
 utility and see you in a next 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.790
 issue
