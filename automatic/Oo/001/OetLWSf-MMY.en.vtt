00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.440
 the entire region of Central Hesse had been at the game of the 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.630
 Year pleased the first point game of the deal between Wetzlar and metallurgical plant 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.700
 For a good 20 years, the masses have been electrified by the great rush 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.440
 Hall for a traffic chaos the lot was therefore first equal to the 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.060
 Delayed 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.270
 the 4412 spectators in the sold-out rittal-arena Sam at least in the first 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.220
 half 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.770
 a cheeky playing TVH hopefully the favorite from the start 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.780
 Matiaske honestly pressed under pressure to lead the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.120
 Hüttenberger put forward their accents with fast ball passages 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 and surprising passes 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.339
 here Sebastian Weber still fails on the strong hsg captain Nikolai Weber 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.730
 second to 1 lead hit fell anyway 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 again by a nice combination Sven Pausch you mark the hit 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.590
 Wetzlar, however, bites the aggressive three-to-one defense 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.230
 the Hüttenberger especially at the beginning of the teeth 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.960
 and once an attacker came through Bamba Matthias Ritschel in the box of 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.329
 TVH delivery 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.610
 the 25-year-old with a very strong performance in half one 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.740
 his opposite Nikolai Weber was in no way but here he directed the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.070
 Ball just so with the fingertips around the post of 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.070
 Wetzlarer impressed until the break with 11 splits Wetzlar found only against 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.520
 In the middle of the first half into play in minute 23 Steffen Fäth fights with 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.670
 All of them do the defense and network the new one to 8 for the HSG 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.990
 but shortly before the tea break, steel mill got the second air three again 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 Hit one by one for the TVH the other there was suddenly 11 to 9 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.980
 in front the climber would have taken this lead into the cabin 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.820
 The Derby might have taken a different turn but with the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.010
 Pausenpfiff succeeds Lars Friedrich still the psychologically important 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.520
 Balancing hit the heated Derbystimmung then discharged 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.020
 Hüttenberg Sebastian Roth with him went through the horses because 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.380
 Referee's refusal he received a 2-minute penalty 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.050
 and the TVH had to start second in the second half 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.200
 that can now benefit the HSG with full throttle from parquet and returned 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.689
 was fast with 14 to 12 in the lead 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.760
 and then you can also make such beautiful moves Kari Kristjan 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:25.139
 Kristjansson with a trick shorts shortly afterwards showed Las his evening 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.139
 Qualities as a veteran and Jonker 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.440
 the TVH got caught on the wrong foot the newcomer got in 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.950
 the first quarter of an hour only two hits 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.040
 Far too little for a Bundesliga game specifically in the game of the year against 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.239
 Wetzlar 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.400
 after the Wetzlar assault a 19 to 13 lead for the hosts was the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.689
 Game was quasi a quarter of an hour before the final siren decided 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.400
 Hulkenberg he has given up with 8 successful attacks in a row 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.069
 The HSG screwed their lead again to 26 to 17 Rauff in the final stages 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.279
 was allowed metallurgical plant there are still a little earnings cosmetics operate 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.109
 Nevertheless, both teams could be satisfied with the service Hüttenberg 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.569
 showed especially at the beginning of the first half really good approaches remains 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.639
 but with three losses for the time being on the last place in the table 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.340
 the HSG is full after three games in the should two home wins and one 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.340
 Unfortunate defeat means sixth place in the table 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.599
 apart from the Enstone percent from Cuba 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.379
 So it was really fun to do that 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.149
 As expected, the largest volume the audience wanted 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:36.069
 Federal Minister Brüderle 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.069
 Continued Elton away away Christopher 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.019
 unless of course to be of the result 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.859
 warming second half totally lost the thread through many 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.339
 Silver bulldozed completed 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.239
 have in defense percent 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.150
 not explained so consistently, of course, this is all 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.649
 a few lived 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:58.649
 that other players hurt that he set important accents 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.179
 Israel will 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:03.739
 Everything was what you wanted when the hall was sold out 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.439
 Mood was great 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.669
 it was a pretty hard-fought game, the defensive lines were as good as you were 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.169
 imagine 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.359
 yes, among us was very important that we just before the end of the duel 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.099
 Draws that he has and pushes a lot 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.239
 In addition, there were two minutes limp and we had the two-stroke the ball 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.909
 all of us knew we are actually the better team in principle 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.620
 Experience Erstligadebüt bring us to the plate 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.920
 and that's a very good warning under the second advent 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.770
 understood was used but 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.810
 have stayed well what will make me even more that deserves
