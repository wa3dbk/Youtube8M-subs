00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.640
 Something you might not know: Slim 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.780
 The first thing: I built a building that is such a big one. 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:35.500
 Let's see what happens when Slim is pushed onto the ladder. 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.600
 ... 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.880
 Technical difficulties, please wait a moment 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.220
 I made some minor changes to this thing, I think it should be fine now. 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:21.060
 Amount... I think those big ones are blocking other slimes from climbing the ladder 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.000
 I will kill one or two Slim 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.740
 I am playing! 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:59.260
 As you can see, only medium-sized and small Slim climbed the ladder! 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:09.900
 This is because the older Slime can't climb the ladder, maybe because it's too fat. 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.920
 You can create larger Slim in my World Vanilla version by command. 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.780
 The one I generated is a size 10 Slim, the naturally generated slime is only size 1, size 2 and size 4. 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.020
 It hurts! 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.140
 As their size increases, the distance and damage of the slime jump increases. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.560
 This is size 20 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.200
 This is size 40 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.220
 Oversized Slim behaviors are generally weird and cause some delay 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.660
 This is size 80 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.500
 Slime's size ranges from 1 to 256, but I don't want the game to crash, so let's do it first:] 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.240
 This is a surprise for you, but it depends on when you play this game. 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.560
 Slime will neither swim nor swim, anyway, I don't know, even though I played the version before 1.8... 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.000
 Version 1.8 has changed this 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:47.060
 Even if it is shot by a monster's arrow, Slime will not attack the monster. Terrible 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Yawn~ The sun is setting 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.420
 I better get a zombie before I go to sleep. 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.060
 Ah, now I can't sleep. Really annoying! 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.240
 Finally, I can make a slime and go to bed. 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:37.600
 Slime is not the same as other hostile creatures. Even if it is near you at night, it will not affect your sleep. 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.800
 You can now order clothes for men, women and children. There are links in the introduction.
