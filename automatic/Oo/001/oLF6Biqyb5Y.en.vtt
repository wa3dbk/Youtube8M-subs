00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:20.643
 We're working like crazy, we're going crazy! But we will resist until the end. 

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:31.672
 We are organized so as to make two rows, both those of the canisters and to fill up the machines. 

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:39.915
 We are all stuck because the flour was over and we went to load it with the machine ... 

00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:42.098
 because the trucks were all blocked. 

00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:57.307
 We are here to protest, there is little to say, we just need to do it and that's why we can't ... 

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:04.412
 later, it is for the whole population, we have come down to the square but this is everyone's problem ... 

00:01:04.412 --> 00:01:10.542
 who still may not have understood it. As for our sector, first of all it is diesel ... 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:25.728
 then all to follow, highway, costs, lengthening payments, non-legal competition that is what destroys us ... 

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:33.019
 non-legal competition, it is the big fleets that there are politicians in the middle as a first person ... 

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:44.160
 who know how to handle their illicit money. Just this. We came down here to protest, with the hope that someone ... 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.500
 listen to us or take the situation seriously, otherwise we'll end up in the civil war, we'll kill each other ... 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.280
 because as far as I'm concerned I'm a master, with only one car, I don't have drivers, I have nothing ... 

00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:10.080
 yet I have my difficulties, let alone those who have been hired on heavy vehicles, so at this rate we will not make it. 

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:16.530
 We ask what belongs to us, what touches us, what is right, how to live, pay for machines ... 

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:26.100
 pay employees, have a normal life that we've always done, the worse we go the more ... 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.120
 from 5 6 months, even the last month almost 0.20 cents of increase to diesel ... 

00:02:31.487 --> 00:02:35.570
 how do you do if the prices are always the same? We couldn't do it before, think about it now ... 

00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:41.330
 you earn more to stand still and we decided to stop, then we have the categories that do not help us ... 

00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:47.700
 because they don't already agree with each other and everything falls on us in the end. 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.970
 We must protect our employers, we must put ourselves in their shoes ... 

00:02:53.546 --> 00:03:00.140
 I'm just an employee, let's say, but we have to put ourselves in their shoes and protect them in all possible ways ... 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:09.480
 to keep everyone going. Then stop, stop all. These costs, we also understand that we are workers ... 

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:13.380
 because employers can't get by. 

00:03:13.887 --> 00:03:19.530
 We are here to strike to make our voice heard because the transport companies can no longer go on ... 

00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:25.220
 I'm an employee but my owner said that if he can't take it anymore he starts selling trucks, stopping ... 

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:32.810
 so as a result I am out of work, we also risk work, so we need to make our voice heard ... 

00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:38.410
 in the hope that someone up there in Rome understands that the situation here is really serious ... 

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:49.640
 go on like this you don't go, the management costs are many, the costs are so many, the payments for the companies are always longer ... 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:04:01.810
 and the costs increase more and more, costs of diesel, highway, insurance while the companies for which we work ... 

00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:11.660
 increase the payment of invoices, go from 45 to 60 to 90 so you don't go ahead, so ... 

00:04:11.983 --> 00:04:16.630
 we hope that something moves until Friday, we don't like being here in the middle of the road ... 

00:04:17.463 --> 00:04:23.270
 chaos for working people we're not creating because the people who go to work are working and we don't block it ... 

00:04:23.732 --> 00:04:29.540
 so we're quietly protesting without creating chaos to people I think ... 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.180
 more than this ... we are here for this ... we hope they hear our voice. 

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:41.610
 In the end, the price of diesel is not just about us, it also affects the population ... 

00:04:41.612 --> 00:04:51.130
 it concerns anyone who moves with diesel. We are waiting for a response from a change ... 

00:04:51.503 --> 00:04:56.800
 with the hope that there is this change, they are threatening us, suspending license ... 

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:04.650
 but in the end we are not being afraid, they suspend us the unfounded license it is better to stay still than not to work ... 

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:07.340
 not convenient, that is, one goes to earn more. 

00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:14.000
 We hope that in the end something serves all this, because in any case I put myself in the shoes of employers ... 

00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:17.630
 even if I am an employee, we try to help. 

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:26.240
 The important thing is that we come to lower prices and we are no longer competitive, because we can't make it with the expenses ... 

00:05:27.308 --> 00:05:30.610
 therefore we are automatically forced to lay off and stop.
