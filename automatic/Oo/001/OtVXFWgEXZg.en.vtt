00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.419 

okay<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.350> my<00:00:01.469> review<00:00:01.800> on<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.070> cube<00:00:02.340> for

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay this is my review on the cube for

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.180 
okay this is my review on the cube for
you<00:00:02.550> 3<00:00:02.820> by<00:00:02.970> 3<00:00:03.120> by<00:00:03.330> 4<00:00:03.629> cube<00:00:04.049> so<00:00:04.620> we've<00:00:04.830> got<00:00:04.980> all

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
you 3 by 3 by 4 cube so we've got all

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.570 
you 3 by 3 by 4 cube so we've got all
four<00:00:05.220> layers<00:00:06.060> fully<00:00:06.450> functional<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.580> since

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
four layers fully functional and since

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.669 
four layers fully functional and since
its<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.480> don't<00:00:10.019> know<00:00:10.080> how<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.290> describe<00:00:10.620> it

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
its I don't know how to describe it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.440 
its I don't know how to describe it
since<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.040> cube<00:00:11.250> turns<00:00:11.519> like<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.150> can't

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
since the cube turns like this you can't

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.829 
since the cube turns like this you can't
turn<00:00:12.809> these<00:00:13.440> layers<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:14.040> all<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.420> means

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
turn these layers at all so this means

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.140 
turn these layers at all so this means
that<00:00:16.139> we're<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.949> any<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.490> these<00:00:17.760> layers

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
that we're with any of these layers

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
that we're with any of these layers
you'll<00:00:18.539> always<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> turn<00:00:19.439> them<00:00:19.670> 180

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
you'll always have to turn them 180

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.769 
you'll always have to turn them 180
degrees<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.890> does<00:00:23.369> make<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.970> big<00:00:24.390> challenge

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
degrees so it does make a big challenge

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.019 
degrees so it does make a big challenge
I<00:00:25.109> mean<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.410> thing<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.650> hard<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.460> solve<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
I mean this thing was hard to solve I

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.750 
I mean this thing was hard to solve I
mean<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:28.260> hardly<00:00:28.859> anything<00:00:29.220> close<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
mean it's it's hardly anything close to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.659 
mean it's it's hardly anything close to
a<00:00:30.179> 4x4<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> mean<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> had<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.710> learn<00:00:31.890> algorithms

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
a 4x4 I mean I had to learn algorithms

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.639 
a 4x4 I mean I had to learn algorithms
yeah<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.170> yeah

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
yeah it was yeah

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.130 
yeah it was yeah
really<00:00:34.890> hard<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.239> yeah<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.870> cube

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
really hard so but yeah I like this cube

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.660 
really hard so but yeah I like this cube
a<00:00:37.200> lot<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.530> seems<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:38.010> function<00:00:38.190> very<00:00:38.610> well

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
a lot it seems to function very well

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.319 
a lot it seems to function very well
cuts<00:00:39.239> corners<00:00:39.480> very<00:00:39.930> nicely<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:41.219> yeah<00:00:41.820> let's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
cuts corners very nicely and yeah let's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
cuts corners very nicely and yeah let's
give<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:43.079> show<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> mechanism

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
give you a little show of the mechanism

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.979 
give you a little show of the mechanism
so<00:00:44.460> we've<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.969> these<00:00:45.450> little<00:00:45.660> center

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so we've got this these little center

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.420 
so we've got this these little center
caps<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.440> each<00:00:46.559> side<00:00:46.860> where<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.309> adjust

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
caps on each side where you can adjust

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.080 
caps on each side where you can adjust
the<00:00:47.760> tensions<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:49.050> each<00:00:49.680> side<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.399> for

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the tensions on each side and then for

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.729 
the tensions on each side and then for
the<00:00:51.360> other<00:00:51.390> 4<00:00:51.750> screws<00:00:52.020> they're<00:00:52.230> hidden<00:00:52.559> below

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the other 4 screws they're hidden below

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.619 
the other 4 screws they're hidden below
these<00:00:53.190> pieces<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.969> much<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> 4x4<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.680> its

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
these pieces so much like a 4x4 with its

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
these pieces so much like a 4x4 with its
screws<00:00:57.629> hidden<00:00:57.960> below<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.320> center<00:00:58.530> pieces<00:00:58.739> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
screws hidden below the center pieces so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
screws hidden below the center pieces so
as<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.760> tell<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> don't<00:01:00.899> have

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
as you can tell you know I don't have

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.420 
as you can tell you know I don't have
the<00:01:01.140> original<00:01:01.230> stickers<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.100> builder

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the original stickers on it builder

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.329 
the original stickers on it builder
tiles<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.409> let's<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.799> came<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.220> this

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
tiles and let's see it came with this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.370 
tiles and let's see it came with this
box<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.210> oh<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.600> by<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.900> did<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.229> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
box I oh and by the way I did get this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
box I oh and by the way I did get this
cube<00:01:07.619> from<00:01:07.799> pop<00:01:08.040> buying<00:01:08.340> calm<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.030> seemed

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
cube from pop buying calm that seemed

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.050 
cube from pop buying calm that seemed
him<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.930> most<00:01:10.430> cheapest<00:01:11.430> place<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
him the most cheapest place to get it so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.550 
him the most cheapest place to get it so
it<00:01:12.150> came<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.540> came<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.080> algorithms

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it came with this came with algorithms

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.940 
it came with this came with algorithms
which<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:15.049> haven't<00:01:16.049> looked<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:16.740> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
which I I haven't looked at because I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.320 
which I I haven't looked at because I
wanted<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> come<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.549> my<00:01:17.729> own<00:01:17.850> algorithms

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
wanted to come up with my own algorithms

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.200 
wanted to come up with my own algorithms
I<00:01:18.450> haven't<00:01:18.750> looked<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:20.210> yeah

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
I haven't looked at it but I really yeah

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.210 
I haven't looked at it but I really yeah
trouble<00:01:21.600> using<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.830> kind<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> weird

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
trouble using them so it's kind of weird

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.090 
trouble using them so it's kind of weird
alright<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.770> cube<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
alright so I think the cube is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.410 
alright so I think the cube is
definitely<00:01:26.490> worth<00:01:26.640> getting<00:01:26.820> I'm<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.210> sure

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
definitely worth getting I'm not sure

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
definitely worth getting I'm not sure
what<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> prices<00:01:28.110> anymore<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:29.130> pretty

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
what the prices anymore but it's pretty

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.899 
what the prices anymore but it's pretty
reasonable

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
reasonable

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
reasonable
now<00:01:30.540> I'm<00:01:30.810> sure<00:01:31.049> you'll<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
now I'm sure you'll like to see the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.179 
now I'm sure you'll like to see the
insides<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> basically<00:01:36.720> we've<00:01:37.350> got<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.590> normal

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
insides so basically we've got a normal

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.880 
insides so basically we've got a normal
normal<00:01:38.520> 3x3<00:01:39.180> parts<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.560> would<00:01:40.770> be

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
normal 3x3 parts like this would be

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.069 
normal 3x3 parts like this would be
considered<00:01:41.280> an<00:01:41.400> edge<00:01:41.520> piece<00:01:41.759> even<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.840> even

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
considered an edge piece even it it even

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.810 
considered an edge piece even it it even
has<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.259> basic<00:01:43.710> shape<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.040> an<00:01:44.130> edge<00:01:44.280> except

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
has the basic shape as an edge except

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
has the basic shape as an edge except
these<00:01:44.970> two<00:01:45.030> pieces<00:01:45.390> kind<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.869> fit<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.409> between

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
these two pieces kind of fit in between

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.160 
these two pieces kind of fit in between
where<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.009> goes<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> same<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> corner

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
where it goes in the same with a corner

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
where it goes in the same with a corner
an<00:01:49.350> edge<00:01:50.450> like<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:54.030> we've<00:01:54.210> got

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
an edge like this and then we've got

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.270 
an edge like this and then we've got
this<00:01:54.630> inner<00:01:54.930> layer<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.159> know<00:01:56.250> just

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
this inner layer in here you know just

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.969 
this inner layer in here you know just
like<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.119> v-cube<00:01:57.509> 6<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:57.899> each<00:01:58.049> gene<00:01:58.259> 4x4<00:01:58.799> this

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
like the v-cube 6 or each gene 4x4 this

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.249 
like the v-cube 6 or each gene 4x4 this
inner<00:01:59.159> layer<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.939> turn<00:02:00.090> freely<00:02:00.329> except

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
inner layer that can turn freely except

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.380 
inner layer that can turn freely except
they<00:02:01.649> they<00:02:02.100> got<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> way<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> keep<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.180> inner

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
they they got a way to keep the inner

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.870 
they they got a way to keep the inner
mechanism<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.200> alignment<00:02:04.500> let<00:02:05.460> me<00:02:05.549> see<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.820> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
mechanism in alignment let me see if I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
mechanism in alignment let me see if I
can<00:02:06.030> show<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.329> there<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.140> backlight<00:02:07.560> is

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
can show you that there the backlight is

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
can show you that there the backlight is
on<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> show<00:02:08.190> detail<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:09.090> notice<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.479> when

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
on the show detail now notice that when

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.900 
on the show detail now notice that when
I<00:02:09.690> take<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.170> edge<00:02:10.440> piece<00:02:10.500> off<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.730> inner

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
I take this edge piece off the inner

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.520 
I take this edge piece off the inner
layer<00:02:12.239> does<00:02:12.810> freely

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
layer does freely

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.460 
layer does freely
rotate<00:02:14.540> at<00:02:15.540> least<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.810> thought<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.110> did<00:02:16.230> never

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
rotate at least I thought it did never

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.230 
rotate at least I thought it did never
mind<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.860> doesn't<00:02:16.890> well<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.490> get<00:02:17.700> rotates<00:02:18.060> like

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
mind it doesn't well it get rotates like

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.630 
mind it doesn't well it get rotates like
this<00:02:18.270> alright<00:02:18.870> yeah<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:19.800> can<00:02:20.040> get<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.340> rotate

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
this alright yeah I can get it to rotate

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.460 
this alright yeah I can get it to rotate
like<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.600> how<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.990> keeps<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.350> in

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
like that so how it keeps it in

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.780 
like that so how it keeps it in
alignment<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.430> particular<00:02:23.790> inner<00:02:24.350> piece

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
alignment is this particular inner piece

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
alignment is this particular inner piece
so<00:02:26.790> let<00:02:27.000> me<00:02:27.060> pull<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.330> out<00:02:27.480> has<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> little<00:02:28.620> bump

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
so let me pull it out has a little bump

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.380 
so let me pull it out has a little bump
sticking<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.459> know<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> normal

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
sticking on it you know this is a normal

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.630 
sticking on it you know this is a normal
side<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.930> then<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.560> edge<00:02:31.739> piece<00:02:31.770> basically

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
side and then this edge piece basically

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.460 
side and then this edge piece basically
when<00:02:32.910> assembled<00:02:33.270> sticks<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.080> bump<00:02:34.319> it

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
when assembled sticks to that bump it

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.670 
when assembled sticks to that bump it
kind<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.709> snaps<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.190> place<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:36.180> yeah<00:02:36.959> that's

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
kind of snaps in place so yeah that's

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.900 
kind of snaps in place so yeah that's
what<00:02:37.830> keeps<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.130> inner<00:02:38.280> mechanism<00:02:38.790> in

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
what keeps the inner mechanism in

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.110 
what keeps the inner mechanism in
alignment<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.160> basically<00:02:41.430> my<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
alignment so that is basically my the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.880 
alignment so that is basically my the
same<00:02:42.390> thing<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.750> did<00:02:42.989> with<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.350> v-cube<00:02:43.650> six

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
same thing I did with the v-cube six

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.040 
same thing I did with the v-cube six
modification<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.790> know<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.360> instead<00:02:45.989> of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
modification you know this instead of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.509 
modification you know this instead of
gluing<00:02:46.260> two<00:02:46.470> pieces<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.980> core<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.310> glue

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
gluing two pieces of the core you glue

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.970 
gluing two pieces of the core you glue
two<00:02:47.670> edges<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.750> glue<00:02:48.989> up<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.320> edge<00:02:49.440> piece<00:02:49.739> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
two edges you glue up the edge piece to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.130 
two edges you glue up the edge piece to
an<00:02:50.190> inner<00:02:50.700> edge<00:02:50.940> piece<00:02:51.209> which<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.870> have

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
an inner edge piece which I have

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.900 
an inner edge piece which I have
considered<00:02:52.650> doing<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.220> really<00:02:53.400> it's<00:02:53.670> no

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
considered doing but really it's no

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.520 
considered doing but really it's no
different<00:02:54.390> than<00:02:54.450> gluing<00:02:54.810> two<00:02:54.930> pieces<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
different than gluing two pieces to the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.620 
different than gluing two pieces to the
core<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:55.920> fact<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.550> method<00:02:56.760> will<00:02:57.120> only<00:02:57.150> work

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
core in fact this method will only work

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.190 
core in fact this method will only work
with<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.170> axis<00:02:58.860> which<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.819> why<00:03:00.660> they<00:03:00.840> used<00:03:01.019> it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
with one axis which is why they used it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680 
with one axis which is why they used it
there<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.560> only<00:03:01.860> one<00:03:02.220> inner<00:03:02.519> layer<00:03:02.850> access<00:03:03.450> in

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
there is only one inner layer access in

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.900 
there is only one inner layer access in
there<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.650> let's<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.160> ahead<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.370> completely

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
there so let's go ahead and completely

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.690 
there so let's go ahead and completely
take<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.480> apart<00:03:09.800> okay<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.250> is<00:03:11.430> what<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
take it apart okay so this is what the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.600 
take it apart okay so this is what the
core<00:03:11.880> looks<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.890> we've<00:03:13.890> got<00:03:14.040> basically<00:03:14.489> a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
core looks like we've got basically a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.430 
core looks like we've got basically a
three<00:03:14.970> by<00:03:15.090> three<00:03:15.120> you're<00:03:15.360> looking<00:03:15.600> chord<00:03:15.900> so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
three by three you're looking chord so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.710 
three by three you're looking chord so
me<00:03:17.069> normal<00:03:17.760> three<00:03:17.910> by<00:03:18.030> three<00:03:18.209> center<00:03:18.480> pieces

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
me normal three by three center pieces

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.870 
me normal three by three center pieces
with<00:03:19.110> these<00:03:19.410> extended<00:03:20.040> center<00:03:20.310> caps<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:20.790> then

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
with these extended center caps and then

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.180 
with these extended center caps and then
we've<00:03:21.030> got<00:03:21.209> these<00:03:21.360> trimmed<00:03:22.079> down<00:03:22.350> Center

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
we've got these trimmed down Center

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.000 
we've got these trimmed down Center
pieces<00:03:23.630> that<00:03:24.630> look<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:25.140> doesn't<00:03:25.829> seem

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
pieces that look like that doesn't seem

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.090 
pieces that look like that doesn't seem
to<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.280> much<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.989> with<00:03:28.410> my<00:03:28.560> attentions

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
to have much like with my attentions

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.009 
to have much like with my attentions
here<00:03:29.430> I've<00:03:29.610> tighten<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.480> pretty<00:03:30.660> good<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.989> I

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
here I've tighten it pretty good and I

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.539 
here I've tighten it pretty good and I
don't<00:03:31.079> really<00:03:31.350> have<00:03:31.500> much<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.950> tensions<00:03:32.400> to

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
don't really have much of tensions to
