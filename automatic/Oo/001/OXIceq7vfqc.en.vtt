rolling<00:01:32.390> fakie<00:01:33.880> don't<00:01:34.880> lean<00:01:35.150> too<00:01:35.390> far<00:01:35.840> forward

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
rolling fakie don't lean too far forward

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.440 
rolling fakie don't lean too far forward
because<00:01:37.580> then<00:01:37.730> you're<00:01:37.910> just<00:01:37.940> going<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.240> shoot

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
because then you're just going to shoot

out<00:01:38.630> like<00:01:38.660> this

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.319 

you<00:01:49.259> want<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> continue<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> kind<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.460> kind<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
you want to continue to kind of kind of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.480 
you want to continue to kind of kind of
lean<00:01:51.509> back<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.950> were<00:01:53.070> doing<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
lean back as if you were doing to a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.100 
lean back as if you were doing to a
normal<00:01:53.939> fakie<00:01:54.149> half<00:01:54.420> cab<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.280> pop<00:02:00.110> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
normal fakie half cab so you can pop so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.630 
normal fakie half cab so you can pop so
that's<00:02:01.259> pretty<00:02:01.439> much<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.369> super<00:02:02.759> simple

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.760 

make<00:02:09.330> sure<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.720> don't<00:02:09.840> over<00:02:10.229> rotate<00:02:10.649> because

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
make sure you don't over rotate because

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.090 
make sure you don't over rotate because
then<00:02:11.009> you'll<00:02:11.630> primo<00:02:12.630> eat<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.040> you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
then you'll primo eat like this you

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.290 
then you'll primo eat like this you
don't<00:02:17.100> want<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.340> flip<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.580> too<00:02:17.760> much<00:02:17.940> that's

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
don't want to flip it too much that's

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.090 
don't want to flip it too much that's
why<00:02:18.890> that's<00:02:19.890> why<00:02:21.050> actually<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.350> try<00:02:22.680> not<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.860> put

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
why that's why actually I try not to put

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.570 
why that's why actually I try not to put
my<00:02:23.220> my<00:02:24.150> toe<00:02:24.210> too<00:02:24.600> far<00:02:25.040> didn't<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.100> just<00:02:26.250> you're

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
my my toe too far didn't you just you're

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.670 
my my toe too far didn't you just you're
always<00:02:26.790> you're<00:02:27.060> gonna<00:02:27.180> flip<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.630> you're<00:02:28.590> gonna

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
always you're gonna flip it you're gonna

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.590 
always you're gonna flip it you're gonna
flip<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:28.980> too<00:02:29.130> fast<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.880> usually<00:02:30.270> put<00:02:30.570> my

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
flip it too fast so I usually put my

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.440 
flip it too fast so I usually put my
foot<00:02:30.840> right<00:02:31.050> about<00:02:31.290> there<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.700> slower

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
foot right about there so it's a slower

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.010 
foot right about there so it's a slower
flick

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.170 

so<00:02:40.830> that's<00:02:41.370> how<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.550> think<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.850> have<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.090> have

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
so that's how you think you have to have

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.900 
so that's how you think you have to have
flip<00:02:42.420> go<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.530> try<00:02:43.710> them<00:02:43.860> zoom<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
flip go out and try them zoom in the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.120 
flip go out and try them zoom in the
streets<00:02:45.180> doing<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.720> parks<00:02:45.960> doom<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.010> your

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
streets doing the parks doom in your

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:55.150 
streets doing the parks doom in your
mom's<00:02:47.280> kitchen<00:02:47.490> whatever
