00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
you know get the courage to be saying
some<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> those<00:01:15.960> things<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.590> now<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> love<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
some of those things but now I love I

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.740 
some of those things but now I love I
love<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.850> don't<00:01:18.299> know<00:01:18.360> why<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
love it so I don't know why there is a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
love it so I don't know why there is a
rush<00:01:19.020> when<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> audience<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.220> really

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
rush when when the audience is really

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.270 
rush when when the audience is really
laughing<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.170> think<00:01:22.409> too<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.890> I'm

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
laughing and I think too because I'm

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.770 
laughing and I think too because I'm
used<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> singing<00:01:23.850> things<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> little

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
used to singing things that are a little

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
used to singing things that are a little
bit<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:24.990> innocent<00:01:25.530> when<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.640> say

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
bit more innocent when when I do say

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
bit more innocent when when I do say
something<00:01:26.970> that's<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
something that's so out of you know you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.499 
something that's so out of you know you
wouldn't<00:01:29.100> expect<00:01:29.280> me<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.579> say<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.119> it's

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
wouldn't expect me to say it it's it's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
wouldn't expect me to say it it's it's
got<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.140> punch<00:01:31.380> maybe<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009

there are some I struggle with lyrics I
I<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.820> never<00:01:51.000> I've<00:01:51.270> never<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.960> been<00:01:52.079> good

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
I was never I've never really been good

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780 
I was never I've never really been good

horrible my brother always laughs at me
every<00:01:55.860> Christmas<00:01:56.189> because<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.520> know<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
every Christmas because I don't know the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.920 
every Christmas because I don't know the
words<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.090> I've<00:01:57.180> been<00:01:57.240> singing<00:01:57.509> all<00:01:57.659> my<00:01:57.689> life

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
words that I've been singing all my life

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.660 
words that I've been singing all my life
you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.920> how<00:01:59.070> difficult<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.640> it

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you know and how difficult is it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
you know and how difficult is it
standing<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.270> front<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.930> few<00:02:01.110> people

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
standing in front of just a few people

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.389 
standing in front of just a few people
because<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.770> relatively<00:02:02.219> small

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
because this is a relatively small

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.770 
because this is a relatively small
theatre<00:02:02.909> probably<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> hundred<00:02:03.299> people

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
theatre probably a hundred people

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.179 
theatre probably a hundred people
something<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.009> more

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
something like that is that more

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.380 
something like that is that more
intimidating<00:02:05.850> because<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.180> literally

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
intimidating because you can literally

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.969 
intimidating because you can literally
see<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> whites<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.990> their<00:02:07.110> eyes<00:02:07.200> Connie<00:02:07.590> yeah

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
see the whites of their eyes Connie yeah

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.830 
see the whites of their eyes Connie yeah
you<00:02:08.039> know<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.670> little<00:02:08.910> bit<00:02:09.030> different

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
you know it is a little bit different

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.440 
you know it is a little bit different
although<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.470> was<00:02:10.679> visiting<00:02:11.009> my<00:02:11.129> home

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
although I just was visiting my home

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.380 
although I just was visiting my home
in<00:02:11.629> Pennsylvania<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.379> I<00:02:12.980> did<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> show<00:02:13.459> for<00:02:13.489> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
in Pennsylvania and I did a show for the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.809 
in Pennsylvania and I did a show for the
town<00:02:14.709> where<00:02:15.709> everyone<00:02:16.220> knew<00:02:16.370> me<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.610> know<00:02:16.730> my

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
town where everyone knew me you know my

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.009 
town where everyone knew me you know my
seventh<00:02:17.090> grade<00:02:17.209> math<00:02:17.420> teacher<00:02:17.629> was<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
seventh grade math teacher was in the

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.479 
seventh grade math teacher was in the
audience<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.680> was<00:02:18.800> probably<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.370> most

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
audience and that was probably the most

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.800 
audience and that was probably the most
intimidating<00:02:19.760> because<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:20.569> know<00:02:20.690> these

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
intimidating because you know these

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.059 
intimidating because you know these
people<00:02:21.110> knew<00:02:21.230> me<00:02:21.349> when<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.530> was<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> little<00:02:21.920> kid

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
people knew me when I was a little kid

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.520 
people knew me when I was a little kid
and<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:23.360> think<00:02:23.690> if<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.050> got<00:02:24.170> through<00:02:24.379> that<00:02:24.410> I

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
and so I think if I got through that I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.390 
and so I think if I got through that I
could<00:02:24.739> get<00:02:24.830> through<00:02:24.980> anything

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
could get through anything

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.729 
could get through anything
III<00:02:26.030> really<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> intimate<00:02:27.560> crowd

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
III really I like the intimate crowd

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.020 
III really I like the intimate crowd
though<00:02:27.920> because<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.430> feel<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.940> know

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
though because you I feel like you know

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.100 
though because you I feel like you know
it's<00:02:29.180> something<00:02:29.450> you're<00:02:29.569> sharing<00:02:29.930> and

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
it's something you're sharing and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.839 
it's something you're sharing and
