in<00:01:02.970> the<00:01:03.360> two<00:01:03.540> years<00:01:03.780> I've<00:01:03.989> been<00:01:04.019> associated

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
in the two years I've been associated

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.010 
in the two years I've been associated
with<00:01:04.920> nakshatra<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> first<00:01:06.810> time

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
with nakshatra this is the first time

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.840 
with nakshatra this is the first time
we're<00:01:07.229> launching<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.950> special<00:01:08.280> bridal

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
we're launching a special bridal

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.960 
we're launching a special bridal
collection<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:11.010> ad<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.580> something

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
collection and the ad was something

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.370 
collection and the ad was something
which<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.330> tried<00:01:12.570> something<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.140> little

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
which we tried something a little

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.840 
which we tried something a little
different<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.860> terms<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> look<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
different in terms of the look and the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
different in terms of the look and the
styling<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.320> think<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> first<00:01:16.979> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
styling and I think it's the first of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
styling and I think it's the first of
its<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> brand<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> hope<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
its kind for the brand so I hope that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.040 
its kind for the brand so I hope that
you<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.010> and<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.550> hope<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:21.660> ad<00:01:21.780> goes

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
you like it and I hope that the ad goes

something I'm very excited about and I

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.910 
something I'm very excited about and I
think<00:02:24.450> I'm<00:02:24.810> sure<00:02:24.960> Tara<00:02:25.170> has<00:02:25.350> already<00:02:25.680> found

think I'm sure Tara has already found

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.270 
think I'm sure Tara has already found
its<00:02:26.160> place<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.000> know<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.560> tradition<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
its place and you know as a tradition I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.040 
its place and you know as a tradition I
think<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.610> most<00:02:29.820> Indian<00:02:30.180> marriages<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.020> I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
think in most Indian marriages so I

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.510 
think in most Indian marriages so I
think<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:31.680> taking<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.220> little

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
think this is just taking that a little

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.400 
think this is just taking that a little
bit<00:02:32.610> forward<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.270> we've<00:02:33.960> done<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.170> very

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
bit forward and we've done a very

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.840 
bit forward and we've done a very
different<00:02:34.740> campaign<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.100> very<00:02:35.460> special

going to give you what you needed my
last<00:03:33.990> 10<00:03:34.230> films<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.680> thought<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:34.980> was<00:03:35.310> speaking

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
last 10 films I thought I was speaking

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.520 
last 10 films I thought I was speaking
Hindi<00:03:35.970> but<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.150> guess<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.540> wasn't<00:03:37.020> because<00:03:37.260> it's

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
Hindi but I guess I wasn't because it's

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.290 
Hindi but I guess I wasn't because it's
a<00:03:37.620> film<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.070> more<00:03:38.280> serious<00:03:38.490> nature<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.240> I

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
a film of a more serious nature and I

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.150 
a film of a more serious nature and I
think<00:03:39.330> people<00:03:39.750> when<00:03:40.380> someone<00:03:40.770> doesn't<00:03:40.950> more

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
think people when someone doesn't more

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.460 
think people when someone doesn't more
serious<00:03:41.520> film<00:03:41.760> people<00:03:42.030> think<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.600> maybe

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
serious film people think that maybe

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.170 
serious film people think that maybe
more<00:03:43.770> work<00:03:43.980> has<00:03:44.160> gone<00:03:44.310> into<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.060> know

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
more work has gone into it but you know

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.660 
more work has gone into it but you know
to<00:03:45.240> make<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.600> successful<00:03:46.260> film<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.250> hardest

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
to make a successful film is the hardest

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.400 
to make a successful film is the hardest
thing<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:48.060> think<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.570> is<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.810> hardest<00:03:49.230> thing<00:03:49.290> to

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
thing I think it is the hardest thing to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.830 
thing I think it is the hardest thing to
do<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.040> every<00:03:50.520> film<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:51.060> mine<00:03:51.330> by<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.600> grace
