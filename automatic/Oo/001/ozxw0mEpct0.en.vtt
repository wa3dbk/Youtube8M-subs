00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 a few things are very annoying 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.259
 having a website is one thing 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.300
 that it is always very difficult to get enough 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.530
 visitors get to your site 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.670
 there are companies that attract therefore 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.009
 are these for money out for it 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.199
 Via Google Adwords to Enough Visitors 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.510
 and enough traffic to your website too 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.770
 always get used to struggle and stroll 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.650
 to get it done 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.539
 and maybe you also have lasso and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.529
 other is the second point is you 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.060
 visitors who come to your website there 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.430
 to just have to see that they have something 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.320
 that they become customers so what we do 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.790
 only for all money websites is that the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.350
 most visitors 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 the vast majority of visitors are none 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.200
 customer 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 so if you have it on your website then 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.680
 they will not do anything so annoying 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.660
 And that's the quick search reason you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 except to make real nonsense via 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.539
 Internet she is not only a 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.800
 website needed but also 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.239
 and newsletter you also have you 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.079
 email marketing needs a chance 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.609
 you have to meet each other every time 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 you agree you have to take care of that 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.920
 such a visitor money goes to life or that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.200
 you just want to make your sales in the end 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.659
 as an entrepreneur and that of ordinary 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.369
 don't go with your newsletter so leave it 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.960
 become as working title life newsletter 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.740
 I think it's a terrible word 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.360
 it still explains in another moment 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.080
 but let's call it your newsletter 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.350
 you don't who makes sure he is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.030
 actually an onsen guarantee that you 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 constantly getting visitors on you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.360
 website thus you ensure yourself a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 the traffic to your website that is 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.290
 the beauty of a good newsletter and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.259
 a him it is already by the way 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.060
 newsletter there is news with it 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.250
 would spread or your business in the edm 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.140
 the word says a newsletter 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.000
 nothing is less true if you go to something 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.799
 and you are in your newsletter 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.170
 send news 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.119
 anyway basket 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.979
 is to convert but I again 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.700
 internet is your website and you 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.909
 newsletter 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.560
 work together as a system to become 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.450
 make sure you always satisfy and visitors 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 to your website and that you may 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.840
 give with also becoming convinced and the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.219
 take the next step towards and 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.869
 a conversion to an order to 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.119
 contact you or keep them secret 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.670
 just sign up for a training 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.930
 For example, here gives 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.069
 so that you need system of 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.690
 those two things that work together and 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.220
 thus people who are very serene 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.980
 be successful here that describes 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.519
 sometimes when someone makes marketing 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.690
 You are independent of Google so you are 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.670
 not constantly concerned with 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.410
 optimize for for example 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.819
 google from your website seo search engine 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.560
 optimization 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.120
 you are no longer constantly making money 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.370
 to throw in adwords or a facebook 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.630
 advertising to visitors to your website 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.090
 to get 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.500
 no you make sure you are there 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.959
 independent of you take care of yourself 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.410
 for visitors to your website and being 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.200
 also very warm visitors because you have them 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.930
 already through your newsletter and actually 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.430
 you work up convincedly over time 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.260
 a natural way in a pleasant way 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.730
 way to ultimately become a customer with you 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.720
 be that is the beauty of one 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.430
 newsletter and because one of the one of 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.450
 the biggest problems with selling 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.269
 and that is entirely with online sales 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.700
 People don't believe what you say hey 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.100
 overcome that she has come to believe 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.269
 one of the biggest wins that I have 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.500
 that you can achieve that you also have 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.709
 needed to be able to sell something 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.690
 and that work that goes very nicely with 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.040
 email marketing because they are people 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.019
 always something from you 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.519
 whether you receive that newsletter every month 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.709
 sends either every week or every two weeks 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.660
 does not matter but periodically with one 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.410
 they hear a regular reference again 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.590
 something from you 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.599
 do you there to trust that 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.190
 get that gun factor going 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.500
 to get the sympathy 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.109
 works great in email marketing because 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.030
 people who are not going to buy from you on 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.560
 the moment you want it 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.290
 People are going to buy more moment that they will 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.430
 want and that is possible then there is time 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.319
 needed often 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.730
 and buy your trance in that make in that 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.620
 get to know you are not immediately ready 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.329
 order something or go with you 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.840
 then customers are one more 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.430
 need time and that time that graphic 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.530
 by will get into you at whose light 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.180
 and through a very precise system 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.260
 actually having your website that 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.580
 cooperate with your newsletter and I have 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.930
 also a system itself 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.940
 I found out how in the lottery 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.410
 that works and I'm applying and I 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.180
 I have spent the last two years 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.370
 walked one always made sales 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.530
 via email marketing alone via my 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.910
 newsletter 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.180
 And what it needs is you 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.250
 website not only used as the place 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.020
 where the from transaction up to 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.130
 may come is like a humming contact 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.110
 to record with you 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.390
 sign up for your training or a 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.290
 place an order with you that you also have 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.000
 used to harvest e-mail addresses 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.350
 so you use that website with 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.210
 important function of that website 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.370
 that your e-mail addresses are high that you have it 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.340
 someone is being taught by your potential 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.660
 customer and that in you in your email 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.130
 system goes so that you are those customers 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.560
 can regularly go there email regularly 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.960
 that they will hear from you regularly and 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.190
 they become more and more confident 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.690
 you get you go they keep you going 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.580
 believe more and ultimately can also 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.400
 lead a sale 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.180
 I have had a very good one in recent years 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.370
 experience, and I have mixed 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.730
 it's up to it's much easier then 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.440
 you think 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.450
 if your company have difficult evil 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.220
 I don't feel like it and so that is every one 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.500
 a lot of work and it doesn't matter 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.260
 I often object to that 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.850
 email marketing and I have come back 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.830
 that it is actually not so bad 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.990
 is easier than I thought 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.310
 it is also much nicer than i thought 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.169
 is my meanwhile it really is 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.430
 highlight of my week to my email 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.720
 is who send I really enjoy it 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.520
 also because there are so many great responses 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.960
 come back from you 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.850
 so that is really a highlight in it 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.940
 that can also be when you get there 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.320
 Once in one starts to get customers 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.040
 its crazy about it being good at it 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.740
 responded 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.419
 it really creates a bond between you 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.550
 and your customers is a we things that 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.690
 printer and so awkward are those tape up 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.700
 bring about 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.270
 the cia a kind of sympathy and kind of 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.040
 Click with your customers that you face to face 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.650
 in a conversation or at an in 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.090
 phone conversation much easier 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.460
 because then are people who have a moment 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.630
 eye contact with you you also see if you 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.760
 body language 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.830
 we are of course totally human 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.960
 unconscious functioning beings too 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.490
 we think they are but different 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.650
 all kinds of unconscious triggers that come along 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:26.320
 work with face-to-face conversations that 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:27.910
 on the internet so have that click until it 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.919
 establish 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.229
 is just it's just that it costs that 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.970
 takes time and that time you have when you 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.729
 newsletter and you don't have one like that 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.110
 have your customers on your website for a moment 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.340
 must still be entrepreneurs then stared 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.000
 a bit so I do not visitors 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.070
 Get Your Website 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.750
 yes but then you want them 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.979
 in your system to really have one 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.900
 relationship with them to build on the 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.550
 customer to go with more and more clicks 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.039
 to gain an increasing confidence 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.510
 and it just doesn't work 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:53.950
 in a visit to your website to us 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.120
 most people finish 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.090
 this website does not yet visit us 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.260
 ready to slow those customers though 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.210
 get ready for that for that 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.990
 purchase decisions 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.289
 investment decision includes one 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.840
 ideal and I decided to go there 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:09.280
 next week a webinar pass 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.500
 giving me some things that I like 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.419
 I learned about the successful ones myself
