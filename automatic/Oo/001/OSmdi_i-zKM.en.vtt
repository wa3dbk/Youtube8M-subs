middle part and a rule of thumb I like

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.840 
middle part and a rule of thumb I like
to<00:01:14.700> follow<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.619> fill<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> eyebrows<00:01:17.400> in

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to follow is to fill in the eyebrows in

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.109 
to follow is to fill in the eyebrows in
the<00:01:18.750> direction<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.590> your<00:01:19.770> hair<00:01:19.979> growth<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.820> for

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the direction of your hair growth so for

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
the direction of your hair growth so for
the<00:01:21.210> outer<00:01:21.390> halves<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.020> my<00:01:22.080> brows<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.860> hair

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the outer halves of my brows the hair

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
the outer halves of my brows the hair
grows<00:01:23.520> downward<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.659> that's<00:01:24.869> why<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> brush<00:01:25.259> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
grows downward so that's why I brush it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.280 
grows downward so that's why I brush it
down<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.009> front<00:01:26.460> part<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.150> brush<00:01:28.080> them

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
down and for the front part I brush them
upwards<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.030> combing<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> through

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
brow but at the same time it looks

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.719

step<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.250> other<00:04:02.280> brow<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.990> as<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.410> can

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
step to the other brow and as you can

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.370 
step to the other brow and as you can
see<00:04:04.710> here<00:04:04.950> my<00:04:05.100> brows<00:04:05.340> aren't<00:04:05.640> completely

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
see here my brows aren't completely

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.190 
see here my brows aren't completely
symmetrical<00:04:07.380> it's<00:04:08.190> because<00:04:08.760> no<00:04:09.510> brows<00:04:09.780> are

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
symmetrical it's because no brows are

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.830 
symmetrical it's because no brows are
perfectly<00:04:10.740> identical<00:04:11.220> they're<00:04:12.030> sisters<00:04:12.630> not
