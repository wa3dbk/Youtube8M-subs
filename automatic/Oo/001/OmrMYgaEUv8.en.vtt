250<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.600> Volvo<00:02:57.870> s60<00:02:58.320> does<00:02:58.560> offer<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.920> little

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
250 the Volvo s60 does offer a little

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.530 
250 the Volvo s60 does offer a little
bit<00:02:59.310> more<00:02:59.460> room<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.880> back<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.330> little

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
bit more room in the back it is a little

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.330 
bit more room in the back it is a little
bit<00:03:00.720> bigger<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.230> vehicle<00:03:01.620> than<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.890> Audi<00:03:02.040> a3

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
bit bigger of a vehicle than the Audi a3

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220 
bit bigger of a vehicle than the Audi a3
so<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> little<00:03:03.300> bit<00:03:03.480> more<00:03:03.630> accommodating

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
so it is a little bit more accommodating

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.200 
so it is a little bit more accommodating

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
do like in a car let's see how many car

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.860 
do like in a car let's see how many car
seats<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.070> can<00:03:32.100> jam<00:03:32.640> in<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.030> trunk<00:03:33.300> now

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.780 

two<00:03:38.470> car<00:03:38.680> seats<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.099> about<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.489> limit<00:03:39.730> and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
two car seats is about the limit and

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.580 
two car seats is about the limit and
that's<00:03:39.940> due<00:03:40.090> to<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.330> height<00:03:40.599> of<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.110> trunk<00:03:41.409> in

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
that's due to the height of the trunk in

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.039 
that's due to the height of the trunk in
the<00:03:41.769> Audi<00:03:41.950> a3<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.909> isn't<00:03:43.299> terribly<00:03:43.629> tall<00:03:43.870> in

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
the Audi a3 it isn't terribly tall in

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.080 
the Audi a3 it isn't terribly tall in
this<00:03:44.140> opening<00:03:44.650> isn't<00:03:45.069> terribly<00:03:45.670> wide<00:03:45.849> either

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
this opening isn't terribly wide either

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.550 
this opening isn't terribly wide either
so<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.480> little<00:03:46.750> bit<00:03:46.900> more<00:03:47.080> difficult<00:03:47.530> to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
so it is a little bit more difficult to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.740 
so it is a little bit more difficult to
fit<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.860> child<00:03:48.129> seats<00:03:48.430> in<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:48.879> way<00:03:49.060> you

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
fit the child seats in this way you

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.390 
fit the child seats in this way you
could<00:03:49.959> fit<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.200> few<00:03:50.500> more<00:03:50.739> if<00:03:50.830> you<00:03:50.920> had<00:03:51.040> narrower

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
could fit a few more if you had narrower

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.680 
could fit a few more if you had narrower
child<00:03:51.760> seats<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.299> still<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:52.659> a
