from the exterior even though many

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.770 
from the exterior even though many
claims<00:00:33.710> you've<00:00:33.890> done<00:00:34.129> a<00:00:34.390> facelift<00:00:35.390> of<00:00:35.480> sort

and<00:00:35.989> as<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:36.289> can<00:00:36.410> see<00:00:36.469> apart<00:00:37.010> from<00:00:37.160> some<00:00:37.460> red

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
and as you can see apart from some red

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.979 
and as you can see apart from some red
arrows<00:00:38.179> there<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.539> maybe<00:00:38.629> a<00:00:38.690> little<00:00:38.749> bit<00:00:38.929> of

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
arrows there and maybe a little bit of

arrows there and maybe a little bit of
chrome<00:00:39.170> on<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.409> bottom<00:00:39.679> it's<00:00:40.190> basically

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
chrome on the bottom it's basically

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.189 
chrome on the bottom it's basically
identical<00:00:40.940> as<00:00:41.210> you<00:00:41.659> know<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:41.870> minis<00:00:42.079> have

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
identical as you know the minis have

identical as you know the minis have
been<00:00:42.320> for<00:00:42.530> many<00:00:42.769> years<00:00:42.920> now<00:00:43.190> now<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:43.999> change

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
been for many years now now the change

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.809 
been for many years now now the change
is<00:00:44.600> under<00:00:44.839> the<00:00:44.960> hood<00:00:45.170> for<00:00:45.379> 2011<00:00:45.980> are<00:00:46.159> about<00:00:46.609> as

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
is under the hood for 2011 are about as

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.540 
is under the hood for 2011 are about as
minor<00:00:47.269> as<00:00:47.569> the<00:00:47.809> changes<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.039> exterior<00:00:49.429> of

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
minor as the changes to the exterior of

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.979 
minor as the changes to the exterior of
the<00:00:49.609> car<00:00:49.760> we're<00:00:49.969> talking<00:00:50.269> about<00:00:50.359> a<00:00:50.510> 9

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
the car we're talking about a 9

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.290 
the car we're talking about a 9
horsepower<00:00:51.440> gain<00:00:51.890> from<00:00:52.249> the<00:00:52.519> 1.6<00:00:52.850> litre

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
horsepower gain from the 1.6 litre

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.819 
horsepower gain from the 1.6 litre
turbocharged<00:00:53.870> engine<00:00:54.140> here<00:00:54.319> in<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:54.499> Cooper<00:00:54.800> S

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
turbocharged engine here in the Cooper S

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.369 
turbocharged engine here in the Cooper S
and<00:00:55.760> again<00:00:56.300> that's<00:00:56.510> nothing<00:00:56.839> significant

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
and again that's nothing significant

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.459 
and again that's nothing significant
we're<00:00:57.469> up<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.649> 181<00:00:58.370> horsepower<00:00:58.519> though<00:00:59.059> and

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
we're up to 181 horsepower though and

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.689 
we're up to 181 horsepower though and
you<00:01:00.469> know<00:01:00.559> from<00:01:00.800> that<00:01:00.829> turbocharged<00:01:01.460> four

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
you know from that turbocharged four

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.079 
you know from that turbocharged four
banger<00:01:01.999> it's<00:01:02.179> a<00:01:02.300> 0-60<00:01:03.139> time<00:01:03.469> in<00:01:03.710> 6.6<00:01:04.699> seconds

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
banger it's a 0-60 time in 6.6 seconds

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.539 
banger it's a 0-60 time in 6.6 seconds
which<00:01:05.509> is<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.840> reasonably<00:01:06.530> quick<00:01:06.829> speed<00:01:07.159> and

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
which is a reasonably quick speed and

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.130 
which is a reasonably quick speed and
even<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.850> second<00:01:08.270> year<00:01:08.390> has<00:01:08.509> gotten<00:01:08.810> lots<00:01:08.960> of

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
even a second year has gotten lots of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.690 
even a second year has gotten lots of
punch<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.950> want<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.189> make<00:01:10.280> things<00:01:10.460> more

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
punch and you want to make things more

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.310 
punch and you want to make things more
fun<00:01:10.909> there's<00:01:11.149> a<00:01:11.210> great<00:01:11.390> sport<00:01:11.869> button<00:01:12.049> on<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
throttle response even better so again

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.539 
throttle response even better so again
just<00:01:20.630> heightening<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.409> cars<00:01:21.649> already<00:01:21.920> great

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
just heightening the cars already great

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.639 
just heightening the cars already great

driving dynamics while small those
horsepower<00:01:25.100> gains<00:01:25.369> are<00:01:25.610> gained<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.509> they

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
horsepower gains are gained and they

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.539 
horsepower gains are gained and they
come<00:01:26.899> even<00:01:27.469> while<00:01:27.619> many<00:01:27.829> engineers<00:01:28.250> managed

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
come even while many engineers managed

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.420 
come even while many engineers managed
to<00:01:28.729> eke<00:01:29.719> out<00:01:29.899> a<00:01:30.140> few<00:01:30.469> more<00:01:30.680> miles<00:01:30.920> per<00:01:31.070> gallon

so there's a lot of great functionality

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.449 
so there's a lot of great functionality
built<00:02:50.849> in<00:02:51.030> there<00:02:51.150> interestingly<00:02:51.900> um<00:02:52.410> mini<00:02:53.220> is

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
built in there interestingly um mini is

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.270 
built in there interestingly um mini is
really<00:02:54.030> focused<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.650> Apple<00:02:55.650> products<00:02:56.130> now

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
really focused on Apple products now

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.190 
really focused on Apple products now
unlike<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.970> lot<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.269> companies<00:02:57.690> they<00:02:57.840> did<00:02:58.019> some

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
unlike a lot of companies they did some

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.390 
unlike a lot of companies they did some
research<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.799> they<00:02:58.860> figured<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.310> they

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
research and they figured that they

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.160 
research and they figured that they
realized<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.730> most<00:03:00.180> people<00:03:00.569> who<00:03:00.660> buy<00:03:00.959> their

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
realized that most people who buy their

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.110 
realized that most people who buy their
products<00:03:01.560> are<00:03:01.980> actually<00:03:02.190> Apple<00:03:02.760> consumers

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
products are actually Apple consumers

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.339 
products are actually Apple consumers
they're<00:03:03.239> not<00:03:03.360> using<00:03:03.540> BlackBerry's<00:03:04.200> or

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
they're not using BlackBerry's or

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.960 
they're not using BlackBerry's or
Android<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:04.950> they<00:03:05.069> really<00:03:05.280> decided<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:05.640> then

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
Android so they really decided that then

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.160 
Android so they really decided that then
