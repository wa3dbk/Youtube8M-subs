so first up as you can see we have a
picture<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.630> our<00:00:33.750> motherboard<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.290> shows

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
picture of our motherboard that shows

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.110 
picture of our motherboard that shows
different<00:00:34.980> areas<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.969> actually

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
different areas that you can actually

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
different areas that you can actually
control<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> settings<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.280> change

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
control the settings for you can change

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.030 
control the settings for you can change
this<00:00:38.790> view<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> motherboard<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.590> each<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
this view of the motherboard and each of

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.590 
this view of the motherboard and each of
the<00:00:41.160> different<00:00:41.309> sections<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.300> memory

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the different sections like the memory

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.779 
the different sections like the memory
section<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.710> click<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.070> easily<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
section you can just click on easily and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.729 
section you can just click on easily and
make<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.180> changes<00:00:45.629> using<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> slider<00:00:46.440> bars

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
make your changes using the slider bars

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.560 
make your changes using the slider bars
so<00:00:47.460> memory<00:00:47.910> CPU<00:00:48.629> frequency<00:00:48.829> voltages<00:00:49.829> um<00:00:50.570> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so memory CPU frequency voltages um that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.020 
so memory CPU frequency voltages um that
is<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:52.289> able<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.949> changed<00:00:53.340> through<00:00:53.399> our<00:00:53.670> 3d

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
is all able to be changed through our 3d

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
is all able to be changed through our 3d
bios<00:00:54.270> utility<00:00:54.920> we've<00:00:55.920> also<00:00:56.129> added<00:00:56.489> some<00:00:56.670> new

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
bios utility we've also added some new

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.420 
bios utility we've also added some new
icons<00:00:57.600> down<00:00:57.899> at<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> bottom<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.800> well<00:00:58.980> so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
icons down at the bottom here as well so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.939 
icons down at the bottom here as well so
for<00:00:59.850> example<00:00:59.910> our<00:01:00.329> boot<00:01:00.539> priority<00:01:00.809> it'll<00:01:01.770> list

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
for example our boot priority it'll list

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
for example our boot priority it'll list
all<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.250> different<00:01:02.730> boot<00:01:02.910> devices<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
all the different boot devices that you

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.200 
all the different boot devices that you
have<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:04.229> hard<00:01:04.769> drives<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.519> thumb<00:01:05.880> drives

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
have your hard drives your thumb drives

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
have your hard drives your thumb drives
things<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.560> change<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
things like that and you can change the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.550 
things like that and you can change the
priorities<00:01:08.549> by<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.030> moving<00:01:09.600> these<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.229> only

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
priorities by just moving these I only

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.120 
priorities by just moving these I only
have<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.979> device<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.150> now<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.950> can

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
have one device on here now but you can

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.969 
have one device on here now but you can
get<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.670> meaning<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> also<00:01:16.140> languages<00:01:16.830> we

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
get my meaning and also languages we

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.520 
get my meaning and also languages we
have<00:01:17.070> multi-languages<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.180> time<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.750> z77

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
have multi-languages this time for z77

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.600 
have multi-languages this time for z77
platform<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.400> 3d<00:01:20.640> bios<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.040> again<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
platform and 3d bios so this again is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.270 
platform and 3d bios so this again is
for<00:01:24.000> more<00:01:24.420> novice<00:01:24.780> users<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.770> give<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> lot<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
for more novice users we give a lot of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.630 
for more novice users we give a lot of
help<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.780> sort<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.140> changes<00:01:28.640> what

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
help as to what sort of changes what

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.730 
help as to what sort of changes what
they<00:01:29.970> influence<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> board<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.380> so

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
they influence on the board are so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.289 
they influence on the board are so
people<00:01:31.950> actually<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.549> understand<00:01:33.090> what

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
people actually can understand what

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.300 
people actually can understand what
changes<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.020> made<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:35.070> for

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
changes are going to be made but for

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.640 
changes are going to be made but for
people<00:01:35.579> who<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.909> used<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> using<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
people who are used to using a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
people who are used to using a
traditional<00:01:37.770> bias<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.670> also<00:01:38.880> allow<00:01:39.150> them<00:01:39.299> to
