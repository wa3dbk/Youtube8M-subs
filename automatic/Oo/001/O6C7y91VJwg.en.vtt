00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
port coming up for go go already I'm

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.330 
port coming up for go go already I'm
very<00:06:39.660> interested<00:06:40.289> to<00:06:40.530> see<00:06:40.740> what<00:06:40.919> comes<00:06:41.130> down

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.500 
very interested to see what comes down
after<00:06:41.639> this<00:06:41.760> Stargate<00:06:42.090> because<00:06:42.990> the<00:06:43.260> wow<00:06:44.250> the

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
after this Stargate because the wow the

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.240 
after this Stargate because the wow the
citadel<00:06:45.510> of<00:06:45.539> a<00:06:45.720> tune<00:06:45.930> is<00:06:46.080> not<00:06:46.229> up<00:06:46.410> yet<00:06:46.440> so

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
citadel of a tune is not up yet so

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.830 
citadel of a tune is not up yet so
arbiter<00:06:47.580> is<00:06:47.639> going<00:06:47.849> to<00:06:47.910> be<00:06:48.000> tough<00:06:48.270> to<00:06:48.419> tech<00:06:48.630> to

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
arbiter is going to be tough to tech to

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.560 
arbiter is going to be tough to tech to
so<00:06:49.080> I<00:06:49.139> think<00:06:49.200> this<00:06:49.500> is<00:06:49.680> a<00:06:49.710> carrier<00:06:50.070> build<00:06:50.570> from

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
so I think this is a carrier build from

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.529 
so I think this is a carrier build from
Busan<00:06:52.910> although<00:06:53.910> it<00:06:54.000> doesn't<00:06:54.150> really<00:06:54.330> matter

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
he could just go for scouts in this game

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.580 
he could just go for scouts in this game

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
because it doesn't matter this game

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.550
