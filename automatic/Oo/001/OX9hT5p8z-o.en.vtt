this is the main part of the h80i in it
is<00:02:55.799> made<00:02:56.190> up<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:57.030> large<00:02:57.329> radiator<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.250> your

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
is made up of a large radiator and your

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.430 
is made up of a large radiator and your
block<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.970> pump<00:03:00.599> right<00:03:00.930> here<00:03:00.989> that's<00:03:01.290> all

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
block and pump right here that's all

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.869 
block and pump right here that's all
together<00:03:01.739> in<00:03:02.129> one<00:03:02.159> we're<00:03:02.609> going<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.790> go<00:03:02.849> over

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
together in one we're going to go over

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.759 
together in one we're going to go over
the<00:03:03.090> radiator<00:03:03.480> first<00:03:03.870> get<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.409> stuff<00:03:04.620> out<00:03:04.709> of

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
the radiator first get the stuff out of

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.160 
the radiator first get the stuff out of
the<00:03:04.890> way<00:03:04.920> here<00:03:05.250> radiator<00:03:06.150> is<00:03:06.329> actually<00:03:06.870> really

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the way here radiator is actually really

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.619 
the way here radiator is actually really
thick<00:03:07.609> normally<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.790> thicker<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.239> radiator

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
thick normally the thicker the radiator

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.990 
thick normally the thicker the radiator
the<00:03:09.750> better<00:03:10.170> their<00:03:10.349> performance<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.790> is

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the better their performance so this is

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.229 
the better their performance so this is
pretty<00:03:12.390> thick<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:14.239> 120-millimeter

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
pretty thick it is a 120-millimeter

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.409 
pretty thick it is a 120-millimeter
radiator<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.349> you<00:03:16.829> have<00:03:17.040> spots<00:03:17.639> on<00:03:17.849> each<00:03:18.120> side

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
radiator so you have spots on each side

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.530 
radiator so you have spots on each side
to<00:03:18.450> install<00:03:19.079> both<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:19.980> included<00:03:20.540> 120

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
to install both of the included 120

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.120 
to install both of the included 120
millimeter<00:03:21.870> fans<00:03:22.139> at<00:03:22.380> one<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.709> side<00:03:22.889> and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
millimeter fans at one on this side and

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.319 
millimeter fans at one on this side and
of<00:03:23.819> course<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.799> other<00:03:26.069> now<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
of course one on the other now the

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.869 
of course one on the other now the
tubing<00:03:27.750> here<00:03:28.079> is<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.290> very<00:03:28.980> thick<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:29.489> much

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
tubing here is a very thick it's much

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.900 
tubing here is a very thick it's much
thicker<00:03:30.180> than<00:03:30.419> the<00:03:30.480> original<00:03:31.019> h80<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:32.579> of

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
thicker than the original h80 and of

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.339 
thicker than the original h80 and of
course<00:03:32.970> that's<00:03:33.269> going<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.540> make<00:03:33.840> for<00:03:33.900> better

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
course that's going to make for better

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.800 
course that's going to make for better
water<00:03:34.739> flow<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.879> it's<00:03:36.150> said<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.419> be<00:03:36.540> you

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
water flow and this it's said to be you

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.839 
water flow and this it's said to be you
know<00:03:36.930> less<00:03:37.169> kinks<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.950> line<00:03:38.099> as<00:03:38.310> well<00:03:38.519> of

you can pretty much make it any color
you<00:04:07.949> want<00:04:07.980> through<00:04:08.879> the<00:04:09.030> software<00:04:09.569> so<00:04:09.780> you

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
you want through the software so you

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.020 
you want through the software so you
know<00:04:10.199> if<00:04:10.650> your<00:04:10.919> case<00:04:11.129> fans<00:04:11.400> are<00:04:11.579> blue<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.790> can

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
know if your case fans are blue you can

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.699 
know if your case fans are blue you can
make<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.269> blue<00:04:12.449> if<00:04:12.690> your<00:04:13.109> case<00:04:13.199> fans<00:04:13.500> are

orange<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.549> make<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.849> orange<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.209> match

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
orange you can make it orange to match

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.550 
orange you can make it orange to match
that<00:04:15.540> it's<00:04:15.900> going<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.079> look<00:04:16.169> really<00:04:16.199> cool

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
that it's going to look really cool

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.860 
that it's going to look really cool
especially<00:04:17.250> if<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.849> have<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:18.209> window<00:04:18.630> inside

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
especially if you have a window inside

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.360 
especially if you have a window inside
of<00:04:19.260> your<00:04:19.349> case<00:04:19.530> now<00:04:19.739> there<00:04:19.859> are<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.039> lot<00:04:20.340> of

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
of your case now there are a lot of

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.300 
of your case now there are a lot of
connections<00:04:20.669> actually<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:22.530> first

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
connections actually on this so first

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.459 
connections actually on this so first
you<00:04:23.610> have<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:24.120> SATA<00:04:24.510> power<00:04:24.690> connection<00:04:25.140> which<00:04:25.289> I

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
you have a SATA power connection which I

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:26.850 
you have a SATA power connection which I
do<00:04:25.590> like<00:04:26.159> you<00:04:26.669> know

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
do like you know

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.619 
do like you know
molex<00:04:27.219> is<00:04:27.430> starting<00:04:27.939> to<00:04:28.030> be<00:04:28.150> phased<00:04:28.419> out

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:28.629 
molex is starting to be phased out

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.029 
molex is starting to be phased out
especially<00:04:28.930> since<00:04:29.439> the<00:04:29.560> only<00:04:29.770> thing<00:04:29.919> that

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
especially since the only thing that

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.649 
especially since the only thing that
really<00:04:30.159> uses<00:04:30.520> molex<00:04:30.849> connections<00:04:31.300> anymore

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
really uses molex connections anymore

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:36.240 
really uses molex connections anymore
our<00:04:32.490> accessories<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.849> maybe<00:04:34.620> older<00:04:35.620> fans<00:04:35.889> so

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
our accessories and maybe older fans so

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.429 
our accessories and maybe older fans so
you<00:04:36.310> have<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.849> which<00:04:37.569> powers<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:37.990> unit<00:04:38.319> and

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
you have that which powers the unit and

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.200 
you have that which powers the unit and
then<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.770> have<00:04:38.979> this<00:04:39.580> little<00:04:39.759> connector

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
then you have this little connector

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.209 
then you have this little connector
right<00:04:40.330> here<00:04:40.389> which<00:04:40.719> goes<00:04:40.990> into<00:04:41.439> the<00:04:41.979> fan

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
right here which goes into the fan

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.670 
right here which goes into the fan
header<00:04:42.460> in<00:04:42.639> your<00:04:42.879> motherboard<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.509> then<00:04:44.500> you

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
header in your motherboard and then you

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.240 
header in your motherboard and then you
have<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:46.270> guys<00:04:46.360> can<00:04:46.659> see<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.319> you<00:04:48.129> have

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
have you guys can see that you have

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.159 
have you guys can see that you have
these<00:04:48.400> two<00:04:48.580> connections<00:04:49.090> right<00:04:49.599> there<00:04:49.930> and

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
these two connections right there and

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.580 
these two connections right there and
those<00:04:51.069> connections<00:04:51.669> are<00:04:51.909> for<00:04:52.509> the<00:04:52.810> fans<00:04:53.080> you

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
those connections are for the fans you

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.219 
those connections are for the fans you
can<00:04:53.740> actually<00:04:54.069> connect<00:04:54.400> two<00:04:54.909> of<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.810> Corsair

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
can actually connect two of the Corsair

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.950 
can actually connect two of the Corsair
link<00:04:56.469> fans<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:57.159> this<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:58.270> each<00:04:58.509> connection

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
link fans to this so each connection

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.589 
link fans to this so each connection
actually<00:04:59.949> powers<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.400> fans<00:05:00.669> for<00:05:00.939> a<00:05:00.969> total<00:05:01.479> of

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
actually powers to fans for a total of

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.649 
actually powers to fans for a total of
four<00:05:02.409> so<00:05:02.800> what<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.340> does<00:05:03.669> is<00:05:03.909> with<00:05:04.449> these

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
four so what that does is with these

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.839 
four so what that does is with these
included<00:05:05.020> fans<00:05:05.289> they<00:05:05.500> do<00:05:05.560> include<00:05:06.129> the<00:05:06.460> wiring

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
included fans they do include the wiring

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.670 
included fans they do include the wiring
harness<00:05:07.180> for<00:05:07.509> it<00:05:07.689> so<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.169> can<00:05:08.349> connect<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
harness for it so you can connect the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.559 
harness for it so you can connect the
two<00:05:08.830> fans<00:05:09.099> with<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.669> and<00:05:09.879> then<00:05:10.060> through

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
two fans with this and then through

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.170 
two fans with this and then through
Corsairs<00:05:11.080> link<00:05:11.379> software<00:05:12.069> you<00:05:12.460> can<00:05:12.490> monitor

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
Corsairs link software you can monitor

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.360 
Corsairs link software you can monitor
both<00:05:13.779> the<00:05:13.990> fans<00:05:14.199> change<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.710> speeds<00:05:14.949> do<00:05:15.159> all

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
both the fans change the speeds do all

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.249 
both the fans change the speeds do all
of<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.550> within<00:05:15.969> the<00:05:16.389> software<00:05:16.599> itself<00:05:16.870> which

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
of that within the software itself which

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.709 
of that within the software itself which
is<00:05:17.379> actually<00:05:17.590> really<00:05:18.039> cool<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:18.580> then<00:05:19.210> on<00:05:19.449> this

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
is actually really cool and then on this

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.290 
is actually really cool and then on this
side<00:05:19.779> you<00:05:20.289> have<00:05:21.039> a<00:05:21.310> USB<00:05:21.699> connection<00:05:21.969> right

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
side you have a USB connection right

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.899 
side you have a USB connection right
there<00:05:22.509> so<00:05:22.719> that<00:05:22.990> allows<00:05:23.409> the<00:05:24.129> discourse<00:05:24.729> air

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
there so that allows the discourse air

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.300 
there so that allows the discourse air
link<00:05:25.120> system<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:25.719> actually<00:05:25.900> talk<00:05:26.529> to<00:05:26.560> the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
link system to actually talk to the

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.189 
link system to actually talk to the
courts<00:05:27.669> their<00:05:27.879> links<00:05:28.210> software<00:05:28.750> installed<00:05:29.199> on

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
courts their links software installed on

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.529 
courts their links software installed on
your<00:05:29.439> computer<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:30.189> that's<00:05:31.000> what<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.210> USB

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
your computer so that's what the USB

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.300 
your computer so that's what the USB
connection<00:05:31.960> for<00:05:32.199> is<00:05:32.409> for<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:32.949> then<00:05:33.099> there<00:05:33.279> is

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
connection for is for and then there is

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.459 
connection for is for and then there is
another<00:05:33.940> link<00:05:34.330> connector<00:05:34.779> so<00:05:34.960> if<00:05:35.139> you<00:05:35.259> have

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
another link connector so if you have

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.499 
another link connector so if you have
another<00:05:35.860> Corsair<00:05:36.430> link<00:05:36.610> product<00:05:37.029> such<00:05:37.479> as

another Corsair link product such as

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.200 
another Corsair link product such as
maybe<00:05:37.839> their<00:05:38.110> memory<00:05:38.589> or<00:05:38.860> power<00:05:39.580> supply<00:05:39.879> or

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
maybe their memory or power supply or

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.149 
maybe their memory or power supply or
something<00:05:40.930> like<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:41.529> can<00:05:41.680> connect<00:05:41.979> that

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
something like that you can connect that

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.730 
something like that you can connect that
as<00:05:42.339> well<00:05:42.610> so<00:05:43.089> this<00:05:43.419> can<00:05:43.629> monitor<00:05:44.020> all<00:05:44.199> of<00:05:44.560> that

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
as well so this can monitor all of that

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.290 
as well so this can monitor all of that
together<00:05:44.979> which<00:05:45.430> is<00:05:45.580> actually<00:05:45.759> really<00:05:46.060> cool

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
together which is actually really cool

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.059 
together which is actually really cool
I'm<00:05:46.629> a<00:05:46.839> few<00:05:47.110> of<00:05:47.199> a<00:05:47.259> system<00:05:47.589> decked<00:05:47.889> out<00:05:48.039> with

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
I'm a few of a system decked out with

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.189 
I'm a few of a system decked out with
all<00:05:48.430> Corsair<00:05:48.879> products<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.629> link<00:05:49.839> software

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
all Corsair products the link software

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.689 
all Corsair products the link software
is<00:05:50.259> really<00:05:50.620> cool<00:05:50.800> because<00:05:50.949> you<00:05:51.250> can<00:05:51.279> manage

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
is really cool because you can manage

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.329 
is really cool because you can manage
pretty<00:05:52.060> much<00:05:52.240> everything<00:05:52.990> all<00:05:53.199> together<00:05:53.500> but

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
pretty much everything all together but

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.059 
pretty much everything all together but
that's<00:05:54.520> basically<00:05:54.789> it<00:05:55.379> again<00:05:56.379> this<00:05:56.770> is<00:05:56.889> kind

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
that's basically it again this is kind

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.649 
that's basically it again this is kind
of<00:05:57.129> if<00:05:57.310> you're<00:05:57.460> new<00:05:57.669> to<00:05:57.699> water<00:05:58.120> cooling<00:05:58.539> this

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
of if you're new to water cooling this

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.420 
of if you're new to water cooling this
is<00:05:58.750> kind<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:58.990> how<00:05:59.080> it's<00:05:59.199> set<00:05:59.379> up<00:05:59.409> so<00:05:59.500> if<00:05:59.889> this<00:06:00.250> is

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
is kind of how it's set up so if this is

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.269 
is kind of how it's set up so if this is
the<00:06:00.460> backup<00:06:00.729> my<00:06:01.029> case<00:06:01.300> will<00:06:01.629> do<00:06:01.750> it<00:06:01.839> like<00:06:01.990> this

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:02.279 
the backup my case will do it like this

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.249 
the backup my case will do it like this
maybe<00:06:03.279> this<00:06:03.460> is<00:06:03.610> the<00:06:03.699> back<00:06:03.849> of<00:06:03.969> my<00:06:04.000> case<00:06:04.270> and<00:06:04.509> my

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
maybe this is the back of my case and my

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.379 
maybe this is the back of my case and my
cpu<00:06:05.710> is<00:06:05.770> going<00:06:06.009> to<00:06:06.069> you<00:06:07.029> know<00:06:07.120> it's<00:06:07.210> going<00:06:07.300> to

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
cpu is going to you know it's going to

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.779 
cpu is going to you know it's going to
go<00:06:07.449> like<00:06:07.599> this<00:06:07.719> or<00:06:07.900> actually<00:06:08.310> more<00:06:09.310> like<00:06:09.460> this

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
go like this or actually more like this

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.869 
go like this or actually more like this
and<00:06:10.659> that's<00:06:11.589> how<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:11.830> cooler<00:06:12.310> is<00:06:12.550> going<00:06:12.759> to<00:06:12.819> be

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
and that's how the cooler is going to be

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.459 
and that's how the cooler is going to be
set<00:06:13.060> up<00:06:13.150> it's<00:06:13.270> an<00:06:13.389> all-in-one<00:06:13.750> unit<00:06:13.900> no

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
set up it's an all-in-one unit no

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.200 
set up it's an all-in-one unit no
maintenance<00:06:14.740> so<00:06:15.159> if<00:06:15.400> you<00:06:15.699> want<00:06:15.879> to<00:06:15.939> get<00:06:16.029> into

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
maintenance so if you want to get into

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.670 
maintenance so if you want to get into
water<00:06:16.479> cooling<00:06:16.779> you<00:06:16.870> want<00:06:17.050> that<00:06:17.229> really<00:06:17.439> good

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
water cooling you want that really good

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.129 
water cooling you want that really good
performance<00:06:18.159> this<00:06:18.339> is<00:06:18.669> a<00:06:18.969> very<00:06:19.719> good<00:06:19.839> solution

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
performance this is a very good solution

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.499 
performance this is a very good solution
for<00:06:20.620> that<00:06:20.650> so<00:06:21.129> this<00:06:21.279> basically<00:06:21.520> wraps<00:06:22.120> up<00:06:22.360> our

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
for that so this basically wraps up our

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.010 
for that so this basically wraps up our
