00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.590
 Winter and cold are approaching and 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.390
 it makes you feel in the mornings that's why it's 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.519
 very important that we are prepared in 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.530
 our home so arrives club room 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.599
 TV the best solution to heat 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.390
 our house I mean the fireplace 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.029
 electric kendall a wall fireplace 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.949
 easy to install, ideal for 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.330
 all the spaces of our home 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.189
 the best thing is that it reaches a price that 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.759
 you can not let go because in the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.949
 market is 129 thousand 990 pesos and here 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.070
 in your club room of the teve is only 114 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.350
 thousand 990 pesos that you can pay more in 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.700
 fees with your cmr card or with the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.680
 bank cards that appear in 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.540
 screen but we're already with our 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.370
 expert at home to know what is 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.710
 try this fireplace how is marisol 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.270
 very well thank you maria and happy to have 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.890
 this fireplace stove that we're going to 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.420
 to have our house and in all 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.910
 parts like that is because the cold already 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.890
 we feel the mornings especially yes yes yes 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.240
 the morning is already feeling cold 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.950
 they are well ahead we need 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.590
 heating to our house this only what 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.420
 plug is electrical only plugs into 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.490
 mari and only you are going to decide in what 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.860
 place of the house is going to put it this way 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.190
 foot as beats we have here or also 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.790
 hang it on a wall 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.660
 and it's very real besides no longer those flames 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.640
 that's the grace of this this stove 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.040
 madrid because it gives the effect of esteem ea 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.840
 you know that by measures 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.430
 we can not present the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.650
 first there are no longer the first ones 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.210
 our houses therefore wants but 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.190
 it's rich when you go to a chimney 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.950
 in the south not true and you see the effect of the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.230
 call that reassures that relax 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.330
 like the warm effect and here the 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.120
 we have is not that we have flame or 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.860
 much less but only the effect 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.300
 that makes it look like it's the flame and 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.950
 with those natural stones that I 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.660
 love how it is given as a good touch 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.640
 model is totally like it's a 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.670
 real fireplace but we have the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.690
 heating cleans a heating 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.140
 electrical as we said in a beginning 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.060
 but we have this this image of this 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.350
 video hey that 's very important what 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.690
 you are saying because other types of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.890
 Heating is polluting whether or not they are 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.950
 what because the other types of 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.960
 heating either by paraffin or by 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.729
 gas that produces a combustion so 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.840
 both will grab the oxygen that there is and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.519
 it goes to the base the combustion and then he 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.349
 heat and energy is not going to be so 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.810
 clean like this which is electric so 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.510
 So much is much cleaner to maintain 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.310
 the air not so dry and we will be 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.540
 much better also the whole family but 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.790
 how it works then I'm going to 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.340
 show on the other stove here is 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.739
 extremely simple you can put in the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.180
 floor with this base or on the wall as the 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.489
 we saw there hanging anywhere 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.379
 we want we also have the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.970
 option to take it to the piece of 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.410
 children or our piece or is there 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.450
 no problem that the by the hand of the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.280
 house any part now has a 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.200
 extremely easy power button 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.560
 reach and press and then you will have two 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.360
 intensities high low according to whether you 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.980
 you want more heat or less heat and that goes 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.560
 to consume approximately between 1000 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.440
 watts the low and 2000 watts the high by 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.440
 so we have but a clean energy 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.110
 cheap energy a safe energy in 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.180
 our pretty house being the talents 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.579
 what better to what better and what is good and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.799
 the other has this remote control so 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.019
 I will be able to use it remotely 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.180
 and it also has the effect if I want 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.250
 see the flame that is the flame of the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.350
 chimney or zinc and 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.150
 the effect of intensity forgiveness that is 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.890
 the high and the low we learn the idea 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.540
 let's see then let's do it 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.220
 work here and there is fixed you hear 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.890
 but this then when no call 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.380
 heat so it's like this is the the 'effect 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.270
 called ' that you can give it to you 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.340
 pressing the very nice button of 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.040
 integration imagine being reading a 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.840
 book and you have actor feels as if 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.570
 I was in a shelter you do not know which 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.580
 it was quite water but it is safe 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.310
 exactly for the beans 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.900
 has all the rules that you do not go 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.280
 it's not going to reheat that is very 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.020
 important for those of us who have children 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.400
 small and clear and the good thing that 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.900
 we can also take them to 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.580
 different pieces therefore ensures 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.530
 also to be able to transfer it something that 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.450
 we have to keep it only here 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.860
 and a question marisol what are the 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.850
 measures of this study I'm going to 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.160
 say the measures are 90 10.5 x 56 per 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.500
 So what you give here, you can 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.329
 having everywhere is not going to take away 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.489
 a lot of space therefore it's not going to 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.109
 also interfere with decoration or 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.609
 nor with the rest of the things that you 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.100
 have because in an appropriate size 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.780
 also slim for people 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.430
 I loved doing a summary of this 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.800
 stove we do a mari summary for 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.140
 all of this power line who so 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.700
 ideal for heating our homes 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.100
 Winter cold easy installation 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.110
 has two wall or base modes for 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.840
 floor is safe has a protection 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.640
 against ideal heating for everything 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.890
 type of spaces and also has the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.020
 flame effect like optional thousand chimney 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.630
 at two thousand watts of power a 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.060
 fast heating and no odor practical 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.160
 and cute design mari what better to have this 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.710
 our price is almost even better 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.690
 because in the market is 129 thousand 990 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.990
 pesos and here in club for the one of the tele 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.340
