hello guys we cheer with another we give

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.369 
hello guys we cheer with another we give
away<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.430> this<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.879> on<00:00:06.029> my<00:00:06.240> rag<00:00:06.509> doll<00:00:06.779> rig<00:00:07.200> I

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
away and this is on my rag doll rig I

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.680 
away and this is on my rag doll rig I
made

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.000 

okay<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.710> see<00:00:14.190> he's<00:00:14.790> falling<00:00:15.450> down<00:00:16.010> like

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
okay so you see he's falling down like

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.519 
okay so you see he's falling down like
in<00:00:17.490> dynamics<00:00:18.150> I'm<00:00:18.420> still<00:00:18.690> working<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.140> it

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
in dynamics I'm still working on it

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.060 
in dynamics I'm still working on it
it's<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.189> perfect<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> rig<00:00:21.560> has<00:00:22.560> some<00:00:22.859> small

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it's not perfect the rig has some small

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.220 
it's not perfect the rig has some small
glitches<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.210> trying<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> fix<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.990> once

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
glitches so I'm trying to fix that once

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.380 
glitches so I'm trying to fix that once
I'm<00:00:25.439> done<00:00:25.529> fixing<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.000> will<00:00:27.119> put

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
I'm done fixing it out we will put

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.820 
I'm done fixing it out we will put
everywhere<00:00:28.609> we<00:00:29.720> put<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> download<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> guess<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
everywhere we put the download I guess I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.770 
everywhere we put the download I guess I
would<00:00:32.329> I<00:00:34.430> will<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.700> tell<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.940> guys<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.540> fix

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
would I will also tell you guys if I fix

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.830 
would I will also tell you guys if I fix
it<00:00:36.930> uh<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> great<00:00:38.700> setup<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.360> made<00:00:39.600> of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it uh so this is a great setup I made of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.290 
it uh so this is a great setup I made of
it<00:00:40.640> hit<00:00:41.640> play

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.760 

did<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.450> work<00:00:45.719> I'm<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:47.539> off<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:49.559> gonna

did not work I'm just off that I'm gonna
add<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> Collider<00:00:50.550> body<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.100> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
add a Collider body to this you all you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.040 
add a Collider body to this you all you
have<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.579> add<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> collider<00:00:54.239> body<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
have to do is add the collider body and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.479 
have to do is add the collider body and
then<00:00:55.579> yeah<00:00:57.230> I'm<00:00:58.230> planning<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.710> using<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.160> for

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
then yeah I'm planning on using it for

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
then yeah I'm planning on using it for
my<00:00:59.579> next<00:00:59.820> animation<00:01:02.539> it's<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:03.780> cool<00:01:04.019> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
my next animation it's pretty cool I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.820 
my next animation it's pretty cool I
can't<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> lot<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.119> funding<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.470> just

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
can't have a lot of funding you can just

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.320 
can't have a lot of funding you can just
play<00:01:08.070> around<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:09.080> for<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.490> tutorial<00:01:11.670> I'm

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
play around with it for the tutorial I'm

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.910 
play around with it for the tutorial I'm
gonna<00:01:12.600> put<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> link<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> description

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
gonna put the link in the description

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.080 
gonna put the link in the description
for<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> guy<00:01:14.520> who<00:01:14.720> showed<00:01:15.720> me<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
for the guy who showed me how to do this

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.780 
for the guy who showed me how to do this
and<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.360> always<00:01:18.509> play<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.170> rig

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
and you can always play with the rig

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.780 
and you can always play with the rig
like<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.860> if<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.979> want<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> gravity

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
like here and if you want the gravity

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
like here and if you want the gravity
like<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.509> want<00:01:24.659> more<00:01:24.780> gravity<00:01:25.380> he<00:01:25.650> press

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
like if you want more gravity he press

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.270 
like if you want more gravity he press
control<00:01:26.820> D<00:01:27.170> then<00:01:28.170> dynamics<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.159> then

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
control D then dynamics and then

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.410 
control D then dynamics and then
increase<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:34.340> there's<00:01:35.420> ragdoll

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
increase this and then there's ragdoll

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
increase this and then there's ragdoll
settings<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.110> add<00:01:37.950> no<00:01:38.280> friction<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
settings like add no friction and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.940 
settings like add no friction and
balance<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.320> honor<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.770> use<00:01:40.950> drag<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
balance to it so honor to use drag that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
balance to it so honor to use drag that
and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.360> always<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> did

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and then you can always see what I did

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.780 
and then you can always see what I did
here<00:01:47.149> it's<00:01:48.149> uh<00:01:48.649> it's<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:49.860> took<00:01:50.220> me<00:01:50.430> three

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
here it's uh it's actually took me three

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.940 
here it's uh it's actually took me three
hours<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.299> make<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> tutorial<00:01:52.710> he

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
hours to make because the tutorial he

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.670 
hours to make because the tutorial he
made<00:01:53.570> wasn't<00:01:54.570> too<00:01:54.840> good<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:57.439> might<00:01:58.439> actually

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
made wasn't too good I might actually

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.700 
made wasn't too good I might actually
make<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> tour<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.579> how<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> do<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.710> this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
make it to tour on how to do this this

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.399 
make it to tour on how to do this this
is<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.369> kind<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.790> too<00:02:03.119> long<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.840> his<00:02:04.079> rig

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
is one is kind of too long and his rig

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.459 
is one is kind of too long and his rig
was<00:02:04.560> kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.890> too<00:02:05.040> complicated<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:06.290> write<00:02:07.290> to

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
was kind of too complicated to write to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.580 
was kind of too complicated to write to
be<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> quick<00:02:07.920> tutorial<00:02:08.129> oh<00:02:08.729> yeah<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.899> he<00:02:10.410> could

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
be a quick tutorial oh yeah and he could

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.740 
be a quick tutorial oh yeah and he could
find<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.890> way<00:02:11.009> how<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.190> fix<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
find a way how to fix that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.810 
find a way how to fix that
I'm<00:02:12.960> gonna<00:02:13.230> try<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.470> fix<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.070> then<00:02:14.130> give

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
I'm gonna try and fix that and then give

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.220 
I'm gonna try and fix that and then give
it<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:16.190> see<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.370> body<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:17.870> goes<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.930> know

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
it to you see the body just goes I know

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.260 
it to you see the body just goes I know
it's<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.890> some<00:02:20.100> reason<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.550> oh<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's like that for some reason it oh and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.440 
it's like that for some reason it oh and
by<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.450> way<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.750> gave<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.560> drug<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.450> animation

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
by the way I gave this drug to animation

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.800 
by the way I gave this drug to animation
craft<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:26.010> he<00:02:26.280> might<00:02:26.490> see<00:02:26.820> said<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.210> he<00:02:27.390> fixes

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
craft and he might see said if he fixes

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.830 
craft and he might see said if he fixes
it<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.260> fix<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.460> mind<00:02:29.640> using<00:02:29.840> slow

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
it if I fix it you mind using slow

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.550 
it if I fix it you mind using slow
motion<00:02:31.200> animation<00:02:31.590> see<00:02:32.220> he<00:02:33.090> does<00:02:33.380> which<00:02:34.380> would

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
motion animation see he does which would

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.520 
motion animation see he does which would
be<00:02:34.680> awesome

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
be awesome

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.690 
be awesome
but<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:38.730> ok<00:02:39.150> if<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.870> don't<00:02:40.010> if<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.460> rig

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
but it's ok if you don't if the rig

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.480 
but it's ok if you don't if the rig
doesn't<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.450> very<00:02:42.810> big<00:02:43.620> collisions<00:02:44.370> and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
doesn't have very big collisions and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.030 
doesn't have very big collisions and
stuff<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.480> doesn't<00:02:45.690> deform<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.620> see<00:02:46.920> if

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
stuff it doesn't deform like that see if

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.120 
stuff it doesn't deform like that see if
you<00:02:47.160> hit<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.490> slowly<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.720> stuff<00:02:49.710> it's<00:02:49.920> nice

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
you hit it slowly and stuff it's nice

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.950 
you hit it slowly and stuff it's nice
but<00:02:50.520> as<00:02:50.640> soon<00:02:50.880> as<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.120> get<00:02:51.240> into<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.600> likley

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
but as soon as you get into the likley

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.470 
but as soon as you get into the likley
big<00:02:52.590> ones<00:02:52.800> like<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:54.240> regular<00:02:54.690> deform

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
big ones like that the regular deform

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.140 
big ones like that the regular deform
sometimes<00:02:57.480> yeah<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.010> think<00:02:59.880> it's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
sometimes yeah like that I think it's

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.990 
sometimes yeah like that I think it's
due<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.720> constraints<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.890> stuff<00:03:02.190> because

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
due to the constraints and stuff because

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.240 
due to the constraints and stuff because
this<00:03:03.450> constraints<00:03:04.050> in<00:03:04.140> cinema<00:03:04.470> 4d<00:03:04.680> aren't<00:03:05.070> too

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
this constraints in cinema 4d aren't too

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.800 
this constraints in cinema 4d aren't too
good

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
good

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.010 
good
like<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.290> top<00:03:07.530> protection<00:03:08.190> tags<00:03:08.720> get<00:03:09.720> messed

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
like the top protection tags get messed

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.430 
like the top protection tags get messed
up<00:03:10.730> I'm<00:03:11.730> not<00:03:11.940> sure<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.330> affects<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.960> render

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
up I'm not sure if it affects the render

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.699 
up I'm not sure if it affects the render
but<00:03:13.740> still<00:03:14.040> yeah<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.960> thanks<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.380> watching
