00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.930
 we can learn how a one-year moratorium will be 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.529
 what are we going to need 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.429
 colored paper ribbons 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.749
 a piece of cardboard label form markers or markers 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.189
 and packages that we want ornaments 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.470
 we put the first tape on the table 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 and the second one in the form of a cross 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.620
 the next is the smoky by the sides 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.340
 once given right 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.730
 and the other one on the left 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 in this way 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.040
 and we go on 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 from now on we call interlace 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.149
 sir previous be below the zaragoza put above 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 we keep intertwining 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.370
 again to below or above 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.200
 you can close the same design with lots of tape 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 in this case we have used what we want to do 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.760
 let's put the last 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.690
 intertwining with the previous ones 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.530
 in this case he raised 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 and went under 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780
 Now I have to do it is to place it on the package 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.430
 we will try to lift very carefully 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.430
 so that it does not disarm 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.670
 now what we have to do waiting for them 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.570
 to paste it what we are going to do 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570
 and turn the duct tape 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 we put you prelate from behind 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.279
 we have been waiting 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.199
 and let's go verifying 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.499
 the tape that bancan two loose 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:18.119
 and I love to stay behind 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.109
 we arrived in one of the corners 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.209
 let's get back up 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.299
 the other side 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.839
 and hit him again 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 with tape 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.779
 it was also try 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.869
 when we assemble the interlaced paste from behind 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.019
 before placing it on the package 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.019
 and that way will be firmer in pomasqui 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.199
 we verify loose slope in this case the truth 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.199
 and what we are going to do is simply crawfish behind 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.659
 one that we have clearly attached that we want to adorn 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:01.459
 we are left 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.819
 Fix the edges with the ends on the other side of the box 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.209
 we take all the ribbons 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.799
 We were going to be hitting trying to match in the case that is necessary 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.369
 decree decree said also if in the interns are until the end 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:28.829
 we paste we turn that we continue being like this the four stars 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.079
 in the same way 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.079
 and third of the thieves 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.419
 and the last 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.059
 very well 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:59.799
 so we have left 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.839
 a very funny and colorful way 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:06.689
 the adornments of a package there is that you can add of course a dedication 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.879
 with some piece of small cardboard reported in some way 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.029
 and writing 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.029
 a doctor turkey 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.830
 also this song and we're not going to put tape on my side of 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.639
 transit 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.539
 it is ikea finished our peaceful 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.389
 I hope that that is used in a motion approximate units
