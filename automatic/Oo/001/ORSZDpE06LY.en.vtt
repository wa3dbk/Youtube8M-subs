on<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.110> treadmill<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:56.159> opinion

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
on the treadmill in my opinion

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.289

think<00:02:02.909> when<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.420> trying<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> lose<00:02:03.990> weight

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
think when you are trying to lose weight

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.910 
think when you are trying to lose weight
you<00:02:04.860> should<00:02:04.890> focus<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.240> shedding<00:02:07.079> fat<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.740> not

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
you should focus on shedding fat and not

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800 
you should focus on shedding fat and not
building<00:02:08.369> any<00:02:08.550> muscle<00:02:08.940> because<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.509> muscle

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
building any muscle because the muscle

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.300 
building any muscle because the muscle
will<00:02:09.929> build<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.289> top<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.709> fat<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> then

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
will build on top of the fat and then

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.729 
will build on top of the fat and then
you<00:02:12.270> know<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.870> scale<00:02:13.140> doesn't<00:02:13.170> really<00:02:13.530> seem

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
you know the scale doesn't really seem

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.910

just<00:03:38.910> gonna<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:39.239> dinner<00:03:39.600> but<00:03:40.230> I'm<00:03:40.320> not

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
just gonna have dinner but I'm not

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.009 
just gonna have dinner but I'm not
losing<00:03:40.650> any<00:03:40.980> weight<00:03:41.070> your<00:03:42.060> body<00:03:42.090> holds<00:03:42.750> on<00:03:42.870> to

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
losing any weight your body holds on to

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.539 
losing any weight your body holds on to
all<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.290> your<00:03:43.410> thought<00:03:43.680> because<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.070> doesn't

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
all of your thought because it doesn't

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.080 
all of your thought because it doesn't
it's<00:03:44.870> because<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.769> need<00:03:46.920> energy<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.970> won't

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
it's because you need energy so it won't

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.150 
it's because you need energy so it won't
burn<00:03:48.359> off<00:03:48.660> any<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.440> because<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.829> needs<00:03:49.980> to

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
burn off any of it because it needs to

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.770 
burn off any of it because it needs to
hold<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.820> little<00:03:51.120> bit<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.269> energy<00:03:51.450> to

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
hold on to that little bit of energy to

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.050 
hold on to that little bit of energy to
only<00:03:51.959> give<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.590> little<00:03:52.980> tiny<00:03:53.340> burst<00:03:53.760> of

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
only give you a little tiny burst of

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.840 
only give you a little tiny burst of
energy<00:03:54.299> if<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.079> makes<00:03:55.980> sense<00:03:56.100> hopefully<00:03:56.400> as

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
energy if that makes sense hopefully as

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.210 
energy if that makes sense hopefully as
well<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.870> think<00:03:58.049> that's<00:03:58.290> when<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:58.859> started

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
well so I think that's when I started

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.559 
well so I think that's when I started
realizing<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.760> was<00:03:59.790> losing<00:04:00.000> weight<00:04:00.209> was<00:04:00.390> when<00:04:00.510> i

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
realizing I was losing weight was when i

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.840 
realizing I was losing weight was when i
was<00:04:00.660> eating<00:04:00.959> more<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.500> I'm<00:04:02.190> trust<00:04:02.609> me<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.790> used

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
was eating more and I'm trust me I used

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.330 
was eating more and I'm trust me I used
to<00:04:03.000> go<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.150> work<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.600> would<00:04:03.780> eat<00:04:03.900> once<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.290> day

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
to go to work and I would eat once a day

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.580 
to go to work and I would eat once a day
maybe<00:04:05.340> twice<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.700> day<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.390> was<00:04:06.569> like<00:04:06.780> not

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
maybe twice a day and I was like not

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.030 
maybe twice a day and I was like not
losing<00:04:08.160> anyway<00:04:08.630> so<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.079> then<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.829> started

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
losing anyway so and then I started

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.910 
losing anyway so and then I started
eating<00:04:11.280> breakfast<00:04:11.579> lunch<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.819> dinner<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.920> my

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
eating breakfast lunch and dinner and my

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.279 
eating breakfast lunch and dinner and my
body<00:04:14.850> was<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.209> was<00:04:15.359> getting<00:04:15.450> hungry<00:04:15.810> every<00:04:16.049> two

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
body was I was getting hungry every two

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.469 
body was I was getting hungry every two
to<00:04:16.889> three<00:04:16.979> hours<00:04:17.160> after<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:17.970> would<00:04:18.120> eat<00:04:18.150> and

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
to three hours after I would eat and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.199 
to three hours after I would eat and
it's<00:04:18.989> because<00:04:19.320> my<00:04:19.350> body<00:04:19.680> was<00:04:19.859> now<00:04:20.489> like<00:04:20.850> okay

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
it's because my body was now like okay

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.089 
it's because my body was now like okay
it's<00:04:21.510> okay<00:04:21.720> she's<00:04:22.289> gonna<00:04:22.409> feed<00:04:22.710> me<00:04:22.740> she's

it's okay she's gonna feed me she's
gonna<00:04:23.159> feed<00:04:23.460> me<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.640> can<00:04:23.970> burn<00:04:24.150> this<00:04:24.330> off<00:04:24.539> she

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
gonna feed me I can burn this off she
