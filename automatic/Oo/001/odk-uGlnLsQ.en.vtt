literally yes anyway

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.199 
literally yes anyway
now<00:02:56.099> you've<00:02:56.250> come<00:02:56.400> back<00:02:56.519> out<00:02:56.700> there<00:02:56.849> bathroom

now you've come back out there bathroom
this<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.690> stage<00:02:57.900> two

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.580 

I<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:01.209> he<00:03:01.660> doesn't<00:03:01.990> do<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.260> move<00:03:02.440> and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
I think he doesn't do this move and

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.559 
I think he doesn't do this move and
stage<00:03:02.860> one<00:03:03.160> but<00:03:03.490> basically<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.209> have<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.420> get

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
stage one but basically you have it get

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.110 
stage one but basically you have it get
in<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> gap<00:03:05.020> in<00:03:05.530> between<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.100> doors<00:03:06.910> I'm

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
in the gap in between the doors I'm

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.210 
in the gap in between the doors I'm
assuming<00:03:07.480> they're<00:03:08.050> loose<00:03:08.290> but<00:03:08.650> yeah

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
assuming they're loose but yeah

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.710 
assuming they're loose but yeah
doesn't<00:03:09.730> hurt<00:03:09.850> myself<00:03:10.030> hitting<00:03:10.270> one<00:03:10.510> platform

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
doesn't hurt myself hitting one platform

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.420 
doesn't hurt myself hitting one platform
you<00:03:10.990> have<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.380> hit<00:03:11.500> two<00:03:11.709> platform<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:14.430> always

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
you have to hit two platform and always

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.520 
you have to hit two platform and always

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.460 
artx other skills kind of been upgraded
like<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> study<00:03:18.340> faster<00:03:18.930> that's<00:03:19.930> about<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.260> but

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
like a study faster that's about it but

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.070 
like a study faster that's about it but
yes<00:03:21.400> that's<00:03:21.850> like<00:03:22.030> almost<00:03:22.510> sure<00:03:22.750> there's<00:03:23.020> a

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
yes that's like almost sure there's a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.140 
yes that's like almost sure there's a
glitch<00:03:23.319> but<00:03:23.350> if<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.250> definitely<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.880> against

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
glitch but if you definitely go against

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.460 
glitch but if you definitely go against
him<00:03:26.190> after<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.489> it<00:03:27.880> definitely<00:03:28.060> runs<00:03:28.569> out<00:03:28.810> he

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
him after you it definitely runs out he

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.290 
him after you it definitely runs out he
kind<00:03:29.770> of<00:03:29.860> just<00:03:30.040> stands<00:03:30.340> there<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.760> not<00:03:30.970> do

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
kind of just stands there and not do

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.830 
kind of just stands there and not do
anything<00:03:32.940> but<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.030> see<00:03:34.180> here<00:03:34.330> like<00:03:34.540> he

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
anything but you see here like he

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.710 
anything but you see here like he
thought<00:03:34.989> boy<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.350> half<00:03:35.470> health<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.980> I'm<00:03:36.160> just

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
thought boy and half health and I'm just

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.759 
thought boy and half health and I'm just
attacking<00:03:37.720> him<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.140> just<00:03:38.170> doesn't<00:03:38.680> do

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
attacking him it just doesn't do

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.130 
attacking him it just doesn't do
anything<00:03:39.000> just<00:03:40.000> standing<00:03:40.239> there<00:03:40.300> but<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:40.989> can

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
anything just standing there but you can

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.830 
anything just standing there but you can
have<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.500> don't<00:03:41.739> know<00:03:41.890> why<00:03:42.100> but<00:03:42.510> i'ma<00:03:43.510> show<00:03:43.660> you

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
have I don't know why but i'ma show you

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.530 
have I don't know why but i'ma show you
a<00:03:43.870> glitch<00:03:44.110> but<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:45.190> works<00:03:45.459> on<00:03:45.730> even<00:03:46.239> harder

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
a glitch but it works on even harder

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.660 
a glitch but it works on even harder
difficulties<00:03:47.050> like<00:03:47.319> Ivan<00:03:47.769> I<00:03:48.160> tried<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.640> on

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
difficulties like Ivan I tried it on

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.660 
difficulties like Ivan I tried it on
some<00:03:49.209> Espada<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:49.989> he<00:03:50.890> just<00:03:51.069> can't<00:03:51.220> understand

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
some Espada and he just can't understand

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.990 
some Espada and he just can't understand
it

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
it

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.920 
it
so<00:03:52.720> I'm<00:03:52.840> assuming<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.650> bitch<00:03:54.750> after<00:03:55.750> you

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
so I'm assuming it is a bitch after you

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.750 
so I'm assuming it is a bitch after you
finish<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.290> second<00:03:56.530> valve<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.310> also<00:03:57.459> do<00:03:57.670> this

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
finish the second valve you also do this

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.520 
finish the second valve you also do this
anything<00:03:58.060> again<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.900> jump<00:03:59.170> back<00:03:59.290> in<00:03:59.410> this

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
anything again you jump back in this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.729 
anything again you jump back in this
like<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.190> nuts<00:04:00.430> there<00:04:00.850> alone<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:02.050> listen<00:04:02.680> to

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739
