00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
hard for me to like get to my hair when

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.040 
hard for me to like get to my hair when
i<00:02:07.640> went<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:07.910> wash<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.540> everything<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:08.960> that

i went to wash and everything like that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.090 
i went to wash and everything like that
so<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:10.640> know<00:02:11.480> it's<00:02:11.780> better<00:02:12.050> for<00:02:12.500> your<00:02:12.590> hair<00:02:12.830> if

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
so I know it's better for your hair if

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.590 
so I know it's better for your hair if
you<00:02:13.190> put<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.490> net<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.060> i<00:02:14.150> figure<00:02:14.450> i'm

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
you put the net on but i figure i'm

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.570 
you put the net on but i figure i'm
using<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.170> synthetic<00:02:15.710> here<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.160> i'll<00:02:16.370> take

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
using the synthetic here so i'll take

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.040 
using the synthetic here so i'll take
some<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.000> tension<00:02:17.420> off<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.780> hopefully<00:02:20.050> it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
some of the tension off and hopefully it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.020 
some of the tension off and hopefully it
won't<00:02:21.710> get<00:02:21.830> damaged<00:02:22.250> because<00:02:22.430> i<00:02:22.640> didn't<00:02:22.910> use

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
won't get damaged because i didn't use

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.390 
won't get damaged because i didn't use

but<00:05:33.630> other<00:05:34.630> than<00:05:34.990> that<00:05:35.050> I<00:05:35.890> mean<00:05:36.490> I<00:05:36.880> guess<00:05:37.060> those

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
but other than that I mean I guess those

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.670

aren't<00:05:37.510> like<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.840> best<00:05:37.990> reviews<00:05:38.380> or<00:05:38.470> whatever

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
aren't like the best reviews or whatever

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.500 
aren't like the best reviews or whatever
