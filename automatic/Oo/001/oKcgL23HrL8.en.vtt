00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.279
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.299
 what are you doing, I hope you are 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.879
 all very well 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.910
 today I tell you a chilling news 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:15.330
 about UFOs chan chan 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.640
 well let's not talk nonsense 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.950
 that on July 27 of this year 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.000
 approximately at nine twenty plus 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.880
 or less in Tennessee because there was a 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.939
 thunderstorm coming through 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 of the montgomery county area 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.910
 clarksfield and then it was photographed and it 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.519
 he made videos about this storm and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.269
 you know that there are many fans 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:44.399
 take photos and so-called stormtroopers 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:49.670
 they are dedicated to making videos or 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:53.449
 take pictures of this and good 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.089
 the photographer then while I was 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.800
 looking at the pictures I notice an object 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.289
 similar to a star directly on 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.870
 the center of several of the images at 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.470
 principle the photographer thought it was not 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.230
 more than a bright star dust or 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.320
 something that had interfered in the camera 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:16.640
 a dust some object something insect what 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.650
 that outside and after doing a new exam 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.170
 in the images as a zoom discovered 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.210
 that the object in one of the images was 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.670
 similar to a star but in the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.630
 other images had more disk shape 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.350
 the video that you are watching on the screen 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.320
 it really is impressive where you see 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.240
 waths up 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.360
 a cloud rays and small dots 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.580
 depending on 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.960
 of the area for thinking of two dots a 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.530
 dot 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.040
 and here comes 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.330
 the thing if it were a star for a long 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.470
 lightning that fell could not be seen worth 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.200
 basically because we have several 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.170
 interference we have a cloud that is 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.899
 for the ceiling we have the ray that 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.280
 what it does is provide light light 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:16.569
 over light you do not see a fancy and this 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.880
 that seems to be is like 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.040
 as if it were a ship 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.030
 that by contacting the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.160
 electricity the layer that has outside 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.980
 as what makes the driver like what 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.470
 repels but lights up because the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.390
 current along the outside of that area 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.390
 from the ship or whatever 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.409
 this kid was reaction talk and he looked and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.390
 he said so I was commenting a 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:53.790
 plane a helicopter or something and it was very 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.790
 curious because during this time the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.120
 that he was filming there was no 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.120
 change height speed again 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.909
 no movement of this following 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.030
 being reasonable and I look for another 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.129
 explanation maybe because he thought it is a 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.190
 satellite or is the space station 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.799
 international but the object seems that 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.190
 It is below the clouds or between 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.290
 clouds that appear in the photos after 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.959
 to see other images the object no longer 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.760
 none of them appears only 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.410
 appear in certain a certain period of 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.930
 weather 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.519
 the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.620
 in the images and the video is only 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.739
 a fragment but the video is signed 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.609
 for 20 minutes worth then it's a 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.409
 very long time for a helicopter 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:51.129
 or an airplane is in the same place in the 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.409
 same height same position everything is worth 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.870
 the orbs are not visible to the naked eye 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:00.290
 but they are captured in a video camera 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.940
 High definition is worth the author 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.490
 d 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:10.090
 images of these images do not 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.190
 no no has not commented on any location 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.830
 of the sighting the video that you see in 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.480
 screen is worth so good guys 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.940
 I hope you have been interested in this 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.790
 news really is it is very strange not 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.260
 this kind of thing always always me 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.560
 surprise not because you always try 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.540
 look for the logical and many times for very 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.250
 logic that is the answer a very pool 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.620
 logical that you want to look for a whole 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.950
 answer there is no logic for what you 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.360
 you are seeing many times you have to leave 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.820
 put logic aside and think a little 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.120
 possibly further because what you 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.010
 think it's the right thing so nothing 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.690
 guys, kiss everyone and see you in 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.290
 another video of this channel until the 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.440
 next 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.440
 bye
