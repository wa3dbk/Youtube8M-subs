different<00:00:26.189> learned<00:00:26.760> behaviors<00:00:29.480> let's<00:00:30.480> first

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
different learned behaviors let's first

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.749 
different learned behaviors let's first
talk<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.349> behavior<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.040> behavior<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
talk about what behavior is behavior is

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.810 
talk about what behavior is behavior is
to<00:00:32.910> find<00:00:33.149> us<00:00:33.360> how<00:00:33.780> animals<00:00:34.440> react<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.610> their

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
to find us how animals react to their

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.209 
to find us how animals react to their
environment<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.840> how<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.620> react<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> other

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
environment and how they react to other

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
environment and how they react to other
organisms<00:00:40.520> behavior<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.730> based<00:00:42.030> upon<00:00:42.239> two

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
organisms behavior is based upon two

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.709 
organisms behavior is based upon two
things<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.739> first<00:00:43.920> thing<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.670> stimulus<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
things the first thing is a stimulus and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
things the first thing is a stimulus and
the<00:00:46.140> next<00:00:46.350> thing<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.739> response<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the next thing is a response to that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.209 
the next thing is a response to that
stimulus<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.629> stimulus<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.739> basically

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
stimulus a stimulus is basically

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.970 
stimulus a stimulus is basically
anything<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> causes<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:52.050> certain<00:00:52.590> kind<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
anything that causes a certain kind of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.630 
anything that causes a certain kind of
any<00:00:53.280> type<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> reaction<00:00:54.829> for<00:00:55.829> example<00:00:56.370> there's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
any type of reaction for example there's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
any type of reaction for example there's
two<00:00:56.940> different<00:00:57.390> types<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.870> stimulus<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
two different types of stimulus the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.389 
two different types of stimulus the
first<00:00:58.829> stimuli<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:01.190> external<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
first stimuli would be a external and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
first stimuli would be a external and
then<00:01:02.760> another<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.210> would<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.420> internal<00:01:04.260> an

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
then another one would be internal an

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.840 
then another one would be internal an
example<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.640> external<00:01:06.180> stimulus<00:01:06.930> would<00:01:07.140> be

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
example of an external stimulus would be

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.640 
example of an external stimulus would be
the<00:01:08.850> hot<00:01:09.060> Sun<00:01:09.510> causing<00:01:11.390> an<00:01:12.390> animal<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.439> get

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the hot Sun causing an animal to get

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.780 
the hot Sun causing an animal to get
very<00:01:13.979> very<00:01:14.189> very<00:01:14.520> warm<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.990> dog<00:01:16.790> entering

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
very very very warm or a dog entering

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
very very very warm or a dog entering
another<00:01:18.060> dog's<00:01:18.840> territory<00:01:20.600> those<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.290> those

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
another dog's territory those that those

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
another dog's territory those that those
types<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> things<00:01:23.369> would<00:01:23.670> cause<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.210> particular

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
types of things would cause a particular

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.109 
types of things would cause a particular
reaction<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:25.950> call<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.189> reaction<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
reaction and we call that reaction and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.690 
reaction and we call that reaction and
response<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:28.350> there's<00:01:28.560> other<00:01:28.829> types<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
response now there's other types of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.840 
response now there's other types of
stimuli<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.420> would<00:01:31.049> come<00:01:31.320> from<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.890> inside

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
stimuli that would come from the inside

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.550 
stimuli that would come from the inside
of<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> animal<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:33.689> will<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.869> internal

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
of the animal and those will be internal

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.859 
of the animal and those will be internal
such<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:35.040> feeling<00:01:35.759> nauseous<00:01:35.970> or<00:01:36.540> sick<00:01:36.840> or

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
such as feeling nauseous or sick or

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.010 
such as feeling nauseous or sick or
being<00:01:37.650> hungry<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.400> tired<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:39.180> even<00:01:39.420> thirsty

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
being hungry or tired or even thirsty

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.480 
being hungry or tired or even thirsty
those<00:01:40.560> things<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.070> considered

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
those things would be considered

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.039 
those things would be considered
internal<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:42.479> come<00:01:42.659> from<00:01:42.840> inside

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
internal because they come from inside

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.620 
internal because they come from inside
of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.470> animal<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.549> our<00:01:44.729> response<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.479> be

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
of the animal now our response would be

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870 
of the animal now our response would be
an<00:01:45.720> animal's<00:01:46.259> reaction<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.009> any<00:01:47.250> type<00:01:47.850> of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
an animal's reaction to any type of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760 
an animal's reaction to any type of
stimulus<00:01:48.570> whether<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.079> internal<00:01:49.649> or

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
stimulus whether it be internal or

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
stimulus whether it be internal or
external<00:01:50.000> for<00:01:51.000> example<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> stimulus<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.530> be

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
external for example a stimulus would be

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.249 
external for example a stimulus would be
dry<00:01:53.070> mouth<00:01:53.460> maybe<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:56.600> particular<00:01:57.600> animal<00:01:58.049> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
dry mouth maybe the particular animal is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.969 
dry mouth maybe the particular animal is
in<00:01:58.680> hot<00:01:59.520> Sun<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.850> getting<00:02:00.390> very<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.979> thirsty

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
in hot Sun and getting very very thirsty

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.709 
in hot Sun and getting very very thirsty
and<00:02:02.420> panting<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.159> this<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.579> stimulus<00:02:06.450> via

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and panting and this is a stimulus via

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.660 
and panting and this is a stimulus via
dry<00:02:06.990> mouth<00:02:07.229> well<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> response<00:02:08.039> would<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
dry mouth well the response would be to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.740 
dry mouth well the response would be to
find<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.959> drink<00:02:10.410> some<00:02:10.649> water<00:02:11.120> so

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
find or drink some water so

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.330 
find or drink some water so
that's<00:02:12.840> how<00:02:12.990> this<00:02:13.200> works<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.860> behavior

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
that's how this works this is behavior

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.000 
that's how this works this is behavior

would<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:18.480> hot<00:02:19.410> stove<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
would be a hot stove and here we have a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.940 
would be a hot stove and here we have a
baby<00:02:21.420> touching<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.990> stove<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.500> maybe<00:02:22.650> it's

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
baby touching a stove and maybe it's

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400 
baby touching a stove and maybe it's
really<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.550> hot<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.660> their<00:02:24.930> response

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
really really hot and so their response

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.080 
really really hot and so their response
would<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:27.230> scream<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.590> pulling<00:02:29.370> their<00:02:29.700> hand

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
would be a scream or pulling their hand

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.480 
would be a scream or pulling their hand
back<00:02:30.300> because<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.620> hot<00:02:31.830> stove<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.370> would

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
back because of the hot stove that would

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.330 
back because of the hot stove that would
be<00:02:32.610> considered<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.150> reflex<00:02:33.660> or<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.959> response<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
be considered a reflex or a response to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.440 
be considered a reflex or a response to
the<00:02:35.670> stimulus<00:02:37.790> now<00:02:38.790> there's<00:02:39.000> different<00:02:39.390> types

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the stimulus now there's different types

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.800 
the stimulus now there's different types
of<00:02:39.930> behaviors<00:02:40.530> we<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.640> innate<00:02:42.120> behaviors

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
of behaviors we have innate behaviors

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.100 
of behaviors we have innate behaviors
and<00:02:43.080> we<00:02:43.320> have<00:02:43.470> learned<00:02:43.860> behaviors<00:02:45.110> innate

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
and we have learned behaviors innate

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.960 
and we have learned behaviors innate
behaviors<00:02:46.800> are<00:02:47.040> behaviors<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
behaviors are behaviors that the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.650 
behaviors are behaviors that the
organism<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:49.040> born<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.640> they<00:02:50.970> don't<00:02:51.209> have<00:02:51.450> to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
organism is born with they don't have to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.650 
organism is born with they don't have to
learn<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.459> no<00:02:53.459> one<00:02:53.610> has<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.940> tell<00:02:54.209> them<00:02:54.390> how<00:02:54.600> to

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
learn it no one has to tell them how to

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.100 
learn it no one has to tell them how to
do<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.910> they<00:02:56.910> don't<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.510> learned<00:02:57.840> for

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
do it they don't have to be learned for

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:12.150 
do it they don't have to be learned for
example<00:02:59.030> sneezing<00:03:03.110> blinking<00:03:07.580> crying

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.240 

even<00:03:12.970> screaming<00:03:16.380> those<00:03:17.380> are<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.590> examples<00:03:18.190> of

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
even screaming those are the examples of

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.430 
even screaming those are the examples of
innate<00:03:18.730> behaviors<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.600> then<00:03:20.140> we<00:03:20.290> have

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
innate behaviors and then we have

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.990 
innate behaviors and then we have
learned<00:03:20.770> behaviors<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.640> these<00:03:21.790> are

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
learned behaviors and these are

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.270 
learned behaviors and these are
behaviors<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.810> been<00:03:23.560> learned<00:03:23.800> through

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
behaviors that have been learned through

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.590 
behaviors that have been learned through
life<00:03:24.580> experiences<00:03:25.510> over<00:03:25.990> time<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.710> example

life experiences over time for example

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.150 
life experiences over time for example
reading<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.750> writing<00:03:31.200> would<00:03:32.200> be<00:03:32.380> examples<00:03:32.770> of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
reading and writing would be examples of

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
might not be the nicest or prettiest

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
nests it might be a little bit sloppy

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.210 
nests it might be a little bit sloppy
but<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.930> birds<00:04:23.200> know<00:04:23.500> innately<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:24.100> they

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
but the birds know innately that they

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.659 
but the birds know innately that they
have<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.640> build<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:24.970> nest<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:25.360> order<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.750> survive

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
have to build a nest in order to survive

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.520 
have to build a nest in order to survive
insects<00:04:27.669> also<00:04:28.270> have<00:04:28.510> mostly<00:04:29.020> innate

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
insects also have mostly innate

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.620 
insects also have mostly innate
behaviors<00:04:30.160> because<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:31.090> their<00:04:31.240> short

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
behaviors because of their short

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.610 
behaviors because of their short
lifespan<00:04:32.350> they<00:04:32.890> don't<00:04:33.190> have<00:04:34.050> parents<00:04:35.050> around

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
lifespan they don't have parents around

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:46.239 
lifespan they don't have parents around
to<00:04:38.620> teach<00:04:38.919> them<00:04:41.010> learn<00:04:42.010> behaviors

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:46.249 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.699 

so<00:04:46.849> you<00:04:46.939> don't<00:04:47.119> have<00:04:47.269> to<00:04:47.389> teach<00:04:47.629> a<00:04:47.779> fly<00:04:48.019> how<00:04:48.649> to

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:48.709 
so you don't have to teach a fly how to

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:51.399 
so you don't have to teach a fly how to
fly<00:04:49.239> they<00:04:50.239> automatically<00:04:50.839> know<00:04:51.079> that<00:04:51.109> and

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
fly they automatically know that and

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.109 
fly they automatically know that and
that's<00:04:51.469> what<00:04:52.009> we<00:04:52.129> were<00:04:52.249> considered<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:52.759> be<00:04:52.909> an

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:53.119 
that's what we were considered to be an

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:56.019 
that's what we were considered to be an
innate<00:04:53.599> behavior<00:04:54.429> to<00:04:55.429> teach<00:04:55.639> them<00:04:55.849> learn

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:56.029 
innate behavior to teach them learn

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:01.599 
innate behavior to teach them learn
behaviors<00:04:57.669> all<00:04:58.669> right<00:04:59.079> also<00:05:00.159> we<00:05:01.159> have<00:05:01.339> what<00:05:01.489> we

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:01.609 
behaviors all right also we have what we

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:04.839 
behaviors all right also we have what we
call<00:05:01.819> a<00:05:01.999> reflex<00:05:02.809> or<00:05:03.339> automatic<00:05:04.339> message<00:05:04.579> a

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
call a reflex or automatic message a

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.909 
call a reflex or automatic message a
reflex<00:05:05.269> is<00:05:05.449> considered<00:05:06.409> to<00:05:06.439> be<00:05:06.529> something

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
reflex is considered to be something

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.529 
reflex is considered to be something
that's<00:05:07.099> automatic<00:05:07.819> that<00:05:07.939> you<00:05:08.119> don't<00:05:08.269> have<00:05:08.419> to

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
that's automatic that you don't have to

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.299 
that's automatic that you don't have to
think<00:05:08.779> about<00:05:08.869> it<00:05:09.049> it's<00:05:09.529> a<00:05:09.649> very<00:05:09.859> simple

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:10.309 
think about it it's a very simple

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:13.539 
think about it it's a very simple
pattern<00:05:11.269> of<00:05:11.539> innate<00:05:12.439> behavior<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:13.279> just

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:13.549 
pattern of innate behavior so just

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:15.909 
pattern of innate behavior so just
sneezing<00:05:14.119> blinking<00:05:14.719> or<00:05:14.869> pulling<00:05:15.469> your<00:05:15.709> hand

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
sneezing blinking or pulling your hand

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.809 
sneezing blinking or pulling your hand
away<00:05:16.069> from<00:05:16.339> a<00:05:16.429> hot<00:05:16.609> stove<00:05:16.969> those<00:05:17.539> things<00:05:17.869> are

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
away from a hot stove those things are

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.279 
away from a hot stove those things are
automatic<00:05:19.819> messages<00:05:20.269> that<00:05:20.449> don't<00:05:20.629> need<00:05:21.079> to<00:05:21.139> be

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
automatic messages that don't need to be

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.989 
automatic messages that don't need to be
processed<00:05:21.709> in<00:05:22.219> the<00:05:22.249> brain<00:05:22.659> as<00:05:23.659> soon<00:05:23.959> as<00:05:24.289> that

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:24.999 
processed in the brain as soon as that

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.689 
processed in the brain as soon as that
stimulus<00:05:25.999> occurs<00:05:26.569> that<00:05:26.899> causes<00:05:27.349> a<00:05:27.379> sneeze<00:05:28.219> for

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
stimulus occurs that causes a sneeze for

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.969 
stimulus occurs that causes a sneeze for
example<00:05:29.119> dust<00:05:29.419> that<00:05:29.749> maybe<00:05:29.989> goes<00:05:30.619> up<00:05:30.829> your

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
example dust that maybe goes up your

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.889 
example dust that maybe goes up your
nose<00:05:31.039> your<00:05:31.849> brain<00:05:32.119> doesn't<00:05:32.389> have<00:05:32.719> to

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:32.899 
nose your brain doesn't have to

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.019 
nose your brain doesn't have to
automatically<00:05:33.619> say<00:05:33.829> oh<00:05:34.009> I<00:05:34.429> need<00:05:34.699> to<00:05:34.819> sneeze

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:35.029 
automatically say oh I need to sneeze

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:37.749 
automatically say oh I need to sneeze
and<00:05:35.269> your<00:05:35.449> body<00:05:35.689> automatically<00:05:36.529> reacts<00:05:37.459> to

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
and your body automatically reacts to

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.929 
and your body automatically reacts to
that<00:05:37.969> and<00:05:38.839> so<00:05:39.019> you<00:05:39.079> sneeze<00:05:39.439> and<00:05:40.429> then<00:05:40.579> we<00:05:40.729> have

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:40.939 
that and so you sneeze and then we have

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.359 
that and so you sneeze and then we have
something<00:05:41.269> called<00:05:41.559> instinctive<00:05:42.559> behaviors

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:43.369 
something called instinctive behaviors

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:45.669 
something called instinctive behaviors
and<00:05:43.669> those<00:05:44.059> are<00:05:44.269> type<00:05:44.659> of<00:05:44.869> innate<00:05:45.169> behavior

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:45.679 
and those are type of innate behavior

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.009 
and those are type of innate behavior
which<00:05:46.159> is<00:05:46.309> more<00:05:46.489> of<00:05:46.579> a<00:05:46.669> complex<00:05:47.299> pattern<00:05:47.869> of

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:48.019 
which is more of a complex pattern of

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:50.109 
which is more of a complex pattern of
innate<00:05:48.439> behaviors<00:05:48.979> for<00:05:49.189> example<00:05:49.609> a<00:05:49.729> spider

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:50.119 
innate behaviors for example a spider

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:52.419 
innate behaviors for example a spider
spinning<00:05:51.019> a<00:05:51.259> web<00:05:51.469> would<00:05:51.739> be<00:05:51.889> considered<00:05:52.309> an

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:52.429 
spinning a web would be considered an

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:55.419 
spinning a web would be considered an
instinctive<00:05:53.089> behavior<00:05:53.599> it<00:05:53.979> definitely<00:05:54.979> is

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:55.429 
instinctive behavior it definitely is

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:58.359 
instinctive behavior it definitely is
more<00:05:56.239> complex<00:05:56.749> than<00:05:57.139> say<00:05:57.499> sneezing<00:05:58.219> or

00:05:58.359 --> 00:05:58.369 
more complex than say sneezing or

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:00.879 
more complex than say sneezing or
blinking<00:05:58.909> however<00:05:59.629> a<00:05:59.749> spider<00:06:00.110> automatically

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
blinking however a spider automatically

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:02.589 
blinking however a spider automatically
knows<00:06:01.069> that<00:06:01.249> it<00:06:01.339> has<00:06:01.519> to<00:06:01.669> spin<00:06:01.849> a<00:06:01.909> web<00:06:02.119> but

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
knows that it has to spin a web but

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.209 
knows that it has to spin a web but
again<00:06:02.839> just<00:06:03.079> like<00:06:03.199> a<00:06:03.259> bird<00:06:03.559> building<00:06:03.919> a<00:06:03.979> nest

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
again just like a bird building a nest

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.969 
again just like a bird building a nest
it<00:06:04.489> may<00:06:04.639> take<00:06:04.939> some<00:06:05.149> time<00:06:05.419> for<00:06:05.449> that<00:06:05.779> web<00:06:06.499> to<00:06:06.829> be

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
it may take some time for that web to be

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.600 
it may take some time for that web to be
perfect<00:06:08.319> but<00:06:09.319> they<00:06:09.529> knows<00:06:09.769> automatically

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
perfect but they knows automatically

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.989 
perfect but they knows automatically
that<00:06:11.119> it<00:06:11.269> needs<00:06:11.479> to<00:06:11.689> do<00:06:11.809> that
