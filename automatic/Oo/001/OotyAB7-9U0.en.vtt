00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.970
 we have before us material intended for 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.359
 laying wooden log houses 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.359
 from timber 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.410
 the first we watch the material is jute 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.460
 tape 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.820
 Here is such a thickness of 5 6 millimeters clean 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.340
 Jude width can be different 15-20 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.490
 centimeters wide the given materials 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.619
 used as gasket in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.520
 glued laminated timber in profiled why 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.770
 because the tape is quite thin 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.660
 five to six millimeters is the quality 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 the bar should be very good 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.270
 if the quality of the log is not very good or 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.700
 proust timber ordinary sawn 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.379
 four times that applied here 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.020
 audio tape we see how she 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.750
 thick is 8 millimeters thick she 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.739
 a little more expensive but the quality 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.190
 much better it is denser thicker and the house is from 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.750
 the balk will be quite warm here we are 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.630
 look and see 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.380
 the fact of the so -called and this is up 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.380
 currently used for insulation 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.680
 houses from a bar 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.960
 but working with her is much more difficult because 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.830
 that it needs to be aligned to stack it 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.250
 blown away by the wind 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.720
 so you can attach 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.470
 material is more used for 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.920
 caulking iron 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.460
 already defended houses from timber 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.750
 Well, the last one is like ecologically 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 pure natural material 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.880
 so called could for log cabins here we 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.140
 see its structure 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.290
 he is called kukushkin done if 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.960
 well well , differently its builders 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.049
 also called red moss or brown could 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.840
 it grows in swamps environmentally friendly 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.689
 harmless but the rule is such a builder is not 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.100
 who collect wooden houses from 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.110
 cant us he must be on to possess 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.399
 highly skilled and able to be with him 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.190
 work in more detail about heaters 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.690
 can read 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:15.130
 By the way I am attached to this article. 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:20.630
 video file well and also see 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.930
 materials on the site this heater 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.910
 Our company sells winter home

 please can buy come to 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.890
 any time 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.390
 Well, get advice on
