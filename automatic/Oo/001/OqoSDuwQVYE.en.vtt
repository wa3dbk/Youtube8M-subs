this video for over a week but
personally<00:00:37.460> i<00:00:37.640> think<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:38.180> answer<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.540> yes<00:00:38.950> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.640 
personally i think the answer is yes and
even<00:00:40.520> if<00:00:40.880> you<00:00:41.000> throw<00:00:41.390> world's<00:00:41.870> just<00:00:42.200> out<00:00:42.350> the

Worlds and then if one one of the
Japanese<00:01:03.350> nationals<00:01:03.860> too<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:04.430> it's<00:01:04.610> like<00:01:04.820> the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
Japanese nationals too so it's like the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.330 
Japanese nationals too so it's like the
deck<00:01:05.810> has<00:01:06.050> clearly<00:01:06.350> been<00:01:06.650> doing<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.070> staying

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
deck has clearly been doing it staying

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.610 
deck has clearly been doing it staying
on<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.790> biggest<00:01:08.000> stages<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.930> I<00:01:09.080> think<00:01:09.380> that

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
on the biggest stages and I think that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.140 
on the biggest stages and I think that
you<00:01:09.770> know<00:01:09.860> some<00:01:10.100> of<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.310> has<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.520> do<00:01:10.820> with<00:01:11.060> the

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
you know some of that has to do with the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.760 
you know some of that has to do with the
fact<00:01:11.180> that<00:01:11.420> exit<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:11.960> night<00:01:12.170> gave<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.530> deck

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
fact that exit on night gave the deck

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.280 
fact that exit on night gave the deck
and<00:01:13.040> incredibly<00:01:13.909> easy<00:01:14.150> answer<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.200> whole

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
and incredibly easy answer to the whole

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.500 
and incredibly easy answer to the whole
set<00:01:15.680> five<00:01:15.950> back<00:01:16.310> Oh<00:01:16.340> nonsense<00:01:16.729> that<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.270> lot<00:01:17.479> of

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
set five back Oh nonsense that a lot of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.660 
set five back Oh nonsense that a lot of
decks<00:01:17.780> use<00:01:17.930> as<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.200> strategy<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.620> win<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.190> the

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
decks use as a strategy to win and the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.920 
decks use as a strategy to win and the
deck<00:01:19.850> kind<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:20.270> which<00:01:20.360> struggled<00:01:20.630> with<00:01:20.900> that

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
deck kind of which struggled with that

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.600 
deck kind of which struggled with that
before<00:01:21.470> if<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:21.740> just<00:01:21.950> walled<00:01:22.159> up<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.400> whole

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
before if you just walled up a whole

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.399 
before if you just walled up a whole
bunch<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.909> defenses<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.780> ferny<00:01:24.020> was<00:01:24.260> just

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
bunch of defenses and ferny was just

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.960 
bunch of defenses and ferny was just
like<00:01:24.530> well<00:01:24.710> damn<00:01:24.890> we<00:01:25.190> can't<00:01:25.370> fight<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:25.700> all<00:01:25.850> of

like well damn we can't fight you all of

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.490 
like well damn we can't fight you all of
that<00:01:26.090> unless<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:26.780> have<00:01:27.080> like<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.470> perfect

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
that unless we have like the perfect

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.039 
that unless we have like the perfect
storm<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:29.060> whole<00:01:29.330> bunch<00:01:29.540> of<00:01:29.659> back<00:01:29.840> row

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049

storm of a whole bunch of back row
removable<00:01:30.560> plus<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> way<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.340> special<00:01:31.729> summon

Archfiend<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.229> being<00:01:33.380> said<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:33.830> think

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
Archfiend with that being said I think

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.950 
Archfiend with that being said I think
that<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.700> all<00:01:34.760> agree<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.630> biggest

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
that we can all agree that the biggest

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.300 
that we can all agree that the biggest
reason<00:01:36.260> that<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.470> deck<00:01:36.650> is<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:36.920> good<00:01:37.159> right

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
reason that the deck is so good right

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.950 
reason that the deck is so good right
now<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.700> because<00:01:37.880> solar<00:01:38.270> charge<00:01:38.600> basically

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
now is because solar charge basically

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.590 
now is because solar charge basically
took<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.530> deck<00:01:39.770> back<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.610> when<00:01:40.850> launcher<00:01:41.450> was

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.380 
Mikkel made an excellent point about in
front<00:01:45.650> of<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.830> during<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.159> world<00:01:46.400> stream<00:01:46.909> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
front of you during the world stream and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.969 
front of you during the world stream and
it's<00:01:47.720> something<00:01:48.140> that<00:01:48.320> I<00:01:48.470> hadn't<00:01:48.770> really

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
it's something that I hadn't really

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.130 
it's something that I hadn't really
thought<00:01:49.010> about<00:01:49.280> but<00:01:49.970> right<00:01:50.360> now<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.570> think<00:01:50.780> that

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
thought about but right now I think that

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.380 
thought about but right now I think that
it's<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.439> sole<00:01:51.710> reason<00:01:51.950> why<00:01:52.220> it's<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.090> best

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
it's the sole reason why it's the best

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.660 
it's the sole reason why it's the best
debt<00:01:53.659> currently<00:01:54.170> he<00:01:54.680> said<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.280> front<00:01:55.310> of

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
debt currently he said that in front of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.550 
debt currently he said that in front of
he<00:01:55.790> doesn't<00:01:56.240> care<00:01:56.450> about<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.900> maiden<00:01:57.380> late

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
he doesn't care about the maiden late

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.679 
he doesn't care about the maiden late
game<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.040> basically<00:01:58.520> wants<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.000> go<00:01:59.210> off<00:01:59.420> and

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
game and basically wants to go off and

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:00.969 
game and basically wants to go off and
wants<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.900> search<00:02:00.200> out<00:02:00.380> all<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.530> its<00:02:00.770> power

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
wants to search out all of its power

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.770 
wants to search out all of its power
traps<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.610> then<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.119> wants<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.390> use<00:02:02.570> those

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
traps and then it wants to use those

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.539 
traps and then it wants to use those
power<00:02:03.110> traps<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.530> simplify<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.040> game<00:02:04.310> and

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
power traps to simplify the game and

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.399 
power traps to simplify the game and
then<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.759> just<00:02:04.939> winds<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.420> it's<00:02:06.110> crazy

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
then it just winds and it's crazy

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.529 
then it just winds and it's crazy
because<00:02:06.680> it's<00:02:07.159> kind<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.729> play<00:02:07.970> style<00:02:08.299> that

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
because it's kind of a play style that

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.419 
because it's kind of a play style that
solely<00:02:08.840> belongs<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:09.739> deck<00:02:09.979> right<00:02:10.219> now<00:02:10.249> I

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
solely belongs to this deck right now I

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.070 
solely belongs to this deck right now I
mean<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.329> can<00:02:11.510> think<00:02:11.719> of<00:02:11.959> other<00:02:12.319> decks<00:02:12.709> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
mean you can think of other decks that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
mean you can think of other decks that
tried<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.530> work<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.890> way<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.400> they<00:02:14.520> were

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
tried to work this way but they were

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.270 
tried to work this way but they were
generally<00:02:15.150> bad<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.840> inconsistent<00:02:16.650> ftk<00:02:17.220> is

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
generally bad and inconsistent ftk is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.400 
generally bad and inconsistent ftk is
like<00:02:17.520> exod<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.120> stuff<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.660> mean<00:02:18.870> you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
like exod and stuff like that I mean you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.690 
like exod and stuff like that I mean you
just<00:02:19.440> weren't<00:02:19.830> going<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.490> deck

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
just weren't going to have that deck

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.580 
just weren't going to have that deck
work<00:02:21.000> during<00:02:21.450> an<00:02:21.570> eight<00:02:21.780> or<00:02:21.960> nine<00:02:22.260> round

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
work during an eight or nine round

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
work during an eight or nine round
advantage<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.100> wasn't<00:02:23.400> going<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.550> happen

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
advantage this wasn't going to happen

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.180 
advantage this wasn't going to happen
and<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.930> think<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.620> new<00:02:25.920> rule

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
and I think that with the new rule

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.310 
and I think that with the new rule
change<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.820> farted<00:02:27.210> he<00:02:27.270> actually<00:02:27.510> got<00:02:27.900> better

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
change and farted he actually got better

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.530 
change and farted he actually got better
because<00:02:28.590> we've<00:02:29.460> seen<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.060> debt<00:02:30.270> can

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
because we've seen that the debt can

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.600 
because we've seen that the debt can
routinely<00:02:30.960> take<00:02:31.410> an<00:02:31.650> opening<00:02:32.070> hand<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.400> five

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
routinely take an opening hand of five

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.910 
routinely take an opening hand of five
cards<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.270> convert<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.930> into<00:02:34.170> anywhere

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
cards and convert that into anywhere

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.210 
cards and convert that into anywhere
upwards<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.700> 11<00:02:36.480> cards<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.110> obviously<00:02:37.980> going

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
upwards of 11 cards so obviously going

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.370 
upwards of 11 cards so obviously going
second<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:38.970> getting<00:02:39.210> that<00:02:39.360> extra<00:02:39.540> card<00:02:39.990> you

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
second and getting that extra card you

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.170 
second and getting that extra card you
know<00:02:40.500> giving<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.920> six<00:02:41.190> cards<00:02:41.550> means<00:02:41.760> nothing

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
know giving you six cards means nothing

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.120 
know giving you six cards means nothing
because<00:02:42.210> you've<00:02:43.020> already<00:02:43.320> started<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.980> gain

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
because you've already started to gain

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.740 
because you've already started to gain
mega<00:02:44.550> five<00:02:44.790> if<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.300> wrap<00:02:45.450> your<00:02:45.480> head

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
mega five if you can wrap your head

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.710 
mega five if you can wrap your head
around<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.230> or<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.370> deck<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:47.910> seconds

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
around that or the deck can go seconds

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.320 
around that or the deck can go seconds
and<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.500> has<00:02:49.620> more<00:02:49.920> resources<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:51.180> know

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
and now it has more resources you know

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.540 
and now it has more resources you know
it<00:02:51.630> has<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.080> fact<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.190> less

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
it has the fact that you have less

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.300 
it has the fact that you have less
defense<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.080> attack<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.740> it's<00:02:56.040> kind

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
defense and it can attack so it's kind

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.460 
defense and it can attack so it's kind
of<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.490> same<00:02:56.700> situation<00:02:57.360> as<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.630> mentioned

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
of the same situation as I mentioned

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.590 
of the same situation as I mentioned
with<00:02:58.620> her<00:02:58.770> addicts<00:02:59.190> going<00:02:59.910> second<00:03:00.420> with

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
with her addicts going second with

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.320 
with her addicts going second with
infernity<00:03:01.050> actually<00:03:01.709> isn't<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.220> bad<00:03:02.370> unless

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
infernity actually isn't that bad unless

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.060 
infernity actually isn't that bad unless
you<00:03:03.480> have<00:03:03.540> murmillo<00:03:04.050> where<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.680> have<00:03:04.860> that

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
you have murmillo where you have that

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.980 
you have murmillo where you have that
extra<00:03:05.430> defensive<00:03:05.940> option<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.660> you're<00:03:06.750> still

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
extra defensive option and you're still

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.320 
extra defensive option and you're still
at<00:03:07.110> six<00:03:07.350> cards<00:03:07.790> everything<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.820> I've<00:03:09.060> said

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
at six cards everything that I've said

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.360 
at six cards everything that I've said
basically<00:03:09.600> favor<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.650> important<00:03:11.100> player

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
basically favor is the important player

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.949 
basically favor is the important player
when<00:03:11.730> they're<00:03:11.850> going<00:03:12.120> second<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.750> then<00:03:12.840> of

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
when they're going second and then of

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.470 
when they're going second and then of
course<00:03:12.990> you<00:03:13.709> know<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.430> oh<00:03:14.610> D<00:03:14.820> K<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.120> you

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
course you know it can oh D K so you

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.390 
course you know it can oh D K so you
know<00:03:15.750> ask<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.200> second<00:03:16.800> place<00:03:16.950> do<00:03:17.160> that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
know ask the second place do that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.370 
know ask the second place do that
world's<00:03:17.730> if<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.910> don't<00:03:18.090> believe<00:03:18.360> me<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.750> would

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
world's if you don't believe me I would

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
anyway so at some point you defense was

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.940 
anyway so at some point you defense was
going<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.720> crack<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.440> kind<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.830> does

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
going to crack this that kind of does

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.949 
going to crack this that kind of does
the<00:03:56.070> same<00:03:56.310> thing<00:03:56.610> if<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.239> commit<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.750> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
the same thing if you commit to the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.690 
the same thing if you commit to the
board<00:03:58.200> heavy<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:58.860> keeps<00:03:59.130> trying<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.519> some

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
board heavy it just keeps trying to some

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.310 
board heavy it just keeps trying to some
in<00:03:59.880> at<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.300> time<00:04:00.450> night<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.230> know

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
in at the time night to you know

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.040 
in at the time night to you know
basically<00:04:01.590> get<00:04:02.550> rid<00:04:02.700> of<00:04:02.730> your<00:04:02.880> back<00:04:03.150> row<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.720> I

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
basically get rid of your back row and I

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.080 
basically get rid of your back row and I
would<00:04:04.260> say<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.530> second<00:04:04.920> thing<00:04:05.100> is<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.820> dets

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
would say the second thing is the dets

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.110 
would say the second thing is the dets
willingness<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.959> go<00:04:07.110> crazy<00:04:07.440> neg<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.340> spending

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
willingness to go crazy neg and spending

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.060 
willingness to go crazy neg and spending
so<00:04:09.420> much<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:09.660> its<00:04:09.900> resources<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.709> its<00:04:10.799> first

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
so much of its resources and its first

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.070 
so much of its resources and its first
turn<00:04:11.400> remember<00:04:12.000> how<00:04:12.120> dragon<00:04:12.510> rulers<00:04:12.780> used<00:04:12.810> to

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
turn remember how dragon rulers used to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.900 
turn remember how dragon rulers used to
discard<00:04:13.440> like<00:04:13.709> crazy<00:04:14.070> during<00:04:14.340> their<00:04:14.549> opening

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
discard like crazy during their opening

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.370 
discard like crazy during their opening
turn<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.150> mean<00:04:15.450> they<00:04:15.540> would<00:04:15.660> discard<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.200> whole

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
turn I mean they would discard a whole

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.289 
turn I mean they would discard a whole
bunch<00:04:16.590> of<00:04:16.650> cards<00:04:16.859> for<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.100> babies<00:04:17.549> or<00:04:17.880> they

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
bunch of cards for the babies or they

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.909 
bunch of cards for the babies or they
would<00:04:18.479> discard<00:04:18.870> for<00:04:19.140> tempest<00:04:19.470> effect

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
would discard for tempest effect

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.560 
would discard for tempest effect
basically<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.729> build<00:04:21.030> up<00:04:21.150> their<00:04:21.330> graveyard

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
basically just build up their graveyard

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.500 
basically just build up their graveyard
so<00:04:22.080> that<00:04:22.200> they<00:04:22.289> could<00:04:22.470> use<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.800> kind<00:04:23.039> of

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
so that they could use that kind of

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.840 
so that they could use that kind of
an<00:04:23.690> infinite<00:04:24.560> resource<00:04:25.070> throughout<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.610> duel

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
an infinite resource throughout the duel

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.880 
an infinite resource throughout the duel
and<00:04:26.240> then<00:04:26.720> they<00:04:26.840> would<00:04:26.990> just<00:04:27.020> flip<00:04:27.290> over<00:04:27.590> super

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
and then they would just flip over super

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.800 
and then they would just flip over super
rejuvenation<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.550> draw<00:04:28.730> like<00:04:28.940> six<00:04:29.240> cards<00:04:29.660> and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
rejuvenation and draw like six cards and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.210 
rejuvenation and draw like six cards and
it'd<00:04:29.900> be<00:04:29.960> like<00:04:30.080> damn<00:04:30.350> they<00:04:30.560> just<00:04:30.770> recovered

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
it'd be like damn they just recovered

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.000 
it'd be like damn they just recovered
completely<00:04:31.900> infernity<00:04:32.900> does<00:04:33.170> kind<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.680> the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
completely infernity does kind of the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.070 
completely infernity does kind of the
same<00:04:34.280> thing<00:04:34.340> like<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.210> uses<00:04:35.570> all<00:04:35.810> of<00:04:35.840> its

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
same thing like it uses all of its

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.500 
same thing like it uses all of its
resources<00:04:36.260> mainly<00:04:37.190> its<00:04:37.310> monsters<00:04:37.910> for

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
resources mainly its monsters for

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.810 
resources mainly its monsters for
constant<00:04:39.050> ixia<00:04:39.380> temps<00:04:39.770> whether<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.250> be<00:04:40.490> you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
constant ixia temps whether that be you

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.180 
constant ixia temps whether that be you
know<00:04:40.970> like<00:04:41.300> exits<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.930> nights<00:04:42.230> or<00:04:42.530> lavabo

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
know like exits on nights or lavabo

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.430 
know like exits on nights or lavabo
chain<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.850> then<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.690> know<00:04:44.810> if<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:44.990> use<00:04:45.170> back

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
chain and then you know if you use back

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.530 
chain and then you know if you use back
row<00:04:45.680> on<00:04:45.920> those<00:04:46.100> cards<00:04:46.580> or<00:04:46.700> you<00:04:46.790> don't<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.360> deck

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
row on those cards or you don't the deck

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
row on those cards or you don't the deck
is<00:04:47.690> like<00:04:47.870> well<00:04:48.050> we<00:04:48.200> don't<00:04:48.320> really<00:04:48.380> care

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
is like well we don't really care

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.630 
is like well we don't really care
because<00:04:48.830> we're<00:04:49.100> just<00:04:49.250> going<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.400> sole<00:04:49.610> charge

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
because we're just going to sole charge

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.360 
because we're just going to sole charge
everything<00:04:50.510> back<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.230> even<00:04:51.890> if<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.160> use

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
everything back so even if you use

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.100 
everything back so even if you use
removal<00:04:52.970> on<00:04:53.120> our<00:04:53.270> cards<00:04:53.660> it's<00:04:53.780> like<00:04:53.900> we're

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
removal on our cards it's like we're

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.260 
removal on our cards it's like we're
getting<00:04:54.350> them<00:04:54.500> all<00:04:54.650> back<00:04:54.800> anyway<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.700> the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
getting them all back anyway and the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.090 
getting them all back anyway and the
deck<00:04:56.480> is<00:04:56.510> fine<00:04:56.900> taking<00:04:57.260> these<00:04:57.500> heavy<00:04:57.800> losses

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
deck is fine taking these heavy losses

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.950 
deck is fine taking these heavy losses
early<00:04:58.490> because<00:04:58.820> it<00:04:59.240> knows<00:04:59.450> that<00:04:59.690> when<00:04:59.870> it

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
early because it knows that when it

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.110 
early because it knows that when it
really<00:05:00.230> starts<00:05:00.500> going<00:05:00.770> off<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.250> Archfiend

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
really starts going off that Archfiend

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.090 
really starts going off that Archfiend
is<00:05:02.330> just<00:05:02.540> going<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:02.750> get<00:05:02.870> it<00:05:03.020> cards<00:05:03.410> over<00:05:03.830> and

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
is just going to get it cards over and

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.130 
is just going to get it cards over and
over<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.640> over<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.030> over<00:05:05.300> again<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:05.750> every

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
over and over and over again and every

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.620 
over and over and over again and every
time<00:05:06.320> they<00:05:06.470> use<00:05:06.500> Archfiend<00:05:07.130> echo<00:05:07.310> +1<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:07.910> you

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
time they use Archfiend echo +1 and you

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.870 
time they use Archfiend echo +1 and you
know<00:05:08.750> after<00:05:09.020> going<00:05:09.380> like<00:05:09.950> Archfiend<00:05:10.580> five

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
know after going like Archfiend five

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.060 
know after going like Archfiend five
times<00:05:11.330> in<00:05:11.510> a<00:05:11.540> duel<00:05:11.780> or<00:05:12.020> five<00:05:12.290> times<00:05:12.530> in<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.860> turn

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
times in a duel or five times in a turn

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.620 
times in a duel or five times in a turn
and<00:05:13.340> basically<00:05:14.060> they've<00:05:14.300> recovered

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
and basically they've recovered

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.720 
and basically they've recovered
everything<00:05:15.050> that<00:05:15.590> they<00:05:15.710> want<00:05:15.980> so<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.490> you

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
everything that they want so that you

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.100 
everything that they want so that you
know<00:05:16.850> they're<00:05:17.060> ahead<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.360> you<00:05:17.660> or<00:05:17.870> they're

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
know they're ahead of you or they're

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.750 
know they're ahead of you or they're
equal<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.770> but<00:05:18.980> they<00:05:19.070> have<00:05:19.220> better<00:05:19.400> cards

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
equal to you but they have better cards

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.390 
equal to you but they have better cards
than<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.090> generally<00:05:20.510> do<00:05:20.690> so<00:05:21.200> I<00:05:21.500> think<00:05:21.680> that<00:05:22.160> I

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
than you generally do so I think that I

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.040 
than you generally do so I think that I
mean<00:05:22.790> you<00:05:23.120> look<00:05:23.150> at<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.540> deck<00:05:23.780> in<00:05:23.930> it

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
mean you look at the deck in it

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.620 
mean you look at the deck in it
literally<00:05:24.740> erases<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.640> mid<00:05:25.910> and<00:05:25.940> late<00:05:26.300> game

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
literally erases the mid and late game

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.960 
literally erases the mid and late game
it's<00:05:27.020> just<00:05:27.290> like<00:05:27.470> yeah<00:05:27.770> we're<00:05:28.370> not<00:05:28.520> gonna<00:05:28.730> play

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
it's just like yeah we're not gonna play

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.340 
it's just like yeah we're not gonna play
that<00:05:29.030> we're<00:05:29.420> going<00:05:29.600> to<00:05:29.660> make<00:05:29.750> sure<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.170> this

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
that we're going to make sure that this

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.710 
that we're going to make sure that this
game<00:05:30.620> is<00:05:30.650> decided<00:05:31.460> in<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.730> first<00:05:32.000> two<00:05:32.390> turns

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
game is decided in the first two turns

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.170 
game is decided in the first two turns
and<00:05:33.140> that's<00:05:33.920> how<00:05:34.100> we<00:05:34.160> roll<00:05:34.490> I<00:05:34.850> mean<00:05:35.000> I<00:05:35.030> think

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
and that's how we roll I mean I think

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.390 
and that's how we roll I mean I think
that<00:05:35.600> it's<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.900> best<00:05:36.140> deck<00:05:36.380> by<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.590> very<00:05:36.950> small

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
that it's the best deck by a very small

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.850 
that it's the best deck by a very small
margin<00:05:37.810> obviously<00:05:38.810> I<00:05:38.840> think<00:05:39.380> that<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.560> can

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
margin obviously I think that that can

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.130 
margin obviously I think that that can
change<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.520> I<00:05:41.030> thought<00:05:41.270> that<00:05:41.330> shadows<00:05:41.960> would

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
change and I thought that shadows would

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.390 
change and I thought that shadows would
be<00:05:42.320> one<00:05:42.500> of<00:05:42.590> those<00:05:42.680> decks<00:05:43.010> that<00:05:43.160> just

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
be one of those decks that just

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.160 
be one of those decks that just
completely<00:05:43.580> shuts<00:05:44.270> down<00:05:44.360> in<00:05:44.780> front<00:05:44.960> of<00:05:45.110> me

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
completely shuts down in front of me

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.110 
completely shuts down in front of me
because<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.770> mean<00:05:46.250> realistically<00:05:46.670> I<00:05:47.000> think

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
because I mean realistically I think

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.700 
because I mean realistically I think
Midwest<00:05:47.720> is<00:05:47.870> going<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.050> be<00:05:48.140> a<00:05:48.170> problem<00:05:48.440> for

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
Midwest is going to be a problem for

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.500 
Midwest is going to be a problem for
them<00:05:48.950> mean<00:05:49.280> outside<00:05:49.550> of<00:05:49.760> like<00:05:49.940> book<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.330> moon

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
them mean outside of like book of moon

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.150 
them mean outside of like book of moon
they<00:05:51.140> really<00:05:51.320> don't<00:05:51.470> have<00:05:51.650> a<00:05:51.680> lot<00:05:51.800> of<00:05:51.920> ways<00:05:52.130> to

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
they really don't have a lot of ways to

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.980 
they really don't have a lot of ways to
answer<00:05:52.670> it<00:05:52.820> but<00:05:53.210> then<00:05:53.360> I<00:05:53.390> thought<00:05:53.480> about<00:05:53.660> it's

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
answer it but then I thought about it's

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.240 
answer it but then I thought about it's
like<00:05:54.080> how<00:05:54.260> many<00:05:54.470> times<00:05:54.740> are<00:05:54.920> you<00:05:54.980> going<00:05:55.160> to

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
like how many times are you going to

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.460 
like how many times are you going to
open<00:05:55.490> with<00:05:56.120> a<00:05:56.150> first<00:05:56.450> turn<00:05:56.660> Midrash<00:05:57.110> I<00:05:57.320> mean

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
open with a first turn Midrash I mean

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.990 
open with a first turn Midrash I mean
realistically<00:05:57.770> if<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.370> don't<00:05:58.550> have<00:05:58.700> fusion

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
realistically if you don't have fusion

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.420 
realistically if you don't have fusion
you<00:05:59.210> can't<00:05:59.450> even<00:05:59.540> be<00:05:59.780> Midrash<00:06:00.170> turn<00:06:00.800> one<00:06:01.100> so

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
you can't even be Midrash turn one so

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.190 
you can't even be Midrash turn one so
you<00:06:02.120> know<00:06:02.270> I<00:06:02.300> don't<00:06:02.810> know<00:06:02.900> if<00:06:02.990> you're<00:06:03.110> gonna

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
you know I don't know if you're gonna

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.320 
you know I don't know if you're gonna
always<00:06:03.500> open<00:06:04.100> with<00:06:04.130> first<00:06:04.460> or<00:06:04.670> Midrash<00:06:05.060> them

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
always open with first or Midrash them

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.840 
always open with first or Midrash them
and<00:06:05.510> fir<00:06:06.080> to<00:06:06.200> be<00:06:06.290> um<00:06:06.620> is<00:06:07.040> definitely<00:06:07.640> going<00:06:07.760> to
