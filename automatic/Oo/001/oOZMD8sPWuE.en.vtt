driving<00:01:40.829> itself<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.790> have

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
driving itself but then you do have

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.899 
driving itself but then you do have
close-quarter<00:01:42.390> battles<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> side
