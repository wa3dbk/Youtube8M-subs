00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.310
 pleased with this agreement 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.979

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.530

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.700
 then we need 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.500
 the basic game at the patois tombs at 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.550
 each time they will either fall and 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:24.069
 here is the canister 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:28.390

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:33.620
 a really beautiful box 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.330
 this is then to the water yes what is 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.400
 I told you the small halls 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.140
 which I just told you I tell you that 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.750
 because I started going to 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.489
 is in the crossroads all that and 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.810
 suddenly I see we hold them there 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.400
 games they had been it 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.870
 was not at the right price so normally 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.360
 when you are in a store sent 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.250
 on the nickname in the radius the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.230
 barcode finally it's finally the little 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.930
 label he tells you that the price 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.910
 did she I put on the terminal behind he 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.590
 tells you that this game being me this 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.140
 that I did I took my picture 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.739
 heart in francs skin in photo with my 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.470
 portable 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.900
 so here I know I took a picture 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.370
 with this portal and I went to the box 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.470
 and I wait kills more than twenty minutes 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.810
 to have these games there so we go 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.880
 start then I have already searched the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.160
 price to show at what price I the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.299
 buy so we'll start with the game 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.819
 which cost me less 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.010
 yes because of course the Trojans who 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.160
 cost me less and I'll take you 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.099
 I started cheaper times so I 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.700
 found young thesis 2014 on wii or nine 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.989
 in blister 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.549
 instead of paying beats 9 euros 99 30 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.319

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.250
 there is a bit my my credit card here is the 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.380
 price of 10 euros is good I drag 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.069
 2014 that I bought for the price 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.620
 of 10 euros so an addition yes or for 10 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.840
 euros the second against the label 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.000
 a little ugly i found dark souls 2 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.389
 instead of paying it 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.030
 29 euros I have one and like saving 10 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.340
 euros in this country 19.99 so dark souls 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.540
 on xbox so do not hesitate to tell me what 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.450
 worth it 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.209
 the dark souls on xbox I was told the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.739
 well a lot of good on this game so 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.169
 I hope it's true so now 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.130
 let's see we must find the 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.780
 last because the last you 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.199
 do not believe me if not then the 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.539
 latest 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:31.850
 that's it, then I'm going to the radius m 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.940
 like that I go in the radius and what is 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.610
 what I see of a collector's edition 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.050
 limited so I bought 2 the 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.300
 second game the offered one for my 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.740
 family 1-1 and cousin he did not want 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.389
 more so so I offered him 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.220
 even though I do not speak much my family 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.099
 finally here it is seen so I hardly 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.320
 well for me I paid them 40 euros 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.340
 the cedh edition that came out there is a 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.220
 little moment already 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.220
 so already for the price I bought 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.380
 which 40 euros here is this word 40 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.060
 euros so I will not let me wait 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.940
 for a long time it's the hyrule 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.289
 limit limit warriors with 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.419
 the mauled 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.699
 4in finally at the level of the cats I 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.710
 take a little but me it's the game more 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.630
 the little the little quest gift in 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.449
 as usual so it's very 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.990
 pleasure to have had it especially for the 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.699
 price of 40 euros 40 euros that so I 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.710
 an age I bought both so that's me 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.159
 80 euros especially on the internet 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.070
 it by more than 4 between 80 and 90 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.990
 so it's hellish so I managed to 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.510
 find for 40 euros 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.280
