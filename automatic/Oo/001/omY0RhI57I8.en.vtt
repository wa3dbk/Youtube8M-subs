part<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> under<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> map<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.539> keep

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
part is under the map so you just keep

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.330 
part is under the map so you just keep
holding<00:00:24.930> forward<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.650> I'm<00:00:25.769> doing<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.279> you

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
holding forward like I'm doing and you

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.339 
holding forward like I'm doing and you
can<00:00:26.490> do<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.730> with<00:00:26.789> speed<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.570> without<00:00:27.930> speed

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
can do this with speed or without speed

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.769 
can do this with speed or without speed
it's<00:00:29.010> faster<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.519> speed<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.119> when<00:00:30.689> you

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
it's faster with speed you know when you

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.729 
it's faster with speed you know when you
run<00:00:30.990> faster<00:00:31.470> ah<00:00:32.989> but<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.350> actually

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
run faster ah but you can do actually

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.340 
run faster ah but you can do actually
without<00:00:34.980> speed<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.489> know<00:00:36.020> once<00:00:37.020> you're<00:00:37.140> there

i'm showing right now and you just want
a<00:01:31.290> knife<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.329> when<00:01:33.869> you're<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.200> top<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
a knife so when when you're on top of it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.649 
a knife so when when you're on top of it
you<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.130> top<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> map<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.299> actually

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you know top of the map you can actually

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.390 
you know top of the map you can actually
see<00:01:37.130> all<00:01:38.130> entire<00:01:38.939> map<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.100> kill

see all entire map and you can kill
enemies<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> i<00:01:43.170> think<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> first

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
enemies and i think this is the first

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219 
enemies and i think this is the first
knife<00:01:44.520> plunging<00:01:45.090> multiplayer<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.810> actually

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
knife plunging multiplayer that actually

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.410 
knife plunging multiplayer that actually
helps<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.250> lot<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.880> if<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> use<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
helps a lot you know so if you use a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.649 
helps a lot you know so if you use a
sniper<00:01:51.869> i<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> acting<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> best<00:01:53.659> way

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
sniper i think the acting the best way

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.420 
sniper i think the acting the best way
to<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> sniper<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.310> know

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to do this is with the sniper you know

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.069 
to do this is with the sniper you know
you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.790> actually<00:01:57.149> kill<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> lot<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> the

keep pressing a but this time don't
press<00:02:44.950> too<00:02:44.980> much<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:46.090> want<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.420> go<00:02:46.990> to

the<00:02:47.320> fence<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.610> right<00:02:48.850> here<00:02:49.060> what<00:02:49.360> I'm

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
the fence that is right here what I'm

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.920 
the fence that is right here what I'm
looking<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:51.640> slowly<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.600> fence

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
looking so just go slowly to the fence

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.580 
looking so just go slowly to the fence
and<00:02:54.030> it's<00:02:55.030> pretty<00:02:55.630> easy<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.930> know<00:02:56.080> is<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.440> will

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
and it's pretty easy you know is it will

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.470 
and it's pretty easy you know is it will
not<00:02:56.740> take<00:02:56.890> too<00:02:57.100> many<00:02:57.220> tries<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.910> think<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.300> can

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
not take too many tries I think you can

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.690 
not take too many tries I think you can
actually<00:02:58.780> do<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.080> first<00:02:59.380> time<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.430> next

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
actually do it the first time the next

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.340 
actually do it the first time the next
thing<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.090> want<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.300> jump<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.990> defense

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
thing you want to jump to the defense

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.160 
thing you want to jump to the defense
and<00:03:02.850> when<00:03:03.850> you're<00:03:04.240> there<00:03:04.510> there<00:03:04.810> will<00:03:04.959> be<00:03:04.990> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
and when you're there there will be a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.150 
and when you're there there will be a
lot<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.709> spots<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.820> can<00:03:06.940> actually<00:03:07.120> fall

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
lot of spots that it can actually fall

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.270 
lot of spots that it can actually fall
into<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.250> map<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:09.940> or<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:11.440> know<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.860> down
