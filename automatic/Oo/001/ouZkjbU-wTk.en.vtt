00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.340
We are with Peugeot 308. 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.180
In other words a.k.a. the car of the year 2014. 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.280
Previously I have tested the 308 with diesel engine and manual gearbox at Cyprus. 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.200
Let’s see, how 308 with 1.2-liter petrol engine and automatic gearbox is? 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.900
Let’s analyze it together.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.520
The exterior of the 308 possesses a modern design. 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.840
The grill that emphasize the new brand outlook of the Peugeot and headlamps with LED are pleasing to the eyes. 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.740
The 2620 mm. wheelbase gives small hints about the spacious living area of the interior. 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.580
The low-key rear section possesses a dignified appearance. 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.460
The cockpit of the 308 seems as good a quality as the premium models.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.640
Especially, the bicolor console and multimedia touchscreen have a big share in this. 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.200
Adequate areas are offered for your small items and the door bins are also quite large.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.940
On the subject of living space, the front is unproblematic 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.540
and good knee room and sufficient headroom is also offered at the rear. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.440
The boot with 428-liter capacity is 48-liter larger than the boot of the Golf. 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.880
Let’s consider the 308’s engine and driving features. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.760
In the car that I have been driving 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol engine is functioning. 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.880
You are able to get this engine that develops 130 HP and 230 Nm of torque either with 6-speed manual gearbox or with 6-speed automatic gearbox. 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.120
In this car 6-speed automatic gearbox is functioning. 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.880
Even though the engine is small it does not encounter any difficulty with the 1150 kg weight of the 308. 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.240
Its traction, in the city and in the open roads, possesses a character to satisfy all the expectations explicitly. 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.280
Because of the turbo charger the engine does not go through any sluggishness. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.600
I can clearly say that I liked the engine very much, 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.420
of course not only the engine; the 6-speed automatic gearbox is almost as good as the double clutch gearboxes. 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.680
Due to its fast and smooth changes it works in harmony with the engine. 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.080
With these engine and gearbox twosome it looks as if it is not very hard for the 308 to reach the success it is seeking. 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.920
Even though the comfort level of the suspensions of the 308 are approaching the class values, 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.140
due to its taut structure, it is perceived a bit deficient in road conditions of our country.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.000
But, still since its unfaltering road handling and because of the small steering wheel that fits into the hand very well, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the cornering performance is not bad at all.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.600
Let’s come to the fuel consumption of the 308. 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.500
Let me begin with the questions you have been wondering and kept asking. 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.280
Is this engine really that frugal and can it cover 1718 km with one tank? 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.220
There are two answers to these. It is yes and no. 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.360
If you ask how can these happen? Well, let me explain the ‘yes’ first. 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.160
Yes, you can do it because if you drive this car calmly, observing certain criteria’s, you can cruise with minimum fuel consumption. 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.880
As a matter of fact, the Peugeot Turkey did just that and broke a record. 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.340
Let us come to the ‘no’ part. No, you cannot do it because none of us drive the car like that in our daily usage. 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.900
Let me convey to you, as always, my experiences. 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.860
I have been driving this car for a week and have covered 400 km. 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.580
The trip computer at the moment indicates 7.8-liter fuel consumption averages. 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.740
This value is the true value a standard driver will achieve in a daily usage and if you ask me, it is not bad at all. 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.260
The 308 with the new 1.2-liter petrol engine and automatic gearbox looks like it has strengthened its hand considerably. 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:36.000
With this twosome that offers performance, comfort and economy it is not hard for the 308, even though it is late, to enter the competition. 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.020
See you…
