one has I feel like upgraded loot and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.200 
one has I feel like upgraded loot and
also<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> chance<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.430> elf<00:00:26.789> city

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
also you have a chance of elf city

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.029 
also you have a chance of elf city
related<00:00:27.660> items<00:00:27.960> especially<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:28.830> you're<00:00:29.010> on

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
related items especially if you're on

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.450 
related items especially if you're on
the<00:00:29.429> voice<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.849> Saren<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> believe<00:00:31.309> 99%<00:00:32.309> of

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the voice of Saren so I believe 99% of

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.490 
the voice of Saren so I believe 99% of
these<00:00:32.669> chests<00:00:33.480> were<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> voice<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.170> sarin

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
these chests were on the voice of sarin

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.990 
these chests were on the voice of sarin
I<00:00:34.590> might<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.950> missed<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.640> at<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> end

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
I might have missed right at the end

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
I might have missed right at the end
because<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.680> struggling

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
because I was like you know struggling

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.560 
because I was like you know struggling
to<00:00:38.309> finish<00:00:38.670> these<00:00:38.790> thousand<00:00:39.149> keys<00:00:39.329> right

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to finish these thousand keys right

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
to finish these thousand keys right
before<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.960> ended<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.379> might<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.950> done<00:00:41.100> maybe

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
before it ended I might have done maybe

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.100 
before it ended I might have done maybe
ten<00:00:41.670> keys<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:42.030> something<00:00:42.360> without<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.960> voice

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
ten keys or something without the voice

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.209 
ten keys or something without the voice
of<00:00:43.260> sarin<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:43.860> doesn't<00:00:44.100> matter

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
of sarin but that really doesn't matter

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
of sarin but that really doesn't matter
because<00:00:44.820> all<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.120> does<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.480> increase

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
because all it does is just increase

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
because all it does is just increase
your<00:00:46.620> chance<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> getting<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> elf<00:00:48.239> City

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
your chance of getting the elf City

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
your chance of getting the elf City
related<00:00:48.930> items<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.440> corrupted<00:00:49.829> or

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

motherlode shards and the tree blossoms

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
motherlode shards and the tree blossoms
which<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.250> opinion<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.120> my<00:00:54.300> play<00:00:54.539> style

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
only one out of those three is really

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
only one out of those three is really
useful<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.199> other<00:00:58.620> people<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.309> all

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you have to bank all the time and I feel

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300 
you have to bank all the time and I feel
like<00:01:38.579> 15<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.270> 16<00:01:39.689> or<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.049> Keys<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.890> probably<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
like 15 to 16 or so Keys is probably the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
like 15 to 16 or so Keys is probably the
best<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.790> another<00:01:42.780> thing<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.140> you're<00:01:43.290> going

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
best and another thing if you're going

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.719 
best and another thing if you're going
to<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.890> definitely<00:01:44.490> recommend

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to do this I definitely recommend

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.910 
to do this I definitely recommend
bringing<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.360> gem<00:01:45.659> bag<00:01:45.869> because<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> can

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
bringing a gem bag because then you can

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
bringing a gem bag because then you can
fill<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.280> with<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.670> diamonds<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> rubies

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
fill it with your diamonds and rubies

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.480 
fill it with your diamonds and rubies
and<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.290> saves<00:01:49.530> inventory<00:01:49.979> spots<00:01:50.250> because

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and really saves inventory spots because

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.980 
and really saves inventory spots because
every<00:01:50.670> time<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.780> don't

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
every time you get that and you don't

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.210 
every time you get that and you don't
have<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> gem<00:01:52.320> bag<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.680> kind<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> troll

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
have a gem bag it's kind of a troll

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.469 
have a gem bag it's kind of a troll
because<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.790> aux<00:01:54.119> fills<00:01:54.299> your

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
because it's like aux fills your

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.319 
because it's like aux fills your
inventory<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.100> every<00:01:56.100> time<00:01:56.310> you're<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.729> less

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
more experience so it actually is pretty

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.080 
more experience so it actually is pretty
decent<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:34.890> you<00:04:34.980> use<00:04:35.130> these<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.550> then<00:04:35.910> these

single day instead of getting one per

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.460 
single day instead of getting one per
day<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:42.000> can<00:04:42.120> get<00:04:42.330> two<00:04:42.630> I'll<00:04:42.960> probably<00:04:43.230> just

seven<00:05:54.390> mil<00:05:54.540> or<00:05:54.690> whatever<00:05:54.990> this<00:05:55.169> is<00:05:55.229> I<00:05:56.040> think

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
seven mil or whatever this is I think

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.640 
seven mil or whatever this is I think
it's<00:05:56.910> worth<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.090> corrupted<00:05:58.050> or<00:05:58.200> because<00:05:58.500> the

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
it's worth the corrupted or because the

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.990 
it's worth the corrupted or because the
corrupted<00:05:58.950> or<00:05:59.070> even<00:05:59.340> though<00:05:59.400> that<00:05:59.669> will<00:05:59.790> take

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
corrupted or even though that will take

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.730 
corrupted or even though that will take
probably<00:06:00.180> three<00:06:00.600> hours<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.990> finish<00:06:01.169> it's

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
probably three hours to finish it's

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.950 
probably three hours to finish it's
super<00:06:02.160> AF<00:06:02.370> K<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:02.850> that's<00:06:02.970> like<00:06:03.150> 700<00:06:03.840> K

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
super AF K and that's like 700 K

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.909 
super AF K and that's like 700 K

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
that's like 600 K or something lower

that's mainly from the diamonds and the
rubies<00:06:15.810> surprisingly<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.950> thought<00:06:17.370> that<00:06:17.520> would

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
rubies surprisingly I thought that would

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.640 
rubies surprisingly I thought that would
be<00:06:17.640> a<00:06:17.729> little<00:06:17.910> bit<00:06:18.120> higher<00:06:18.380> than<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.500> Med

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.110 
be a little bit higher than the Med
