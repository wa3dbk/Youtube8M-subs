easier<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.420> gathered<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.170> top

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
easier if you just gathered at the top

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.789 
easier if you just gathered at the top

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and twist it a little then you just hook

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.730 
and twist it a little then you just hook
your<00:01:47.009> hair<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:48.140> then<00:01:49.140> you're<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> move
