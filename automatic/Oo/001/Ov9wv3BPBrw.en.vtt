00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
goal and I know to me I'm more of an

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000 
goal and I know to me I'm more of an
attacking<00:01:11.820> type<00:01:12.240> footballer<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.830> really

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
attacking type footballer I don't really

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.609 
attacking type footballer I don't really
care<00:01:14.310> about<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.760> defense<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.049> score<00:01:16.380> more

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.560 
care about the defense if I score more
goals<00:01:16.650> than<00:01:17.009> somebody<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.850> probably<00:01:18.299> gonna

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
goals than somebody I'm probably gonna

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.469
