00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
polished so here's the rub it's the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.190 
polished so here's the rub it's the
learning<00:02:20.250> curve<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.420> when<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.690> went

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
learning curve just like when we went

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.560 
learning curve just like when we went
from<00:02:22.470> film<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.070> digital<00:02:23.370> there<00:02:23.910> was<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> huge

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
from film to digital there was a huge

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.840 
from film to digital there was a huge
change<00:02:25.020> new<00:02:25.710> ways<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.950> shoot<00:02:26.370> new<00:02:26.610> ways<00:02:26.820> to

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
change new ways to shoot new ways to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.690 
change new ways to shoot new ways to
think<00:02:27.240> new<00:02:27.450> rules<00:02:27.810> new<00:02:28.290> software<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.460> was

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
think new rules new software it was

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.940 
think new rules new software it was
definitely<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.330> journey<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.440> learning<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
definitely a journey so learning to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.890 
definitely a journey so learning to
shoot<00:02:32.130> hybrid<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:32.970> same<00:02:33.300> thing<00:02:33.600> it's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
shoot hybrid is the same thing it's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.560 
shoot hybrid is the same thing it's
definitely<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> journey<00:02:34.710> no<00:02:35.640> I'm<00:02:35.790> not<00:02:36.000> changing

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
there's no way to be instantly good at

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.100 
there's no way to be instantly good at
this<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.280> takes<00:02:47.670> time<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.450> takes<00:02:48.690> practice

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
this it takes time and it takes practice
