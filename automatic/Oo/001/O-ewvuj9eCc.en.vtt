00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.440
 so here I am going to show you how we realize the door next door 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.129
 first of all you have to build you have to dig through afp 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.849
 an immense void immense flotation chaos 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.379
 so it's 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.769
 surprising chartrand a lot of work m 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.560
 thomas I made the tuan duke on the cloth prof 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.689
 me it does so now that the house itself 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.689
 so I'm going to show you what we can do 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.259
 you go in the facade 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.130
 if you do 4 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.770
 three to say it 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 and three for the levers nothing for him 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.830
 an artist 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.660
 tar 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.510
 I would like my taste was beyond the only one at the bottom of each hole you 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.220
 have done 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.500
 and you put a blog that is yours in France 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.080
 or anything 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.210
 do you occupy the leverage 11 you can couple in the direction it takes 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.370
 put more levers for your time you want vincent lacroix it's not 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.600
 wrong 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.120
 we must salute in the basement 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.930
 and at homs center where 4 3 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.100
 you put yourself a little wind made a mistake go down by no one 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.370
 this girl 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.600
 m 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.260
 and the prominence of things in the code all peoples so not to confess that 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.630
 this is the two most block the leverage on each side the right and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.390
 from the left 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.049
 he is humble who whistle m6 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.840
 so in front of the stone 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.840
 d 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.370
 But, tonight 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 and the fact that these 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.220
 and locally 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220
 so launched it's at this point 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.170
 here 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.150
 but there 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.670
 anyway low 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.100
 and we see that the current goes from this joke 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.670
 but for example are gradually in fact we can say yes we take the three 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.800
 points 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.360
 no no because the third graded site connected 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.080
 Well, if you do it on the summer 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.819
 this cloister moore 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.399
 so here we go we will continue 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:16.059
 and here it is that it both by its buttons for the validation of the club 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.839
 finally 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.849
 and there we are against one like m 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.509
 historian 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.570
 the door of Aix conditions 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.040
 therefore the lifting of conditions 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.839
 nokia counts conditions this is the activation button 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.879
 and the only condition is the co2 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.689
 so for you and maybe we know and then the button for 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.209
 accept this group 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.349
 for what they learned 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.889
 let him go through 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.379
 so we do not have a door yet 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.389
 so that I think as for the results 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.550
 the projecting elected 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.259
 in the volume 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.269
 if you've seen that at the Victorian 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.919
 you will be taxed 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.919
 m acoustic 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.319
 the only time the door opens 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.119
 who remembers something in which has the memory that carries them 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.059
 memoirs 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.749
 the success of any button and then you know you see the scene was over 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.099
 faced with remembering that all conditions were met for 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.459
 be able to leave the door open 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.009
 but from this crowd it is necessary the real is possible 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.009
 Africa what to do tonight 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.159
 and just above 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.140
 do not make too much saffron put to the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.140
 the ump has no pressure once you're 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:34.359
 reuters the cable from there for any geek up to the door that will be here I believe 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.089
 the tralala 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:38.269
 but even if we do like that 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.249
 so already and that would not be good at all 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.709
 can you order from his doctor 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 and that I had the door he looked 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.879
 t that 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.839
 in the past 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:53.230
 m 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.339
 so for me 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.359
 like this one 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.359
 during this year 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.919
 all shops is the door is always open and famous singer 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.139
 so the code of all alone the closed door 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.749
 you can 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:16.749
 we want their smell pregnant you have to make weapons 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:19.059
 at lambersart 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:23.330
 so I do it at the same level as the button villette like what I have 

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.509
 no problem of 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.120
 all in colors that are clean 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.120
 so this security there the force should be open 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.849
 the open door genk the day 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.849
 shower the moment I'm in shape the mayor 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.650
 so the door open 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.740
 you go back home 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.449
 but also 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.169
 submitted the flock to put some pressure 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.229
 you take a little pressure 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.539
 you put them 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.499
 we will study as exciting we report 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.499
 we are disappointed instead the door closes 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.370
 it was wanted if you enter the code after fumbling 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.370
 you are on the button the door opens at home 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.569
 but you are 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.419
 what is annoying is that outside 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.809
 but once again your house 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.210
 the code is still a little restraint 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.089
 first what happened with on the button in touch or 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.240
 we know that when you come home 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.930
 you prove the idea and the door opens we were already in place 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.470
 but I'm used to taking me I have legs 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.080
 I do not have a problem 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.259
 in view of your home bouriette and here sir tell you that I have more 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.880
 house on the death of the high school student rome we really have the tv tv people real time 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.129
 here you have your own door 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.150
 so I did not try to combine the porta code and tear to be able to 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:45.300
 have a house completely iter that with a digicode an alarm all ages 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.419
 we will not try 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.870
 very hot under the nose but the tear takes a lot of space 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.360
 and chloe 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.360
 the playful staff of these clashes 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.150
 so I think if they created on a castle his own feasible 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.150
 the group I'll be maybe 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:03.780
 we must also thank 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.629
 man two people 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.879
 but who are therefore etam job in gas I do good 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.400
 So here is suddenly we turn on a first subscriber to the site I am very 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.529
 good players at the subscriber 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.999
 and to morgat it's a person who called me and encouraged to do with the 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:18.119
 air Transport 

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:21.269
 at martial arts college run over because I speak the most 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.100
 adding what I can say that wood I was asked to do victoria on 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.159
 a doorbell 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.550
 I think this is about our next Korean business 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.520
 still stops a thought to blue in Lyon
