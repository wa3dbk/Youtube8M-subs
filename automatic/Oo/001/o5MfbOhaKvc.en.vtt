00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
engine or the motor basically there's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.229 
engine or the motor basically there's
three<00:00:40.260> bolts<00:00:40.410> down<00:00:40.710> here

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
three bolts down here

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.750 
three bolts down here
two<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> half<00:00:42.420> millimeter<00:00:42.960> bolts<00:00:43.320> just

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
two and a half millimeter bolts just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:54.340 
two and a half millimeter bolts just
unscrew<00:00:44.760> those

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.960 

it's<00:00:54.770> going<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:54.980> be<00:00:55.070> three<00:00:55.340> more<00:00:55.580> on<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.850> other

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
it's going to be three more on the other

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's going to be three more on the other
side<00:00:56.560> so<00:00:57.560> do<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.950> same<00:00:58.220> for<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.610> other<00:00:58.790> side<00:00:58.880> I

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
side so do the same for the other side I

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.010 
side so do the same for the other side I
have<00:01:00.770> loosened<00:01:01.460> these<00:01:01.610> already<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.690> factory

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
have loosened these already the factory

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.350 
have loosened these already the factory
does<00:01:03.200> use<00:01:03.410> a<00:01:04.690> good<00:01:05.690> amount<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:05.990> Loctite<00:01:06.440> so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
does use a good amount of Loctite so

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.150 
does use a good amount of Loctite so
might<00:01:08.360> want<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.690> either<00:01:08.930> heat<00:01:09.800> him<00:01:09.920> up<00:01:10.040> a

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
might want to either heat him up a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.510 
might want to either heat him up a
little<00:01:10.280> or<00:01:11.740> kind<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.830> hammer<00:01:13.040> them<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.280> little

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
little or kind of hammer them a little

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.210 
little or kind of hammer them a little
bit<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.850> break<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.300> lock<00:01:14.660> tight<00:01:14.930> seal<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.470> you

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
bit to break that lock tight seal so you

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.090 
bit to break that lock tight seal so you
can<00:01:16.340> get<00:01:16.460> them<00:01:16.580> off<00:01:20.320> but<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.440> do<00:01:21.620> want<00:01:21.890> that

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
can get them off but you do want that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.250 
can get them off but you do want that
mount<00:01:22.400> to<00:01:22.550> be<00:01:22.670> nice<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.060> sturdy<00:01:23.300> because<00:01:24.110> it

mount to be nice and sturdy because it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.620 
mount to be nice and sturdy because it
is<00:01:24.350> holding<00:01:24.680> your<00:01:24.770> brushless<00:01:24.979> motor<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:25.630> if

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
is holding your brushless motor and if

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.180 
is holding your brushless motor and if
it<00:01:26.780> does<00:01:26.960> move<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:27.259> can<00:01:27.650> strip<00:01:27.920> out<00:01:28.040> your

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
it does move you can strip out your

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:44.790 
it does move you can strip out your
spray<00:01:28.430> gear

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.410 

okay<00:01:45.800> once<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.160> have<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.490> six<00:01:46.760> bolts<00:01:47.000> removed

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
okay once you have the six bolts removed

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.770 
okay once you have the six bolts removed
you<00:01:47.570> can<00:01:47.600> remove<00:01:48.320> your<00:01:48.560> motor<00:01:48.800> mount<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:50.630> get

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
you can remove your motor mount just get

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.410 
you can remove your motor mount just get
that<00:01:50.960> out<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.380> way<00:01:51.850> now<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:52.910> get<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.300> the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
that out of the way now to get to the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.060 
that out of the way now to get to the
slipper<00:01:53.690> there's<00:01:54.290> a<00:01:54.380> nut<00:01:54.590> holding<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:54.980> on

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070

slipper there's a nut holding it on
there<00:01:55.280> that's<00:01:55.880> why<00:01:56.060> we<00:01:56.210> have<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.510> eight

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
there that's why we have the eight

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.290 
there that's why we have the eight
millimeter<00:01:57.080> socket<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:58.400> remove<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.850> nut<00:01:59.120> now

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
millimeter socket to remove this nut now

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.170 
millimeter socket to remove this nut now
this<00:01:59.480> nut<00:01:59.660> is<00:01:59.810> reverse<00:02:00.290> threaded<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:01.180> righty

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
this nut is reverse threaded so righty

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.900 
this nut is reverse threaded so righty
would<00:02:02.720> be<00:02:02.930> loosen<00:02:03.530> lefty<00:02:04.190> would<00:02:04.370> be<00:02:04.640> to

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
would be loosen lefty would be to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.460 
would be loosen lefty would be to
tighten<00:02:05.240> something<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.020> go<00:02:06.080> ahead<00:02:06.230> and<00:02:06.380> loosen

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
tighten something to go ahead and loosen

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.930 
tighten something to go ahead and loosen
that<00:02:06.710> nut<00:02:09.070> sometimes<00:02:10.070> you<00:02:10.399> got<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.610> hold<00:02:10.729> the

that nut sometimes you got to hold the
spur<00:02:11.210> gear<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.720> doesn't<00:02:12.020> spin<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:14.080> once

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
spur gear so it doesn't spin and once

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.230 
spur gear so it doesn't spin and once
you<00:02:15.710> have<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.070> loosened<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.880> remove

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240

other end now there is a pin here you

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.820 
other end now there is a pin here you
want<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.640> make<00:03:12.760> sure<00:03:12.790> not<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.120> lose<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.660> pin<00:03:13.930> go

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
want to make sure not to lose the pin go

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.680 
want to make sure not to lose the pin go
ahead<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.100> pull<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.280> out<00:03:15.489> this<00:03:16.239> pin<00:03:16.480> goes

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
ahead and pull it out this pin goes

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.570 
ahead and pull it out this pin goes
through<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> shaft<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.160> sits<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.640> there

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
through the shaft and it sits in there

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.360 
through the shaft and it sits in there
so<00:03:21.580> that<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:23.140> will<00:03:23.680> always<00:03:23.980> spin<00:03:24.190> with<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
so that this will always spin with the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.080 
so that this will always spin with the
shaft<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.769> let's<00:03:26.950> go<00:03:27.130> come<00:03:27.459> on<00:03:27.580> over<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:27.940> look

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
at the super pad okay on the right side

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.220 
at the super pad okay on the right side
that<00:03:31.780> is<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.890> slipper<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.880> spur<00:03:34.299> that<00:03:34.959> we

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
through so you do want to check that

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.879 
through so you do want to check that
periodically<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.229> make<00:04:23.410> sure<00:04:23.560> it's<00:04:23.710> in<00:04:23.860> good

noted the washer position of the washers

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:54.439 
noted the washer position of the washers
big<00:05:42.860> washer<00:05:43.220> first<00:05:44.440> little<00:05:45.440> washer<00:05:45.860> on<00:05:46.789> top

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.799 

then<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.229> have<00:05:55.379> your<00:05:55.469> spring<00:05:55.830> in<00:05:55.949> your<00:05:56.099> nut<00:05:56.809> so

00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:57.809 
then you have your spring in your nut so

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:01.429 
then you have your spring in your nut so
the<00:05:57.990> spring<00:05:58.229> on<00:05:59.629> again<00:06:00.629> this<00:06:00.779> is<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:00.990> reverse

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:01.439 
the spring on again this is a reverse

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:12.420 
the spring on again this is a reverse
thread<00:06:01.469> so<00:06:02.460> left<00:06:02.699> would<00:06:02.939> be<00:06:02.969> the<00:06:03.089> Titan

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.529 

okay<00:06:13.430> so<00:06:13.490> when<00:06:13.699> you're<00:06:13.819> tightening<00:06:14.029> this<00:06:14.330> this

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
okay so when you're tightening this this

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.059 
okay so when you're tightening this this
is<00:06:14.689> going<00:06:14.840> to<00:06:14.900> be<00:06:14.990> spinning<00:06:15.169> as<00:06:15.409> well<00:06:15.620> so<00:06:15.979> you

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069 
is going to be spinning as well so you

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.070 
is going to be spinning as well so you
want<00:06:16.189> to<00:06:16.340> kind<00:06:16.460> of<00:06:16.610> hold<00:06:17.360> this<00:06:17.629> while<00:06:17.930> you're

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
want to kind of hold this while you're

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.839 
want to kind of hold this while you're
tightening<00:06:18.319> that<00:06:19.180> grab<00:06:20.180> your<00:06:20.360> wrench<00:06:21.849> make

tightening that grab your wrench make
sure<00:06:22.999> it's<00:06:23.120> spinning<00:06:23.389> the<00:06:23.479> right<00:06:23.569> way<00:06:25.449> and<00:06:26.449> go

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
sure it's spinning the right way and go

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.909 
sure it's spinning the right way and go
ahead<00:06:27.259> and<00:06:27.409> tighten<00:06:27.620> it<00:06:27.830> up<00:06:31.900> I<00:06:32.900> like<00:06:33.499> to<00:06:33.680> Tang

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
ahead and tighten it up I like to Tang

it all the way down and then back it it

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.570 
it all the way down and then back it it
out<00:06:35.419> about<00:06:35.719> a<00:06:35.960> quarter<00:06:36.379> turn<00:06:36.589> and<00:06:36.830> then<00:06:37.249> start

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
out about a quarter turn and then start

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.519 
out about a quarter turn and then start
tuning<00:06:37.789> from<00:06:38.089> there<00:06:38.300> remember<00:06:39.229> if<00:06:39.319> it's

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
tuning from there remember if it's

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.230 
tuning from there remember if it's
tightened<00:06:40.189> all<00:06:40.279> the<00:06:40.370> way<00:06:40.460> down<00:06:40.699> you<00:06:40.939> have<00:06:41.089> the

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
tightened all the way down you have the

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.879 
tightened all the way down you have the
most<00:06:41.449> power<00:06:41.960> transfer<00:06:42.379> to<00:06:42.559> your<00:06:42.680> wheels

most power transfer to your wheels

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:45.489 
most power transfer to your wheels
that's<00:06:43.699> when<00:06:43.909> you<00:06:44.029> get<00:06:44.150> your<00:06:44.330> wheelies<00:06:44.779> and

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:45.499 
that's when you get your wheelies and

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:47.469 
that's when you get your wheelies and
all<00:06:45.589> that<00:06:45.710> stuff<00:06:45.949> if<00:06:46.400> you<00:06:46.610> loosen<00:06:46.999> it<00:06:47.089> it<00:06:47.240> slips

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.600 
all that stuff if you loosen it it slips
a<00:06:47.659> bit<00:06:47.839> more<00:06:48.050> and<00:06:48.319> you<00:06:48.889> get<00:06:49.009> better<00:06:49.249> traction

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
a bit more and you get better traction

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.600 
a bit more and you get better traction
