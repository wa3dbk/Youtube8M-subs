following a lot because this is just
where<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> build<00:00:34.140> stuff<00:00:35.390> as<00:00:36.390> quick<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:36.960> I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
where I build stuff as quick as I

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.910 
where I build stuff as quick as I
possibly<00:00:37.079> can

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
does is like now you need to place two

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.150 
does is like now you need to place two
blocks<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:01.020> top<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.289> each<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.739> light<00:01:01.920> dish

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
blocks on top of each of a light dish

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.799 
blocks on top of each of a light dish
and<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.820> placed<00:01:03.059> more<00:01:03.270> blocks<00:01:03.570> here

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and then you placed more blocks here

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.390 
and then you placed more blocks here
like<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.250> see

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
like this and it's just like we can see

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
like this and it's just like we can see
that<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.210> I've<00:01:06.299> decided<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> do

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that so I've decided not going to do

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.880 
that so I've decided not going to do
that<00:01:07.200> anymore<00:01:08.869> if<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.170> bad<00:01:10.409> choice<00:01:10.619> then

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that anymore if that's a bad choice then

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
that anymore if that's a bad choice then
by<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.490> means<00:01:11.640> let<00:01:11.909> me<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:12.960> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
by all means let me know but it kind of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.890 
by all means let me know but it kind of
slows<00:01:13.260> me<00:01:13.470> cope<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> slows<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.760> know

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
slows me cope it slows you down you know

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.179 
slows me cope it slows you down you know
and<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.290> super<00:01:16.560> simple<00:01:16.710> series

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and this is the super simple series

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.080 
and this is the super simple series
everything<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.759> meant<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.060> quick<00:01:20.030> now<00:01:21.030> I'm

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
everything is meant to be quick now I'm

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.609 
everything is meant to be quick now I'm
going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> fill<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> floor<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.259> ask<00:01:22.409> what

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
going to fill in the floor and ask what

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.219 
going to fill in the floor and ask what
one<00:01:22.770> block<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.070> top<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> there

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
one block on top of there

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.030 
one block on top of there
actually<00:01:25.229> let's<00:01:25.380> skip<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.650> those<00:01:25.770> blocks

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
actually let's skip are those blocks

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.170 
actually let's skip are those blocks
because<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.580> where<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> ladders<00:01:27.000> meant

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
because this is where the ladders meant

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.270 
because this is where the ladders meant
to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.450> almost<00:01:27.600> forgot<00:01:27.900> there<00:01:28.290> did<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.100> put

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to be I almost forgot there did I put

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.730 
to be I almost forgot there did I put
not<00:01:29.790> importance<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.689> they're<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.530> again

not importance on here they're up again

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.630 
not importance on here they're up again
to<00:01:32.220> put<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.520> outside<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:33.150> did<00:01:33.270> group<00:01:34.640> ok

bit<00:03:49.480> annoying<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:50.109> me<00:03:50.440> minor<00:03:51.040> detail<00:03:52.109> finally

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
bit annoying but me minor detail finally

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.990 
bit annoying but me minor detail finally
just<00:03:53.379> to<00:03:53.470> give<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:53.859> little<00:03:54.010> bit<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.280> shape<00:03:54.609> we

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
just to give it a little bit of shape we

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.599 
just to give it a little bit of shape we
do<00:03:55.180> this

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
this is all level and then underneath we

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.830 
this is all level and then underneath we
go<00:04:11.349> one<00:04:11.590> two<00:04:11.620> three<00:04:11.980> on<00:04:12.250> there<00:04:12.760> bring<00:04:13.629> it<00:04:13.660> down

on the block bring it down a block and
that<00:04:15.310> gives<00:04:15.519> it<00:04:15.639> sort<00:04:15.879> of<00:04:15.970> like<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.650> back<00:04:17.650> slant

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039
