 gold has become one of the

 ingredients most present in the high

 cook either for sweets or for savory 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.619
 this will bring the delicate final touch and

 deposit in a crucible and melt in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.510
 an oven 1,200 degrees Celsius 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.940
 once metal could be this 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.630
 will mold in a rectangular mold for 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.630
 form the ingot 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.910
 and once the ingot is formed 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.800
 deposit in cold water in order to 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.790
 cool it so you can handle it with the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.130
 defensive hands of one 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.380
 generally the ingots intended for

 this utility usually starts at 800 grams 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.510
 and cost around 20 thousand euros 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 Laminate base 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.480
 the laminate is to introduce the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.659
 gold through the rollers 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.610
 thus increasingly making gold vil 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.130
 it will happen again and again until 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.200
 the right thickness 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.119
 the gold ingot has to go through the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.860
 rollers to get a thickness of 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.860
 three times lower turkish gay 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.220
 it is important that fats that are 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.909
 used to grease the rollers be 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.909
 groceries 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.159
 once formed the sheet will cut in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.619
 square and it will slide in three 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.100
 plastic surfaces to go to the process 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.100
 of smoothie 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.810
 the shake 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.950
 the shake process is to make 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.110
 both thin sheets of gold such and 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.490
 as indicated by the motto taking from each 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.490
 gold foil four more 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.550
 the beaters used to work 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.680
 with a hammer but little by little 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.360
 they were mechanized until the process 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.360
 it became fully automatic 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.010
 finally and manually a series 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.650
 of people are framed and cut 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.150
 sheets and they are deposited between two 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.280
 sheets of waxed paper so you do not 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.920
 hit this to be done with extreme care 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.050
 because the sheets are very practical 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.840
 pieces that are left over from the sheets 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.660
 embasaran in a boat or they will become 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.020
 dust without changing its value and its 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.020
 quality
