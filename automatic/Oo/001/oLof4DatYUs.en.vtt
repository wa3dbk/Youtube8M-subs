00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.740
 2 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.090
 we 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.600
 the swell down and the wind will be 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.250
 moderate 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.360
 this afternoon on which we hello to 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.250
 all and all in a variable time 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.110
 outside temperature at 19 20 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.120
 degrees a water temperature at 18 Â° 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.980
 a tide that is going down 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.960
 the plane b is at 15:10 the coefficients 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.460
 102,57 sure this descendant the wind is 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.190
 past now south-east he went 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.450
 reinforced at 3 Beaufort establishes so we have 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.280
 a body of water that becomes a little bit 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.780
 wrinkled my own the swell is it less 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.040
 evidence that this morning it's a swell 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.750
 which is long with twelve seconds of 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.460
 west- southwest oriented period that is 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.739
 now a little severed by this wind 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.390
 Southeast and swell and attenuated 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.940
 there is a regular surge at the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.470
 height from one to three 50 series mast 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.500
 regular at one meter fifty than the 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.820
 sawmills spaces and are two meters away 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 where the not very well oriented which 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.479
 sectional swamp that goes down small 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.460
 coefficient it makes waves enough 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.950
 antin farm at the edge of the waves hollow 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.960
 powerful that sometimes opens times 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.979
 farms or broad c reactive a little the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.180
 wide choice winds the biggest 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.159
 series with waves a little bit 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.570
 soft good there are tips to catch 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.909
 but it's still a little less good 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.229
 that this early morning good there is still 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.460
 some tips but it makes waves to 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.150
 these facts go back evolution for the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.890
 rest of the day 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.330
 well where he will continue to lower the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.700
 see that change now to our 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.530
 36 seconds as far as the wind is concerned 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.360
 could maybe calm down a bit 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.640
 end of the day to watch it's not 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.990
 certain expects at 13h fifty 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.460
 two meters or west-southwest 12 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.370
 seconds two periods in the southeast to 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.170
 3 Beaufort and at 17h by the fifty meter 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.230
 West South West in the second half 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.640
 south wind is at 2 3 go for having in 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.140
 all cases there are practicable waves 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.150
 all day long if you find a 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.490
 candy on one or west-southwest ya 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.230
 waves nice enough but good times 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.720
 it happens sometimes it does not happen it's not 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.530
 very regular all that we hold you 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.110
 informed on the 08 92 29 78 73 to 14h and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.530
 at 16h good day thank you 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.530
 how 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.530
 we
