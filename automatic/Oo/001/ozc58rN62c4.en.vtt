00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 good right have the other 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 2014 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.920
 64 also recording 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.630
 in the case of the motorola I'm using 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.230
 the native Motorola app for 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.320
 record and in the case of corn or yours 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.730
 also the native one I did not want to use 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.910
 the google camera so we can see that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.260
 is recording over and over again that I'm going to go 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.140
 passing the engine audio now 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.489
 ay, he made me so you can see how it is 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.329
 listen to a microphone and how is it 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.810
 listen to the other 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.850
 the two mobiles posts one 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.140
 side by side so we can see 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.660
 which taxed while the two 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 and I'm walking 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.880
 it's a good day 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.880
 Are the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.450
 touching to take a picture is fine as 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.010
 I have it synchronized with the motorcycle 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.150
 now he puts me that if I want to make a 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.409
 cook a little touch it right now 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.689
 because my hands are not enough 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.329
 I do not know how destabilizing or anything 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.899
 because you do not have the option to activate or 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:30.940
 turn it off so I guess it will be 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:34.450
 stabilized by eggs by software 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.159
 and we are going to stay the important thing 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.159
 let's stay still 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.720
 the engine focuses only 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.190
 Meizu seems not motorola has 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.190
 focused the solo 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.830
 let's do another test on the tree 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.789
 the menu camera is from 20 to 7 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.299
 megapixels and the motorola's camera is 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.299
 of 13 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.140
 I'm not touching the screen 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.140
 neither of the two 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.950
 to see if this is focused 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.870
 I will not touch anything to see if they 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.870
 focus 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.510
 it seems to cost them 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.379
 the dell motorola 1 so auto focus alone 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.700
 although it costs the meizu how to return 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.250
 I have to touch myself with my hand as 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.370
 I just did and right now 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.030
 Well now let's try the camera 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.860
 frontal 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.680
 let's wait if this focuses I have to 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.239
 touch and again with your finger 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.420
 I'm going to have to touch myself with my finger 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.069
 the mail 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.660
 and we will see how it behaves the 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.930
 front camera of each of these 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.930
 dispositives 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.520
 well these are the front cameras in 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.480
 my right hand I have the engine sorry 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.720
 x2014 engine and in my left hand 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.370
 he tells me x 4 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.470
 I'm going to move a little so you can 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.470
 see the difference between the cameras 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.989
 let's walk a bit about if there 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.639
 less noise because I'm on the street 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.170
 also putting the audio of one and the 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.230
 audio from another 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.680
 at a glance on the screen I see myself 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.810
 darker skin color on the motorcycle x 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.850
 that in the metro is like more yellowish 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.300
 Well, nothing because it's a Chinese phone 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.300
 be done 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.700
 there behind we have the sun 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.700
 good 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.780
 maybe I would stay like this in 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.400
 screen I think I like more the 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.710
 colors of the bike x the truth 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.449
 I'm not sure but I think it is 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.650
 as very burned the image behind 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.020
 the 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.300
 then you have everything very white and in the 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.600
 way I see it well in trees 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.600
 and such 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.169
 and the definition as you will see 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.759
 I just cut the hair you can see if 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.759
 I have my hair cut well or not 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.760
 the definition 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.310
 they follow me that they are following me 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.670
 Well I think it may be as 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.430
 front camera test to see which 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.530
 of the two we like more and it leaves me is 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.090
 comments commenting on the 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.090
 cameras greetings
