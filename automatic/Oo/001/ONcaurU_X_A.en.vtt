00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
yeah this is one product which I don't

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
really recommend I thought that this

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.480 
really recommend I thought that this
would<00:06:32.660> be<00:06:32.720> a<00:06:32.900> pretty<00:06:33.319> similar<00:06:34.099> to<00:06:34.250> a<00:06:34.280> deep

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
would be a pretty similar to a deep

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.510 
would be a pretty similar to a deep
cleansing<00:06:34.910> mass<00:06:35.060> which<00:06:35.360> is<00:06:35.389> pretty<00:06:35.660> thick<00:06:35.990> but

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
cleansing mass which is pretty thick but

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.110 
cleansing mass which is pretty thick but
no<00:06:37.520> it<00:06:37.759> just<00:06:38.000> doesn't<00:06:38.330> do<00:06:38.419> the<00:06:38.569> job<00:06:38.810> so<00:06:39.259> yeah<00:06:40.190> a

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
no it just doesn't do the job so yeah a

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.320
