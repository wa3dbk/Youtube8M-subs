 the graphics are spectacular and if you 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.620
 I like this kind of theme. I think that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.750
 it can be very amazing guys what 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.270
 Free form all over the stage 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.829
 we are going to have freedom 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.600
 to move with a very agile mode of 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.340
 at the end of the fight where we will have 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.679

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.899

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.080
 less intensity to the filter we can 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.060
 change the font as you are 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.650

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.980

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.130

 thank you but at least to edit 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.290
 videos and we have on the reel I think 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.180
 a fantastic option ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.580
 we continue with a game from the house of 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.890

 limited time for ios is also in 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.480
 Android available but the truth is that 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.800
 I have not been but what are the people worth 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.150
 lacks but good the game deserves the 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.160
 I 'm sorry guys you are workshops 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.110
 enjoy the offer notice that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.230
 what we have to do is 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.240
 tilt this construction this species 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.710
 of crossbow we could not live and good 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.020
 the truth is that we in this way 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.120
 let's go we'll tilt what we're going 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.080
 to put it for example to butt and fix 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.850
 that in this way we what 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.130
 we have to do is launch this goal and 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.380
 to try to destroy the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.360
 constructions to know that I did not pass 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.890
 I think more or less there we go uy 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.300
 almost notice that what I have to do 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.730
 is to give the constructions to go 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.709
 destroying them is an angry birds roll 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.150
 but we could say with 3d graphics 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.010
 not in addition we here have 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.690

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.150
 where are we going to launch all of these 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.770
 modified we have destroyed this 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.110
