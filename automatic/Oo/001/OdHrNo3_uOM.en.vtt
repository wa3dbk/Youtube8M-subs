 swine genetics and is present in more 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.800
 of 30 countries around the world form 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.180
 part of the genius group pioneer company 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.250
 in the practical application of 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.860
 biotechnology and quantitative genetics 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.190
 the subsidiaries of the genes group 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.489
 they are peak and abs both world leaders 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.710
 in pig genetics and bovine abs sell 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.540
 more than 10 million doses per year and 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.760
 peak impacts over 100 million 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.559
 pigs to slaughterhouse have achieved this 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.330
 world leadership thanks to its 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.070
 productive performance and improvement 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.559
 offered to its customers to obtain a 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.019
 highest final profit in pique Spain 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.850
 We have been satisfying the 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.879
 needs of farmers in the market 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.170
 and working committed to the sector 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.970
 contributing our global resources and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.850
 our experience in better genetics and 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.619
 swine health, our mission is 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.060
 increase the profitability of our 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.110
 customers through technology 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.970
 most innovative genetics 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.220
 the goal of our program 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.170
 genetic improvement is to improve those 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.940
 productive parameters that increase 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.910
 the profitability of the productive system 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.290
 pig from our peak customers 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.570
 uses the global information system 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.670
 called pitch track which is the basis of 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.850
 Larger genetics data and 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.729
 accurate of the world 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.799
 Data is entered 24 hours a day of 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.759
 our genetic nuclei 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.979
 peak multipliers and our 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.409
 customers around the world in real time 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.850
 through the web application 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.110
 ensuring that the client obtains the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.420
 greater results and benefits 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.369
 economic 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.040
 Peak track is a statistical method 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.689
 called black procedure that uses 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.000
 all the data of the relatives of a 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.820
 pig offering genetic precision for 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.979
 the selection of a player the blog 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.840
 is assisted by markers and peak is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.909
 leader in the development of this new 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.680
 technology that increases the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.409
 precision of the estimated values ​​of 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.569
 better the use of DNA technology 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.540
 along with quantitative genetics 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.500
 traditional is known as matlab marker 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.450
 system blog we currently have 226 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.300
 markers already implemented in our 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.190
 system the technology that we use 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.220
 to improve the robustness of our 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.200
 Animals is the prox breaking program en 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.239
 the use of core boars 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.549
 genetic simultaneously in farms 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.530
 commercial in order to select in 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.480
 our core the players that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.390
 will get the highest performance in 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.490
 commercial farms 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.620
 all these latest technologies 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.140
 generation allow us to select from 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.800
 more and more accurate way the animals 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.330
 of greater profitability for the client 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.110
 We currently have an annual improvement in 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.520
 168 euros per pig to slaughter a ratio 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.470
 that encompasses much of this 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.810
 profitability are the kilos of channel 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.360
 produced by pork and year together with the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.460
 improvement of food efficiency in 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.280
 the present and that already has clients 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.330
 producing more than 3,200 kilos per sow 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.940
 no longer 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.890
 Cambur females are the result of 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.630
 many years of research to 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.880
 get the most profitable sow of the 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.100
 market 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.140
 in a comparison made with a 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.420
 million pic bristles distributed at level 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.130
 Spanish media world with the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.560
 pic females get a better 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.560
 annual return of about 74 euros 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.410
 let's see the whole game that we can take 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.200
 from the escambrón 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.150
 60 kilos less of feed consumption per 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.660
 sow and year 02 - annual replacement 0 with 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.600
 12 more deliveries per mother and year 0 with 24 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.960
 more live births per birth 0.1 per 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.290
 one hundred less mortality in lactation 30 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.840
 less days of adaptation of the first 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.620
 total profit per pig slaughterhouse 2 with 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.620
 93 euros 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.239
 if we give as an example a farm of 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.969
 a thousand mothers assuming a productivity 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:12.230
 of 25 pigs or slaughterhouse per pig and year 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:14.560
 supposes an annual benefit of 73 thousand 250 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.560
 euros 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.560
 at peak we know that the superiority of 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.810
 one or very few productive parameters 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.660
 does not guarantee economic superiority 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.550
 of the whole system so we improve 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.380
 all those parameters with greater 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.919
 economic impact on the entire system 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.120
 productive pig including the slaughterhouse 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.130
 We have a complete range of 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.780
 genetic lines globally to 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.419
 meet the needs of 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.490
 local markets we also have 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.680
 advanced high technology to get 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.690
 all of our goals and we use 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.070
 all the performance data obtained 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.530
 for greater profitability 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.960
 peek always improving its players 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.880
 in search of the maximum final benefit for 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.270
 your customers and the pork industry in 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.270
 the world
