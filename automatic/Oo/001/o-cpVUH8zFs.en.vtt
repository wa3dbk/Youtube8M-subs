00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 very good to all of you surely you have 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.680
 set when creating alarms and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.780
 armor in devil 3 that the new 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.759
 recipes they ask for eg objects 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.860
 whites that are ascension creams or 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.350
 if you know the campaign ended I received 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.240
 the recipe at the end you will see that they ask you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.130
 some pleasures of ascension apart from 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 specific materials that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.300
 true this same of the end of campaign 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.470
 right now it is played and it is that in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.510
 Europe is a week they will not 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 fix approximately with the same 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.679
 this then they ask you for special essences 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.020
 how good can you look where it is 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.309
 get in the game forum as it has 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 there has been a person who has posted where 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.989
 you get it but what it will cost you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 Maybe it's finding the objects 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.840
 whites that ask you then well then 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.809
 you have two options one of two you are going to 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.100
 the sidewalks of the lawyers and you look for 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.199
 Well, the place where AdriÃ¡n is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.280
 kill her or you have another option if you do not 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.630
 you have completed the mission of 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.580
 templar 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.060
 good those teams running equipment like 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.840
 I have myself now you can even 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.520
 put 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.350
 to the legend, then speed e 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.260
 move everything you have, you will have 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.400
 with the Templar when you speak for 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.020
 get the mission 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.910
 If you are on the last mission, the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.760
 angel of death and you talk to him 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.190
 Well, the mission skips and this is 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.720
 very simple you are running you can 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.450
 do it in torments 6 finally at 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.090
 principle had its objects to break 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.520
 you speak here with this one 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.990
 and it is important not to complete this 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.700
 mission enter here in the bulwark and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.759
 we started the gun show 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.250
 exhibitor of weapons that barrels us 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.950
 Exhibitor of armors exhibitor of 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.659
 armor plus barrels exhibitor 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.390
 armor display armors 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.909
 exhibitor of weapons book exhibitor 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.100
 well there is a pot book display 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.469
 exhibitor of armors we go that to the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.939
 final if you do not find what you are looking for 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:56.110
 to be bad luck the breeze that another 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:59.560
 door around here talk to this one 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.530
 free people here and we go to the room 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.910
 of the great master exhibitor of weapons 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.220
 Exhibitor of armors of exhibitor of 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.020
 armor exhibitor armors of 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.280
 exhibitor of armors and here the other 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.320
 Exhibitor weapons 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.820
 so bad it will be that I did not consider 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.520
 this way then the object that you lack 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.920
 if important do not talk to the great 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.540
 teacher because if you do not see 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.069
 good ya 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.930
 I guess it 's starting a fight or 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.340
 leave the game without more and go back to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.920
 enter and well then we are from 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.569
 way that tells us to help her 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.069
 buy to the mission if the have 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.200
 completed well then now you do with 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.030
 a second character or else you are looking for a 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.590
 friend that has the mission and that takes you 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.780
 and in this way you will find the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.519
 whites that you need good I hope that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.840
 this will help us complete our 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.849
 recipes and we'll see each other in the next 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.849
