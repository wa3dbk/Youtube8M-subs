other day and wanna show them off so
this<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.849> Eiffel<00:00:09.570> Tower<00:00:09.630> by<00:00:10.170> sark<00:00:10.740> onyx

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
this is the Eiffel Tower by sark onyx

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.289 
this is the Eiffel Tower by sark onyx
it's<00:00:11.940> done<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.549> glimmer<00:00:14.549> texture<00:00:15.089> pack

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
it's done with the glimmer texture pack

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.779 
it's done with the glimmer texture pack
which<00:00:16.109> sort<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.710> comes<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.220> sort<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.640> has

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
which sort of comes out but sort of has

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.519 
which sort of comes out but sort of has
some<00:00:17.970> problems<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.170> over<00:00:19.500> here

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
some problems like you can see over here

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.580 
some problems like you can see over here
on<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.760> side<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.869> not<00:00:22.080> really<00:00:22.350> coming

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
on this side that it's not really coming

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.310 
on this side that it's not really coming
out<00:00:22.740> quite<00:00:23.039> consistently<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> was<00:00:25.230> an

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
out quite consistently so I was an

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.089 
out quite consistently so I was an
experiment<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.170> funky<00:00:28.710> little<00:00:28.800> piece

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
experiment this is a funky little piece

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.939 
experiment this is a funky little piece
that<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:30.420> meaning<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.810> me<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.410> doesn't<00:00:31.769> look

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that has meaning to me and doesn't look

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.069 
that has meaning to me and doesn't look
like<00:00:32.099> much<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> anybody<00:00:32.759> else<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.690> basically

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
like much to anybody else it's basically

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.319 
like much to anybody else it's basically
just<00:00:34.200> some<00:00:34.559> crazed<00:00:34.920> circuitry<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.090> have

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
just some crazed circuitry that I have

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
just some crazed circuitry that I have
that<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:37.020> things<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.380> open<00:00:37.500> pistons<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
that do things like open pistons and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
that do things like open pistons and
pour<00:00:38.579> water<00:00:38.760> down<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.210> hill<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.829> this<00:00:40.829> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
pour water down the hill and this is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.750 
pour water down the hill and this is
part<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.899> XD<00:00:42.899> unknown<00:00:43.250> this<00:00:44.250> whole<00:00:44.520> roller

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
part of a XD unknown this whole roller

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.369 
part of a XD unknown this whole roller
coaster<00:00:45.300> system<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.260> there's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
coaster system and so on and there's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.850 
coaster system and so on and there's
tunnels<00:00:46.680> underground<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.550> whatnot

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
tunnels underground and whatnot

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
tunnels underground and whatnot
anyway<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.510> nobody

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
anyway that's one that I like but nobody

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.380 
anyway that's one that I like but nobody
else'll<00:00:52.410> doesn't<00:00:52.920> live<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.280> pretty<00:00:53.550> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
else'll doesn't live all that pretty so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
else'll doesn't live all that pretty so
let's<00:00:54.539> go<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.140> pretty<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.579> this<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
let's go to a really pretty one this is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360 
let's go to a really pretty one this is
one<00:00:57.000> by<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.809> honestly<00:00:58.530> forget<00:00:58.829> his<00:00:58.980> name<00:00:59.010> but

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
one by I honestly forget his name but

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.220 
one by I honestly forget his name but
I'll<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> description<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I'll put it in the description of the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.510 
I'll put it in the description of the
video

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
video

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.770

it's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.640> very<00:01:02.850> cute<00:01:03.149> little<00:01:03.180> model<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it's a very cute little model it's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.620 
it's a very cute little model it's
basically<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.260> little<00:01:04.880> Minecraft<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.510> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
basically a little Minecraft in in a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.450 
basically a little Minecraft in in a
bowl<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.320> were<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:08.189> sort<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
little world of its own it's just this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.350 
little world of its own it's just this
little<00:01:11.340> world<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.909> got<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.180> beautiful

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
little world it's got these beautiful

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.380 
little world it's got these beautiful
trees<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.080> he's<00:01:13.200> built<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:15.060> water

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
trees that he's built up and this water

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.780 
trees that he's built up and this water
pouring<00:01:15.720> me<00:01:15.960> over<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> edge<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> bowl<00:01:17.159> so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pouring me over the edge of the bowl so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
pouring me over the edge of the bowl so
I<00:01:18.060> thought<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> was<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> nice<00:01:19.170> cool<00:01:19.530> little

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
I thought that was a nice cool little

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.130 
I thought that was a nice cool little
model<00:01:20.270> pretty<00:01:21.270> cheap<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.750> think<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.080> like

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
model pretty cheap I think it was like

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.219 
model pretty cheap I think it was like
18<00:01:22.560> bucks<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.950> something<00:01:23.220> maybe<00:01:23.369> less<00:01:24.229> small

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
18 bucks or something maybe less small

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.440 
18 bucks or something maybe less small
is<00:01:25.470> cute<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> smaller<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.909> cuter<00:01:27.330> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
is cute and the smaller is cuter is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289 
is cute and the smaller is cuter is
cheaper<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.280> oh<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> should

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
cheaper so and oh and this one I should

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.999 
cheaper so and oh and this one I should
say<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> printed<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.439> millimeter<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
say is a printed at one millimeter a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.210 
say is a printed at one millimeter a
block<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> gets<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.570> nice<00:01:34.159> yeah<00:01:35.159> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
block so it gets a very nice yeah it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.399 
block so it gets a very nice yeah it
just<00:01:35.250> has<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> nice<00:01:35.729> feel<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.409> anyway

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
just has a nice feel to it anyway

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.020 
just has a nice feel to it anyway
because<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.740> default<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:38.520> millimeters<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
because the default is two millimeters a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.840 
because the default is two millimeters a
block<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.630> that's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.229> bit<00:01:40.380> clunky<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:40.850> it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
block and that's a bit clunky but it's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
block and that's a bit clunky but it's
important<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.360> some<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> small<00:01:42.899> detail

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
important for some of the small detail

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039 
important for some of the small detail
stuff<00:01:43.560> otherwise<00:01:43.799> it'll<00:01:44.070> break<00:01:44.250> off<00:01:45.049> anyway

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
stuff otherwise it'll break off anyway

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.160 
stuff otherwise it'll break off anyway
this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.409> new<00:01:46.560> half<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.399> teapot<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.600> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
this is the new half of the teapot so I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.410 
this is the new half of the teapot so I
had<00:01:49.649> printed<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.820> old<00:01:51.000> half<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
had printed the the old half of the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.350 
had printed the the old half of the
teapot<00:01:51.750> earlier<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.890> now<00:01:53.399> they're<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> match

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
teapot earlier and now they're a match

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.410 
teapot earlier and now they're a match
set<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.110> were<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:57.180> put<00:01:57.329> those

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
set as it were so I can put those

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.469 
set as it were so I can put those
together<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> whole<00:01:58.229> teapot

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
together and get a whole teapot

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.590 
together and get a whole teapot
and<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:01.009> then<00:02:01.399> open<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.789> up<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.090> show<00:02:02.119> there's

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
and and then open it up and show there's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.139 
and and then open it up and show there's
a<00:02:02.659> whole<00:02:02.869> Museum<00:02:03.530> of<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.740> stuff<00:02:04.219> inside<00:02:04.640> em

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
a whole Museum of the stuff inside em

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.589 
a whole Museum of the stuff inside em
OTS<00:02:05.890> Museum<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.100> stuff<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.239> there's<00:02:08.450> all

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
OTS Museum of the stuff so there's all

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.059 
OTS Museum of the stuff so there's all
kinds<00:02:08.899> of<00:02:08.959> little<00:02:09.170> blocks<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.769> there<00:02:09.920> and

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
kinds of little blocks in there and

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.040 
kinds of little blocks in there and
whatnot

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
whatnot

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.240 
whatnot
so<00:02:12.050> next<00:02:12.879> and<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:14.120> guess<00:02:14.300> last<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.900> my<00:02:15.830> X<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
so next and I guess last is my X the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.670 
so next and I guess last is my X the
unknown<00:02:16.280> area<00:02:17.180> which<00:02:17.900> again<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.200> printed<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
unknown area which again I printed the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.860 
unknown area which again I printed the
other<00:02:18.830> half<00:02:19.069> so<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.370> get<00:02:19.519> this<00:02:19.670> cutaway<00:02:20.000> so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
other half so I get this cutaway so

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.380 
other half so I get this cutaway so
there's<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.200> little<00:02:21.349> portal<00:02:21.800> on<00:02:21.950> top<00:02:22.300> then<00:02:23.300> I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
there's a little portal on top then I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.280 
there's a little portal on top then I
used<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.900> get<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.530> places<00:02:25.209> there's<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.569> water

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
used to get to places there's this water

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.320 
used to get to places there's this water
ladder<00:02:27.590> it's<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:28.310> kind<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.730> cool<00:02:28.879> feature<00:02:29.090> in

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
ladder it's a kind of a cool feature in

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.240 
ladder it's a kind of a cool feature in
the<00:02:29.420> real<00:02:29.569> world<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:30.110> you're<00:02:30.950> actually

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the real world the you're actually

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.880 
the real world the you're actually
pushed<00:02:31.519> up<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.790> water<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.239> ladder<00:02:32.650> by<00:02:33.650> just

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
pushed up the water a ladder by just

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.440 
pushed up the water a ladder by just
standing<00:02:34.040> there<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.519> water<00:02:34.700> actually<00:02:35.090> pushes

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
standing there the water actually pushes

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.319 
standing there the water actually pushes
you<00:02:35.569> up<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:36.049> up<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.590> slope<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.190> part<00:02:38.150> of<00:02:38.209> that

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
you up the up the slope a part of that

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.910 
you up the up the slope a part of that
broke<00:02:38.569> off<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.079> they<00:02:39.140> didn't<00:02:39.410> notice<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.680> it

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
broke off and they didn't notice that it

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.880 
broke off and they didn't notice that it
broken<00:02:40.130> off<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.610> whatever<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.620> anyway<00:02:42.620> and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
broken off but whatever and anyway and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.370 
broken off but whatever and anyway and
so<00:02:43.040> now<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.310> opens<00:02:43.430> up<00:02:43.760> it's<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.970> cutaway<00:02:44.380> and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
so now it opens up it's a cutaway and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.890 
so now it opens up it's a cutaway and
you<00:02:45.739> can<00:02:45.890> see<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.190> inside<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.730> tower<00:02:46.940> and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
you can see the inside of the tower and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.430 
you can see the inside of the tower and
see<00:02:48.590> both<00:02:48.739> sides<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:50.260> probably<00:02:51.260> all

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
see both sides of it and probably all

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.990 
see both sides of it and probably all
come<00:02:51.590> out<00:02:51.620> in<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.829> video<00:02:52.069> but<00:02:52.670> there's<00:02:52.880> some

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
come out in the video but there's some

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.699 
come out in the video but there's some
cool<00:02:53.180> circuitry<00:02:53.810> down<00:02:54.019> here<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.470> actually

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
cool circuitry down here it actually

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.500 
cool circuitry down here it actually
printed<00:02:55.250> up<00:02:55.370> pretty<00:02:55.579> well<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:56.090> there's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
printed up pretty well like there's

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.740 
printed up pretty well like there's
repeaters<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.760> all<00:02:58.760> kinds<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.390> know<00:02:59.420> just

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
repeaters and all kinds of you know just

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.720 
repeaters and all kinds of you know just
wiring<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:00.560> on<00:03:00.709> for<00:03:01.099> um<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:02.299> this<00:03:03.730> piece

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
wiring and so on for um for this piece

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.819 
wiring and so on for um for this piece
that<00:03:05.000> basically<00:03:05.680> accelerates<00:03:06.680> you

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
that basically accelerates you

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.580 
that basically accelerates you
insensitive<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.549> top<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.000> tower<00:03:08.590> so

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
insensitive to the top of the tower so

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.259 
insensitive to the top of the tower so
that's<00:03:10.040> about<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.370> just<00:03:10.850> thought<00:03:11.030> I'd<00:03:11.120> show

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
that's about it just thought I'd show

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.650 
that's about it just thought I'd show
those<00:03:11.450> off<00:03:11.600> thanks<00:03:12.170> bye
