00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.600
 in all the photos 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.580
 forgive me if I'm more nervous than 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.709
 for the Olympics but 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.220
 normally we do not go that long and more 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:21.580
 about me so they 've written me and I'm going to 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.880
 proceed to quiet reading and 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.880
 calm 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.370
 and today is a great day for me 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.060
 today I start a new life and there I was born 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.060
 a new andrea 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.070
 I always said that I would continue on high 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.650
 competition until my mind does not 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.900
 I would like to continue and I have given everything from 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.579
 the first day and so it's been for 20 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.499
 years 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.320
 until my way of working no longer 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:55.839
 He has the commitment he had and I do not want 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.449
 continue for money I do not want to continue 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.359
 because I touch and I do not want to continue 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.449
 glory neither by itself nor by being afraid of what 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.449
 unknown 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.219
 It has been a very difficult lesson to take 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.469
 even more having world close at home 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.810
 I leave it because I think it's time to 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.759
 make a change in my life the five already 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.799
 it does not move me from within and now my 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.340
 motivations begin to be outside the 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.140
 water we wanted to give everything to reach 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.770
 reach the Olympic classification 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.729
 we do not get it 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.729
 memory 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.109
 you have half a way done I believe in 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.370
 you know that you are strong and what 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:48.060
 you will achieve the sport must unite 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.790
 this is one of your missions 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.770
 now look objectively from outside and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.770
 I do not see here the essence of sport 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.649
 and it saddens me a lot saddens me to see 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.230
 two sides saddened me to see 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.840
 confrontations hatreds and resentments 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.600
 and I have also lived them and I 'm not 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.790
 proud of it the question is not 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.010
 because I left him but because he was 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.010
 unmotivated if you want you can
