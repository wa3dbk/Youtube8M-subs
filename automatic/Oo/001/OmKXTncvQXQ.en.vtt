is just over there in the background now
we<00:02:18.820> are<00:02:19.300> doing<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.320> co-op<00:02:20.590> because<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:21.460> a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
we are doing it on co-op because it's a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.070 
we are doing it on co-op because it's a
little<00:02:22.270> bit<00:02:22.390> different<00:02:22.780> than<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
little bit different than the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.590 
little bit different than the
single-player<00:02:23.550> aside<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.030> only<00:02:25.420> difference

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
single-player aside the only difference

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.080 
single-player aside the only difference
really<00:02:25.810> being<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.440> shorter<00:02:27.090> campaigns

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
really being that is shorter campaigns

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.880 
really being that is shorter campaigns
and<00:02:28.300> everything<00:02:28.600> else<00:02:28.780> or<00:02:31.140> well<00:02:32.140> they're<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
and everything else or well they're the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.530 
and everything else or well they're the
same<00:02:33.070> length<00:02:33.340> got<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> same<00:02:33.910> story<00:02:34.240> pretty

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
same length got the same story pretty

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.170 
same length got the same story pretty
much<00:02:34.780> but<00:02:35.290> there<00:02:35.620> are<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.980> bunch<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.910> levels

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
much but there are a bunch of levels

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.140 
much but there are a bunch of levels
that<00:02:37.270> I<00:02:37.330> left<00:02:37.540> out<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.140> we<00:02:38.410> thought<00:02:38.620> it'd<00:02:38.800> be

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
that I left out so we thought it'd be

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.090 
that I left out so we thought it'd be
kind<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.210> fun<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:41.710> our<00:02:41.740> own<00:02:41.890> little

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
kind of fun to just do our own little

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.900 
kind of fun to just do our own little
walkthrough<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:48.040> far<00:02:48.489> what<00:02:48.880> I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
walkthrough like this so far what I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.720 
walkthrough like this so far what I
think<00:02:49.300> about<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.630> game<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.370> well<00:02:51.370> I'll<00:02:51.550> of

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
think about the game is well I'll of

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.280 
think about the game is well I'll of
World<00:02:51.940> War<00:02:52.090> two<00:02:52.239> games<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:52.900> thought<00:02:53.230> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
World War two games so I thought that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.800 
World War two games so I thought that
the<00:02:53.560> campaign<00:02:54.130> was<00:02:54.520> way<00:02:54.970> more<00:02:55.000> fun<00:02:55.540> and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
the campaign was way more fun and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.770 
the campaign was way more fun and
quality<00:02:56.260> befores<00:02:56.739> because<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:58.000> harder<00:02:58.570> and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
quality befores because it's harder and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.610 
quality befores because it's harder and
it<00:02:59.170> was<00:02:59.350> longer<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.250> just<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:01.390> was<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.810> just

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
it was longer and it just it was I just

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.890 
it was longer and it just it was I just
liked<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.040> better<00:03:03.160> but<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.150> multiplayer

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
liked it better but the multiplayer

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.600 
liked it better but the multiplayer
isn't<00:03:05.620> really<00:03:06.340> as<00:03:06.900> grit<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.610> for

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
isn't really as grit it's for

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.090 
isn't really as grit it's for

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
block so you could like be up on top of

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.690 
block so you could like be up on top of
a<00:03:43.420> box<00:03:43.690> they'd<00:03:44.230> hide<00:03:44.500> right<00:03:44.860> next<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.489> and

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
know veteran is just like wow shouldn't

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.159 
know veteran is just like wow shouldn't
even<00:04:32.400> be<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.610> hard<00:04:33.910> but<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:34.480> was<00:04:34.600> just<00:04:34.750> crazy

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
even be that hard but it was just crazy

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.320 
even be that hard but it was just crazy
I<00:04:35.680> don't<00:04:36.220> know<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.520> think<00:04:36.940> there's<00:04:37.180> an

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
I don't know I think there's an

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.360 
I don't know I think there's an
achievement<00:04:37.720> for<00:04:37.990> beating<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.710> last<00:04:39.070> level

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
achievement for beating the last level

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.470 
achievement for beating the last level
of<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:40.390> campaign<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.290> single<00:04:41.680> player

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
of the campaign and single player

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.150 
of the campaign and single player
without<00:04:43.480> dying<00:04:43.750> on<00:04:44.050> veteran<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.919> think

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
without dying on veteran and I think

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.090 
without dying on veteran and I think
that's<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.930> one<00:04:46.930> of<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.140> secret<00:04:47.470> events<00:04:47.950> it's

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
that's the one of the secret events it's

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.180 
that's the one of the secret events it's
like<00:04:48.310> 100<00:04:48.850> gamerscore<00:04:49.150> or<00:04:49.450> something<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:50.190> think

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
like 100 gamerscore or something I think

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.000 
like 100 gamerscore or something I think
that's<00:04:51.370> just<00:04:51.610> nuts<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.419> never<00:04:53.410> be<00:04:53.680> able<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:53.919> do

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
that's just nuts I never be able to do

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.590 
that's just nuts I never be able to do
that<00:04:54.130> I<00:04:54.190> can<00:04:54.430> I<00:04:54.550> can't<00:04:54.760> even<00:04:54.880> pass<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:55.390> level

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
that I can I can't even pass this level

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.520 
that I can I can't even pass this level
of<00:04:55.750> veteran<00:04:56.110> on<00:04:56.229> my<00:04:56.350> own<00:04:56.580> or<00:04:57.580> co-op<00:04:57.850> I<00:04:58.530> liked

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
of veteran on my own or co-op I liked

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.810 
of veteran on my own or co-op I liked
how<00:04:59.740> they<00:04:59.890> made<00:05:00.070> co-op<00:05:00.910> pretty<00:05:01.270> much<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:02.820> lot

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
how they made co-op pretty much a lot

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.909 
how they made co-op pretty much a lot
harder<00:05:04.150> they<00:05:04.630> may<00:05:04.810> go<00:05:04.990> up<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.260> lot<00:05:05.440> harder<00:05:05.710> than

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
harder they may go up a lot harder than

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.030 
harder they may go up a lot harder than
single<00:05:06.460> player<00:05:06.960> because<00:05:07.960> you<00:05:08.110> know<00:05:08.229> it's<00:05:08.440> how

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
single player because you know it's how

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.650 
single player because you know it's how
it<00:05:09.250> should<00:05:09.490> be<00:05:09.520> club<00:05:09.940> should<00:05:10.180> be<00:05:10.330> harder<00:05:10.630> than

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
it should be club should be harder than

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.350 
it should be club should be harder than
single<00:05:11.020> player<00:05:11.169> versus<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.530> get<00:05:11.650> more<00:05:11.740> people

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
single player versus to get more people

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.310 
single player versus to get more people
hopefully<00:05:13.360> they're<00:05:13.540> smarter<00:05:13.960> than<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.200> eyes

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
hopefully they're smarter than the eyes

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.969 
hopefully they're smarter than the eyes
but<00:05:14.350> you<00:05:15.310> know<00:05:16.110> okay<00:05:17.110> let's<00:05:17.500> screen<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:17.860> this

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
Eli can each screen its own screen

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.070 
Eli can each screen its own screen
instead<00:05:27.880> just<00:05:28.060> running<00:05:28.390> a<00:05:28.479> line<00:05:28.690> through<00:05:28.930> it

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
instead just running a line through it

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.260 
instead just running a line through it
some<00:05:29.860> people<00:05:30.130> don't<00:05:30.250> like<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:30.490> this<00:05:30.790> way<00:05:31.000> but<00:05:31.240> I
