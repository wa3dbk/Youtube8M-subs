00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.030
 how are you today I have a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 Dessert a dessert is like a breakfast 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.990
 let's say it this breakfast I saw it by 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.450
 facebook seems like a fantastic idea 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.159
 to share it with all of you and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.959
 also with children the truth is that 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.699
 I found something super delicious that 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.259
 can do I do not know before going to the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.449
 school if you enter a little 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.099
 late because they already know that always 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.130
 they go one of the races when 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.400
 we entered buying and then if they were 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.289
 the afternoon or if it is something of week options 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.360
 whatever it is you can do it when you have 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.520
 the time of the world or how else can 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.230
 do not know about Sunday the same and many 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 of you have already seen it on facebook 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.760
 but I've never seen it and when I saw it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.400
 Maybe I have shared with me 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.650
 than to share it and then if it does not stop it's a 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.410
 wonderful idea I hope you like it 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.570
 a lot and never 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.880
 and let's start first of all 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.010
 trimming the edges or removing the 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.840
 edges with a knife and after 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.489
 you will remove a roller and this was 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.620
 the closest thing I found because the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.379
 I really do not have a roller after 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.360
 we will add some cream cheese and 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.150
 then let's add the strawberries 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.950
 this is favorite freedom and we're going to 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.950
 roll them up as if they were technicians 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.940
 then we are going to mix the eggs with 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.300
 a spoon that I'm doing and we're going to 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.710
 Soak our rolls right there 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.710
 Now let's do this 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.630
 and then we are going to heat the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.350
 pan and let's put some 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.570
 Butter 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.729
 then we will add our rolls and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.030
 the will to cook for about 5 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.500
 minutes until we see that they are like this 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.070
 like boiling bubbles out 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.070
 put 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.830
 and we will add with game to taste the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.030
 true is that these optional if you 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.400
 you want to do what I want to do 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.890
 because I think it 's very beautiful and we have 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.890
 add strawberries and also banana 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.850

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.489

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.629
