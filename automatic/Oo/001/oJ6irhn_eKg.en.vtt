00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
hole if it opens up if it opens up it's

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.300 
hole if it opens up if it opens up it's
the<00:01:10.570> hole<00:01:10.720> this<00:01:10.899> is<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.170> hole<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:12.009> opened<00:01:12.250> up

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
the hole this is the hole it opened up

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.020 
the hole this is the hole it opened up
perfectly<00:01:12.729> now<00:01:13.479> what<00:01:13.659> I<00:01:13.720> do<00:01:13.810> is<00:01:14.049> I<00:01:14.170> dig<00:01:14.409> back

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
perfectly now what I do is I dig back

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.249 
perfectly now what I do is I dig back
about<00:01:16.030> oh<00:01:17.759> five<00:01:18.759> inches<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.240> push<00:01:19.720> stuff<00:01:19.930> over

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
about oh five inches and push stuff over

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.460 
about oh five inches and push stuff over
so<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.440> can<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:21.729> more<00:01:21.909> area<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:26.229> hole

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
so I can get more area and this hole

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.609 
so I can get more area and this hole
goes<00:01:26.649> both<00:01:26.950> directions<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:28.390> goes<00:01:28.630> this<00:01:28.960> way<00:01:29.020> it

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
goes both directions it goes this way it

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.510 
goes both directions it goes this way it
goes<00:01:29.770> this<00:01:29.950> way<00:01:34.740> put<00:01:35.740> two<00:01:35.860> traps<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.369> holes

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
goes this way put two traps in the holes

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.880 
goes this way put two traps in the holes
because<00:01:37.450> whatever<00:01:37.810> way<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.140> Gopher<00:01:38.380> comes<00:01:38.590> I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
because whatever way the Gopher comes I

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.200 
because whatever way the Gopher comes I
want<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.310> catch<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.610> so<00:01:39.729> I<00:01:39.789> got<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.000> put<00:01:40.119> two

want to catch it so I got to put two
traps<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:43.000> just<00:01:43.659> dig<00:01:43.840> out<00:01:43.990> all<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.500> access

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
traps so just dig out all the access

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.710 
traps so just dig out all the access
there's<00:01:45.159> these<00:01:45.369> holes<00:01:45.640> stick<00:01:46.179> your<00:01:46.299> hands<00:01:46.479> far

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.690 
right now a trap and then there's the
other<00:04:33.680> Horrocks<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.190> don't<00:04:34.370> put<00:04:34.520> no

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
other Horrocks you don't put no

00:04:34.700 --> 00:05:20.659 
other Horrocks you don't put no
attractive

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:28.050 

right<00:05:22.379> well<00:05:23.379> we<00:05:23.530> have<00:05:23.560> that<00:05:23.800> done<00:05:24.840> we<00:05:25.840> take<00:05:27.060> a

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
right well we have that done we take a

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.140 
right well we have that done we take a
board<00:05:28.409> and<00:05:29.409> this<00:05:29.830> method<00:05:30.189> works<00:05:30.819> pretty<00:05:31.029> well

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
board and this method works pretty well

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.540 
board and this method works pretty well
because<00:05:31.539> as<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:32.379> don't<00:05:32.590> have<00:05:32.770> a<00:05:32.830> side<00:05:33.099> clog

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
because as you don't have a side clog

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.640 
because as you don't have a side clog
that<00:05:34.419> we<00:05:34.539> can<00:05:34.629> just<00:05:34.749> plug<00:05:34.960> back<00:05:35.169> in<00:05:35.379> the<00:05:35.469> hole

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
that we can just plug back in the hole

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.760 
that we can just plug back in the hole
because<00:05:35.830> we<00:05:36.129> dug<00:05:36.279> it<00:05:36.400> all<00:05:36.490> up<00:05:36.610> just<00:05:36.909> pure<00:05:37.150> dirt

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
because we dug it all up just pure dirt

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.149 
because we dug it all up just pure dirt
so<00:05:38.770> what<00:05:39.039> we<00:05:39.129> do<00:05:39.279> and<00:05:39.819> take<00:05:39.999> Bard

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
so what we do and take Bard

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.279 
so what we do and take Bard
six<00:05:42.159> inches<00:05:42.340> by<00:05:42.759> 12<00:05:43.569> whatever<00:05:43.870> just<00:05:44.680> cut<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:45.009> up

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
six inches by 12 whatever just cut it up

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.189 
six inches by 12 whatever just cut it up
put<00:05:47.289> it<00:05:47.379> over<00:05:47.469> the<00:05:47.620> hole<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.960> we're<00:05:50.110> gonna

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
put it over the hole and we're gonna

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.589
