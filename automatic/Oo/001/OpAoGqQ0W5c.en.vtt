00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
 the bold data you could not tell more things from others there is difference 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.970
 that if the iter these meals 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.820
 then look for that same thing but at different points or you can look for it 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.210
 separately not as Peruvian stories or you can search Peru only 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.039
 this new attack when I 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.789
 this pongo is in quotes melo 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.429
 search in a more pixant way we are more punctual 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.970
 to that subject 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.480
 What else can we do 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.910
 Now I want this information 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.740
 this idea 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.340
 end in a quillo format I wish for example I want they are in formation but 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.370
 in a format 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.660
 of the doc and a pdf format how do I do what 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.850
 ended history of Peru that are closing meals 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.030
 what the site 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.610
 in a simple way for that team 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.410
 document 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.560
 he assigned him without further ado and I can put him 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.720
 and already without another more what a mess 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.970
 What does it mean 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.670
 I'm saying that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 I need documents that are in these formats 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.970
 dokic and pedersen 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570
 that contain this information 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.659
 he told me they will not be looking inside these pages 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.430
 50 aesthetics information 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.400
 edo and in search 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.580
 we look for there and for example here I liked a point since this is a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.620
 document 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.810
 gestha 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.260
 world has fallen everything commented that tells me that before efe 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.810
 here for example history of Peru that this format doc and pdf format 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.650
 in format nike pdf of nike format are expressed account 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.040
 and you can find it a faster way as I say no 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.619
 that is a command for 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.790
 speed up our search 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.790
 what else could we teach her in what her browser 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.300
 for example now we want inside the government I imagined 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.650
 about what it is to be in Peru the music revealed that they imagine 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.479
 and they do not generate images but as they say in this case 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.889
 but by age they differ 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.250
 in these times of in margins 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.569
 we want for example 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.840
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.610
 it is not clear by what a size is a great resistance in mind 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.800
 that in the average and images indicates that the size of the area 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.069
 of the image is a small workshop format I want it to be a matogrande bull 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.919
 sanz we notice where it says 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:42.069
 showing all the image sizes we look at the large images 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.389
 hundreds of new puppies 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.110
 image the child a wider range of quality 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.519
 in a round a much better candidate 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.319
 and so be able to work with these types of images 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.319
 but remember that those images are from web pages 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.629
 therefore from machines you may have had some kind of 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.609
 koplowitz 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.859
 that are like alice as a copy of directing and right of some 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.889
 authors that is not allowed 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.729
 the copy of this type of ekin margins 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.749
 in some more exquisite works and they were willing to present as a 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:17.689
 project a 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.539
 a page to the museum something that 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.929
 that is to say to increase you could not use those images 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:26.969
 although they are very interesting you can use it for jobs 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.879
 they shoot from three universities but it's not like we were going to do a project 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.459
 for it is that the bonuses in undertaking as had the way how I put them 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.269
 black image can not put small images 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.529
 that they assign as a kind of icon 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.389
 I do not wait for you 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.049
 what yes this type of letter Messi was parish priest is not known but 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.239
 July the existence on the page that 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.570
 nunn internet 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.570
 that back I'm going to teach so they can look for images 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:04.369
 without copyright, that is, they are free and can be published where 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.929
 hacinan de alba 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:07.179
 they founded 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.799
 pink any problem so I tell you that and because maybe more fernandez 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.469
 is to work with that but their presences 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:14.069
 propose
