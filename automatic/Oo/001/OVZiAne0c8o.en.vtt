they are prone to rusting and the screws

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.780 
they are prone to rusting and the screws
can<00:01:15.750> actually<00:01:16.140> shear<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> could

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
can actually shear and then you could

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.120 
can actually shear and then you could
end<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.270> problem<00:01:18.600> getting<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.770> drum

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
end up with a problem getting the drum

end up with a problem getting the drum
separated<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.330> tend<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.400> drill

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
separated what we tend to do is drill

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.830 
separated what we tend to do is drill
the<00:01:23.909> screws<00:01:24.659> out<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.469> the<00:01:25.619> spider<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:27.240> then

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the screws out of the spider and then

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.450 
the screws out of the spider and then
fit<00:01:28.079> new<00:01:28.289> screws<00:01:28.619> when<00:01:28.859> fitting<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.310> new

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
fit new screws when fitting the new

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.849 
fit new screws when fitting the new
spider<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.329> you're<00:01:30.659> lucky<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.350> will<00:01:31.590> come

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
spider if you're lucky they will come

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.469 
spider if you're lucky they will come
out<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.429> still<00:01:32.520> worth<00:01:32.820> changing<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
out but it's still worth changing the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.709 
out but it's still worth changing the
screws<00:01:34.609> I'll<00:01:35.609> just<00:01:35.880> show<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.179> the<00:01:36.420> procedure

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
screws I'll just show you the procedure

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.399 
screws I'll just show you the procedure
that<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.469> for<00:01:37.799> drilling<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.549> them

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
that we use for drilling out to them

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.899 
that we use for drilling out to them
basically<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.770> you're<00:01:40.920> using<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.310> power<00:01:41.579> too

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
basically if you're using a power too

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.520 
basically if you're using a power too
ill<00:01:42.060> make<00:01:42.689> sure<00:01:42.869> you're<00:01:43.049> using<00:01:43.140> high<00:01:43.469> speed

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
ill make sure you're using high speed

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.010 
ill make sure you're using high speed
bits<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.490> worth<00:01:44.700> putting<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.119> pilot<00:01:45.570> hole<00:01:45.719> in

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
bits it's worth putting a pilot hole in

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.810 
bits it's worth putting a pilot hole in
first<00:01:46.289> before<00:01:46.770> using<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.189> large<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.609> a<00:01:47.640> little

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
first before using a large it a little

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.340 
first before using a large it a little
bit<00:01:47.999> to<00:01:48.630> take<00:01:49.079> off<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.439> head<00:01:50.659> after<00:01:51.659> you've

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
bit to take off the head after you've

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.340 
bit to take off the head after you've
removed<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.069> screws<00:01:53.700> either<00:01:54.569> by<00:01:54.780> drilling<00:01:55.020> or

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
removed the screws either by drilling or

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.319 
removed the screws either by drilling or
actually<00:01:55.799> undoing<00:01:56.219> them<00:01:56.310> use<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> flat<00:01:57.060> bladed
