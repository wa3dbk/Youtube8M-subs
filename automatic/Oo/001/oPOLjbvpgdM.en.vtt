also look at our mounted knife blade is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.569 
also look at our mounted knife blade is
mounted<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> top<00:00:42.539> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.780> multi-tool

mounted on the top of the multi-tool
with<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.699> edge<00:00:44.850> down<00:00:46.460> for<00:00:47.460> cutting

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
with the edge down for cutting

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.979 
with the edge down for cutting
Leatherman<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.210> along<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> bottom<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
Leatherman is not along the bottom of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.380 
Leatherman is not along the bottom of
the<00:00:52.050> tool<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:52.890> edge<00:00:53.039> down<00:00:56.030> this<00:00:57.030> gives<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the tool with the edge down this gives a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.419 
the tool with the edge down this gives a
better<00:00:57.570> grip<00:00:57.899> better<00:00:58.199> better<00:00:59.070> cutting

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
better grip better better cutting

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.720 
better grip better better cutting
control<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> use<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> blade<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.339> lot<00:01:02.640> more

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
control you can use the blade a lot more

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.990 
control you can use the blade a lot more
in<00:01:05.730> my<00:01:05.760> opinion<00:01:07.100> use<00:01:08.100> more<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.579> the<00:01:08.790> blade

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
in my opinion use more of the blade

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.800 
in my opinion use more of the blade
rather<00:01:13.369> then<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.700> said<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:17.090> saw<00:01:18.090> gas<00:01:18.390> file

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
rather then like I said the saw gas file

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.410 
rather then like I said the saw gas file
it's<00:01:19.409> also<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.770> three-sided<00:01:20.490> file<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it's also a three-sided file this is the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
it's also a three-sided file this is the
SOG<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> file<00:01:25.799> bit<00:01:26.360> for<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
SOG this is the file bit for the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.380 
SOG this is the file bit for the
Leatherman

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.290 

not<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.080> same<00:01:32.320> size<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.680> um<00:01:35.920> on<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.850> soggy<00:01:37.120> it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
not the same size but um on the soggy it

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.210 
not the same size but um on the soggy it

finer file face on the other side not

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.720 
finer file face on the other side not
bad

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.090 

and<00:01:51.730> then<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.120> sog<00:01:52.360> has<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.930> like<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:53.860> shoved

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
and then the sog has the like I shoved

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.480 
and then the sog has the like I shoved
the<00:01:54.220> saw<00:01:54.400> blade<00:01:54.730> and<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.720> other<00:01:55.870> bits<00:01:56.490> not

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
the saw blade and the other bits not

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.620 
the saw blade and the other bits not
gonna<00:01:57.700> go<00:01:57.850> over<00:01:58.030> those<00:01:58.180> now<00:01:59.790> size<00:02:00.790> comparison

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
gonna go over those now size comparison

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.219 
gonna go over those now size comparison
side-by-side<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.800> let's<00:02:02.980> do<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:04.080> there's<00:02:05.080> a
