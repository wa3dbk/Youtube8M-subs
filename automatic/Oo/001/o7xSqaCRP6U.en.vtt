00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
speaker I usually just try to scratch

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
can't see it with this camera but I'm

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.640 
can't see it with this camera but I'm
rubbing<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> edge<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.409> very

slightly<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> foam<00:01:38.970> kind<00:01:39.299> of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
slightly and I can see the foam kind of

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.319 
slightly and I can see the foam kind of
coming<00:01:39.810> off<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.650> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.240> see<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
coming onto the woofer cone there that's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.819 
coming onto the woofer cone there that's
a<00:01:45.479> good<00:01:45.630> indication<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.530> thing<00:01:46.710> is

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.120 
good example here just touching it there
it<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.549> barely<00:01:56.549> any<00:01:56.700> pressure<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:58.130> now

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
it is barely any pressure at all now

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.639 
it is barely any pressure at all now
here's<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> fun<00:01:59.909> part<00:02:00.290> I'm<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.469> show

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
here's the fun part I'm going to show

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.289 
here's the fun part I'm going to show
you<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.100> does<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.939> play<00:02:03.119> music

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
you what this does when you play music

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:16.740 
you what this does when you play music
out<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.719> them

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.460 

and<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.930> think<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.640> always<00:02:19.900> these<00:02:20.900> particular

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
and I think it always these particular

00:02:21.470 --> 00:03:02.920 
and I think it always these particular
speakers<00:02:21.920> have<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.130> circuit<00:02:22.520> breaker<00:02:22.610> built

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:13.210 

these<00:03:03.930> ones<00:03:04.170> actually<00:03:04.350> trip<00:03:04.770> very<00:03:05.190> very<00:03:05.640> fast

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.320 

takes<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.340> couple<00:03:14.460> seconds<00:03:14.910> for<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.150> turn

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
takes a couple seconds for it to turn

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.630 
takes a couple seconds for it to turn
back<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.750> but<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.470> see<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.740> foam<00:03:16.950> just<00:03:17.160> blast

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
back on but you see the foam just blast

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.130 
back on but you see the foam just blast
it<00:03:17.850> all<00:03:17.970> over<00:03:18.180> my<00:03:18.300> floor<00:03:18.450> here<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.870> that's<00:03:18.990> a

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
it all over my floor here and that's a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:36.650 
it all over my floor here and that's a
bitch<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.470> clean<00:03:19.680> up<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:36.030> actually<00:03:36.240> this<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.540> a

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
bitch to clean up and actually this is a

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.570 
bitch to clean up and actually this is a
kind<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.080> weird<00:03:37.230> situation<00:03:37.500> usually<00:03:38.220> when

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
kind of a weird situation usually when

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.330 
kind of a weird situation usually when
this<00:03:38.730> foam<00:03:38.970> rots<00:03:39.270> away<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:40.290> speaker<00:03:41.070> will<00:03:41.220> go

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
this foam rots away the speaker will go

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.890 
this foam rots away the speaker will go
out<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:41.550> alignment<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.300> pop<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.780> make

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
out of alignment and just pop and make

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.510 
out of alignment and just pop and make
all<00:03:43.050> kinds<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.380> bad<00:03:43.500> noises<00:03:43.800> this<00:03:44.160> isn't<00:03:44.460> the

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
all kinds of bad noises this isn't the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.820 
all kinds of bad noises this isn't the
case<00:03:44.670> with<00:03:44.880> these<00:03:45.060> ones<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.540> guess<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.530> spider

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
case with these ones I guess the spider

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.430 
case with these ones I guess the spider
which<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.580> little<00:03:47.960> another<00:03:48.960> kind<00:03:49.290> of

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
which is that little another kind of

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.650 
which is that little another kind of
suspension<00:03:50.190> inside<00:03:50.670> there<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.090> holding<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.510> up

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
suspension inside there is holding it up

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.570 
suspension inside there is holding it up
so<00:03:51.959> usually<00:03:52.830> you'll<00:03:52.950> hear<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.220> kind<00:03:53.490> of

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
so usually you'll hear this kind of

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.080 
so usually you'll hear this kind of
sound<00:03:55.490> when<00:03:56.490> you're<00:03:56.580> playing<00:03:56.820> them<00:03:58.940> kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.000> a

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
sound when you're playing them kind of a

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:12.490 
sound when you're playing them kind of a
parent<00:04:00.390> with<00:04:00.510> these<00:04:00.660> ones

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:20.580

circuit breaker in there and he was a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.670 
circuit breaker in there and he was a
more<00:04:50.640> powerful<00:04:50.820> lamp<00:04:51.240> than<00:04:51.450> its<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.720> wimpy
