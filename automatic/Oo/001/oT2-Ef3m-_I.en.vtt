00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.190
 sea ​​if a man thinks that a car 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.770
 It has a three-cylinder engine and a 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.780
 liter thinks that I do not know 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.000
 I would buy a woman you think is 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.880
 important the engine to displacement the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.470
 power or when you drive the car and you 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.529
 like how you walk you do not think 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.929
 how is the engine I personally do not 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.810
 I start to think what the engine is like and it goes 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.250
 well this one if it went perfectly well what yes 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.710
 I notice it is sensitive 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.100
 in the rotation rotation of the winds 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.320
 yes it is true 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.839
 especially to the asphalt also out there in 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.579
 bad been a little vaulted as is 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.579
 here in this access to san pedro moves 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.020
 daily that is the good highway 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.750
 aires-rosario that is pretty bad this 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.879
 yes it depends on the lane and for and for the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.670
 city what did you think 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.559
 I think it's comfortable is practical is 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.009
 Little boy is the mini fox as they call him 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.350
 on the street but for example put 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.770
 the grandchildren's armchair load something in 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.110
 the trunk will carry a large suitcase 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.229
 there is a line of hand a bag of 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.229
 hand the two together of the children 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.010
 we were able to travel let's say the weekend 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.010
 without problems and good and fundamentally 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.799
 the theme of isofix that brings this art 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.200
 and the security that has taken five 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.000
 stars have in here should be 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.490
 important to people more than how many 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.940
 cylinders there are down the engine and it reverts 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.940
 a little 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.560
 this weekend and reversed what I 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.829
 I was thinking about why I did not like it 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.270
 the presentation of marketing when 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.520
 presented to the side because what 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.670
 presented in a jovial way as 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.259
 for young people and I thought 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.130
 which can be a car that can use it 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.560
 so much 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.689
 the young man like us who 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.850
 we are grandparents or those who are bigger 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.420
 that they already married their children and I want 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.140
 a small car are not good many 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.140
 thanks for the opinion
