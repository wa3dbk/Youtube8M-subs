00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.940 
Dodge Challenger SC 3.5 liter v6 engine
this<00:00:11.940> came<00:00:12.300> from<00:00:12.480> modern<00:00:12.840> muscle<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.559> been

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
this came from modern muscle it's been

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.980 
this came from modern muscle it's been
ported<00:00:14.340> out<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.820> stock<00:00:15.089> part<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.660> then<00:00:15.780> just

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
ported out to stock part and then just

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.230 
ported out to stock part and then just
make<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> little<00:00:16.619> bit<00:00:16.770> larger<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.850> get<00:00:18.210> a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
make it a little bit larger to get a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.359 
make it a little bit larger to get a
little<00:00:18.330> bit<00:00:18.480> more<00:00:18.630> airflow<00:00:18.949> you<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.070> see<00:00:20.220> it's

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
little bit more airflow you can see it's

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.640 
little bit more airflow you can see it's
nice<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.580> polished<00:00:21.180> there<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:22.199> big

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
nice and polished there the big

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.779 
nice and polished there the big
difference<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> allow

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
difference is that it's going to allow

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.700 
difference is that it's going to allow
more<00:00:24.269> air<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.660> your<00:00:24.810> system<00:00:25.199> which<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.560> going

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
more air in your system which is going

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.839 
more air in your system which is going
to<00:00:25.830> give<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> little<00:00:26.220> bit<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.400> horsepower

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
to give you a little bit of horsepower

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.580 
to give you a little bit of horsepower
but<00:00:26.880> they're<00:00:27.390> saying<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.840> about<00:00:27.990> 10-15

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
but they're saying it's about 10-15

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.470 
but they're saying it's about 10-15
horsepower<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.250> probably<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.359> around

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
horsepower is probably right around

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.460 
horsepower is probably right around
they're<00:00:30.750> probably<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.109> bit<00:00:31.289> less

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
they're probably a little bit less

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.530 
they're probably a little bit less
depending<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.309> system<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:35.540> all

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
depending on what your system is all

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.869 
depending on what your system is all
right<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:37.140> air<00:00:37.469> system<00:00:37.980> we're<00:00:38.760> going

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
right this is my air system we're going

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.310 
right this is my air system we're going
to<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.030> removing<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.629> from<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> throttle<00:00:40.260> body

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to be removing it from the throttle body

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.959 
to be removing it from the throttle body
first<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> first<00:00:41.070> step<00:00:41.489> you're<00:00:41.850> going

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
first that's the first step you're going

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.080 
first that's the first step you're going
to<00:00:42.030> take<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.420> these<00:00:42.629> screws<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
to take out these screws here and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.950 
to take out these screws here and
separate<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.180> from<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> throttle<00:00:45.600> body<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
separate it from the throttle body so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.459 
separate it from the throttle body so
you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.170> take<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> throttle<00:00:46.620> body<00:00:46.770> off<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
you can take the throttle body off I

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.729 
you can take the throttle body off I
have<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> Canon<00:00:50.100> intake<00:00:50.700> system<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.289> little

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
have a Canon intake system it's a little

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.770 
have a Canon intake system it's a little
bit<00:00:52.829> different<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.219> stock<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:54.539> you're<00:00:54.690> not

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
bit different from stock if you're not

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.939 
bit different from stock if you're not
familiar<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.469> you're<00:00:55.590> gonna<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
familiar with it you're gonna have to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.260 
familiar with it you're gonna have to
find<00:00:56.250> someplace<00:00:56.579> else<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> show<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> how<00:00:57.210> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
find someplace else to show you how to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.729 
find someplace else to show you how to
take<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.480> stock<00:00:57.660> system<00:00:57.870> off<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
take your stock system off but if you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
take your stock system off but if you
have<00:00:58.859> an<00:00:58.980> intake<00:00:59.430> system<00:00:59.850> I'll<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.510> taking<00:01:00.780> it

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
have an intake system I'll be taking it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
have an intake system I'll be taking it
off<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> couple<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.520> steps<00:01:02.760> first

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
off and see a couple of steps first

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.050 
off and see a couple of steps first
thing<00:01:03.180> we<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.600> remove<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:05.010> a

I<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.400> show<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> house<00:01:23.820> video<00:01:25.520> go

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
I don't think I show the house video go

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.219 
I don't think I show the house video go
ahead<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.790> pull<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.119> whole<00:01:27.299> piece<00:01:27.509> off<00:01:27.689> make

millimeter bolt that's up underneath and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
millimeter bolt that's up underneath and
holds<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.399> black<00:01:53.670> arm<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.060> place<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.600> then

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
holds that black arm in place and then

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.020 
holds that black arm in place and then
there's<00:01:55.290> two<00:01:55.500> more<00:01:55.680> ten<00:01:55.920> millimeter<00:01:56.310> bolts

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
there's two more ten millimeter bolts

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.250 
there's two more ten millimeter bolts
underneath<00:01:57.719> that

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.000 

so<00:02:00.980> here<00:02:01.130> we<00:02:01.220> are<00:02:01.250> using<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.790> 10<00:02:02.000> millimeter

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
so here we are using the 10 millimeter

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.460 
so here we are using the 10 millimeter
just<00:02:04.010> move<00:02:04.220> those<00:02:04.400> four<00:02:04.670> bolts<00:02:11.350> now<00:02:12.350> we're

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
just move those four bolts now we're

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.050 
just move those four bolts now we're
going<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.680> use<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.890> 15<00:02:13.250> millimeter<00:02:13.490> reach<00:02:13.940> up

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
going to use the 15 millimeter reach up

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.000 
going to use the 15 millimeter reach up
underneath<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.540> by<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.290> engine<00:02:15.590> block<00:02:15.740> where

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
underneath and by the engine block where

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.650 
underneath and by the engine block where
that<00:02:16.130> black<00:02:16.310> arm<00:02:16.580> attaches<00:02:16.880> we're<00:02:17.450> going<00:02:17.570> to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
that black arm attaches we're going to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.420 
that black arm attaches we're going to
loosen<00:02:17.960> one<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.260> 15<00:02:18.620> millimeter<00:02:18.830> bolts

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
loosen one of the 15 millimeter bolts

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.620 
loosen one of the 15 millimeter bolts
and<00:02:19.940> we're<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:20.090> going<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.300> take<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> other

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
and we're just going to take the other

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.170 
and we're just going to take the other
one<00:02:20.810> off<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.740> can<00:02:21.890> see<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.000> big

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
one off you can see it's a it's a big

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.330 
one off you can see it's a it's a big
one<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:24.880> that's<00:02:25.880> smaller<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:27.740> smaller<00:02:27.920> 10

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
one so the that's smaller the smaller 10

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.830 
one so the that's smaller the smaller 10
millimeters<00:02:28.820> are<00:02:29.000> underneath<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:29.720> you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
millimeters are underneath it so you

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.150 
millimeters are underneath it so you
have<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.080> move<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.410> black<00:02:30.590> arm<00:02:30.860> out<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
have to move that black arm out of the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.010 
have to move that black arm out of the
way<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.550> only<00:02:31.910> took<00:02:32.120> one<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.540> 15<00:02:32.840> millimeter

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
way I only took one of the 15 millimeter

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.020 
way I only took one of the 15 millimeter
bolts<00:02:33.470> out<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.160> take<00:02:34.310> them<00:02:34.460> both<00:02:34.610> out<00:02:34.820> and

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
bolts out you can take them both out and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.160 
bolts out you can take them both out and
take<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.210> whole<00:02:35.450> arm<00:02:35.630> off<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.140> just

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
take that whole arm off but I just

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.140 
take that whole arm off but I just
prefer<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.650> take<00:02:36.830> one<00:02:37.070> out<00:02:37.100> keep<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.000> other

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
prefer to take one out keep the other

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.480 
prefer to take one out keep the other
one<00:02:38.240> loose<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.780> swing<00:02:38.960> it<00:02:38.990> out<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.260> way

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
one loose and swing it out of the way

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.440 
one loose and swing it out of the way
all<00:02:40.490> right<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.640> pulled<00:02:40.880> those<00:02:41.000> two<00:02:41.240> 10

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
all right I pulled those two 10

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.410 
all right I pulled those two 10
millimeters<00:02:41.900> off<00:02:42.550> I'm<00:02:43.550> getting<00:02:44.180> ready<00:02:44.390> to

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
millimeters off I'm getting ready to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.600 
millimeters off I'm getting ready to
separate<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.960> whole<00:02:45.110> throttle<00:02:45.380> body<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:48.610> don't

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
separate the whole throttle body I don't

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.070 
separate the whole throttle body I don't
think<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.790> showed<00:02:50.030> here<00:02:50.270> but<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.810> need<00:02:50.960> to

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
think I showed here but you do need to

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.080 
think I showed here but you do need to
disconnect<00:02:51.410> your<00:02:51.770> your<00:02:52.250> electronics<00:02:52.730> -<00:02:52.880> I

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
disconnect your your electronics - I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.810 
disconnect your your electronics - I
didn't<00:02:53.750> replace<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.200> gasket<00:02:54.610> didn't<00:02:55.610> look

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
didn't replace the gasket didn't look

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.010 
didn't replace the gasket didn't look
like<00:02:55.880> there<00:02:56.120> was<00:02:56.150> anything<00:02:56.390> wrong<00:02:56.510> with<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.900> it

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
like there was anything wrong with it it

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.690 
like there was anything wrong with it it
was<00:02:57.110> still<00:02:57.260> fitting<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:57.620> place<00:02:57.740> fine<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.460> I

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
was still fitting in place fine and I

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.160 
was still fitting in place fine and I
didn't<00:02:59.060> have<00:02:59.180> one<00:02:59.300> on<00:02:59.330> hand<00:02:59.420> replace<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.050> with

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
didn't have one on hand replace it with

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.960 
didn't have one on hand replace it with
so<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.130> can<00:03:01.190> see<00:03:01.370> there's<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.640> side<00:03:01.820> by<00:03:01.940> side

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
so you can see there's a side by side

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.460 
so you can see there's a side by side
comparison<00:03:02.150> mine's<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.870> little<00:03:02.900> bit<00:03:03.140> dirtier

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
comparison mine's a little bit dirtier

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.920 
comparison mine's a little bit dirtier
Gers<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.250> big<00:03:04.430> difference<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:05.000> is<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.690> size

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
Gers the big difference is is the size
