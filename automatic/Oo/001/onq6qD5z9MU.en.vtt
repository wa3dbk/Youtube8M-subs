but<00:00:36.690> we're<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.320> truly<00:00:37.920> trying<00:00:38.190> our

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
but we're really truly trying our

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.100

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
hardest to get back to where we know we

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
hardest to get back to where we know we
can<00:00:40.260> play<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.129> we're<00:00:41.489> good<00:00:41.610> players

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
can play like we know we're good players

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.889 
can play like we know we're good players
we<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.600> good<00:00:42.690> team

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
we know it can be a really good team

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.170 
we know it can be a really good team
it's<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.890> lack<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.370> trying<00:00:44.760> or

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it's not for a lack of like trying or

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.490 
it's not for a lack of like trying or
not<00:00:45.329> lack<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.410> don't

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
not lack of like it's not like we don't

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.229 
not lack of like it's not like we don't
want<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.219> trying<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:47.820> hard<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
want it like we're trying very hard and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.690 
want it like we're trying very hard and
we<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.079> some<00:00:49.530> communication<00:00:50.100> issues<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
we just have some communication issues a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
we just have some communication issues a
bit<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.940> inexperience<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.780> bit<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> wet<00:00:52.770> feet<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
bit of inexperience a bit of wet feet I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
bit of inexperience a bit of wet feet I
guess<00:00:53.190> at<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> start<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.510> think

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
guess at the start but I really think

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.930 
guess at the start but I really think
that<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:55.410> enough<00:00:55.620> time<00:00:55.800> will<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.699> able<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that with enough time will be be able to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.189 
that with enough time will be be able to
reach<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.270> level<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.079> at

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
reach that level that we want to be at

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.170 
reach that level that we want to be at
and<00:00:58.399> hopefully<00:00:59.399> by<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> end<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and hopefully by the end of the this

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
and hopefully by the end of the this
split<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:01.079> think<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.559> compete<00:01:01.920> at

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
split I really think we can compete at

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
split I really think we can compete at
the<00:01:02.280> international<00:01:02.789> stage<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.870> all

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the international stage and we all

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.390 
the international stage and we all
really<00:01:04.350> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> world<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.159> as

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
really want to go to world just like as

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.310 
really want to go to world just like as
any<00:01:05.580> LCS<00:01:05.970> team<00:01:06.180> does<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:07.080> think<00:01:07.110> we

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
any LCS team does but I really think we

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.960 
any LCS team does but I really think we
can<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.950> we're<00:01:08.520> shooting<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
can do it so we're shooting for it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.539 
can do it so we're shooting for it
really<00:01:09.150> hard<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.840> right<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.770> new<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.520> a
