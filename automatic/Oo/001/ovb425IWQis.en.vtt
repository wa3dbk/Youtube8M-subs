reflections<00:01:22.310> you'll<00:01:23.310> probably<00:01:23.880> come<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.450> with

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
reflections you'll probably come up with

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.599 
reflections you'll probably come up with
these<00:01:24.869> fireflies<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:28.159> what<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.429> is

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
these fireflies and what it is is

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.349 
these fireflies and what it is is
blender<00:01:30.539> cycles<00:01:30.929> is<00:01:31.079> trying<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> reproduce

blender cycles is trying to reproduce
the<00:01:33.359> reflections<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:34.530> light<00:01:34.799> that's

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
the reflections in the light that's

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.910 
the reflections in the light that's
reflecting<00:01:35.609> off<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.799> depending<00:01:37.799> on

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
reflecting off of it and depending on

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
reflecting off of it and depending on
your<00:01:38.039> settings<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.850> quite<00:01:39.210> getting<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
your settings it's not quite getting it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.010 
your settings it's not quite getting it
in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.469> right<00:01:41.240> some<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.359> the<00:01:42.420> pixels<00:01:42.749> are<00:01:42.869> just

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
in the right some of the pixels are just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.300 
in the right some of the pixels are just
too<00:01:43.109> bright<00:01:43.289> I<00:01:43.350> mean<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.100> what<00:01:44.219> it

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
too bright I mean that's that's what it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.139 
too bright I mean that's that's what it
boils<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:47.490> been<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> lot

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
boils down to and so there's been a lot

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
boils down to and so there's been a lot
of<00:01:48.179> talk<00:01:48.539> about<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.109> get<00:01:49.319> rid<00:01:49.499> of<00:01:49.619> these

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
of talk about how to get rid of these

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.929 
of talk about how to get rid of these
things

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
things

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.950 
things
anywhere<00:01:51.929> from<00:01:52.490> making<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.689> very<00:01:54.689> high

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
anywhere from making a very high

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.989 
anywhere from making a very high
resolution<00:01:56.539> render<00:01:57.539> of<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:58.020> image<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> then

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999 
resolution render of your image and then

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.370 
resolution render of your image and then
resizing<00:01:59.999> it<00:02:00.119> down<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.630> people<00:02:00.780> won't<00:02:01.109> notice

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
resizing it down so people won't notice

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.859 
resizing it down so people won't notice
it<00:02:01.709> like<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.579> that's<00:02:03.209> ridiculous

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it like that that's ridiculous

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.440 
it like that that's ridiculous
it<00:02:04.770> takes<00:02:05.069> forever<00:02:05.459> to<00:02:05.700> try<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:05.999> do<00:02:06.209> something

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it takes forever to try to do something

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.450 
it takes forever to try to do something
like<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.749> and<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.039> shouldn't<00:02:08.340> have

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
like that and it is you shouldn't have

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.150 
like that and it is you shouldn't have
to<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.729> something<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.180> that<00:02:10.130> some<00:02:11.130> people

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
to do something like that some people

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
to do something like that some people
have<00:02:11.550> written<00:02:11.910> scripts<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.390> try<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.600> get<00:02:12.750> rid

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
have written scripts to try to get rid

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.580 
have written scripts to try to get rid
of<00:02:12.900> them<00:02:13.080> some

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
of them some

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.190 
of them some
people<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.300> said<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.569> know<00:02:15.599> set<00:02:15.959> your

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
people have said you know set your

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
people have said you know set your
samples<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.800> high<00:02:16.950> as<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.550> possibly<00:02:17.940> go

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
samples as high as you can possibly go

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.290 
samples as high as you can possibly go
that<00:02:18.510> that's<00:02:18.810> not<00:02:19.019> really<00:02:19.260> true<00:02:19.410> because<00:02:20.300> you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that that's not really true because you

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.390 
that that's not really true because you
can<00:02:21.510> set<00:02:21.810> your<00:02:21.959> samples<00:02:22.500> higher<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> can

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
can set your samples higher and you can

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.430 
can set your samples higher and you can
take<00:02:23.550> more<00:02:23.700> samples<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.900> get<00:02:25.260> rid<00:02:25.410> of

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
take more samples and you get rid of

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.050 
take more samples and you get rid of
some<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.920> fireflies<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.790> ends

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
some of the fireflies but then it ends

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.080 
some of the fireflies but then it ends
up<00:02:27.150> creating<00:02:27.360> new<00:02:27.720> ones<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.940> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
up creating new ones so just really a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.039 
up creating new ones so just really a
big<00:02:30.330> pain<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.620> with<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:33.120> latest<00:02:33.420> versions<00:02:33.870> of

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
big pain but with the latest versions of

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.729 
big pain but with the latest versions of
blender<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.680> have<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> way<00:02:35.370> an<00:02:35.670> easy<00:02:36.150> way<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.750> do

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
blender we have a way an easy way to do

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.589 
blender we have a way an easy way to do
away<00:02:37.860> with<00:02:38.010> these<00:02:38.280> pesky<00:02:38.670> little<00:02:39.090> fireflies

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
away with these pesky little fireflies

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.150 
away with these pesky little fireflies

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
I'm going to show you how to do that all

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.630 
I'm going to show you how to do that all
you<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.180> do<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:43.190> when<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.310> render<00:02:44.610> your

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
you have to do is when you render your

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.390 
you have to do is when you render your
model<00:02:45.170> go<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.470> render<00:02:46.739> settings<00:02:47.130> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
model go up to the render settings and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.080 
model go up to the render settings and
you<00:02:47.549> want<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> go<00:02:47.910> down<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.510> your<00:02:48.870> sampling<00:02:49.769> and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
you want to go down to your sampling and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.890 
you want to go down to your sampling and
you<00:02:51.090> want<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.329> look<00:02:51.480> at<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.760> clamp<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.450> this

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
you want to look at the clamp here this

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.569 
you want to look at the clamp here this
is<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.470> fairly<00:02:55.950> new<00:02:56.069> setting<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:58.250> by<00:02:59.250> default

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
is a fairly new setting and by default

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.050 
is a fairly new setting and by default
is<00:02:59.879> set<00:03:00.150> at<00:03:00.360> 0<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.959> at<00:03:01.349> 0<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:02.190> will<00:03:02.670> give<00:03:02.910> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
is set at 0 and at 0 it will give you

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.550 
is set at 0 and at 0 it will give you
exactly<00:03:03.390> what<00:03:03.690> you're<00:03:03.840> seeing<00:03:03.959> in<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> render

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
exactly what you're seeing in the render

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.550 
exactly what you're seeing in the render
and<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:05.519> probably<00:03:05.819> get<00:03:05.970> fireflies<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.379> what

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and you probably get fireflies so what

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.930 
and you probably get fireflies so what
you<00:03:07.680> need<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.280> need<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.519> kind<00:03:08.790> of

you need to do is you need to kind of

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.280 
you need to do is you need to kind of
play<00:03:09.060> around<00:03:09.180> with<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.540> setting<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.140> order

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
play around with this setting in order

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.440 
play around with this setting in order
to<00:03:10.470> get<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.829> best<00:03:11.069> setting<00:03:11.790> for<00:03:11.819> what<00:03:12.269> your

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
to get the best setting for what your

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.930 
to get the best setting for what your
what<00:03:12.930> your<00:03:13.140> model<00:03:13.379> is<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.250> what<00:03:14.730> kind<00:03:14.910> of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
what your model is and what kind of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.840 
what your model is and what kind of
materials<00:03:15.030> you're<00:03:15.750> using<00:03:16.019> them<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:17.670> don't

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
materials you're using them you don't

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.970 
materials you're using them you don't
want<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.359> set<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.750> at<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> low<00:03:19.200> say<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.590> say<00:03:19.709> if<00:03:19.799> I

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
want to set it at a low say and say if I

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.960 
want to set it at a low say and say if I
went<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.430> like<00:03:20.639> point<00:03:21.000> two<00:03:21.510> or<00:03:21.780> something<00:03:22.970> or

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
went to like point two or something or

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.500 
went to like point two or something or
one<00:03:24.660> 6.06<00:03:25.500> whatever<00:03:25.850> what<00:03:26.850> you're<00:03:27.030> doing<00:03:27.299> then

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
one 6.06 whatever what you're doing then

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.080 
one 6.06 whatever what you're doing then
is<00:03:27.780> you're<00:03:28.049> clamping<00:03:28.500> off<00:03:28.650> almost<00:03:29.579> all<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.790> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
is you're clamping off almost all of the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.360 
is you're clamping off almost all of the
light<00:03:30.840> emitting<00:03:31.319> from<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> pixels<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.190> you're

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
light emitting from the pixels so you're

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.250 
light emitting from the pixels so you're
going<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.519> get<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> very<00:03:32.940> dark<00:03:33.209> render<00:03:33.630> that's

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
going to get a very dark render that's

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.080 
going to get a very dark render that's
not<00:03:34.440> what<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.739> want<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:35.880> particular

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
not what you want for this particular

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
render what I just happen to find out is

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.099 
render what I just happen to find out is
I<00:03:40.109> set<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.500> at<00:03:40.650> 30<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:42.060> worked<00:03:42.269> fine<00:03:42.599> for<00:03:42.630> me

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
I set it at 30 and it worked fine for me

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:50.449 
I set it at 30 and it worked fine for me
this<00:03:44.099> is<00:03:44.280> what<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.489> got<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:48.950> that's<00:03:49.950> great<00:03:50.190> it

this is what I got so that's great it

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.580 
this is what I got so that's great it
got<00:03:50.609> rid<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.819> all<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.269> fireflies<00:03:51.780> now<00:03:52.319> what

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
got rid of all the fireflies now what

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.589 
got rid of all the fireflies now what
you<00:03:52.739> don't<00:03:52.950> want<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.220> do<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.669> you<00:03:54.150> don't<00:03:54.359> want

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
to with the clamp you can actually get

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.319 
to with the clamp you can actually get
rid<00:03:58.139> of<00:03:58.349> a<00:03:58.500> lot<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.709> your<00:03:59.150> reflections<00:04:00.150> and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
realism of the image so just like I say

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.970 
realism of the image so just like I say
just<00:04:09.930> kind<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.319> play<00:04:10.530> around<00:04:10.650> with<00:04:10.829> the

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
sighting to get your best render and

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.219 
sighting to get your best render and
just<00:04:14.639> as<00:04:14.760> another<00:04:15.000> example<00:04:15.229> something

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
just as another example something

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.750 
just as another example something
interesting<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:16.919> found<00:04:17.160> out<00:04:17.340> while<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:17.609> was

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
interesting I found out while I was

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.839 
interesting I found out while I was
messing<00:04:18.450> around<00:04:18.630> with<00:04:18.840> these<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.349> setting

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
messing around with these this setting

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.610 
messing around with these this setting
is<00:04:20.849> I<00:04:21.060> created<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.539> little<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.590> know

spheres cue
type<00:04:25.180> seen<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:28.950> just<00:04:29.950> made<00:04:30.070> these

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
type seen and I just made these

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.030 
type seen and I just made these
materials<00:04:30.730> out<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.500> like<00:04:32.940> glass<00:04:33.940> and

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
materials out of like glass and

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.330 
materials out of like glass and
translucent<00:04:36.040> materials<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:38.340> glossy

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
translucent materials and glossy

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.930 
translucent materials and glossy
materials<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.000> things<00:04:40.090> like<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:42.610> when<00:04:42.910> I

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
materials and things like that so when I

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.890 
materials and things like that so when I
rendered<00:04:43.300> up<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.600> got<00:04:43.930> this<00:04:45.450> which<00:04:46.450> I<00:04:46.600> kind<00:04:46.840> of

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
rendered up I got this which I kind of

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.320 
rendered up I got this which I kind of
expected<00:04:47.470> on<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.680> on<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.580> zero<00:04:48.820> setting<00:04:49.240> with

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
expected on the on the zero setting with

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.920 
expected on the on the zero setting with
a<00:04:49.390> clamp<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.870> got<00:04:50.170> some<00:04:50.470> fireflies<00:04:50.980> there<00:04:51.930> but

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
a clamp I got some fireflies there but

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.420 
a clamp I got some fireflies there but
then<00:04:53.080> when<00:04:53.200> I<00:04:53.230> played<00:04:53.440> around<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.740> scenes<00:04:54.040> a

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
then when I played around the scenes a

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.630 
then when I played around the scenes a
little<00:04:54.550> bit<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:54.790> went<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.180> like<00:04:55.420> 0.5<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:57.430> got

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
little bit I went to like 0.5 and I got

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.240 
little bit I went to like 0.5 and I got
this<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:59.740> is<00:04:59.920> kind<00:05:00.040> of<00:05:00.130> interesting

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
this and this is kind of interesting

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.310 
this and this is kind of interesting
because<00:05:00.700> it's<00:05:01.120> actually<00:05:01.360> giving<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:01.990> a<00:05:02.020> way

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
because it's actually giving you a way

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.880 
because it's actually giving you a way
to<00:05:02.350> give<00:05:03.190> kind<00:05:03.490> of<00:05:03.580> like<00:05:03.790> a<00:05:03.820> soft<00:05:04.330> light<00:05:04.890> look

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
to give kind of like a soft light look

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.190 
to give kind of like a soft light look
to<00:05:06.070> your<00:05:06.190> image<00:05:06.490> now<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.180> may<00:05:07.450> be<00:05:07.480> able<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.810> get

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
to your image now you may be able to get

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.050 
to your image now you may be able to get
the<00:05:08.290> same<00:05:08.470> thing<00:05:08.710> by<00:05:08.950> cutting<00:05:09.340> down<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.850> power

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
the same thing by cutting down the power

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.270 
the same thing by cutting down the power
of<00:05:10.360> your<00:05:10.660> lamp<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.410> don't<00:05:12.010> know<00:05:12.070> I<00:05:12.100> haven't

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
of your lamp I don't know I haven't

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.590 
of your lamp I don't know I haven't
really<00:05:12.370> played<00:05:12.640> around<00:05:12.730> with<00:05:12.970> that<00:05:13.060> but<00:05:13.390> I

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
really played around with that but I

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.000 
really played around with that but I
just<00:05:13.990> thought<00:05:14.110> it<00:05:14.170> was<00:05:14.290> interesting<00:05:14.350> that<00:05:14.770> you

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
just thought it was interesting that you

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.760 
just thought it was interesting that you
can<00:05:15.160> get<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.490> kind<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.850> look<00:05:16.260> by<00:05:17.260> using<00:05:17.530> that

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
can get that kind of look by using that

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.060 
can get that kind of look by using that
clamp<00:05:18.070> setting<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:18.820> that's<00:05:19.030> just<00:05:19.240> another

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
clamp setting so that's just another

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.220 
clamp setting so that's just another
interesting<00:05:21.070> little<00:05:21.250> tidbit<00:05:21.610> there<00:05:22.230> so

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
interesting little tidbit there so

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.010 
interesting little tidbit there so
anyway<00:05:23.560> that's<00:05:23.800> how<00:05:24.400> to<00:05:25.120> take<00:05:25.540> care<00:05:25.810> of<00:05:25.840> those

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
anyway that's how to take care of those

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.710
