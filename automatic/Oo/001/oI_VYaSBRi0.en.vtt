00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.830
 hi it's the expo blues that make the point fr today a small tutorial 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.230
 a very fast talent that will show how to operate the jailbreak of an iphone 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.450
 3g and 3gs equipped with firmware 3 points in 33 with the tool which avoids that is 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.739
 released last May 4th 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.539
 so see here I have my iphone 3g 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.169
 who is it 3% in francs 3 that has just been restored by itunes that's 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.029
 important to start by doing that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.449
 we take the opportunity to save the contents of his iphone which can not 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.669
 make of bad 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.890
 for the little important clarification before we start it this tool does not 

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:36.640
 does not support the desimlock an official so if ever percent 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.870
 you need the one to have a iphone unlocked it is not necessary that you 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.800
 use it for now and we also invite you not save all 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.420
 the files also the other 1% via cydia 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.440
 more information go to the blog yes these attacks and the party 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.600
 practice so what is this budget to explain what has fast and for that I 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.570
 I'm going to start singing my iphone 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.650
 at my computer 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.820
 we left it is used in pc equipped with windows 7 a suite also 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.090
 available for mac and for luxury 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.240
 under our skies a little trick to avoid having to meet him from 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.270
 problems and switch from an application to compatibility mode 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.550
 winehouse 94 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.670
 so after having recovered a strict executable by ex and you do 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.590
 right click 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.530
 you go on properties 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.350
 for compatibility 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.070
 you select to run this program in compatibility mode 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.690
 course and in the drop-down menu selected for a 30% increase 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780
 from there 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 applied 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.640
 and you just need 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 of old if you are going to have an alert years 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.060
 the appeal there 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.119
 as it comes up it must be much simpler than comets and 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.240
 other novels 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.580
 a single operation to accomplish but here it looks like said 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.830
 iphone 3g in three years takes 3 connected so it's ready to 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.120
 to launch the wharf it is enough for that 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 click on the corresponding button 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.619
 and the operation starts 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.199
 on the forums 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.639
 we will observe 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.099
 setting up 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 an extremely fast restoration 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.269
 we see that there must be a charge 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.599
 quite simply 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.749
 and on a PC, you can see very quickly 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.759
 the operation 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:35.709
 is indicated as being successful 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.619
 the trick is not to click on titles 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:41.619
 is not closing the application simply 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.549
 from there 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.799
 the honor leaf 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.799
 restarts 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.649
 which unfortunately we always take a little time especially if like mine 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.649
 he was abused on the adapted software level 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.870
 multiple streams short installation of more or less official applications 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.999
 and others 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.099
 see the wallpaper that is integrated by spirit 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.069
 which proves that a priori the jailbreak went well 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.059
 we learn that the first load is time that we can only 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.059
 changes that are made at the system level 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.629
 here we observe that the progress bar 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.289
 is coming to an end 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.499
 which means curious in a few seconds the iphone should be 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.499
 operational 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.950
 What I want is that I see it went well 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.439
 so I will go to the last page to find the apps 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.329
 and here I see the icon cydia 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.489
 I find that a priori 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.989
 everything worked 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.369
 so how does it complain? 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:02.169
 here are the few bugs in the first version of the application that 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.969
 have been fixed since banks from the moment I'm following you 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.050
 the few precautions of used 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.670
 know the switch in compatibility windows 7 rebounds 15 countries obviously do not 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.899
 not to plug your iphone at the wrong time 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:16.449
 properly closed the software rather than pressing the small button 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:20.150
 I think you should not have a problem here for more 

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.279
 do not hesitate to pass on iphone dot fr blue that we tell you 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.089
 see you soon for next sooner probably for the exit dolores 

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.799
 4-0
