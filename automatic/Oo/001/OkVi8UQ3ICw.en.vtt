tight<00:01:10.500> lining<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.040> great<00:01:11.520> because<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.119> very

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
tight lining is great because it's very

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
tight lining is great because it's very
natural<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.350> subtle<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> darken

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
natural and it's a subtle way to darken

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460 
natural and it's a subtle way to darken
a<00:01:14.460> lash<00:01:14.640> line<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> if<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> very<00:01:15.990> small

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
a lash line and if you have a very small

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.440 
a lash line and if you have a very small
lid<00:01:16.710> space<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.159> myself<00:01:17.369> sometimes<00:01:18.299> you'll

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
lid space like myself sometimes you'll

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.660 
lid space like myself sometimes you'll
find<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.840> normal<00:01:19.470> eyeliner<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.400> upper

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
find that normal eyeliner on the upper

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.730 
find that normal eyeliner on the upper
lash<00:01:20.850> line<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.600> take<00:01:21.810> away<00:01:22.049> quite<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> lot<00:01:22.650> of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
lash line can take away quite a lot of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
lash line can take away quite a lot of
your<00:01:22.860> lip<00:01:23.009> space<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.850> trick<00:01:24.180> means<00:01:24.479> zero

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
your lip space this trick means zero

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.490 
your lip space this trick means zero
compromise<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.540> again<00:01:27.780> comparing<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.409> my

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
compromise so again comparing with my

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.620 
compromise so again comparing with my
other<00:01:28.710> eye<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.090> eye<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
other eye you can see one eye in the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.830 
other eye you can see one eye in the
visibly<00:01:31.290> darker<00:01:32.040> than<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> other<00:01:35.780> okay<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
visibly darker than the other okay so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.719 
visibly darker than the other okay so
this<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.710> most<00:01:37.829> favorite<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.460> and

this<00:02:58.519> creates<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.120> fresh<00:02:59.780> I'd<00:02:59.989> like<00:03:00.170> making<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
this creates a fresh I'd like making the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.420 
this creates a fresh I'd like making the
eyes<00:03:00.769> like<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.010> Wiccan<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.610> write<00:03:03.190> out<00:03:04.190> the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
eyes like a Wiccan and write out the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.710 
eyes like a Wiccan and write out the

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
guidelines a harder feather out your

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.930 
guidelines a harder feather out your
eyeliner<00:03:06.049> just<00:03:06.650> follow<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:07.280> curve<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.910> your

now<00:03:33.360> instead<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.690> creating<00:03:34.050> something<00:03:34.260> that

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
now instead of creating something that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.070 
now instead of creating something that
fans<00:03:34.710> off<00:03:35.070> smoothly<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.030> curve<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.810> wing

fans off smoothly in a curve the wing
doesn't<00:03:37.620> expand<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.460> much<00:03:38.490> in<00:03:39.060> fact

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
doesn't expand it as much in fact
