 Here 's a motorist's turnst here 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:58.060
 It looks like the terminal of the contact did not hit a little well have ended up floating 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.590
 There are two places . 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.640
 This turn is this, but I did a little bending to hit 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.640
 Yes I turned 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.820
 I'm not happy 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:18.510
 There is also a lot of momentum 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.049
 Then, I will assemble this plastic stage seems a little difficult 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.720

 We'll have or 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.440
 It looks like it's quite difficult here 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.190
 It will high Anochotto trick is good 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.330
 State it in a state 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:54.659
 You should put a screw, yes 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.659
 It was a bit difficult, but I can not explain it 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.000
 I need some tips 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.000

 I think Dattari Kyu and the spirit a little Do not interesting or to thin of such a little uneven 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:43.570
 I tried to use it, but I changed it to a flat one because it is not a bit 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.570
 So let's get back and go again 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.090
