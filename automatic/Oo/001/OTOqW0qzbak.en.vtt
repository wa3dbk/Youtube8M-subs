00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.460
 Hi people 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.349
 The other day he went to an Italian 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.210
 asked pasta to the Parisian he is so 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.560
 simple and so good to make me 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.779
 I decided to share this recipe with 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.500
 Come on, two tablespoons of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.640

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.129
 while pasta is cooking and in the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.370
 another pot I'm going to start preparing the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.789
 lemon-based sauce bÃ©chamel sauce I 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.510
 I'm going to add traditional butter now 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.510
 the wheat flour 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.910
 I'm going to show you how to make a clay 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.470
 add that milk gradually 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.780
 mixing parana in put if you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.119
 have one was better to be able to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 absorb the small groups of flour is 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.270
 We'll settle here until now. 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.890
 no more domain to do 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.869
 Now that you have dissolved all the flour, I 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.860
 I'll add the creme 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.440
 of milk 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.910
 mix to incorporate everything we go 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.020
 be careful because they do not milk you 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.020
 see for him not to pay 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.590
 I'll join frozen beams if you 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.759
 want can use only can but here is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.630
 much more beautiful 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.630
 the chopped ham 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.490
 you can also change it by chest of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:56.460
 turkey 1 now I'm going to give a storm a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:01.409
 little nutmeg parsley a 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.509
 little salt and pepper to increase the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.069
 Fire now, and time to start wanting. 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.229
 Stand up safely, just switch off after 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.200
 Boil it's time to add more 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.880
 I'm adding a noodle but you 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.849
 can add any mass of the type 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.540
 long but if you are not worth short 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.310
 also add an extra always reminds 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.379
 take a little more time before 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.330
 cooking point to get ready 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.730
 because she always finishes cooking 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.810
 here in the sauce our pasta can stand 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.180
 very soft 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.680
 if you want an eye a little bit more 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.120
 watery I advise you to put a 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.959
 of the cooking water of the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.540
 spaghetti 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.140
 but I like it very creamy and now it's 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.140
 just enjoy 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.989

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.870

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.410
 delicious in the kitchen but at home and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.410
