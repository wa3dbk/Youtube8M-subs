00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and I quickly found out that that's not

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.609

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
trail and that took two years had to

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.370 
trail and that took two years had to
build<00:01:48.210> something<00:01:48.420> totally<00:01:48.689> different<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
build something totally different to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.249 
build something totally different to
trick<00:01:49.829> him<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.549> into<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.210> smart

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
trick him to get into it just smart

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.410

now<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:52.829> wild<00:01:53.130> boar<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.729> possible

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
now with wild boar that is possible

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.469 
now with wild boar that is possible
because<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.770> don't<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.700> ship<00:01:57.060> them<00:01:57.270> when

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
because you don't just ship them when

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.080 
because you don't just ship them when
they're<00:01:57.920> when<00:01:58.920> they're<00:01:58.950> very<00:01:59.219> young<00:01:59.340> because

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
they're when they're very young because

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.360 
they're when they're very young because
it<00:02:00.329> takes<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> lot<00:02:00.750> longer<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.170> grow<00:02:01.500> them<00:02:01.770> so

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
it takes a lot longer to grow them so

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.190 
it takes a lot longer to grow them so
two<00:02:02.730> and<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> half<00:02:03.030> years<00:02:03.330> there's<00:02:03.600> nothing<00:02:04.020> for

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
two and a half years there's nothing for

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.250 
two and a half years there's nothing for
them<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.850> bring<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.000> up<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.240> market<00:02:06.630> wait<00:02:06.840> and

steel mesh so they still think that they

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.070 
steel mesh so they still think that they
can<00:04:01.350> jump<00:04:01.590> off<00:04:01.830> but<00:04:02.790> then<00:04:03.510> you've<00:04:03.660> got<00:04:03.690> them

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080

can jump off but then you've got them
under<00:04:04.410> control

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
under control

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.970 
under control
now<00:04:05.880> they<00:04:06.090> can<00:04:06.360> jump<00:04:06.690> out<00:04:06.840> anymore<00:04:07.319> mm-hmm<00:04:07.890> and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
because once they get through the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.130 
because once they get through the
subsoil<00:05:02.880> they<00:05:03.210> stop<00:05:03.510> they<00:05:03.810> don't<00:05:03.990> go<00:05:04.110> down

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
subsoil they stop they don't go down

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.409 
subsoil they stop they don't go down
into<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.740> subsoil<00:05:05.220> they<00:05:05.730> don't<00:05:05.940> mix<00:05:06.180> that

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
into the subsoil they don't mix that

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:07.760 
into the subsoil they don't mix that
