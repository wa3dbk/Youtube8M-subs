number<00:00:09.360> seven<00:00:09.510> bottom<00:00:09.719> not<00:00:09.960> sure<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.580> so<00:00:11.580> this

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
number seven bottom not sure and so this

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.599

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
this way actually want to think but i'm

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.350 
this way actually want to think but i'm
not<00:02:42.760> sure<00:02:43.000> but<00:02:43.260> yeah<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:45.820> pretty<00:02:45.940> much<00:02:46.060> it

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
not sure but yeah so it's pretty much it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.080 
not sure but yeah so it's pretty much it
for<00:02:46.390> this<00:02:46.540> host<00:02:46.870> or<00:02:47.050> um<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:48.190> actually<00:02:48.580> really

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
for this host or um I actually really

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.290 
for this host or um I actually really
like<00:02:49.240> this<00:02:49.270> house<00:02:49.660> if<00:02:50.910> anything<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.150> would

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
like this house if anything I would

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.670 
like this house if anything I would
probably<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:53.050> move<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.320> staircase<00:02:53.560> and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
probably just move the staircase and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.050 
probably just move the staircase and
yeah<00:02:56.680> if<00:02:57.070> anything<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.640> bit<00:02:57.760> too<00:02:57.910> small

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
yeah if anything it's a bit too small

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.540
