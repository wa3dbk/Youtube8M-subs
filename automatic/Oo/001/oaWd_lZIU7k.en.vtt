00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.160
 otherwise I do not think because we had 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.370
 had I think an opportunity that maybe 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 deserved a peno rods it's not too much 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.910
 marseille opportunities also we could 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.650
 still rely on one on a big 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.539
 vincent it's true he did in 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.820
 first half time and a double parry 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.109
 second with her was important to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.150
 been decisive 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.680
 and then a bit like like since a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.599
 certain world number of matches we have not 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.599
 we did not give up we kept going 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.750
 forced and royan secret entered a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.739
 opportunity and we mark at the end so 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.320
 so it's true that it's a bit of a 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.820
 plerin command can call his 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.110
 liberation means to have marked 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 like that in the end because we know that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.510
 that behind we will not take a goal we have 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.590
 need him a rate that we who we 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.289
 still comes out shares like that so 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.120
 better for us that will keep you his cages 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.260
 inviolate I think it's some 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.550
 good thing for us and for him 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.370
 also because I think I believe a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.650
 record to beat is well gone for ben 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.390
 as I said hardworker every day and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.080
 another thousand of montclos weekend that 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.630
 congratulations to sir bah there what 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.770
 demonstrates that by being I think we 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.729
 can be satisfied with having it in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.080
 the goal is cruel bread for the content 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.240
 compared to what we did not do for 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.509
 so many opportunities we had in our 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.700
 favor 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.979
 finally as it says she and especially in 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.229
 end of the game it's hard to cash 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.220
 it makes us think a little there at the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.259
 last season where it's us who 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.280
 win less 1 0 a lot of matches 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.509
 like that recurrent a bomb there so much 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.720
 better for Lille but hey it's true 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.570
 it's a little frustrating because he has 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.640
 does true preserving and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.960
 we can congratulate him in time but 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.750
 polite the same in any case we are 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.260
 a lot disappointed with the result because 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.030
 as I tell you I think that we very 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.950
 good things unfortunately in the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.510
 football and that the result that we retain 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.550
 less frustrating porn because we do 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.890
 a very good match then we cash a 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.530
 purpose in additional time whereas 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.880
 the team had held well until then 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.540
 had defended well we did not create 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.610
 badly of opportunities 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.750
 we did not succeed in concretizing them 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 it's really frustrating for us 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.150
 necessarily when we lose points 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.760
 against a team that is before us at 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.489
 ranking is that they are moving away 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.050
 necessarily it's complicated but after it 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.000
 are still a lot of matches we are not 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.810
 still at the truce and we have the resources 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.810
 to go up the rankings 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.470
 it's the game I was expecting that's it 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.690
 do not worry I was able to 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.280
 to do my match 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.790
 I was focused so it did not ask me 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.790
 of particular concern
