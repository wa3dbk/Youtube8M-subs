the<00:02:18.080> job<00:02:18.290> done<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.860> probably<00:02:19.340> could<00:02:19.670> get<00:02:20.270> a

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
the job done I probably could get a

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.990 
the job done I probably could get a
little<00:02:20.480> faster<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.260> said

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.309 

and<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.480> notice<00:02:26.660> how<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and you notice how the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.099 
and you notice how the
the<00:02:28.709> tachometer<00:02:29.069> sort<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.609> bouncy<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.299> don't

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
the tachometer sort of bouncy I don't

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.729 
the tachometer sort of bouncy I don't
like<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.859> just<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:33.469> sort<00:02:34.469> of<00:02:34.499> showing

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
like that it's just a sort of showing

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.089 
like that it's just a sort of showing
that<00:02:34.829> a<00:02:35.459> week<00:02:36.420> power<00:02:36.719> banded<00:02:37.170> motor<00:02:37.439> of<00:02:37.799> you

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
that a week power banded motor of you

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.640 
that a week power banded motor of you
got<00:02:38.219> a<00:02:38.249> 16-9<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.180> half<00:02:39.359> almost<00:02:39.659> a<00:02:40.010> 17-second

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
got a 16-9 and a half almost a 17-second

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.809 
got a 16-9 and a half almost a 17-second
you<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.950> get<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.099> right<00:02:44.370> suspension

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
you have to get a right suspension

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.670 
you have to get a right suspension
tuning<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.569> car<00:02:45.810> nota<00:02:46.139> for<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.409> to<00:02:46.500> lay

down<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:47.069> power<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.109> I<00:02:49.109> just<00:02:49.950> didn't

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
down this power right and I just didn't

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.559 
down this power right and I just didn't
have<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.219> time<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> set<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.909> right

have the time to set it right

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.119 
have the time to set it right
that<00:02:53.109> I'm<00:02:53.230> looking<00:02:53.379> at<00:02:53.499> that<00:02:53.620> bump<00:02:53.799> rubber<00:02:54.040> you

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
that I'm looking at that bump rubber you

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:23.630 
that I'm looking at that bump rubber you
don't<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.459> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.820

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
214 in the full mile she did have the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.309 
214 in the full mile she did have the
legs<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.220> sort<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:28.000> pull<00:03:28.390> off<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.810> little<00:03:29.170> bit

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
legs to sort of a pull off a little bit

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.070 
legs to sort of a pull off a little bit

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.190 

25.8<00:03:35.080> 43<00:03:36.450> no<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.510> guess<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.870> could<00:03:38.019> call<00:03:38.140> that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
25.8 43 no you guess you could call that

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.300 
25.8 43 no you guess you could call that
good<00:03:38.530> but<00:03:38.970> yeah

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.059 

just<00:03:43.970> lighten<00:03:44.209> them<00:03:44.390> up

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.699 

it<00:03:48.549> is<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:48.760> fairly<00:03:49.060> easy<00:03:49.299> car<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.569> drive<00:03:49.659> but<00:03:50.200> as

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
it is a fairly easy car to drive but as

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.179 
it is a fairly easy car to drive but as
the<00:03:51.010> same<00:03:51.189> problem<00:03:51.430> here<00:03:51.819> as<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.239> did<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.480> the

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
the same problem here as I did on the

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.309 
the same problem here as I did on the
drag<00:03:54.189> races<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:55.510> engine<00:03:55.780> doesn't<00:03:55.930> lay<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
drag races the engine doesn't lay the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.259 
drag races the engine doesn't lay the
power<00:03:56.590> down<00:03:56.799> smoothly<00:03:57.219> it<00:03:57.609> bounces<00:03:58.120> around

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
power down smoothly it bounces around

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.449 
power down smoothly it bounces around
and<00:03:58.749> I<00:03:59.560> don't<00:03:59.709> know<00:03:59.799> that's<00:03:59.950> just<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.249> fact

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
and I don't know that's just the fact

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.940 
and I don't know that's just the fact
that<00:04:00.549> uh<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:01.659> know<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.900> has<00:04:02.019> 600<00:04:02.680> pound<00:04:02.829> feet

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
that uh you know it has 600 pound feet

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.110 
that uh you know it has 600 pound feet
of<00:04:03.069> torque<00:04:03.159> which<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.609> figured<00:04:03.909> it<00:04:03.969> would<00:04:04.060> be

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
of torque which I figured it would be

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.229 
of torque which I figured it would be
more<00:04:04.329> than<00:04:04.359> enough<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.810> pull<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.139> through<00:04:05.290> but

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
more than enough to pull it through but

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.879 
more than enough to pull it through but
no<00:04:07.239> I<00:04:07.269> really<00:04:07.540> don't<00:04:07.659> i<00:04:07.840> guess<00:04:07.989> i<00:04:08.230> just<00:04:08.530> had<00:04:08.859> to

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
no I really don't i guess i just had to

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.199 
no I really don't i guess i just had to
completely<00:04:09.250> wrong<00:04:09.459> since<00:04:09.670> pitch<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:09.969> set<00:04:10.090> up

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
completely wrong since pitch and set up

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.449 
completely wrong since pitch and set up
on<00:04:10.329> this<00:04:10.450> car<00:04:10.719> I<00:04:10.989> couldn't<00:04:11.859> get<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.129> to<00:04:12.219> stop

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
on this car I couldn't get it to stop

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.440 
on this car I couldn't get it to stop
and<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.180> very<00:04:13.269> tail<00:04:13.780> happy

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.710 

so<00:04:18.220> now<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:19.370> could<00:04:19.520> be<00:04:19.580> a<00:04:19.970> pretty<00:04:20.300> good<00:04:20.480> judge

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
so now this could be a pretty good judge

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.140 
so now this could be a pretty good judge
car<00:04:20.990> so<00:04:21.800> I<00:04:21.830> did<00:04:22.010> try<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.220> set<00:04:22.430> this<00:04:22.550> up<00:04:22.700> for<00:04:22.760> I

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
car so I did try to set this up for I

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.960 
car so I did try to set this up for I
came<00:04:23.420> close<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:23.750> that<00:04:24.050> wall<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.970> did

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
came close to that wall I did

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.520 
came close to that wall I did
try<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.120> set<00:04:26.330> this<00:04:26.450> up<00:04:26.600> for<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.870> know<00:04:26.960> as<00:04:27.410> much

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
try to set this up for you know as much

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.430 
try to set this up for you know as much
grip<00:04:27.890> as<00:04:28.010> possible<00:04:28.490> but<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:29.870> just<00:04:29.990> likes<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.290> be

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
grip as possible but it just likes to be

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.650 
grip as possible but it just likes to be
tail<00:04:30.650> happy

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.720 

it<00:04:37.140> is<00:04:37.320> fairly<00:04:37.530> easy<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.920> control<00:04:38.250> once<00:04:38.610> you

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
it is fairly easy to control once you

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.180 
it is fairly easy to control once you
get<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.030> hang<00:04:39.420> of<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.840> but<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.740> fact<00:04:40.980> that<00:04:41.040> you

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
get the hang of it but the fact that you

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.740 
get the hang of it but the fact that you
have<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.340> sit<00:04:41.550> there<00:04:41.670> and<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.910> know<00:04:42.030> work<00:04:42.540> at

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
have to sit there and you know work at

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.570 
have to sit there and you know work at
it<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:42.960> get<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.170> hang<00:04:43.290> of<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.560> which<00:04:44.460> is

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
it to get the hang of it which is

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.060 
it to get the hang of it which is
nothing<00:04:44.790> really<00:04:44.910> something<00:04:45.330> i<00:04:45.950> don't<00:04:46.950> know<00:04:46.980> i

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
nothing really something i don't know i

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.850 
nothing really something i don't know i
won't<00:04:47.400> have<00:04:47.580> patience<00:04:48.090> for<00:04:48.120> i<00:04:48.540> did<00:04:49.470> do<00:04:49.590> like

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
won't have patience for i did do like

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.310 
won't have patience for i did do like
maybe<00:04:50.220> two<00:04:50.460> or<00:04:50.490> three<00:04:50.640> laps<00:04:51.150> before<00:04:51.510> this<00:04:51.930> just

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
maybe two or three laps before this just

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
like it a try to get a good decent feel

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.459 
like it a try to get a good decent feel
of<00:04:55.140> it

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:56.469 
of it

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.719 
of it
there's<00:04:57.469> complete<00:04:58.249> couldn't<00:04:58.639> get

there's complete couldn't get

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:14.040 
there's complete couldn't get
anything<00:04:58.939> done

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.110 

remember<00:05:14.710> I'm<00:05:14.770> one<00:05:14.949> of<00:05:15.039> my<00:05:15.099> practice<00:05:15.580> that's

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
remember I'm one of my practice that's

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.610 
remember I'm one of my practice that's
what<00:05:16.270> I<00:05:16.360> was<00:05:16.509> doing<00:05:16.750> I<00:05:16.840> actually<00:05:16.930> drifted<00:05:17.470> that

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
what I was doing I actually drifted that

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.200 
what I was doing I actually drifted that
whole<00:05:17.770> little<00:05:17.889> section<00:05:18.400> right<00:05:18.430> there<00:05:18.580> big<00:05:19.150> man

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
whole little section right there big man

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.320 
whole little section right there big man
should<00:05:19.509> get<00:05:19.599> a<00:05:19.629> 44<00:05:20.530> barges<00:05:21.039> but<00:05:21.310> wasn't<00:05:22.150> what<00:05:22.240> I

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
should get a 44 barges but wasn't what I

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:36.580 
should get a 44 barges but wasn't what I
was<00:05:22.419> going<00:05:22.629> for

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.070 

you'll<00:05:37.220> hear<00:05:37.400> me<00:05:37.520> being<00:05:38.180> real<00:05:38.450> timid<00:05:38.870> on<00:05:38.960> the

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
you'll hear me being real timid on the

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.010 
you'll hear me being real timid on the
throttle

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.930 

and<00:05:45.440> you<00:05:45.650> can<00:05:45.770> kind<00:05:46.009> of<00:05:46.069> hear<00:05:46.250> it<00:05:46.400> sort<00:05:46.699> of<00:05:46.789> a

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
and you can kind of hear it sort of a

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.969 
and you can kind of hear it sort of a
word<00:05:47.150> it's<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:47.990> commoners<00:05:48.379> bouncing<00:05:48.800> up<00:05:48.860> and

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
word it's a commoners bouncing up and

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:59.170 
word it's a commoners bouncing up and
down<00:05:49.099> with<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.340> car<00:05:49.610> so

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.760 

but<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.720> right<00:05:59.900> setup<00:06:00.139> I'm<00:06:00.350> pretty<00:06:00.530> sure<00:06:00.650> this

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
but the right setup I'm pretty sure this

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.950 
but the right setup I'm pretty sure this
would<00:06:00.979> be<00:06:01.130> an<00:06:01.220> awesome<00:06:01.460> track<00:06:01.910> car<00:06:02.150> but<00:06:02.360> also<00:06:02.720> I

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
would be an awesome track car but also I

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.629 
would be an awesome track car but also I
think<00:06:03.050> it'd<00:06:03.259> be<00:06:03.410> a<00:06:03.440> better<00:06:03.650> a<00:06:03.800> drift<00:06:04.280> garden

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
think it'd be a better a drift garden

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.110 
think it'd be a better a drift garden
anything<00:06:05.000> now<00:06:05.990> he<00:06:06.050> can<00:06:06.199> make<00:06:06.289> it<00:06:06.440> look<00:06:06.620> good

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
anything now he can make it look good

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.360 
anything now he can make it look good
obviously<00:06:08.120> I<00:06:08.150> did<00:06:08.449> him<00:06:08.600> but<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:09.320> can<00:06:09.590> and<00:06:12.370> it's

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
obviously I did him but you can and it's

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:41.870 
obviously I did him but you can and it's
fairly<00:06:13.520> easy<00:06:13.669> to<00:06:13.970> get<00:06:14.240> swinging<00:06:14.720> out

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.670 

you<00:06:42.330> can<00:06:42.480> see<00:06:42.600> it<00:06:42.690> already<00:06:42.840> breaking<00:06:43.350> loose

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
you can see it already breaking loose

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.820 
you can see it already breaking loose
and<00:06:43.890> try<00:06:44.040> to<00:06:44.100> slide<00:06:44.490> a<00:06:45.420> little<00:06:45.740> bit<00:06:46.740> of

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
and try to slide a little bit of

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.850 
and try to slide a little bit of
corrective<00:06:47.280> breaking<00:06:47.700> right<00:06:47.880> there

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.980
