was<00:01:44.579> my<00:01:44.700> first<00:01:44.909> real<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.840> mean<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.470> did<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> lot<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
was my first real I mean I did a lot of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.499 
was my first real I mean I did a lot of
short<00:01:47.070> films<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.670> student<00:01:48.090> films<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
short films with all student films but I

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.749 
short films with all student films but I
had<00:01:48.630> never<00:01:48.780> done<00:01:48.960> anything<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.950> grand<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
had never done anything in that grand of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.270 
had never done anything in that grand of
a<00:01:50.790> scale

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
a scale

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.390 
a scale
before<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:52.360> how<00:01:52.810> do<00:01:52.869> you<00:01:52.990> feel<00:01:53.229> about<00:01:53.400> the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
before so how do you feel about the

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.770 
before so how do you feel about the
character<00:01:54.790> target<00:01:55.090> makes<00:01:55.270> itself<00:01:55.570> I<00:01:55.750> mean

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
character target makes itself I mean

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.380 
character target makes itself I mean
it's<00:01:56.080> such<00:01:56.260> like<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> anything<00:01:57.460> character<00:01:58.119> and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
it's such like a anything character and

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's such like a anything character and
really<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.260> would<00:01:59.680> assume<00:01:59.860> design<00:02:00.250> for<00:02:00.460> kids

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
really I would assume design for kids

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.760 
really I would assume design for kids
yeah<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.330> it's<00:02:01.420> kind<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.690> polarizing<00:02:02.229> at<00:02:02.650> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
yeah and it's kind of polarizing at the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.830 
yeah and it's kind of polarizing at the
time<00:02:03.250> yeah<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.670> polarization<00:02:04.119> really<00:02:04.630> came

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
time yeah the polarization really came

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.980 
time yeah the polarization really came
from<00:02:05.220> mostly<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.580> popular<00:02:07.090> news<00:02:07.300> media<00:02:07.659> and

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
from mostly a popular news media and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.550 
from mostly a popular news media and
their<00:02:08.229> agenda<00:02:08.410> with<00:02:09.220> George<00:02:09.520> Lucas<00:02:09.729> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
their agenda with George Lucas and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.070 
their agenda with George Lucas and
because<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.069> character<00:02:12.550> was<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:12.880> new<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.420> it

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
because the character was so new and it

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.430 
because the character was so new and it
was<00:02:14.230> very<00:02:14.440> easy<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.950> point<00:02:15.340> out<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.840> because

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
was very easy to point out and because

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.559 
was very easy to point out and because
it<00:02:17.590> didn't<00:02:17.920> fit<00:02:18.430> with<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.239> dark

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
it didn't fit with the the dark

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.440 
it didn't fit with the the dark
mythology<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.590> Star<00:02:20.980> Wars<00:02:21.220> lore<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:22.300> was<00:02:22.420> a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
mythology of Star Wars lore it was a

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.479 
mythology of Star Wars lore it was a
very<00:02:22.600> easy<00:02:22.720> character<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.350> pinpoint<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:24.040> use

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
very easy character to pinpoint and use

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.660 
very easy character to pinpoint and use
against<00:02:24.970> George<00:02:25.180> Lucas<00:02:25.630> but<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.800> know<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.550> I
