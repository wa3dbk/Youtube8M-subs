pipe it's in the off position as you can
see<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:41.760> forms<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> tee<00:00:42.360> against<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
see this one forms a tee against the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.770 
see this one forms a tee against the
pipe<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.350> means<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.860> off<00:00:44.360> what<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.570> does

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
pipe that means it's off what this does

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
pipe that means it's off what this does
is<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.079> shuts<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> gas<00:00:46.620> flow<00:00:46.920> off<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> unit

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
is it shuts the gas flow off to the unit

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.549 
is it shuts the gas flow off to the unit
which<00:00:47.940> eliminates<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> pilot<00:00:49.140> light<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
which eliminates the pilot light and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
which eliminates the pilot light and
shuts<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:50.340> completely<00:00:50.750> now<00:00:51.750> remember

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
shuts it down completely now remember

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.930 
shuts it down completely now remember
that<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.980> you're<00:00:53.100> coming<00:00:53.460> into<00:00:53.610> something

like this you're also typically dealing

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.410 
like this you're also typically dealing

the sediment out of the water heater
while<00:01:27.990> you're<00:01:28.140> doing<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.590> because<00:01:28.829> it'll

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
while you're doing this because it'll

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.980 
while you're doing this because it'll
create<00:01:29.400> kind<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> double<00:01:30.060> process<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.840> you

create kind of a double process for you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.469 
create kind of a double process for you
and<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.950> also<00:01:32.130> blows<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> valve<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.420> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and it also blows the valve out so it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
and it also blows the valve out so it
won't<00:01:33.600> plug<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.320> other<00:01:34.500> garbage<00:01:34.890> that

won't plug up with other garbage that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.440 
won't plug up with other garbage that
may<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> bottom<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.180> water

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
cool off the next thing that we do is

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.670 
cool off the next thing that we do is
get<00:02:19.810> our<00:02:20.560> crescent<00:02:21.189> wrench<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:22.680> we

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
get our crescent wrench and we

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.089 
get our crescent wrench and we
disconnect<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> lines<00:02:24.579> below<00:02:26.069> there<00:02:27.069> are

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
disconnect the lines below there are

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.399 
disconnect the lines below there are
three<00:02:27.519> separate<00:02:27.909> lines<00:02:28.150> one<00:02:28.689> a<00:02:28.719> pilot<00:02:29.200> line

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
three separate lines one a pilot line

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.240 
three separate lines one a pilot line
the<00:02:30.219> next<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.849> gas<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.109> main<00:02:32.290> gas<00:02:32.560> line<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the next a gas the main gas line the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.220 
the next a gas the main gas line the
third<00:02:33.519> is<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.760> thermocouple<00:02:34.420> which<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
third is the thermocouple which is a

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.199 
third is the thermocouple which is a
sensor<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.920> lets<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.310> unit<00:02:36.639> know<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.000> it's

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
sensor that lets the unit know that it's

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.879 
sensor that lets the unit know that it's
proving<00:02:37.629> flame<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.290> it's<00:02:38.409> okay<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.739> go

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
proving flame and that it's okay to go

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.860 
proving flame and that it's okay to go
ahead<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.189> turn<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.700> big<00:02:39.849> flame<00:02:40.180> it's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
ahead and turn on the big flame it's

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.509 
ahead and turn on the big flame it's
just<00:02:41.139> one<00:02:41.379> that<00:02:41.530> works<00:02:41.739> off<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.189> pilot

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
just one that works off of the pilot

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.059 
just one that works off of the pilot
itself<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.439> you<00:02:44.530> remove<00:02:44.799> all

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
itself so what you do is you remove all

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.940 
itself so what you do is you remove all
three<00:02:45.310> remembering<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.419> center<00:02:46.720> one

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
three remembering that the center one

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.379 
three remembering that the center one
especially<00:02:47.950> if<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.519> propane<00:02:49.030> will<00:02:49.269> be

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
especially if it's on a propane will be

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.569 
especially if it's on a propane will be
reverse-thread<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.739> will<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.129> to<00:02:51.340> spin

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
reverse-thread so you will have to spin

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.970 
reverse-thread so you will have to spin
it<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.819> other<00:02:51.970> direction<00:02:52.359> as<00:02:52.750> opposed<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.709> the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
it the other direction as opposed to the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.970 
it the other direction as opposed to the
standard<00:02:54.189> on/off<00:02:54.879> direction<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.470> be<00:02:56.680> aware<00:02:56.769> of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
standard on/off direction so be aware of

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.709 
standard on/off direction so be aware of
that<00:02:57.250> because<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.609> can<00:02:57.730> mess<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.269> gas<00:02:58.450> valve

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
that because you can mess the gas valve

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.959 
that because you can mess the gas valve
up<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.139> and<00:02:59.379> other<00:03:00.099> things<00:03:00.370> once<00:03:00.579> again<00:03:00.819> if

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
up and and other things once again if

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.129 
up and and other things once again if
you're<00:03:01.090> not<00:03:01.209> comfortable<00:03:01.689> with<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:01.959> you

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
you're not comfortable with this you

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.959 
you're not comfortable with this you
should<00:03:02.169> get<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> certified<00:03:03.040> technician<00:03:03.430> out

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:03.969 
should get a certified technician out

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.170 
should get a certified technician out
after<00:03:04.599> we<00:03:04.719> get<00:03:04.930> those<00:03:05.109> three<00:03:05.409> lines<00:03:05.620> removed

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
after we get those three lines removed

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.750 
after we get those three lines removed
we<00:03:07.180> come<00:03:07.389> over<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:09.700> remove<00:03:11.040> our<00:03:12.040> gas<00:03:12.400> line

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
we come over we remove our gas line

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.949 
we come over we remove our gas line
that's<00:03:13.269> hooked<00:03:13.510> in<00:03:15.030> by<00:03:16.030> simply<00:03:16.450> threading

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
that's hooked in by simply threading

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.379 
that's hooked in by simply threading
this<00:03:17.109> off<00:03:17.379> remember<00:03:18.129> our<00:03:18.280> gas<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:18.729> off<00:03:18.909> now<00:03:19.150> so

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
this off remember our gas is off now so

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.119 
this off remember our gas is off now so
there's<00:03:19.569> no<00:03:19.750> hazard<00:03:20.229> in<00:03:20.349> this<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.859> with<00:03:20.979> all

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
there's no hazard in this and with all

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.479 
there's no hazard in this and with all
of<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.400> removed<00:03:21.819> these<00:03:22.690> are<00:03:23.069> tough<00:03:24.069> too

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
of that removed these are tough too

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.449 
of that removed these are tough too
tough<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.329> get<00:03:25.449> out<00:03:25.629> it's<00:03:25.840> not<00:03:25.989> real<00:03:26.769> real<00:03:27.099> easy

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
tough to get out it's not real real easy

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.379 
tough to get out it's not real real easy
and<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:29.139> have<00:03:29.169> the<00:03:29.349> potential<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:30.389> bending

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
and you have the potential of bending

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.699 
and you have the potential of bending
and<00:03:31.479> breaking<00:03:31.599> things<00:03:32.079> if<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.379> don't<00:03:32.500> really

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
and breaking things if you don't really

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.800 
and breaking things if you don't really
know<00:03:32.829> what<00:03:33.069> you're<00:03:33.220> doing<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:33.819> basically<00:03:34.629> you

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
know what you're doing so basically you

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.319 
know what you're doing so basically you
get<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.959> really<00:03:35.169> big<00:03:35.409> wrench<00:03:35.939> you<00:03:36.939> go<00:03:37.090> across

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
get a really big wrench you go across

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.229 
get a really big wrench you go across
the<00:03:37.449> top<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:38.079> it<00:03:38.760> make<00:03:39.760> sure<00:03:39.909> it's<00:03:40.060> tight

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
the top of it make sure it's tight

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.159 
the top of it make sure it's tight
enough<00:03:40.449> that<00:03:40.510> it's<00:03:40.720> not<00:03:40.840> going<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.019> hurt

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
enough that it's not going to hurt

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.210 
enough that it's not going to hurt
anything<00:03:41.439> and<00:03:41.849> you<00:03:42.849> just<00:03:43.349> spin<00:03:44.349> it<00:03:44.500> off<00:03:44.650> you

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
anything and you just spin it off you

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.249 
anything and you just spin it off you
thread<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.669> out<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.150> after<00:03:47.019> you're<00:03:47.139> done

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:47.259 
thread it out and after you're done

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.809 
thread it out and after you're done
threading<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.769> out<00:03:47.919> remember<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.430> tank<00:03:48.669> is

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
threading it out remember the tank is

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.490 
threading it out remember the tank is
empty<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.239> look<00:03:49.419> in<00:03:49.599> there<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:50.229> see<00:03:50.409> if

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
empty you look in there to see if

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.199 
empty you look in there to see if
there's<00:03:50.709> any<00:03:50.889> kind<00:03:51.129> of<00:03:51.189> big<00:03:51.459> sediment<00:03:51.909> buildup

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
there's any kind of big sediment buildup

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.999 
there's any kind of big sediment buildup
if<00:03:52.389> there<00:03:52.599> is<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:52.989> strongly<00:03:53.349> recommended

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.009 
if there is it's strongly recommended

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.530 
if there is it's strongly recommended
that<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.159> think<00:03:54.430> about<00:03:54.669> replacing<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.359> water

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
that you think about replacing the water

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.080 
that you think about replacing the water
heater<00:03:55.810> itself<00:03:56.199> a<00:03:56.560> good<00:03:57.159> recommendation<00:03:57.400> is

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
heater itself a good recommendation is

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.999 
heater itself a good recommendation is
if<00:03:58.329> there<00:03:58.509> is<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.629> problem<00:03:58.989> with<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.439> gas<00:03:59.590> valve

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:00.009 
if there is a problem with the gas valve

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.249 
if there is a problem with the gas valve
it's<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.120> good<00:04:01.329> idea<00:04:01.479> to<00:04:01.720> think<00:04:01.989> about

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:02.259 
it's a good idea to think about

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.439 
it's a good idea to think about
replacing<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.979> whole<00:04:03.159> tank<00:04:03.579> itself<00:04:04.000> but

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
replacing the whole tank itself but

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.439 
replacing the whole tank itself but
these<00:04:04.689> are<00:04:04.900> pieces<00:04:05.169> and<00:04:05.500> parts<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.799> can<00:04:06.129> be

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
these are pieces and parts that can be

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.259 
these are pieces and parts that can be
switched<00:04:07.449> out<00:04:07.739> now<00:04:08.739> what<00:04:09.609> we<00:04:09.729> do<00:04:09.879> is<00:04:09.909> just

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
switched out now what we do is just

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.640 
switched out now what we do is just
rethread<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.930> new<00:04:11.139> one<00:04:11.290> in

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
rethread the new one in

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.140 
rethread the new one in
it'll<00:04:11.919> thread<00:04:12.129> in<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.459> clockwise<00:04:12.849> manner

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
it'll thread in and clockwise manner

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.289 
it'll thread in and clockwise manner
what<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.079> is<00:04:14.199> you<00:04:14.319> get<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.729> hand<00:04:15.729> tight<00:04:15.849> and

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
what you do is you get it hand tight and

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.699 
what you do is you get it hand tight and
then<00:04:16.659> you<00:04:16.750> go<00:04:16.870> ahead<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.259> give<00:04:17.349> it<00:04:17.470> another

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
then you go ahead and give it another

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.729 
then you go ahead and give it another
spin<00:04:17.979> around<00:04:18.599> don't<00:04:19.599> get<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.959> super<00:04:20.409> super

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
spin around don't get it super super

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.220 
spin around don't get it super super
tight<00:04:20.949> in<00:04:21.130> there<00:04:21.340> because<00:04:21.639> it's<00:04:21.820> some

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
tight in there because it's some

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.010 
tight in there because it's some
that<00:04:22.680> will<00:04:22.980> tear<00:04:23.670> up<00:04:23.880> if<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.600> get<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.840> super

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
that will tear up if you get it super

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.630 
that will tear up if you get it super
tight<00:04:25.170> in<00:04:25.500> there<00:04:25.650> plus<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.010> can<00:04:26.130> crush<00:04:26.370> the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
tight in there plus you can crush the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.180 
tight in there plus you can crush the
valve<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.470> many<00:04:28.470> different<00:04:28.650> things<00:04:28.920> that<00:04:29.070> you

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
valve and many different things that you

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.190 
valve and many different things that you
can<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.640> if<00:04:30.000> you<00:04:30.210> do<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.540> once<00:04:30.810> again<00:04:31.050> I'd

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
can do if you do this once again I'd

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.720 
can do if you do this once again I'd
recommend<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.920> get<00:04:32.040> a<00:04:32.100> certified<00:04:32.520> guy

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
recommend that you get a certified guy

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.600 
recommend that you get a certified guy
into<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.510> do<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.080> then<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.740> simply<00:04:34.950> hook

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
into to do this and then you simply hook

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.420 
into to do this and then you simply hook
the<00:04:35.790> thermocouple<00:04:36.390> back<00:04:36.540> in<00:04:37.040> hook<00:04:38.040> your<00:04:38.220> main

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
the thermocouple back in hook your main

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.980 
the thermocouple back in hook your main
tubing<00:04:38.940> actually<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.330> hook<00:04:39.450> your<00:04:39.570> main<00:04:39.750> tube

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
tubing actually you hook your main tube

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.630 
tubing actually you hook your main tube
in<00:04:40.170> first<00:04:40.440> because<00:04:40.770> it's<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.040> biggest<00:04:41.430> and

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
in first because it's the biggest and

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.950 
in first because it's the biggest and
easiest<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.060> get<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.240> wrench<00:04:42.450> on<00:04:42.600> when<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.840> do

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
easiest to get a wrench on when you do

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.390 
easiest to get a wrench on when you do
that<00:04:43.140> and<00:04:43.260> then<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.440> hook<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.800> thermocouple

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
that and then you hook the thermocouple

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.120 
that and then you hook the thermocouple
and<00:04:44.580> then<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.850> hook<00:04:45.030> your<00:04:45.500> pilot<00:04:46.500> tube<00:04:46.710> in<00:04:46.950> and

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
and then you hook your pilot tube in and

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.950 
and then you hook your pilot tube in and
then<00:04:47.520> go<00:04:48.360> ahead<00:04:49.730> you<00:04:50.730> install<00:04:51.150> reinstall<00:04:51.780> your

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
then go ahead you install reinstall your

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.180 
then go ahead you install reinstall your
nipple<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.530> pulled<00:04:52.710> out<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.040> other

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
nipple that you pulled out of the other

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.760 
nipple that you pulled out of the other
one<00:04:53.370> before<00:04:53.670> you<00:04:53.730> got<00:04:53.850> done<00:04:54.170> you<00:04:55.170> tighten<00:04:55.620> this

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
one before you got done you tighten this

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.370 
one before you got done you tighten this
in<00:04:56.040> and<00:04:56.340> this<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:57.030> flare<00:04:57.360> fitting<00:04:57.780> there

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
in and this is a flare fitting there

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.140 
in and this is a flare fitting there
should<00:04:58.650> be<00:04:58.800> no<00:04:59.040> teflon<00:04:59.940> tape<00:05:00.210> or<00:05:01.610> pipe<00:05:02.610> dope<00:05:02.910> on

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
should be no teflon tape or pipe dope on

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.300 
should be no teflon tape or pipe dope on
this<00:05:03.600> fitting<00:05:04.020> that's<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.350> flare<00:05:04.620> fitting<00:05:05.040> when

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
this fitting that's a flare fitting when

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.980
