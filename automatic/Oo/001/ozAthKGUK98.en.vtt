00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
but is there a feeling about what might

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.899 
but is there a feeling about what might
have<00:00:01.860> been<00:00:02.010> after<00:00:02.250> an<00:00:02.490> encouraging

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
have been after an encouraging

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.780 
have been after an encouraging
first-half<00:00:03.419> display<00:00:04.220> yeah<00:00:05.220> thought<00:00:05.460> we<00:00:05.609> paid

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
first-half display yeah thought we paid

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.629 
first-half display yeah thought we paid
very<00:00:06.029> good<00:00:06.330> first<00:00:06.660> half<00:00:07.280> second<00:00:08.280> half<00:00:08.370> was<00:00:08.580> a

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
very good first half second half was a

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.259 
very good first half second half was a
bit<00:00:08.880> more<00:00:09.059> racket<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.139> open<00:00:11.000> but<00:00:12.000> was<00:00:12.120> still

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
bit more racket and open but was still

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.209 
bit more racket and open but was still
had<00:00:12.420> some<00:00:12.570> incredible<00:00:12.719> chances<00:00:13.469> even<00:00:13.650> at<00:00:13.830> 11

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
had some incredible chances even at 11

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.260 
had some incredible chances even at 11
so<00:00:15.800> very<00:00:16.800> difficult<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.400> feed<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.730> take<00:00:17.910> after

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
so very difficult to feed to take after

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420 
so very difficult to feed to take after
having<00:00:18.630> played<00:00:18.810> quite<00:00:19.109> well<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.380> thought<00:00:19.650> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
having played quite well a thought and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.300 
having played quite well a thought and
certainly<00:00:21.029> worked<00:00:21.420> our<00:00:21.900> socks<00:00:22.140> off<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:23.039> 90

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
certainly worked our socks off for 90

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.980 
certainly worked our socks off for 90
minutes<00:00:23.490> but<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.269> wasn't<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> be<00:00:24.660> against<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
minutes but it wasn't to be against a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.800 
minutes but it wasn't to be against a
good<00:00:25.080> team<00:00:25.400> I'm<00:00:26.400> sure<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.240> players<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
good team I'm sure the players the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.320 
good team I'm sure the players the
feeling<00:00:28.500> very<00:00:28.650> low<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> moment<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.789> there

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
feeling very low at the moment but there

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.880 
feeling very low at the moment but there
are<00:00:30.480> lots<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.929> positives<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.410> take<00:00:31.650> from<00:00:31.769> that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
are lots of positives to take from that

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
are lots of positives to take from that
game<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.460> said<00:00:32.669> not<00:00:32.910> only<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.329> chances

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
game like you said not only the chances

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990 
game like you said not only the chances
we<00:00:34.170> had<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.920> general<00:00:35.340> football<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.760> open

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
we had but the general football in open

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.319 
we had but the general football in open
play<00:00:36.320> it<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> good<00:00:37.590> game<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.950> football<00:00:38.329> we

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
play it was a good game of football we

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.209 
play it was a good game of football we
need<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.540> keep<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.719> up<00:00:39.989> no<00:00:40.290> no<00:00:40.500> question<00:00:40.980> but

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
need to keep that up no no question but

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.940 
need to keep that up no no question but
it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> very<00:00:42.360> difficult<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.840> take<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it is very difficult to take some in the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.510 
it is very difficult to take some in the
position<00:00:44.340> where<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:44.850> points<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:46.520> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
position where we need points and and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.910 
position where we need points and and
with<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.270> performance<00:00:48.710> against<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.770> very

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
with that performance against a very

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
with that performance against a very
good<00:00:50.039> evidence<00:00:50.399> I'd<00:00:50.700> definitely<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.750> would

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
good evidence I'd definitely we would

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.950 
good evidence I'd definitely we would
hope<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.770> three<00:00:53.129> points<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.899> but<00:00:54.899> we

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
hope for three points of this but we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.660 
hope for three points of this but we
need<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> pick<00:00:55.260> ourselves<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.920> yes<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
need to pick ourselves up and yes I

searching to do now before the trip to
Aston<00:02:17.530> Villa<00:02:17.709> next<00:02:17.890> week<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.430> think<00:02:19.300> there's

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
Aston Villa next week I think there's

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.820 
Aston Villa next week I think there's
some<00:02:19.540> soul<00:02:19.750> searching<00:02:19.780> every<00:02:20.410> week<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.739> be

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
some soul searching every week to be

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.080 
some soul searching every week to be
fair<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.450> hard<00:02:22.630> situation<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.560> know

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
fair it's a hard situation but you know

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.520 
fair it's a hard situation but you know
you<00:02:25.090> can't<00:02:25.270> fold<00:02:25.569> any<00:02:25.780> players<00:02:26.080> effort<00:02:26.410> today

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
you can't fold any players effort today

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.160 
you can't fold any players effort today
I<00:02:26.650> think<00:02:27.209> with<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.239> bit<00:02:28.450> more<00:02:28.630> looking<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.140> bit

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
I think with a bit more looking a bit

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.130 
I think with a bit more looking a bit
more<00:02:29.440> skill<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.800> front<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.100> roll<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:31.050> could<00:02:32.050> be

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
more skill in front of roll it could be

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.690 
more skill in front of roll it could be
a<00:02:32.170> different<00:02:32.470> story<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.920> hopefully<00:02:33.280> that's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
a different story so hopefully that's

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.910 
a different story so hopefully that's
the<00:02:33.850> case<00:02:33.970> next<00:02:34.330> weekend<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:35.410> are<00:02:35.530> five

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the case next weekend and we are five

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.740 
the case next weekend and we are five
points<00:02:36.220> from<00:02:36.310> safety<00:02:36.400> with<00:02:36.970> six<00:02:37.239> games<00:02:37.450> still
