00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
really like on a simulator i can see

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:48.470 
really like on a simulator i can see
that<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.490> working<00:02:38.820> just<00:02:39.000> great<00:02:40.190> hello<00:02:41.190> okay

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
I can play this game I even marked a few

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.119 
I can play this game I even marked a few
buttons<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.569> they<00:02:54.780> are<00:02:54.989> they<00:02:55.860> are<00:02:55.950> working

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
buttons but they are they are working

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.509 
buttons but they are they are working
okay<00:02:59.120> well<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.330> really<00:03:00.930> hard<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.709> play<00:03:01.920> games

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
okay well it's really hard to play games

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.199 
okay well it's really hard to play games
without<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.360> hardware<00:03:04.140> keys<00:03:04.849> but<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:05.970> think

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
without the hardware keys but I think

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.089 
without the hardware keys but I think
how<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.799> will<00:03:07.799> find<00:03:08.069> some<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.849> some<00:03:09.860> some<00:03:10.860> games

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
how I will find some but some some games

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.550 
how I will find some but some some games
which<00:03:11.459> don't<00:03:12.209> need<00:03:12.480> me<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.349> press<00:03:13.620> 10<00:03:14.610> case<00:03:15.560> at

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
which don't need me to press 10 case at

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.420 
which don't need me to press 10 case at
the<00:03:16.650> same<00:03:16.829> time<00:03:17.040> ah<00:03:19.129> oh<00:03:20.129> my<00:03:20.489> god<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.940> wish<00:03:21.629> forget

the same time ah oh my god I wish forget

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:36.890 
the same time ah oh my god I wish forget
let<00:03:23.430> me<00:03:23.610> turn<00:03:24.269> off<00:03:25.670> turn<00:03:26.670> on<00:03:27.000> sound<00:03:27.660> master<00:03:28.530> boy

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:46.789 

a<00:03:39.799> little<00:03:40.799> bit<00:03:40.920> jerky<00:03:41.189> but<00:03:41.459> well<00:03:45.650> but<00:03:46.650> it's

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
a little bit jerky but well but it's

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:54.770 
a little bit jerky but well but it's
working<00:03:47.159> oh<00:03:52.400> also<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.670> see<00:03:53.939> that<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.180> have<00:03:54.299> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
working oh also you see that I have to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.800 
working oh also you see that I have to
use<00:03:55.260> mice<00:03:55.530> my<00:03:56.129> fingers<00:03:56.549> on<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.060> screen<00:03:57.180> on<00:03:57.599> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
use mice my fingers on the screen on the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.780 
use mice my fingers on the screen on the
working<00:03:59.120> on<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.390> working<00:04:00.540> place<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.549> will

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
working on the working place so it will

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.030 
working on the working place so it will
be<00:04:02.939> perfect<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.569> we<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.170> create<00:04:04.439> a<00:04:04.530> joystick

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
be perfect if we can create a joystick

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.089 
be perfect if we can create a joystick
here<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.180> while<00:04:06.359> we<00:04:06.540> pressing<00:04:07.049> buttons<00:04:07.620> here

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
here so while we pressing buttons here

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.089 
here so while we pressing buttons here
and<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.870> won't<00:04:10.109> affect<00:04:10.470> my<00:04:10.709> screen<00:04:13.040> now<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
and it won't affect my screen now the

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:21.400 
and it won't affect my screen now the
hardest<00:04:14.609> thing<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.560> have<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.739> jump

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.290 

yeah<00:04:22.410> that's<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.919> big<00:04:23.100> issue<00:04:23.300> playing

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
yeah that's the big issue playing

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:54.589 
yeah that's the big issue playing
without<00:04:25.430> hard<00:04:26.430> work<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:43.849> done<00:04:44.849> this<00:04:53.599> maybe

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
without hard work is done this maybe

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:03.560 
without hard work is done this maybe
there<00:04:54.930> is<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.080> way<00:04:55.199> to<00:04:55.380> make<00:04:55.889> some<00:04:56.449> thumb<00:05:02.539> well<00:05:03.539> a

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
there is a way to make some thumb well a

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.140 
there is a way to make some thumb well a
virtual<00:05:04.080> button<00:05:04.500> which<00:05:04.770> will<00:05:04.800> symbolize<00:05:05.550> for

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
virtual button which will symbolize for

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.020 
virtual button which will symbolize for
example<00:05:06.659> forward<00:05:07.349> and<00:05:07.560> X<00:05:08.220> so<00:05:08.729> I<00:05:09.260> won't<00:05:10.260> need<00:05:10.560> to

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
example forward and X so I won't need to

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:21.919 
example forward and X so I won't need to
to<00:05:12.030> make<00:05:12.330> this<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.840> game<00:05:13.770> impossible

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:21.929 

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:25.319 

okay<00:05:22.929> so<00:05:23.189> that's<00:05:24.189> what<00:05:24.429> I<00:05:24.549> wanted<00:05:24.909> to<00:05:25.089> tell<00:05:25.269> you

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:25.329 
okay so that's what I wanted to tell you

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:28.529 
okay so that's what I wanted to tell you
about<00:05:25.569> this<00:05:25.869> emulator<00:05:27.059> it's<00:05:28.059> pretty<00:05:28.329> perfect

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
about this emulator it's pretty perfect

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.879 
about this emulator it's pretty perfect
thing<00:05:28.959> I<00:05:30.179> really<00:05:31.179> could<00:05:31.389> play<00:05:31.599> some<00:05:32.259> games<00:05:32.589> and

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
I saw an emulator of ps1 on the windows

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.439 
I saw an emulator of ps1 on the windows
mobile<00:06:04.809> phone<00:06:05.319> just<00:06:06.039> how<00:06:06.339> this<00:06:06.579> tiny<00:06:06.999> small

mobile phone just how this tiny small
device<00:06:07.839> could<00:06:08.229> play<00:06:08.529> um<00:06:09.239> could<00:06:10.239> emulate<00:06:10.449> the

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
device could play um could emulate the

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:13.469 
device could play um could emulate the
whole<00:06:10.989> console<00:06:11.529> game<00:06:11.849> but<00:06:12.849> now<00:06:12.999> I<00:06:13.029> see<00:06:13.449> that

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
whole console game but now I see that

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.779 
whole console game but now I see that
it's<00:06:13.779> working<00:06:14.019> and<00:06:14.409> it's<00:06:15.129> working<00:06:15.309> pretty

controls<00:06:22.539> it's<00:06:23.019> perfectly<00:06:23.589> working<00:06:24.099> from<00:06:24.610> my

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
controls it's perfectly working from my

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.399 
controls it's perfectly working from my
point<00:06:24.969> of<00:06:25.149> view<00:06:25.209> because<00:06:25.360> I<00:06:25.569> have<00:06:25.869> a<00:06:25.899> high<00:06:26.139> FPS

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409
