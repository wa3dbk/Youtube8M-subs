00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
hallway we're going you know it's more

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.549 
hallway we're going you know it's more
of<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> maintenance<00:00:59.910> hallway<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.629> we're<00:01:01.440> going

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
of a maintenance hallway so we're going

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.619 
of a maintenance hallway so we're going
to<00:01:01.620> incorporate<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.460> lighting<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.390> seems

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to incorporate a lighting that seems

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.530 
to incorporate a lighting that seems
appropriate<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.350> such<00:01:04.589> an<00:01:04.739> environment<00:01:05.540> our

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
appropriate in such an environment our

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
appropriate in such an environment our
first<00:01:06.810> step<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> guide<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.650> player<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
first step is to guide the player to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.890 
first step is to guide the player to
where<00:01:08.640> he<00:01:08.850> needs<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
where he needs to go which is the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500 
where he needs to go which is the
shipping<00:01:10.320> area<00:01:10.530> down<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.100> hallway<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:12.360> can

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
shipping area down this hallway we can

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
shipping area down this hallway we can
accomplish<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.650> multitude<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.310> ways

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
accomplish this in a multitude of ways

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.560 
accomplish this in a multitude of ways
for<00:01:15.180> example<00:01:15.619> controlled<00:01:16.619> shadowing<00:01:17.570> notice
