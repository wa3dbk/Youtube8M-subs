around even makes it more incredible so
when<00:01:26.689> we<00:01:26.810> heard<00:01:27.049> our<00:01:27.229> guests<00:01:27.470> say<00:01:27.710> they<00:01:27.920> wanted

that<00:01:28.400> kind<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.880> uniqueness<00:01:29.299> we<00:01:29.930> thought<00:01:30.140> that

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
that kind of uniqueness we thought that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.080 
that kind of uniqueness we thought that
this<00:01:30.560> was<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.890> perfect<00:01:31.100> place<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.700> give<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:31.970> to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
this was the perfect place to give it to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.469 
this was the perfect place to give it to
him<00:01:32.200> so<00:01:33.200> I<00:01:33.500> think<00:01:34.399> it's<00:01:34.520> time<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.759> really<00:01:35.149> make

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
him so I think it's time to really make

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.100 
him so I think it's time to really make
the<00:01:35.630> official<00:01:37.150> forward<00:01:38.150> go<00:01:38.510> backwards<00:01:38.990> so

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
the official forward go backwards so

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.870
