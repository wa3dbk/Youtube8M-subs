00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
the belt was kind of loose on the motor

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.620 
the belt was kind of loose on the motor

so I'm gonna have to adjust the motor
place<00:01:22.049> front<00:01:27.830> take<00:01:28.830> a<00:01:28.860> look<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.399> serial

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
place front take a look at the serial

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.710 
place front take a look at the serial
number<00:01:30.330> here<00:01:31.190> see<00:01:32.190> if<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.429> can<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.000> turned

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
number here see if I can get it turned

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.600 
number here see if I can get it turned
around<00:01:36.440> serial<00:01:37.440> number<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:38.190> one<00:01:39.090> six<00:01:39.479> six<00:01:40.610> six

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
around serial number is one six six six

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.999 
around serial number is one six six six
nine<00:01:43.220> BS<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.899> think<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> makers<00:01:46.380> data<00:01:46.679> plate

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
nine BS I think the makers data plate

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
nine BS I think the makers data plate
would<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.369> been<00:01:47.520> right<00:01:47.729> here<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.450> it's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
would have been right here but it's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:58.120 
would have been right here but it's
missing

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.189
