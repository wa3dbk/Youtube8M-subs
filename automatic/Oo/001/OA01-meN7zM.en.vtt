00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
inches of suspension travel and it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.620

really comes down to throttle control
just<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.260> too<00:01:46.380> much<00:01:46.440> power<00:01:46.830> for<00:01:47.190> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
just really too much power for the
