00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
you do not need to go twin motors what a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.710 
you do not need to go twin motors what a
lot<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.399> people<00:01:19.580> don't<00:01:19.820> realize<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:20.450> not

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
lot of people don't realize it's not

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.450 
lot of people don't realize it's not
only<00:01:21.289> for<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> security<00:01:22.039> and<00:01:22.160> a<00:01:22.220> safety

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
only for a security and a safety

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.850 
only for a security and a safety
scenario<00:01:23.060> by<00:01:23.270> having<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.630> backup<00:01:23.869> engine<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.740> go

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
scenario by having a backup engine to go

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.719 
scenario by having a backup engine to go
with<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.220> it's<00:01:25.970> also<00:01:26.479> for<00:01:26.840> maneuverability<00:01:27.729> so

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
with it it's also for maneuverability so

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.529 
with it it's also for maneuverability so
simply<00:01:29.119> by<00:01:29.270> sticking<00:01:29.780> one<00:01:30.380> motor<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.860> Reverse

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
simply by sticking one motor in Reverse

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.990 
simply by sticking one motor in Reverse
one<00:01:32.539> motor<00:01:32.810> in<00:01:33.020> forward<00:01:33.580> we<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.729> actually

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
one motor in forward we can actually

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.760 
one motor in forward we can actually
spend<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:35.420> much<00:01:35.690> this<00:01:35.959> whole<00:01:36.170> boat<00:01:36.440> around

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
spend this much this whole boat around

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.490 
spend this much this whole boat around
in<00:01:37.310> 360<00:01:38.000> degrees<00:01:38.360> in<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.840> length<00:01:39.050> of<00:01:39.200> its<00:01:39.349> own

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
in 360 degrees in the length of its own

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.179 
in 360 degrees in the length of its own
bow

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
bow

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.359 
bow
so<00:01:40.700> for<00:01:40.999> maneuverability<00:01:41.479> in<00:01:41.929> a<00:01:42.020> mooring<00:01:42.409> in<00:01:43.189> a

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
so for maneuverability in a mooring in a

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.349 
so for maneuverability in a mooring in a
tight<00:01:43.719> mooring<00:01:44.719> scenario<00:01:45.200> like<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.590> marina

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
tight mooring scenario like a marina

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.609 
tight mooring scenario like a marina
twin<00:01:47.359> motors<00:01:47.780> work<00:01:47.960> really<00:01:48.289> really<00:01:48.469> well<00:01:50.619> one

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
twin motors work really really well one

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.319 
twin motors work really really well one
thing<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.859> really<00:01:52.159> like<00:01:52.340> about<00:01:52.369> stable<00:01:53.090> graphs

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
thing I really like about stable graphs

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.419 
thing I really like about stable graphs
is<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.350> driving<00:01:54.799> position<00:01:54.950> in<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
is the the driving position in the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.639 
is the the driving position in the
layout<00:01:55.819> inside<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.359> cabin<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:57.380> got<00:01:57.500> plenty

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
layout inside the cabin you got plenty

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.589 
layout inside the cabin you got plenty
of<00:01:57.799> room<00:01:58.069> it<00:01:58.399> feels<00:01:58.609> like<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> very<00:01:59.000> spacious

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
of room it feels like a very spacious

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.719 
of room it feels like a very spacious
sort<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.170> thing<00:02:00.349> but<00:02:00.679> it's<00:02:01.219> a<00:02:01.310> very<00:02:01.549> strong

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
sort of thing but it's a very strong

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.660 
sort of thing but it's a very strong
scenario<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:02.990> when<00:02:03.560> you're<00:02:03.709> in<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:03.950> real

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
scenario so when you're in that real

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.609 
scenario so when you're in that real
nasty<00:02:04.939> scenario<00:02:05.599> you're<00:02:05.840> copping<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.170> few<00:02:06.380> over

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
nasty scenario you're copping a few over

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.339 
nasty scenario you're copping a few over
the<00:02:06.649> top<00:02:07.149> nothing<00:02:08.149> like<00:02:08.420> being<00:02:08.629> in<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.899> hardtop

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
the top nothing like being in a hardtop

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.500 
the top nothing like being in a hardtop
the<00:02:09.860> layout<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.459> dashboard<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:11.209> all

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
the layout of the dashboard it's all

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.380 
the layout of the dashboard it's all
there<00:02:11.750> right<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.290> front<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.650> you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
there right in front of you

units<00:02:25.040> quickly<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.670> easily<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.720> there's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
units quickly and easily and there's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.750 
units quickly and easily and there's
nothing<00:02:27.709> more<00:02:27.890> comfortable<00:02:28.370> than<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.640> way

nothing more comfortable than the way

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.680 
nothing more comfortable than the way
out<00:02:28.970> we've<00:02:29.150> got<00:02:29.180> it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.350 

the<00:02:35.140> stabi<00:02:35.530> crafts<00:02:35.830> are<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.190> very<00:02:36.640> strong<00:02:37.060> boat

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
the stabi crafts are a very strong boat

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.410

but<00:02:38.080> they're<00:02:38.230> also<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.590> very<00:02:38.890> safe<00:02:39.250> way<00:02:39.420> they've

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
but they're also a very safe way they've

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.330 
but they're also a very safe way they've
obviously<00:02:40.570> got<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:41.080> lot<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.380> inbuilt<00:02:41.770> buoyancy

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
