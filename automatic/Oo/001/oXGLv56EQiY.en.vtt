00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.560 
the what I guess will be the patches for
panini<00:05:37.250> coming<00:05:37.670> up<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.970> really<00:05:38.300> sweet

looking<00:05:39.880> stitching<00:05:40.880> so<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.240> patches<00:05:41.630> are

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
looking stitching so the patches are

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.350 
looking stitching so the patches are
going<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.080> really<00:05:42.320> be<00:05:42.410> popping<00:05:42.890> out<00:05:43.360> and

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
going to really be popping out and

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.080 
going to really be popping out and
actually<00:05:45.320> this<00:05:45.770> area<00:05:46.280> it's<00:05:46.730> kind<00:05:46.940> of<00:05:46.970> like
