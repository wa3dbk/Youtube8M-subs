checked with the other vials so I chose

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.639 
checked with the other vials so I chose
this<00:01:49.070> specific<00:01:50.030> color<00:01:50.360> because<00:01:50.960> we're

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
this specific color because we're

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.859 
this specific color because we're
transitioning<00:01:52.340> into<00:01:52.520> fall<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:52.909> I<00:01:53.689> just

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
transitioning into fall and I just

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.529 
transitioning into fall and I just
wanted<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.289> darker<00:01:54.649> color<00:01:54.920> on<00:01:55.250> myself<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:56.060> I

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
wanted a darker color on myself and I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.319 
wanted a darker color on myself and I
also<00:01:56.659> chose<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.710> new<00:01:58.100> T<00:01:58.250> series<00:01:58.520> because<00:01:59.060> I've

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
also chose the new T series because I've

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.499 
also chose the new T series because I've
tried<00:01:59.569> super<00:02:00.079> nudy<00:02:00.380> pink<00:02:00.829> before<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.700> super

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
tried super nudy pink before and super

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.450 
tried super nudy pink before and super
nudy<00:02:02.810> is<00:02:03.140> just<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:03.799> larger<00:02:04.429> size<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:06.799> still

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
nudy is just a larger size and I still

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.430 
nudy is just a larger size and I still
wanted<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.789> keep<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.239> natural<00:02:08.479> looking<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.410> I

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
wanted to keep it natural looking so I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.070 
wanted to keep it natural looking so I
went<00:02:09.709> with<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.920> regular<00:02:10.429> new<00:02:10.670> t1<00:02:11.060> which<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.540> 14

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
went with a regular new t1 which is 14

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.460 
went with a regular new t1 which is 14
millimeters<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.420> diameter<00:02:14.810> 14

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
millimeters so that is the diameter 14

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.039 
millimeters so that is the diameter 14
millimeters<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:17.000> brand<00:02:17.269> of<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.750> circle

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
millimeters and the brand of the circle

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.600 
millimeters and the brand of the circle
lenses<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.500> GTL<00:02:18.890> like<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:19.220> mentioned<00:02:19.430> before

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
lenses is GTL like I mentioned before

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.830 
lenses is GTL like I mentioned before
and<00:02:20.239> they<00:02:21.049> are<00:02:21.440> now<00:02:21.709> fda<00:02:22.220> approved<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.030> also

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
and they are now fda approved and also

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.990 
and they are now fda approved and also
by<00:02:24.079> canada<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.799> water<00:02:24.980> content<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.610> only

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
by canada the water content is only

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.390 
by canada the water content is only
thirty-eight<00:02:26.599> percent<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.349> I<00:02:28.010> guess<00:02:28.160> that's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
thirty-eight percent and I guess that's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.580 
thirty-eight percent and I guess that's
understandable<00:02:28.579> since<00:02:29.209> it's<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.079> more<00:02:30.319> smaller

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
understandable since it's a more smaller

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.160 
understandable since it's a more smaller
circle<00:02:31.220> lens<00:02:31.340> base<00:02:31.819> curve<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.630> usual<00:02:32.810> base

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
circle lens base curve is the usual base

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.490 
circle lens base curve is the usual base
curve<00:02:33.470> which<00:02:33.739> is<00:02:33.769> 8.6<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.299> far<00:02:35.540> already<00:02:35.810> tried

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
curve which is 8.6 so far already tried

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.530 
curve which is 8.6 so far already tried
the<00:02:36.739> super<00:02:37.069> nudy<00:02:37.280> serious<00:02:37.730> like<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.000> said<00:02:38.239> and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the super nudy serious like I said and

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.170 
the super nudy serious like I said and
that<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.799> another<00:02:40.250> reason<00:02:40.370> why<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.819> chose<00:02:41.120> this

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
that is another reason why I chose this

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.900 
that is another reason why I chose this
brand<00:02:41.660> because<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:42.319> remember<00:02:43.160> them<00:02:43.400> being

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
brand because I remember them being

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.390 
brand because I remember them being
really<00:02:44.750> really<00:02:44.930> comfortable<00:02:45.260> compared<00:02:46.160> to

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
really really comfortable compared to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.300 
really really comfortable compared to
other<00:02:46.880> psycho<00:02:47.150> lenses<00:02:47.630> I've<00:02:47.810> tried<00:02:48.019> and<00:02:48.680> that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
other psycho lenses I've tried and that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.879 
other psycho lenses I've tried and that
is<00:02:49.459> very<00:02:49.519> true<00:02:49.760> for<00:02:50.299> these<00:02:50.540> ones<00:02:50.780> too<00:02:51.139> so<00:02:51.709> for

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
is very true for these ones too so for

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.490 
is very true for these ones too so for
the<00:02:51.950> comfort<00:02:52.310> i<00:02:52.459> would<00:02:52.639> say<00:02:52.819> 505<00:02:53.510> maybe<00:02:54.079> in<00:02:54.470> the

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
the comfort i would say 505 maybe in the

the comfort i would say 505 maybe in the
first<00:02:54.920> few<00:02:55.160> hours<00:02:55.370> i<00:02:55.639> would<00:02:55.790> feel<00:02:56.030> some

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
the design part of it you can see that

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.890 
the design part of it you can see that
there's<00:03:10.069> like<00:03:10.310> little<00:03:10.609> specks<00:03:11.090> all<00:03:11.329> around

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
there's like little specks all around

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.199 
there's like little specks all around
and<00:03:12.760> from<00:03:13.760> afar<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.480> looks<00:03:14.540> very<00:03:15.190> natural

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
and from afar it looks very natural

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.479 
and from afar it looks very natural
looking<00:03:17.209> because<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:18.319> all<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.980> specs<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.430> gray

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
looking because it all the specs of gray

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.879 
looking because it all the specs of gray
would<00:03:19.970> just<00:03:20.269> blend<00:03:20.810> in<00:03:21.079> together<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.709> just

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
would just blend in together and just

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.640 
would just blend in together and just
make<00:03:22.160> like<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.430> circle<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.060> grey<00:03:23.380> but<00:03:24.380> when

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
make like a circle of grey but when

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.979 
make like a circle of grey but when
you're<00:03:24.769> closer<00:03:25.040> up<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.750> definitely<00:03:26.750> does<00:03:26.959> not

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
you're closer up it definitely does not

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.050 
you're closer up it definitely does not
look<00:03:27.139> natural<00:03:27.829> there's<00:03:28.040> like<00:03:28.250> specs<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:29.000> gray

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
look natural there's like specs of gray

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.930 
look natural there's like specs of gray
everywhere<00:03:29.739> from<00:03:30.739> their<00:03:31.069> website<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.730> says

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
everywhere from their website it says

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.059 
everywhere from their website it says
that<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.359> is<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.750> number<00:03:33.019> one<00:03:33.230> choice<00:03:33.440> for

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
that this is the number one choice for

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.250 
that this is the number one choice for
sparkling<00:03:35.060> eyes<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.630> was<00:03:35.930> especially

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
sparkling eyes it was especially

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.250 
sparkling eyes it was especially
designed<00:03:36.709> for<00:03:37.069> a<00:03:37.250> model<00:03:37.700> in<00:03:37.880> Japan<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.959> guess

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
designed for a model in Japan so I guess

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.370 
designed for a model in Japan so I guess
that<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.700> really<00:03:40.700> special<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:41.870> an<00:03:42.049> okay

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
that is really special it's an okay

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.870 
that is really special it's an okay
design<00:03:42.769> i'm<00:03:43.010> not<00:03:43.190> going<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.370> say<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:43.730> the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
design i'm not going to say it's the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.780 
design i'm not going to say it's the
best<00:03:43.910> or<00:03:44.480> not<00:03:44.750> i<00:03:45.049> think<00:03:45.590> i'm<00:03:45.980> gonna<00:03:46.099> go<00:03:46.310> for<00:03:46.579> the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
best or not i think i'm gonna go for the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.720 
best or not i think i'm gonna go for the
more<00:03:46.970> natural<00:03:47.209> type<00:03:47.689> ones<00:03:47.989> now<00:03:48.319> going<00:03:49.040> forward

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
more natural type ones now going forward

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.570 
more natural type ones now going forward
uh<00:03:50.209> this<00:03:50.810> one<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.140> semi-natural<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:52.220> would<00:03:52.370> say

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
uh this one is semi-natural I would say

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.500 
uh this one is semi-natural I would say
it's<00:03:52.970> not<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.870> like<00:03:54.769> dolly<00:03:55.340> looking<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.299> it's

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
it's not to like dolly looking and it's

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.710 
it's not to like dolly looking and it's
not<00:03:56.750> too<00:03:57.370> natural<00:03:58.370> looking<00:03:58.730> it's<00:03:59.060> kind<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.510> in

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
not too natural looking it's kind of in

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.960 
not too natural looking it's kind of in
between<00:03:59.870> for<00:04:00.709> enlargement<00:04:01.099> this<00:04:01.760> would

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
between for enlargement this would

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.440 
between for enlargement this would
definitely<00:04:02.120> be<00:04:02.830> very<00:04:03.830> low<00:04:04.069> because<00:04:04.299> it's<00:04:05.299> only

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
definitely be very low because it's only

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.960 
definitely be very low because it's only
14<00:04:05.870> millimeters<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:07.269> even<00:04:08.269> roasts<00:04:09.970> contacts

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
14 millimeters and even roasts contacts

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.410 
14 millimeters and even roasts contacts
I<00:04:11.180> think<00:04:11.420> our<00:04:11.739> 14.2<00:04:12.739> millimeters<00:04:13.580> I'm<00:04:14.209> not

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
I think our 14.2 millimeters I'm not

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.590 
I think our 14.2 millimeters I'm not
sure<00:04:14.480> on<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:14.930> ah<00:04:15.699> so<00:04:16.699> this<00:04:16.850> is<00:04:17.060> about<00:04:17.389> the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
sure on that ah so this is about the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.199 
sure on that ah so this is about the
size<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.049> regular<00:04:18.229> contact<00:04:18.889> it's<00:04:19.820> not<00:04:20.000> very

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
size of a regular contact it's not very

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.360 
size of a regular contact it's not very
large<00:04:20.690> inning<00:04:21.019> it's<00:04:21.229> just<00:04:21.590> maybe<00:04:21.979> a<00:04:22.130> different

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
large inning it's just maybe a different

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.879 
large inning it's just maybe a different
color<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:23.150> because<00:04:23.750> it's<00:04:23.930> great<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.470> doesn't

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
color and because it's great it doesn't

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.920 
color and because it's great it doesn't
show<00:04:24.979> up<00:04:25.520> as<00:04:26.530> obviously<00:04:27.530> as<00:04:28.039> maybe<00:04:28.820> blue<00:04:29.300> or

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
show up as obviously as maybe blue or

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.930 
show up as obviously as maybe blue or
green<00:04:30.470> because<00:04:31.039> of<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.280> little<00:04:31.580> specks<00:04:31.789> in

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
green because of the little specks in

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.650 
green because of the little specks in
the<00:04:32.090> design<00:04:32.479> it's<00:04:32.930> pretty<00:04:33.440> much<00:04:34.449> gets<00:04:35.449> that

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
the design it's pretty much gets that

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.510 
the design it's pretty much gets that
sparkling<00:04:36.229> effect<00:04:36.590> that<00:04:36.830> they<00:04:36.979> were<00:04:37.039> talking

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
sparkling effect that they were talking

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.090 
sparkling effect that they were talking
about<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:39.169> don't<00:04:39.229> really<00:04:39.470> count<00:04:39.710> as<00:04:39.919> a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
about but I don't really count as a

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.150 
about but I don't really count as a
sparkling<00:04:40.610> I've<00:04:41.300> asked<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.930> friend<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.470> she

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
sparkling I've asked a friend and she

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.279 
sparkling I've asked a friend and she
said<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.820> just<00:04:44.030> looks<00:04:44.300> like<00:04:44.479> little<00:04:44.750> specks<00:04:45.110> in

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
said it just looks like little specks in

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.930 
said it just looks like little specks in
my<00:04:45.470> eyes<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.680> little<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.280> polka<00:04:46.550> dots<00:04:46.760> or

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
my eyes a little like polka dots or

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.810 
my eyes a little like polka dots or
something<00:04:47.330> but<00:04:48.289> like<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.220> said<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.699> don't

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
something but like I said you don't

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.520 
something but like I said you don't
really<00:04:50.000> notice<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.539> until<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.930> get<00:04:51.320> really

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
really notice that until you get really

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.010 
really notice that until you get really
close<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:52.130> someone's<00:04:52.580> eyes<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.720> don't

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
close to someone's eyes and I don't

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.990 
close to someone's eyes and I don't
think<00:04:54.200> people<00:04:54.349> really<00:04:54.620> stare<00:04:55.400> at<00:04:55.639> your<00:04:55.789> eyes

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
think people really stare at your eyes

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.080 
think people really stare at your eyes
so<00:04:56.630> all<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:57.110> really<00:04:57.979> love<00:04:58.160> these<00:04:58.370> deco<00:04:58.700> lenses

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
so all I really love these deco lenses

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.860 
so all I really love these deco lenses
they<00:04:59.300> are<00:04:59.750> comfortable<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:01.039> that<00:05:01.130> is<00:05:01.750> what<00:05:02.750> is

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
they are comfortable and that is what is

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.589 
they are comfortable and that is what is
number<00:05:03.229> one<00:05:03.590> for<00:05:03.979> me<00:05:04.039> because<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.610> have<00:05:04.880> dry<00:05:05.210> and

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
number one for me because I have dry and

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.740 
number one for me because I have dry and
sensitive<00:05:05.780> eyes<00:05:06.430> so<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.910> is<00:05:08.240> a<00:05:08.270> really<00:05:08.570> big

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
sensitive eyes so that is a really big

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.390 
sensitive eyes so that is a really big
factor<00:05:09.229> when<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.410> comes<00:05:09.650> to<00:05:09.770> circle<00:05:10.070> lenses

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
factor when it comes to circle lenses

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.460 
factor when it comes to circle lenses
which<00:05:11.000> are<00:05:11.180> known<00:05:11.419> for<00:05:11.720> not<00:05:11.900> being<00:05:12.229> that

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
which are known for not being that
