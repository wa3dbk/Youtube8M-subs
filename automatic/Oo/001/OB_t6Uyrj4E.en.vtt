00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 she hosted the channel performing today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.089
 about this today we are going to make a video 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.450
 bit different a little bit about 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.170
 processors in their differences is 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.070
 using it then is enough 4g maybe up to 1 600 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.020
 the galaxy s3 species 23 years with 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.960
 different processing versions 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.380
 total is we have a captive audience that is the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.710
 cpu hill that shows the characteristics 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 of each concessionaire Mario environment 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.280
 some interesting features to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.450
 are all open in your code to 1.9 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.460
 from Bahia am 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 and there it shows some information 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.129
 such as the process that has been 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.910
 128 kilometers the smaller the number 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.670
 the better the processor is 62 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.860
 stj is 28 also because this here is the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.050
 This four-wheeled snapdragon is a 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:04.860
 21 from alcorta and moved to 1,049 mars 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.670
 He's 45 so he's the stench today. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.619
 aa relation to their devices GPU 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 dantas and 21 400 of 1 305 and amália 400 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.630
 also in those with less capacity 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.820
 but at my gpu table 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.770
 so I and people get very attached to 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.950
 processing issue is not 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.630
 quad core nagô court recommended today in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.290
 same time period already has a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.450
 nice experience with android but the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.689
 processor in one of the cores and 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.049
 lemon frequency is what defines the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.729
 final processing power is one thing 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.070
 For example, this is a new 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.510
 point 2 and can not rope and the difference of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.800
 Eliza 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.800
 Fred thinks he can get here. 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.330
 I think it generated every score 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.530
 comparing here the action was only once 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.590
 better summoned 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.590
 the emotion of each time 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:13.920
 then cpu and hit the pilot in 5 thousand 38 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.220
 6 thousand and that these in 1511 s4 while 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.170
 messi grew 4203 1.100 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.290
 So you can see my difference in 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.230
 only issue of CPU processing 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.860
 then henry we are tac graphics 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:36.030
 s4 also has a much higher gpu to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.519
 443 since it is a case of 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.459
 interesting as they live well at 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.239
 difference of these processors is a 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.700
 engine only 200 meters in difference 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.549
 but are we the difference of punctuation 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.970
 due to the architecture and also the size 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.840
 not previously explaining then the cpu 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.989
 with 1,692 in 1609 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.510
 so it is much better than with more 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.849
 three thousand sheets of paper 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.329
 proved it here is already much higher 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:14.340
 chairs so show a difference in 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.540
 I had that mother 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.870
 with more points 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.750
 from 3 of an apparatus lower than the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.090
 general sense one day like this is more with 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.340
 the latest processing is the 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.370
 the case of speaking is the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.670
 galaxy in which it can choose the point 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.180
 2 but that's how it is there 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.230
 are 9.33 thousand and other assets based 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.910
 in a 15 but in an oversight that the galaxy in 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.640
 2004 hour 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.300
 but the culture without control mark less 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.970
 that the galaxy express can do 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.630
 to vote in the test but it's about love and 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.760
 youtube is more or less compliant galera 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.780
 since then open putin is 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.030
 will 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.120
 any doubt any comment not 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.670
 do not forget write current also mother 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.530
 to continue your facebook page 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.569
 facebook.com an android chat and not 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:16.280
 follow on twitter that the ine 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.280
 modernity greetings big hug
