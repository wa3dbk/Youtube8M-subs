 of your press but 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.599
 as much give it a name that matches 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.539
 to the theme of the site so I'm going 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.370
 call it wordpress tests let's go 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.979

 use to to connect for 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.720
 security questions I advise you 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.419
 to put here a little more terms 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.819
 originals that allowed us your first name 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.330
 I'll call it for example wpk 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:11.199
 death press essays and I put all three 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.300
 random numbers idem I would put a 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.900
 secure password you see them 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.979
 instructions that are next to 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.440
 actually allocated a level of 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.800
 sufficient security to this password 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.449
 security was really a subject 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.199
 important 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.270
 someone coming back to your site 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.460
 can do a lot of things can 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.229
 recover lost passwords can 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.479
 access the databases of your 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.360
 customers can obviously alter the 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.650
 voting content it's it starts with 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.419
 set up passwords a 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.419
 little bit complicated so we go 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.820

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.050

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.970
 to recover the password 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:07.170
 if you ever lose it ditto I'll 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:09.060
 call it wordpress testing and we are 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.580
 party here we ask you to configure 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.600
 a database do not be afraid you 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.650
 just enter a description he 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.120
 is the same as just now 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.610
 After the wordpress tests, the EU puts 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:31.260

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:32.910
 the one you have 6 6 just now 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.650
 leave the table prefix or as we 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.800
 you propose it and you click on 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:41.700
 continue directory we do not 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.820
 do not occupy click continue and 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.990
 it's gone you install wordpress 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.990
 so you see here 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.340
 the installation ran your name 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.770
 domain is good and it's pulled 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.840
 brest.com so the domain name that 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.540
 you have weighings is very important 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.250
 you have here 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.360

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.510
 drunkards points like database is 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.140
 being created so you have to 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.800
 to wait a little 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.750
 to freshen his page until the 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.880
 database be created and from 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.010

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.990
 of passion and and wait between 5 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.370
 and 10 minutes 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.530
