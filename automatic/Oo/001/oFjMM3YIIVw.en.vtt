00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
just drag that copy it right into there

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.710 
just drag that copy it right into there
it's<00:02:43.480> fairly<00:02:43.780> small<00:02:44.200> once<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.800> done<00:02:45.720> let's

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
or here so what we can do is take the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.430 
or here so what we can do is take the
auto<00:05:23.720> rip<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.230> compress<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:25.060> come<00:05:26.060> at<00:05:26.330> it

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
drag and drop it right there so then we

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.510 
drag and drop it right there so then we
can<00:05:29.810> even<00:05:29.990> rename<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.680> something<00:05:30.890> even

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
can even rename it to something even

looks like it took it again you got to

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.820 
looks like it took it again you got to
be<00:05:52.070> careful<00:05:52.250> unchecking<00:05:52.850> a<00:05:53.240> lot<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.810> boxes<00:05:54.230> you

be careful unchecking a lot of boxes you

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.470 
be careful unchecking a lot of boxes you
have<00:05:54.890> to<00:05:55.070> experiment<00:05:55.550> sometimes<00:05:55.940> media

centers<00:05:56.750> to<00:05:56.900> do<00:05:57.020> itself<00:05:57.290> will<00:05:57.530> crash<00:05:57.800> other

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
centers to do itself will crash other

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.560 
centers to do itself will crash other
times<00:05:58.400> when<00:05:58.610> you<00:05:58.700> try<00:05:58.850> to<00:05:58.970> launch<00:05:59.210> media

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
times when you try to launch media

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.360 
times when you try to launch media
center<00:05:59.870> after<00:06:00.170> you've<00:06:00.320> added<00:06:00.440> it<00:06:00.770> it<00:06:01.160> will

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
center after you've added it it will

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.940

just<00:06:01.550> crash<00:06:01.790> altogether<00:06:02.300> also<00:06:02.740> so<00:06:03.740> let's

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
just crash altogether also so let's

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.740

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
we've got it skinned and we've

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.000 
we've got it skinned and we've
customized<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.580> menus<00:06:07.970> it<00:06:08.300> should<00:06:08.870> be<00:06:09.170> pretty

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
customized the menus it should be pretty

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
darn close to done we're going to use

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.920

that Media Center studio in the future

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.990 
that Media Center studio in the future
in<00:06:15.050> future<00:06:15.380> videos<00:06:15.710> when<00:06:15.980> we<00:06:16.130> get<00:06:16.280> into<00:06:16.430> adding

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
in future videos when we get into adding

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.740 
in future videos when we get into adding
streaming<00:06:17.480> services<00:06:18.020> into<00:06:18.350> this<00:06:18.470> interface

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
streaming services into this interface

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.300 
streaming services into this interface
so<00:06:20.750> as<00:06:20.900> you<00:06:21.020> can<00:06:21.170> see<00:06:21.380> actually<00:06:21.620> it<00:06:21.980> did<00:06:22.190> not

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
so as you can see actually it did not

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.340 
so as you can see actually it did not
take<00:06:22.610> it<00:06:22.820> and<00:06:22.970> there<00:06:23.420> is<00:06:23.510> a<00:06:23.540> reason<00:06:23.990> for<00:06:24.020> that

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
take it and there is a reason for that

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.400 
take it and there is a reason for that
so<00:06:24.730> let's<00:06:25.730> I'll<00:06:26.240> show<00:06:26.510> you<00:06:26.570> how<00:06:26.780> to<00:06:26.810> how<00:06:27.170> to<00:06:27.200> get

desktop for now and open it and what
they<00:06:47.340> did<00:06:47.520> is<00:06:47.730> that<00:06:47.910> basically<00:06:48.600> gets<00:06:48.870> rid<00:06:49.050> of

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
they did is that basically gets rid of

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.900 
they did is that basically gets rid of
some<00:06:49.290> system<00:06:49.740> directories<00:06:50.250> that<00:06:50.400> Microsoft

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
some system directories that Microsoft

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.250 
some system directories that Microsoft
keeps<00:06:51.180> writing<00:06:51.600> and<00:06:51.690> that<00:06:51.780> overrides

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
keeps writing and that overrides

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.620 
keeps writing and that overrides
everything<00:06:53.160> that<00:06:53.310> we<00:06:53.430> do<00:06:53.610> so<00:06:54.120> in<00:06:54.270> theory<00:06:54.540> that

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
everything that we do so in theory that

everything that we do so in theory that
should<00:06:54.810> have<00:06:55.080> worked<00:06:55.850> you<00:06:56.850> can<00:06:57.060> put<00:06:57.270> that<00:06:57.390> into

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
should have worked you can put that into

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.990 
should have worked you can put that into
