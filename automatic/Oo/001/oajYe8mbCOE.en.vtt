to<00:01:52.670> get<00:01:52.730> a<00:01:52.820> gold<00:01:54.310> seems<00:01:55.310> very<00:01:55.460> difficult

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
to get a gold seems very difficult

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.340

though see their aim for headshots and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.770 
though see their aim for headshots and
probably<00:02:00.890> go<00:02:01.130> negative<00:02:01.370> or<00:02:01.820> do<00:02:02.330> really<00:02:02.600> good

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
probably go negative or do really good
