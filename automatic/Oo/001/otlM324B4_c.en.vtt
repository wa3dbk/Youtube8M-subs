00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:10.139
 [Music] 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.980
 for this craft we are going to need 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:22.550
 silk paper a cork pot scissors 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.550
 pencil skewers chopsticks and candies 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.330
 As you can see we have started cutting the 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.850
 cork tailored to the mouth of the 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.400
 flower pot 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.400
 we will fit it to be fixed 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.549
 [Music] 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.579
 with the tissue paper what are we going to 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.269
 do is cut the squares to 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.870
 cover the surface of the cork and that 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.010
 look like a skirt 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.010
 [Music] 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.679
 [Music] 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.150
 we're going to put the tips 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.380
 worked to make it more decorative 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.040
 and you see the two colors 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.870
 [Music] 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.330
 Here I show you how we have done the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.240
 different flowers here for example you see 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.060
 a flower made with a roll of licorice and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.750
 two melons as leaves 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.750
 [Music] 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.600
 here for example you see this clover done 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.600
 with three hearts 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.420
 and the leaves are the curved worms 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.230
 [Music] 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.400
 for the little ones that we have made 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.500
 with the chopsticks we have used a 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.180
 candy coin and a watermelon like 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.880
 You see, it's very simple 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.940
 for example a heart also serves 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.510
 like flower and a curved banana too 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.510
 as a leaf 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.759
 this sheet for example we have made it with 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.759
 a little slice of sponge 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.660
 Here I show you for example two mushrooms 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.040
 made with blackberries and the base is medium 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:32.360
 egg or a kiss 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:32.360
 [Music] 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.330
 [Music] 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.120
 here those children another very simple 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.680
 also with a green jelly like flower 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 and a brick like leaves 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.230
 [Music] 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.930
 is for example is one of the most 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.360
 complicated to make the leaves are two 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.000
 watermelons and I'm going to show you how he has done 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.370
 the flower 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.250
 This flower is made with 4 strawberries 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.910
 this type 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.750
 curved as I show you 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.540
 and united as now I am going to teach you the 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.180
 I have sewn with thread that I have taken from a 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.030
 Licorice roll like this 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.120
 I have undone it 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.459
 and with the help of the toothpick we would have 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.130
 that pierce the candy and with the tip 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.320
 of licorice 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.200
 we are going to introduce it into these 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.010
 Holes is as if we wanted but 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.010
 with licorice thread 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.400
 it costs a little bit because the goodies 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.310
 they are very sticky 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.030
 but if we do well the hole is going to 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.030
 be easier 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.599
 [Music] 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.450
 You see , we would have a little leaf 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.790
 the same procedure to pass 4 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.349
 leaves and then in sharp we would do the 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.349
 skewer and we would stay this way 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.770
 the skewer sticks we have 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.270
 cut so they do not stay that long and 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.890
 therefore as they have no tip we 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.210
 we help with the stick to do the 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:34.490
 hole and can place it 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:37.580
 [Music] 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.610
 Another model I show you I have done with 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.060
 a blackberry and a tongue 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.230
 wrapped around 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.230
 [Music] 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.230
 another way to cover the cork is in 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.140
 place to cut two square curl 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:02.300
 tissue paper tapes as if it were 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.300
 gift ribbon as you see here 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:11.190
 [Music] 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.689
 and with the help of a pin simply 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.239
 when pricking and masters on the cork 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.879
 it stays curly and is a bit more 

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:22.129
 showy are two different forms of 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.229
 cover it as you see is very simple 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.629
 you can invent all the models that 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.789
 I leave here ye the idea os 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.540
 I remember in crafts point is you have 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:39.370
 all instructions and templates 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:39.370
