so the engineer has a lot of different
versatility<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.290> him<00:00:55.559> he's<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.399> turrets<00:00:56.610> he

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
turrets down he has different abilities

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
turrets down he has different abilities
he<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.360> where<00:01:00.780> he<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.020> blow<00:01:01.200> up<00:01:01.379> the

he can do where he can blow up the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.690 
he can do where he can blow up the
turrets<00:01:01.800> or<00:01:01.920> she<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.190> make<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> turrets

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
turrets or she can make the turrets

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700 
turrets or she can make the turrets
overload<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.899> they<00:01:04.019> start<00:01:04.259> firing<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.589> whole

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
overload and they start firing a whole

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
overload and they start firing a whole
bunch<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> times<00:01:05.129> rapidly<00:01:05.579> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.789> they

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
bunch of times rapidly and then they

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
bunch of times rapidly and then they
fall<00:01:06.060> apart<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> lot<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.350> different

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
fall apart so you get a lot of different

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380 
fall apart so you get a lot of different
gameplay<00:01:07.979> elements<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> those<00:01:08.940> basic

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
gameplay elements out of those basic

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
gameplay elements out of those basic

skills and the abilities that come with
the<00:01:11.790> engineer<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> first<00:01:13.290> thing

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409

have<00:01:27.000> two<00:01:27.150> choices<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.750> either<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> for

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
have two choices we either do it for

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.679 
have two choices we either do it for
real<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.580> at<00:01:29.700> all<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.240> we

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
real or we don't do it at all and we

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.969 
real or we don't do it at all and we
want<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.290> real<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.799> look

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
want to do it for real and if you look

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.289 
want to do it for real and if you look
at<00:01:32.070> most<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.430> games<00:01:32.580> that<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.909> underwater

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
at most other games that have underwater

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.910 
at most other games that have underwater
combat<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:33.810> underwater<00:01:34.080> areas<00:01:34.350> they're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
combat or underwater areas they're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.740 
combat or underwater areas they're
usually<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.400> tacked<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> end<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.600> go

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
usually like tacked on at the end you go

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.880 
usually like tacked on at the end you go
in<00:01:36.900> them<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.320> really<00:01:37.560> enjoy<00:01:37.710> being

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
in them and you don't really enjoy being

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.170 
in them and you don't really enjoy being
there<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:38.700> got<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
there you're like I got to get out of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.520 
there you're like I got to get out of
the<00:01:39.240> water<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.570> fast<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.290> part

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the water as fast as I can this part

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.850 
the water as fast as I can this part
sucks<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.330> we<00:01:42.600> tailor<00:01:43.020> made<00:01:43.229> our<00:01:43.560> game

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
sucks and so we we tailor made our game

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.340 
sucks and so we we tailor made our game
to<00:01:44.070> take<00:01:44.220> advantage<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.939> underwater<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.200> when

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
to take advantage of underwater so when

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.560 
to take advantage of underwater so when
you<00:01:46.470> jump<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.860> underwater<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.400> our<00:01:47.520> game<00:01:47.670> your

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you jump on underwater in our game your

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
you jump on underwater in our game your
weapon<00:01:48.900> skills<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.619> switch<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.400> have

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
weapon skills actually switch to have

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
weapon skills actually switch to have
new<00:01:50.880> abilities<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> take<00:01:51.720> advantage<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> z

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
new abilities to take advantage of the z

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
new abilities to take advantage of the z
axis<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:52.920> available<00:01:53.400> for<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.299> for

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
axis you have available for you so for

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.550 
axis you have available for you so for
example<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.810> engineer<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> talked<00:01:55.470> about

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
example the engineer I talked about

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.469 
example the engineer I talked about
earlier<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.310> gets<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> harpoon<00:01:56.909> gun<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.270> he<00:01:57.329> can

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
earlier it gets a harpoon gun and he can

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.389 
earlier it gets a harpoon gun and he can
shoot<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.750> net<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> expands<00:01:58.680> out<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> 3d

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
shoot a net that expands out in the 3d

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.310 
shoot a net that expands out in the 3d
space<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.880> traps<00:02:00.299> creatures<00:02:00.689> inside<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> net

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
space and traps creatures inside the net

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.649 
space and traps creatures inside the net
he<00:02:02.220> has<00:02:02.340> explosive<00:02:02.880> devices<00:02:03.119> he<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.450> fire

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
he has explosive devices he can fire

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.149 
he has explosive devices he can fire
that<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> timer<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.470> they<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.770> out<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:04.950> they

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
that on a timer and they go out and they

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.039 
that on a timer and they go out and they
sit<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.640> explode<00:02:06.240> he<00:02:06.390> has<00:02:06.509> mines<00:02:06.750> he<00:02:06.930> can

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
sit in the explode he has mines he can

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.960 
sit in the explode he has mines he can
drop<00:02:07.259> he<00:02:07.860> has<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> lot<00:02:08.159> of<00:02:08.189> abilities<00:02:08.640> he<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.879> do

drop he has a lot of abilities he can do
that<00:02:09.149> takes<00:02:09.360> advantage<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> fact<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.079> we

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
that takes advantage of the fact that we

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.490 
that takes advantage of the fact that we
have<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.499> whole<00:02:10.739> z<00:02:10.919> axis<00:02:11.249> of

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
have this whole z axis of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.440 
have this whole z axis of
to<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.890> I'm<00:02:12.310> some<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.790> other<00:02:12.940> professions

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
to you I'm some of the other professions

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.850 
to you I'm some of the other professions
have<00:02:13.570> abilities<00:02:14.020> where<00:02:14.200> they<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.410> put<00:02:14.590> chains

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
have abilities where they can put chains

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.200 
have abilities where they can put chains
around<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.250> guy<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.760> they<00:02:15.820> get<00:02:15.970> dragged<00:02:16.180> down

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
around a guy and they get dragged down

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.700 
around a guy and they get dragged down
to<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> ocean<00:02:16.690> floor<00:02:16.870> or<00:02:17.230> they<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.440> trap<00:02:17.620> them

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
to the ocean floor or they can trap them

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.290 
to the ocean floor or they can trap them
in<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.920> bubble<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.610> raises<00:02:18.790> them<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.210> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
in a bubble and it raises them up to the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.330 
in a bubble and it raises them up to the
top<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.690> ocean<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.650> we<00:02:20.800> really<00:02:21.070> want<00:02:21.220> to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
top of the ocean so we really want to

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.700 
top of the ocean so we really want to
use<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.760> full<00:02:22.240> 3d<00:02:22.630> space<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.140> develop

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
use that full 3d space and develop

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.470 
use that full 3d space and develop
skills<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.250> were<00:02:24.340> perfectly<00:02:24.820> designed<00:02:25.030> for

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
skills that were perfectly designed for

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.780 
skills that were perfectly designed for
doing<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.650> underwater<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.250> huge<00:02:27.550> part

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
doing that so underwater is a huge part

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.370 
doing that so underwater is a huge part
of<00:02:27.850> our<00:02:27.940> game<00:02:28.180> you're<00:02:28.600> going<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.780> explore<00:02:29.230> it

of our game you're going to explore it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.240 
of our game you're going to explore it
down<00:02:29.530> there<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.860> going<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.040> run<00:02:30.160> into

down there and you going to run into

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.860 
down there and you going to run into
content<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:30.970> have<00:02:31.060> all<00:02:31.180> sorts<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.480> dynamic

events<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.290> are<00:02:32.380> happening<00:02:32.410> underwater

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
events that are happening underwater

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.860 
events that are happening underwater
there<00:02:33.550> are<00:02:33.670> full<00:02:33.820> underwater<00:02:34.270> cities<00:02:34.660> and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
there are full underwater cities and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.510 
there are full underwater cities and
races<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.380> live<00:02:35.500> entirely<00:02:35.830> underwater<00:02:36.220> in

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
races and live entirely underwater in

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.790 
races and live entirely underwater in
the<00:02:36.550> game<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.600> it's<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.840> key<00:02:38.110> part<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.500> our<00:02:38.620> game

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800
