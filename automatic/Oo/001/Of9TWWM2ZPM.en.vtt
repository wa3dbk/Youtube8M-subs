00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
there is a pretty big difference I mean
seriously<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.239> put<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.770> whoops<00:00:39.290> if

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
seriously if we just put the whoops if

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.100 
seriously if we just put the whoops if
we<00:00:40.440> put<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> malevolence<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.700> add<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.690> at

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
we put the malevolence and add it and at

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.729 
we put the malevolence and add it and at
the<00:00:43.290> length<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> Star<00:00:44.309> Destroyer

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
the length of it to the Star Destroyer

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.900 
the length of it to the Star Destroyer
