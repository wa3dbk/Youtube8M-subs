00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
into strength and conditioning you can

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
into strength and conditioning you can
do<00:00:49.320> movements<00:00:49.950> where<00:00:50.730> you're<00:00:50.879> supporting

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449

do movements where you're supporting
weight<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.530> knee<00:00:52.680> isn't<00:00:52.829> really

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
weight but your knee isn't really

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
weight but your knee isn't really
bending<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> first<00:00:54.480> things<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
bending so one of the first things you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.160 
bending so one of the first things you
might<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.079> back<00:00:55.170> into<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> barbell

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
might get back into is a like a barbell

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.270 
might get back into is a like a barbell
RDL<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.440> I'm<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.680> bending<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> hip

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
RDL where I'm just bending at the hip

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
RDL where I'm just bending at the hip
and<00:00:59.489> my<00:00:59.699> knee<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.059> relatively<00:01:00.750> straight<00:01:01.109> oh

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and my knee is relatively straight oh

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
and my knee is relatively straight oh
I'm<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.850> putting<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.270> lot<00:01:03.420> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
I'm not really you know putting a lot of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.719 
I'm not really you know putting a lot of
stress<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:03.960> knee<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.350> mostly<00:01:04.650> hip<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> my

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
stress on my knee it's mostly hip and my

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.250 
stress on my knee it's mostly hip and my
knee<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.240> having<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.570> stabilize<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
knee is just having to stabilize that

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
knee is just having to stabilize that
position<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.400> movements<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.390> are

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
position so so movements like that are

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.640 
position so so movements like that are
one<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.930> first<00:01:10.080> things<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.380> you'll<00:01:10.560> be

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
are coming forward and then in like this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.160 
are coming forward and then in like this
because<00:02:54.209> that's<00:02:54.390> how<00:02:54.540> people<00:02:54.720> tear<00:02:54.959> their<00:02:55.110> ACL

so you want to be here where my knees

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.220 
so you want to be here where my knees
are<00:02:57.720> out<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.610> even<00:02:59.610> if<00:02:59.790> I'm<00:02:59.940> even<00:03:00.900> if<00:03:01.110> I'm

straight back up and there's less stress

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.250 
straight back up and there's less stress
on<00:03:08.580> your<00:03:08.760> knee<00:03:08.940> when<00:03:09.480> your<00:03:09.600> knee<00:03:09.720> stays<00:03:10.019> out
