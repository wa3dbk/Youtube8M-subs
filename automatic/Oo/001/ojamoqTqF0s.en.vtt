bi-directional carbon weep I don't know
if<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> can<00:01:23.549> see<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.560> sorry<00:01:25.560> for

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's very quiet also creates a sturdy

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.810 
it's very quiet also creates a sturdy
blade<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.530> thing<00:01:34.799> another<00:01:35.549> thing

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
blade so that's one thing another thing

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.590 
blade so that's one thing another thing
is<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> lower<00:01:36.540> kick<00:01:36.900> point<00:01:37.229> then<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> 195<00:01:38.600> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
is the lower kick point then the 195 the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
is the lower kick point then the 195 the
problem<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> higher<00:01:40.409> kid<00:01:40.710> point<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.189> me

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
problem of the higher kid point for me

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
problem of the higher kid point for me
is<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.329> go<00:01:42.860> really<00:01:43.860> hard

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
is that I would like to go really hard

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
is that I would like to go really hard
snappers<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.090> when<00:01:45.600> de<00:01:45.750> Kipling's<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> little

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
snappers and when de Kipling's a little

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.039 
snappers and when de Kipling's a little
bit<00:01:46.829> higher<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.340> shot<00:01:47.610> goes<00:01:48.240> off<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
bit higher the shot goes off more so a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.370 
bit higher the shot goes off more so a
lower<00:01:49.439> kick<00:01:50.100> point<00:01:50.369> cook<00:01:50.880> gives<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
lower kick point cook gives more of a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.340 
lower kick point cook gives more of a
consistent<00:01:52.979> accuracy<00:01:53.630> as<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.170> on

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
consistent accuracy as you can see on

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
consistent accuracy as you can see on
the<00:01:55.470> top<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.979> knob<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.700> carbon<00:01:57.329> fiber

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the top of the knob the carbon fiber

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.700 
the top of the knob the carbon fiber
actually<00:01:58.020> galls<00:01:58.710> goes<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.149> around

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
actually galls goes all the way around

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.209 
actually galls goes all the way around
from<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> blade<00:02:02.540> all<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.990> way<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
from the blade all the way up to this to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.830 
from the blade all the way up to this to
the<00:02:05.340> end

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
the end

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.529 
the end
here<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.859> that's<00:02:07.070> pretty<00:02:07.310> good<00:02:07.490> ah<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.300> weight

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
here so that's pretty good ah the weight

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.170 
here so that's pretty good ah the weight
I<00:02:08.899> mean<00:02:09.530> it's<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.830> pretty<00:02:10.129> light<00:02:10.399> stick<00:02:10.879> but

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
I mean it's a pretty light stick but

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.290 
I mean it's a pretty light stick but
it's<00:02:11.330> not<00:02:11.569> very<00:02:11.780> well<00:02:12.050> balanced<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:13.060> wish<00:02:14.060> to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
it's not very well balanced I wish to

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.839 
it's not very well balanced I wish to
blade<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:15.349> this<00:02:15.379> area<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.400> wish<00:02:16.670> they

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
blade like this area here I wish they

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.979 
blade like this area here I wish they
can<00:02:17.090> made<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.750> like<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.319> 195<00:02:19.750> make<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.930> a

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
can made it like the 195 make this a

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.830 
can made it like the 195 make this a
special<00:02:21.410> type<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:21.920> light<00:02:22.340> foam<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.090> then<00:02:23.629> like

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
special type of light foam and then like

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.350 
special type of light foam and then like
reduce<00:02:24.319> reduce<00:02:25.280> material<00:02:25.849> there<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.330> a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
reduce reduce material there for a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.369 
reduce reduce material there for a
better<00:02:27.049> balance<00:02:27.799> but<00:02:28.370> weight<00:02:29.150> wise<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.660> decent

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
better balance but weight wise is decent

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.339 
better balance but weight wise is decent
i<00:02:30.470> think<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:30.830> around<00:02:30.920> like<00:02:31.900> 450<00:02:33.640> 430<00:02:34.640> ish

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
i think it's around like 450 430 ish

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.420 
i think it's around like 450 430 ish
yeah<00:02:36.349> um<00:02:38.470> durability<00:02:39.470> wise<00:02:40.010> ah<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:41.140> say<00:02:42.140> it's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
yeah um durability wise ah I say it's

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.089
