00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.290
 among the many people who have lost their heads for lamborghini there is also a 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.630
 an admirer of exception, he is always in love with valerio merola 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.789
 of sports cars tells us how his love was born which are his 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.380
 favorite models and how he managed to personalize these by chance like 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.930
 he himself defines the related accessories that have become special for valeria 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.980
 my love for lamborghini beyond the passion I always have 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.350
 had for the supercar you absolutely lamborghini represents 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.339
 one of these cars 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.760
 it was also for a professional reason 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.149
 in fact the thirty years of lamborghini was celebrated and there would have been a 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.300
 big event. The factory can be seen at the Sant'Agata Bolognese 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.059
 el president then kimberly president 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.500
 he turned to a dear friend of mine 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.220
 he worked in the factory 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.009
 wondering if there was an Italian presenter 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.149
 let it be a presenter we say of the known television but 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.289
 above all that he had competence 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.180
 of machines and the choice 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.360
 fell on me 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.260
 and I must say that it was one of the most beautiful days in my life in Persia 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.070
 professional 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.050
 why me 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.359
 you have to admire and present 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.480
 some of the most beautiful work 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.530
 some even came from Japan from the United States we do not speak then of 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.090
 those 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 who arrived from emilia europe 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.430
 let's say both read and binary 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.010
 and passions both for sports cars and pierrette of the bull's boat 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.750
 then it became perhaps also for this occasion my favorite brand and da 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.230
 there the purchase 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.720
 of the red diablo 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.610
 then 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.890
 the off-road vehicle was the first off-road vehicle of great power 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.660
 came out on the market 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.090
 mtb-o always followed the bull factory 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.339
 in all his and so 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.449
 we also say vicissitudes because 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.389
 so many properties have changed so many things have changed up to the current one 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.470
 change i love market success after being successful 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.619
 purchased by the audi 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:31.919
 falling in love 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.219
 with the gall 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.259
 just gallardo 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.899
 was presented and I suffered 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.969
 I told him inside me hime 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.789
 I have to buy this too 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.609
 because I liked it immediately but waited 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.009
 the golf cabrio model 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.009
 because my passion for supercar you closely 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.779
 related to cartridges for me 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.219
 supercar must be open because the emotion it is 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.839
 I repeat it again when this type of car does not run 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.349
 the wind in your hair is something 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.620
 and then with a whole series of customizations because I am 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.919
 party of customizations and therefore also the gallardo became special 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:24.289
 dvb-t fine limp bizkit 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.759

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.890
 there is a gem 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.010
 if you allow me that maybe not all 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.200
 shoes arno king thought to have losses 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.189
 just born at lamborghini 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.669
 I 8 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.989
 this particular obvious 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.330
 type of shoes connects from school suitable for the driving that also leads 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.640
 the trademark that fights on the specia formal machine would mean us 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.670
 that + special I say yes you can't congrats 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.279
 but 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.049
 smartbox 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.039
 TGCOM 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.349
 gmail turbine farm 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.149
 but you have noticed that those who are fond of lamborghini 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:16.389
 max and spread coach avant-garde how to say cars 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.819
 lamborghini I always love my teeth and also those who buy them 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.919
 I find that they are customers and enthusiasts who have a little taste of preceding the 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:31.610
 taste the taste of proceeding the tastes xd all the others f la lazio is a 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.250
 car that even now seems futuristic indeed two to all 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.560
 duration effects absolutely a line 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.800
 ultras as the diablo with his 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:49.590
 sport and that they open to dance well it seems a space object that gradually 

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:52.649
 maybe the only lamborghini are a little bit 

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:58.289
 we say telepiÃ¹ uniformed to the style sent say mini-futuristic 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.849
 they are the actual ones we say perhaps the gallardo because it has a style 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.259
 very strict eat my aunt is worked 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.490
 that climate that temperament that old pennette line lamborghini here 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.919
 I would say that 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.059
 film cinema 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:18.800
 dry lamborghini thickness because at eight o'clock of the unique personality 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.089
 movie 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.439
 maybe you can confuse a Ferrari or another brand despite being a car 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.400
 wonderful 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.190
 but the very difficult if not impossible to confuse a lamborghini
