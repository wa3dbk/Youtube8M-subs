game where I can adapt to just about any
fight<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:36.390> quickly<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:37.079> where<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> guy<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
do whatever I need to want to find I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.910 
do whatever I need to want to find I
think<00:01:45.259> someone<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> improve<00:01:46.710> about

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
think someone like to improve about

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.690 
think someone like to improve about
boxing<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.180> regulations<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
boxing is the regulations I think the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.120 
boxing is the regulations I think the
sport<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.149> still<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.570> very<00:01:51.840> corrupt<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.619> think

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
sport can still be very corrupt I think

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.700 
sport can still be very corrupt I think
there<00:01:53.280> needs<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.880> natural<00:01:54.710> national

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
there needs to be a natural national

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.999 
there needs to be a natural national
committee<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.369> oversees<00:01:56.990> fighters<00:01:58.009> they're

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
committee that oversees fighters they're

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.060 
committee that oversees fighters they're
testing<00:01:59.630> whether<00:02:00.630> there's<00:02:00.960> doping<00:02:01.439> involved

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
testing whether there's doping involved

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.510 
testing whether there's doping involved
on<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.369> levels<00:02:02.549> um<00:02:03.770> also<00:02:04.770> how<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.070> take<00:02:05.280> care

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
on all levels um also how they take care

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.830 
on all levels um also how they take care
of<00:02:05.610> fighters<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> end<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.420> their<00:02:06.509> career

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
of fighters at the end of their career

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.660 
of fighters at the end of their career
think<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> pay<00:02:07.770> scale<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.399> on

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
think the pay scale is on

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.420 
think the pay scale is on
very<00:02:10.360> off<00:02:10.740> fighters<00:02:11.740> are<00:02:11.860> being<00:02:12.040> paid<00:02:12.250> very

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
very off fighters are being paid very

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.360 
very off fighters are being paid very
little<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:13.150> risk<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.480> lives<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.080> yet<00:02:15.040> some<00:02:15.250> of

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
little to risk the lives and yet some of

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.729 
little to risk the lives and yet some of
them<00:02:15.489> are<00:02:15.610> making<00:02:16.000> millions<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.290> millions<00:02:17.319> of

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
them are making millions and millions of

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.770 
them are making millions and millions of
dollars<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.310> think<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:19.270> could<00:02:19.420> make<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.630> a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
dollars I think we could make it a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.650 
dollars I think we could make it a
little<00:02:19.900> more<00:02:20.020> even<00:02:21.000> because<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.300> risk<00:02:22.510> that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
little more even because the risk that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.809 
little more even because the risk that
every<00:02:23.260> fighter<00:02:23.500> puts<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:23.920> ring<00:02:24.099> is<00:02:24.280> similar

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
every fighter puts and ring is similar

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.880 
every fighter puts and ring is similar

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
in the sport I think fighters do a poor

I think fighters need to do their best
to<00:03:02.530> preserve<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.850> sport<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.530> still<00:03:05.530> be

this<00:04:10.720> ball<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.049> I<00:04:11.079> learned<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.410> growing<00:04:11.650> up

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
this ball and I learned that growing up

this ball and I learned that growing up
with<00:04:11.950> my<00:04:12.069> father<00:04:12.420> unfortunately<00:04:13.420> he<00:04:13.540> was<00:04:13.660> on

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
with my father unfortunately he was on

the wrong side of things and I think was

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.839 
the wrong side of things and I think was
used<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.180> lot<00:04:16.209> in<00:04:16.389> his<00:04:16.750> career<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:18.519> really

used a lot in his career and you really

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.370 
used a lot in his career and you really
you<00:04:18.940> got<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.209> take<00:04:19.510> care<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.780> yourself<00:04:19.840> if

you got to take care of yourself if
you're<00:04:20.769> not<00:04:20.919> looking<00:04:21.220> out<00:04:21.340> for<00:04:21.549> yourself

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
you're not looking out for yourself

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.590 
you're not looking out for yourself
knowing<00:04:22.180> it

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
knowing it

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.690 
knowing it
and<00:04:23.140> you<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.770> absolutely<00:04:24.070> remember<00:04:24.580> that

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
and you have to absolutely remember that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
in every situation as far as the boxing

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.190 
in every situation as far as the boxing
movies<00:04:27.700> have<00:04:27.850> been<00:04:27.880> out<00:04:28.150> on<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.750> thought

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
movies have been out on I thought

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.050 
movies have been out on I thought
senator<00:04:29.620> mount<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:30.010> Cinderella<00:04:30.460> Man<00:04:30.640> was<00:04:30.850> very

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
senator mount is Cinderella Man was very

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.240 
senator mount is Cinderella Man was very
good<00:04:31.240> movie<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:32.020> bought<00:04:32.320> James<00:04:32.740> Braddock<00:04:33.040> to

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
good movie it bought James Braddock to

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.100 
good movie it bought James Braddock to
the<00:04:33.370> forefront<00:04:33.730> need<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.150> get<00:04:34.480> much<00:04:34.660> credit<00:04:35.020> in

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
the forefront need to get much credit in

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.930 
the forefront need to get much credit in
his<00:04:35.290> career<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:36.400> thought<00:04:36.580> was<00:04:36.730> fairly

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
his career and I thought was fairly

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.180 
his career and I thought was fairly
accurate<00:04:37.480> and<00:04:37.660> in<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.320> latest<00:04:38.620> movie<00:04:38.920> with<00:04:39.160> a

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
accurate and in the latest movie with a

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.910 
accurate and in the latest movie with a
about<00:04:40.030> Micky<00:04:40.300> Ward<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.660> fighter<00:04:40.900> that<00:04:41.740> was<00:04:41.890> a

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
about Micky Ward the fighter that was a

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.800 
about Micky Ward the fighter that was a
great<00:04:42.040> movie<00:04:42.370> as<00:04:42.460> well<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.670> think<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:43.540> like

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
great movie as well I think it I like

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.170 
great movie as well I think it I like
movies<00:04:44.020> boxing<00:04:44.710> movies<00:04:44.980> that<00:04:45.700> are<00:04:45.910> more

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
movies boxing movies that are more

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.030 
movies boxing movies that are more
realistic<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.930> show<00:04:47.140> you<00:04:47.350> maybe<00:04:47.770> the

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
realistic and show you maybe the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.010 
realistic and show you maybe the
fighters<00:04:48.490> side<00:04:48.730> of<00:04:48.880> life<00:04:49.000> not<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.720> punch

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
fighters side of life not just the punch

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.050 
fighters side of life not just the punch
in<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.350> box<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.100> there's<00:04:51.220> more<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.610> fighters

in a box and there's more to a fighters

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.360 
in a box and there's more to a fighters
like<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.480> natural<00:04:52.690> boxing<00:04:53.680> we<00:04:53.860> are<00:04:54.010> human

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370

so<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.550> like<00:04:58.000> any<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.270> those<00:04:58.330> movies<00:04:59.310> referring

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
so I like any of those movies referring

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.220 
so I like any of those movies referring
to<00:05:00.340> those<00:05:00.520> past<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:01.450> show<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:01.810> more

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
to those past to that that show you more

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.350 
to those past to that that show you more
than<00:05:02.470> just<00:05:02.710> beyond<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.220> guy<00:05:03.730> being<00:05:03.940> punched<00:05:04.240> in

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.330 
than just beyond a guy being punched in
the<00:05:04.480> face<00:05:04.690> because<00:05:04.990> generally<00:05:05.500> that's

the face because generally that's

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.280 
the face because generally that's
probably<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:06.970> least<00:05:07.180> accurate<00:05:07.480> part<00:05:08.050> of
