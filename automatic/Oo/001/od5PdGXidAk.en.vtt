this<00:00:09.150> can<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:09.450> done<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.780> seconds<00:00:10.349> by<00:00:10.620> all<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
this can be done in seconds by all the

this can be done in seconds by all the
ranch<00:00:11.429> users<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> record<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.349> sonar<00:00:13.799> log<00:00:13.830> you

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
ranch users so to record a sonar log you

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.010 
ranch users so to record a sonar log you
do<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.849> take<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.059> chip<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:15.870> buy

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
do is you take a chip that you can buy

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.200 
do is you take a chip that you can buy
in<00:00:16.080> any<00:00:16.230> store<00:00:16.320> between<00:00:16.859> two<00:00:17.340> gigs<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.850> 32

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
there's a little red dot that comes up

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.850 
there's a little red dot that comes up
that<00:00:47.969> blinks<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.079> every<00:00:49.260> few<00:00:49.500> seconds

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that blinks or in every few seconds

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.500 
that blinks or in every few seconds
there'll<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> little<00:00:50.340> message<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.360> comes

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
there'll be a little message that comes

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.270 
there'll be a little message that comes
up<00:00:51.780> saying<00:00:52.050> how<00:00:52.199> much<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.590> file<00:00:52.770> size<00:00:53.010> has

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
up saying how much your file size has

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
up saying how much your file size has
been<00:00:53.430> recorded<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.329> good<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.660> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> keep

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
been recorded it's good to kind of keep

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.600 
been recorded it's good to kind of keep
the<00:00:55.140> file<00:00:55.320> sizes<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.190> every<00:00:56.399> couple

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
the file sizes down so every couple

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.299 
the file sizes down so every couple
hours<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> hit<00:00:57.510> stop<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> hit<00:00:58.739> record<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
hours you can hit stop and hit record it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220 
hours you can hit stop and hit record it
only<00:00:59.399> takes<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> second<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.629> makes<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> easier

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
only takes a second it makes it easier

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.549 
only takes a second it makes it easier
to<00:01:01.379> upload<00:01:01.710> later<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.539> but<00:01:03.539> after<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to upload later on but after that you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.479 
to upload later on but after that you
just<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:04.920> your<00:01:05.040> day

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
just go about your day

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.940 
just go about your day

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
and I can fish like normal just go fish

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
and I can fish like normal just go fish
the<00:01:08.100> spots<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.850> pitch<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.570> I'm

there are two methods of surveying the

there are two methods of surveying the
first<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.009> deliberate<00:01:50.759> method<00:01:51.180> where

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
first one is a deliberate method where

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.700 
first one is a deliberate method where
you<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.479> back<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.869> forth<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.380> mowing

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you go back and forth like you're mowing
