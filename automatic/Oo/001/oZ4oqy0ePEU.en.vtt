00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
 Baltic Sea in the sure winner 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.290
 10 was the no card against 17:30 the Haspa financial holding last 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.899
 played 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.899
 against the one of 14 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.300
 Chávez had made it the barrier the superior team was 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.259
 already in the cabin 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.730
 the fees are 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.499
 Stockholm dpa-afx 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.630
 we have to watch that 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.119
 In German I should be a bit more than they would be at the German Association 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.320
 I did not want to but still I can only appeal the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.630
 Responsible people 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.050
 that they only ever few clubs give it votes SPD to the new 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 Windows 7 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.530
 People can not pretend that they want us to do it with all our might 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.220
 and because that is so, it is that I have no strength 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.710
 do not stage 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 our picture of ours i know can take care of the problem 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.140
 It was difficult to convince for the solution 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.760
 more and more taking advantage of Bastos 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580
 Hertha BSC 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.680
 Fischers Tower Stars what happened there is also in office 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.530
 Dancers came to stand 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.080
 Do not introduce gates 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 the Czech and will 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.390
 with it security 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.920
 how could it happen 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.770
 ass to the 5th 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.300
 at the last moment say that it is tangible Michelle Duggar the show 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.600
 But it's important 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 I personally started this situation so naturally they play here of course 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.270
 to let 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.189
 that is absolutely not the Linde Group to the radiant ever percent 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.250
 At an event in Lünen, what they are looking for is little Hans a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.570
 Elie Wiesel now seeks to draw attention 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.170
 then another one has to 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.140
 a single one 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.140
 we did it 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.610
 a bitter day for Hertha BSC and also brings him civilians 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.090
 we have gone the transmitter and they may even put their car 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.490
 the bundesliga ninth had succeeded as usual
