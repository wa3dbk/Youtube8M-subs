00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi we all go to video today 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.940
 review this grain this gem of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.130
 tablet which is the samsung galaxy tab 2 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.590
 10.1 inches in fact you see that right away 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.379
 the first strength is undoubtedly the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 display size a display with one 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.070
 really beautiful definition we are 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.949
 speaking of 1280 x 800 then a hd where 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.680
 you can see video conditions 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.470
 splendid the first thing we notice is 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.759
 that the best samsung has improved the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.100
 its design 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.600
 we have two speakers placed in front and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 not behind like the other tablets then 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.270
 we have better audio realism 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.140
 the only thing about audio and of course 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.200
 if we pump it too much the sound gets dirty 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.449
 a little bit always always advisable 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.480
 use the earphones to listen to yourself 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:02.100
 audio in the best possible way 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 then it weighs 581 g 256 for 165 for 97 mm 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 is the thickness 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.280
 this is white like 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.790
 feature this model does not have the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.290
 3g then for those who want to use the sim 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.530
 card and to have the connection 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.330
 internet must buy the 3g version 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 this is just wifi for that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.810
 which costs a little less and consumes less e 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 was paid 300 euros 299 euros that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.950
 you should have a great price for this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.780
 tablet is the first thing you find 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.390
 compared to many other tablets if 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.570
 not the absolute majority of the material 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.090
 of the touch hecker much much more than 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.990
 quality like that of the ipad 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.430
 of the new ipad 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.170
 we immediately see the fluidity is perfect 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.149
 obviously I'm talking about android 4.0 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.759
 these are the batch applications it is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.909
 It has been a long time and I must say that I do not have 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:02.570
 found flaws we go even now to 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.570
 open a browser 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.290
 we put google 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.070
 indeed we put virgilio.it that already here 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.270
 then on internet browsing the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.810
 first thing I noticed is that the 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.090
 speed is that of the computer neither more nor 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.230
 less excellent I managed to make one 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.060
 download in download 850 kilobits per 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.420
 according to which is more or less the maximum that 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.870
 I reach the pinch to on my adsl 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.200
 zoom and immediate as you can see is 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.550
 something fantastic 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.950
 so no problem indeed 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.560
 absolutely absolutely recommended 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.150
 for internet browsing then 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.130
 talking about power this tablet 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.160
 compared to many others it has gps 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.110
 integrated so we can use the 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.000
 various navigators and various applications that 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.490
 use gps 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.590
 the dual core cpu of 1 gigahertz but 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.410
 attention compared to many others 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.700
 many other tablets that have maybe 1.4 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.760
 they are even quad core 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.470
 this cpu nvidia terra therefore lends 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.130
 much better than many other tablets 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.670
 the ram is a gigabyte the display like 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.280
 we have said before and 10.1 inch hd 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.890
 1280 x 800 the memory of this model 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.800
 of 16 gigabytes and therefore really excellent 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.230
 for me also because there is a micro slot 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.240
 sd additional and therefore you will have it all 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.610
 space you want if they are not enough for me 16 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.100
 gigabytes also used a coupon 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.170
 additional memory for me anyway 16 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.850
 gigabytes and I'm really more than that 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:55.480
 sufficient therefore absolutely 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.120
 recommended as a level device 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.560
 of video camera we don't have something 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.070
 competitive by comparing an ipad yes 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.770
 talks about a rear camera from 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:12.120
 3.15 megapixels so it's not up to par 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.500
 of other devices however depends 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.799
 from the use we really want to make 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.829
 also a front camera here 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.710
 find the audio jack down here 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.940
 obviously there is the socket to charge it e 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.330
 if you want you can attack us 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.100
 to the adapter to have a USB input 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.260
 wines you can also attack us 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.620
 keys the adapter is not included 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.420
 in the box in the box you find 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.910
 simply the charger e 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.100
 the adapter for the wall socket il 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.100
 usb charger 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.850
 then talking about the battery as I have 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.800
 said it's absolutely fantastic right 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.440
 due to the fact that 3g are missing 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.710
 managed to make a full day of 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.850
 heavy use of the device e 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.820
 this battery is 7000 milliamps 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.580
 so really great so the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.880
 my final grade is certainly a 9 also 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.640
 considering the price 299 is really 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.950
 fantastic absolutely recommended 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.720
 the purchase is certainly worth it 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.690
 for those who don't want to spend so much money 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.729
 to have the new ipad anyway 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.040
 those tablets and very high price this 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.370
 it's still a mid-range tablet 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.260
 high 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.260
 see you at the next video
