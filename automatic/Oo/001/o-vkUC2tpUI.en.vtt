a<00:00:03.390> pacemaker<00:00:04.390> is<00:00:05.019> a<00:00:05.049> little<00:00:05.559> box<00:00:06.130> of<00:00:06.430> metal

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:07.650 
a pacemaker is a little box of metal

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.390 
a pacemaker is a little box of metal
which<00:00:08.650> is<00:00:08.680> connected<00:00:09.400> to<00:00:09.430> one<00:00:10.299> to<00:00:11.290> three<00:00:11.400> leads

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
which is connected to one to three leads

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.839 
which is connected to one to three leads
and<00:00:12.849> the<00:00:13.480> pacemaker<00:00:13.990> would<00:00:14.620> stimulate<00:00:15.160> the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
and the pacemaker would stimulate the

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.960 
and the pacemaker would stimulate the
heart<00:00:16.090> in<00:00:17.020> case<00:00:17.410> of<00:00:18.509> slow<00:00:19.509> pulse<00:00:20.470> or<00:00:21.160> heart

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
heart in case of slow pulse or heart

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.300 
heart in case of slow pulse or heart
block

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.150 

you<00:00:26.310> might<00:00:26.520> be<00:00:26.670> considered<00:00:27.770> for<00:00:28.770> a<00:00:28.800> pacemaker

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you might be considered for a pacemaker

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.049 
you might be considered for a pacemaker
as<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.660> neuro<00:00:31.199> cardio<00:00:31.590> genic<00:00:32.430> syncope

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
as is neuro cardio genic syncope

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.280 
as is neuro cardio genic syncope
patients<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:34.040> you<00:00:35.040> present<00:00:35.879> with<00:00:36.290> assistant

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
patients if you present with assistant

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.820 
patients if you present with assistant
that<00:00:37.800> means<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.110> complete<00:00:40.110> heart<00:00:40.710> block

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
that means you have complete heart block

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.360 
that means you have complete heart block
in<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.460> shorter<00:00:42.269> or<00:00:42.720> longer<00:00:42.780> period<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.800> time

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
in a shorter or longer period of time

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.939 
in a shorter or longer period of time
which<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.360> mechanism<00:00:45.570> mechanism<00:00:46.410> for

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
which is the mechanism mechanism for

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.130 
which is the mechanism mechanism for
your<00:00:47.100> syncope

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.880 
pacemakers in patients with neuro cardio
genic<00:00:56.470> syncope<00:00:57.010> are<00:00:58.080> indicated<00:00:59.080> but<00:00:59.350> not<00:00:59.710> in

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
genic syncope are indicated but not in

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.460 
genic syncope are indicated but not in
all<00:01:00.100> patients<00:01:00.430> because<00:01:01.300> patients<00:01:01.690> can

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
all patients because patients can

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.560 
all patients because patients can
respond<00:01:03.460> differently<00:01:05.430> some<00:01:06.430> patients<00:01:07.030> get

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
respond differently some patients get

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.750 
respond differently some patients get
fallen<00:01:08.230> blood<00:01:08.500> pressure<00:01:08.830> blood<00:01:09.040> pressure

fallen blood pressure blood pressure

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.540 
fallen blood pressure blood pressure
well<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.180> pacemaker<00:01:10.660> will<00:01:10.930> not<00:01:11.170> work<00:01:11.470> but<00:01:12.280> if

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
well the pacemaker will not work but if

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.320 
well the pacemaker will not work but if
patients<00:01:13.300> get<00:01:13.600> assistant<00:01:14.410> or<00:01:14.710> bradycardia

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
patients get assistant or bradycardia

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.040 
patients get assistant or bradycardia
then<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.570> pace<00:01:16.810> pacemaker<00:01:17.650> may<00:01:18.220> be<00:01:18.280> indicated

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
then a pace pacemaker may be indicated

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.510 
then a pace pacemaker may be indicated
but<00:01:20.050> it's<00:01:20.200> always<00:01:20.820> an<00:01:21.840> individual<00:01:22.840> decision
