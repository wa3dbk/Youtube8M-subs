00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.570 
more guys will get some of the guys back
that<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:49.590> played<00:02:49.800> about<00:02:49.980> half<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.370> season

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
that we played about half the season

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.600 
that we played about half the season
with<00:02:50.880> out<00:02:51.270> on<00:02:51.420> defense<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.620> hopefully

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
with out on defense and hopefully

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.370 
with out on defense and hopefully
they'll<00:02:53.820> they'll<00:02:54.150> understand<00:02:54.750> their<00:02:54.989> schemes

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
they'll they'll understand their schemes

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.900 
they'll they'll understand their schemes
and<00:02:55.590> responsibilities<00:02:56.400> better<00:02:56.610> than<00:02:56.820> they

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and responsibilities better than they

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.790 
and responsibilities better than they
did<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.120> year<00:02:57.330> ago<00:02:57.390> we'll<00:02:58.260> add<00:02:58.320> some<00:02:58.350> more

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
did a year ago we'll add some more

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.310 
did a year ago we'll add some more
firepower<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.700> defense<00:03:00.090> again<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.750> and

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
firepower to the defense again and and

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.070 
firepower to the defense again and and
that'll<00:03:01.739> be<00:03:01.830> good<00:03:02.540> what<00:03:03.540> when<00:03:03.690> you're<00:03:03.780> looking

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
that'll be good what when you're looking

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.400 
that'll be good what when you're looking
at<00:03:04.200> TV<00:03:05.130> needs<00:03:05.390> between<00:03:06.390> offensive<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
at TV needs between offensive the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.900 
at TV needs between offensive the
defensive<00:03:07.980> line<00:03:08.010> one<00:03:09.680> well<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.739> think<00:03:10.800> we<00:03:11.100> know

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
defensive line one well I think we know

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.759 
defensive line one well I think we know
that<00:03:12.209> we<00:03:12.450> got<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.720> develop<00:03:13.080> some<00:03:13.290> more<00:03:13.500> depth

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
that we got to develop some more depth

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.340 
that we got to develop some more depth
on<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.070> offensive<00:03:14.430> line<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:15.299> whether<00:03:16.110> the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
on the offensive line and whether the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.520 
on the offensive line and whether the
depth<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.860> guy<00:03:17.120> emerges<00:03:18.120> as<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.299> starter<00:03:18.840> or

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
depth and guy emerges as a starter or

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.710 
depth and guy emerges as a starter or
however<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:20.160> comes<00:03:20.310> about<00:03:20.610> Charlie<00:03:21.030> between

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
however it comes about Charlie between

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.680 
however it comes about Charlie between
now<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.470> draft<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.310> I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.600 
with the addition obviously the draft we
got<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.660> get<00:03:41.750> better<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.110> Russian<00:03:42.410> attack<00:03:42.650> we

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
got to get better in Russian attack we

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.950 
got to get better in Russian attack we
got<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.850> be<00:03:43.940> more<00:03:44.060> productive<00:03:44.270> rushing

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
got to be more productive rushing

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.900 
got to be more productive rushing
offense<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.070> think<00:03:46.280> that's<00:03:46.460> a<00:03:46.550> progression

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
offense and I think that's a progression

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.090 
offense and I think that's a progression
that's<00:03:47.210> a<00:03:47.300> progression<00:03:47.600> from<00:03:48.010> learning<00:03:49.010> to

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
that's a progression from learning to

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.770 
that's a progression from learning to
play<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.340> run<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.000> being<00:03:50.600> responsible

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
play the run and being responsible

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.440 
play the run and being responsible
enough<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.590> play<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.040> run<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.790> now<00:03:52.940> making<00:03:53.360> the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
enough to play the run to now making the

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.180 
enough to play the run to now making the
conversions<00:03:53.960> to<00:03:54.020> become<00:03:54.350> pass<00:03:54.560> rushers<00:03:54.980> I

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
conversions to become pass rushers I

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.640 
conversions to become pass rushers I
think<00:03:55.940> that's<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.210> maturity<00:03:57.460> linebacker

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
think that's a maturity linebacker

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.380 
think that's a maturity linebacker
obviously<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:02.860> where<00:04:03.860> is<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.550> feel<00:04:05.210> good

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
obviously I where is that I feel good

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.760 
obviously I where is that I feel good
