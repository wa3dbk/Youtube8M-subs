00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 big puppy of bernese mountain dog by 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.769
 nickname jean rejoices every guest of his 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.839
 host he learns to guard and be with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.429
 this hospitable guests come here 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.680
 quite often appreciate the comfort 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.050
 frame-panel house and steam in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.940
 bath in the production of frame houses baths 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.980
 and other designs can distinguish two 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.870
 fundamentally different approach which 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 further affects the quality of the finish 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.410
 the first case of the structure from the beginning to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.150
 end collects on the plot in the second 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.279
 case domokomplekt make 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.990
 factory conditions and on site collects 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.730
 only large format panel and mounting 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.579
 lasts one to two weeks 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.380
 complex designs harder to assemble on 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.520
 location if the factory is all 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.890
 going to come 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.470
 automated line collecting then when 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.630
 assembly in place going a little under 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.149
 another angle therefore err more 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.399
 chances for good house geometry 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.380
 enough if the building is made 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.910
 in the factory for conservation 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.770
 geometry baths are built by 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.020
 frame panel technology required 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.030
 additional vapor barrier protection 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.830
 to prevent moisture buildup in 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.870
 gaps between wall and trim 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.210
 in fairness it should be noted that 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.640
 moisture protection is required for all saunas 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.520
 built of wood directly 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.010
 before installing the lining in the keychain itself 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.049
 I make foil vapor barrier 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.280
 which is specifically for pine gap 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.930
 finishing works in frame panel 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.909
 buildings can begin immediately after 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.130
 mounting the building does not take time to 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.920
 shrinkage as block monolithic 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.270
 or wooden houses 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.970
 frame-panel houses are not by themselves 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.570
 almost no light shrinkage 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.490
 give therefore moments with cracks 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.470
 their interior decoration does not occur by 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.600
 project in this house used different 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.490
 Invoice finishing materials for 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.869
 parts of the walls where the sticking was intended 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.390
 wallpaper owner decided not to do 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.159
 leveling plaster and sewn up 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.020
 drywall walls 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.580
 the sheet was attached directly to the wall without 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.069
 metal guides 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.890
 if drywall is done here 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.869
 just close to the wall, he decided that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.670
 will repeat the wall geometry if 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.520
 wall geometry is wrong then us 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.140
 will have to set the profile and already 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.380
 drywall expose level losing 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.130
 part of the area due to the fact that 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.600
 drywall will be on 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.850
 distance from the main wall 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.380
 did extra work spend money 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.030
 on a profile suspensions on installation work 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.950
 dry board on the ceiling non-woven wallpaper 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.650
 on the walls of the room in the kitchen area 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.700
 block house imitation board system 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.010
 bar surface 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.109
 on the floor is a laminate corridor in the kitchen and in 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.850
 bathrooms ceramic tiles under which 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.489
 floor heating system is installed 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.140
 in other words for finishing 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.310
 frame-panel house no restrictions 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.140
 but on one condition 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.560
 the building must be made 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.560
 qualitatively 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.450
 group of companies Ural Lesprom 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.220
 will design and manufacture at home 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.640
