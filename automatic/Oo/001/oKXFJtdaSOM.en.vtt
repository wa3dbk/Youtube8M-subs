 Hi everyone, I'm mar in this episode 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 we will see how to mount the handlebar for 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 mount the handlebar first 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 unscrew lady you present yourself on your head 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.939
 of the stem there are two types 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.439
 of handlebar stems double screw o 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.240
 four screws 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 always remember that the double one 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.800
 they can be taken off one or the other 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.140
 while those at 4 you always have to pull out 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.750
 cross shaped for which high right low 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.750
 left top left bottom right 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.250
 now unscrew the screws completely 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.770
 of the stem and sprinkle on i 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.770
 anti-gripping grease fillets 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.660
 now insert the handlebar inside 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.660
 of the attack and close the two screws 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.710
 when you mount the manutd you always do it 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.079
 attention that the axis of the but man 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.759
 indicated by this line both in 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.520
 correspondence of the axis of the attack 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.710
 handlebar these cleats instead 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.560
 indicate the position of the fold because 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.210
 this we are mounting a racing bike 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.220
 of the fold as inclinations 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.780
 since it suits you well 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.090
 characteristics there are those who love 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.110
 a more corsaiola setting then more 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.000
 dry ata 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.920
 or those who prefer to be more upright 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.920
 this depends on your needs 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.310
 now take the torque wrench e 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.380
 after correctly adjusting the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.570
 Your handlebar read on your head 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.700
 of the stem on the amount of 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.380
 newton maximum meter to be radius 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.430
 set up as we saw in the video 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.140
 previous one 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.150
 the torque wrench and tighten the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.040
 screw the memory as always that in 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.900
 In this case you can tighten one first 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.580
 then the other but if your attack 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.160
 handlebar had four screws you have to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.470
 always ferrar the cross then high a 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:38.610
 right low left high left 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.990
 step right we concluded to me not 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.700
 remains that we thank for having us 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.440
 followed and if you have any questions 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.750
 clarifications leave a comment 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.080
 in the section below you want to pedal a 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.080
