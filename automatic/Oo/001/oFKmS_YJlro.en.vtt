00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.500
 I think 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.000
 hello next we'll see how to get 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:17.890
 the maximum benefit to your video card 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.890
 radio with processor to 8 on your computer 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:27.070
 sleep book v105 the first thing is to verify 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.610
 the desk we go to the right button 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:35.090
 graphics properties 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:38.079
 then we go to distance preferences 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.940
 to the games tab 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:45.820
 ya md dual graphics 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.440
 there it immediately shows us some 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.329
 images that we will be able to take the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.219
 maximum benefit of these two 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.090
 processors to get the most 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.660
 video performance 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.600
 if this tab is not available it is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.360
 you need to download the application and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.620
 update the drive for that we 're going to 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.160
 a browser for example here is google 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.160
 we have 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.560
 md drivers in the first option 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.860
 that appears to us we seek our our 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.050
 card in this case is a 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.050
 as it says there is a bus 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.300
 of a mobile and the series 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.500
 we really select our system 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.740
 summery in this case 28 64 bits and there 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.010
 our driver will appear in this 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.820
 case is a beta driver that weighs 240 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.860
 megas 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.320
 It is available to download 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.880
 once you download this already 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.430
 they will be able to get the most 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.420
 performance of your team 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.420
 for games 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.400
 good 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.710
 we have our kind of 105 running 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.540
 butterfield 4 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:16.709
 we left the game was thrown everything in between 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.140
 and with our graphics working we 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.720
 we can realize that the performance 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.690
 it's a performance that has nothing 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.280
 envy to game console 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.530
 in this you do not feel any side the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.640
 frames stands 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.959
 - some incredible no less than 24 and 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:46.900
 middle general center go in 30 28 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.900
 passing even 35 38 frames per second 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.250
 the game can be played completely 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.670
 fluid 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:01.090
 does not have any difference with one in 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.090
 one to 8 m
