it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.279 
it
this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> new<00:00:26.849> tutor<00:00:27.210> model<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.750> it's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
this is the new tutor model and it's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.130 
this is the new tutor model and it's
based<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> Alea<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.849> Alea<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> very

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
based on the Alea and the Alea is a very

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
based on the Alea and the Alea is a very
fun<00:00:31.529> surfboard<00:00:32.099> arrived<00:00:32.340> once<00:00:32.640> you're<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
fun surfboard arrived once you're on the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.209 
fun surfboard arrived once you're on the
way<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.110> nearly<00:00:34.290> impossible<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.920> catch

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
way but it's nearly impossible to catch

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.520 
way but it's nearly impossible to catch
a<00:00:35.370> wave<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.730> an<00:00:35.880> Alea<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> average<00:00:37.110> surfer

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
a wave on an Alea for the average surfer

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.880 
a wave on an Alea for the average surfer
so<00:00:38.250> I've<00:00:38.399> taken<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> concept<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.079> yelw<00:00:40.440> layout

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so I've taken the concept of yelw layout

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.880 
so I've taken the concept of yelw layout
and<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.940> into<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> foam<00:00:42.510> board<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.680> you

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and put it into a foam board that you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
and put it into a foam board that you
can<00:00:43.920> palette<00:00:44.399> very<00:00:44.430> easily<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.090> then<00:00:45.180> once

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
can palette very easily and then once

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
can palette very easily and then once
you're<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.719> way<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.289> feels<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.770> an<00:00:46.890> Alaia

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
you're on the way it feels like an Alaia

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.029 
you're on the way it feels like an Alaia
and<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.210> way<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> board<00:00:48.719> works<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.890> got

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and the way the board works is we got

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.970 
and the way the board works is we got
rolled<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.690> gently<00:00:52.140> pull<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> board

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
rolled here that gently pull the board

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.189 
rolled here that gently pull the board
into<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.000> sits<00:00:54.149> along<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
into the way that it sits along and the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.520 
into the way that it sits along and the
hard<00:00:55.469> edge<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.940> set<00:00:57.480> grabs<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.440> the

hard edge here that set grabs into the
way<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.789> fin

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
way of just it's like it's like a fin

way of just it's like it's like a fin
your<00:01:00.690> whole<00:01:00.870> rail<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.680> long<00:01:02.010> pin<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
your whole rail is one long pin that

holds into that into the way and gives

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
holds into that into the way and gives
you<00:01:04.619> enormous<00:01:04.890> speed<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.519> go<00:01:05.700> across<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you enormous speed as you go across the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.590 
you enormous speed as you go across the
way<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.770> flexes<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:09.180> took<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> long

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
way and it flexes and it took a long

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.530 
way and it flexes and it took a long
time<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.930> work<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.790> foam<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.970> EPS<00:01:12.330> foam

epoxy to get a board that will Bend

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
epoxy to get a board that will Bend
within<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> wave<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> board<00:01:19.409> doesn't

Bend in the way it just sits side slips
out<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.580> flex<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
out you have to have that flex so it's a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.880 
out you have to have that flex so it's a
dynamic<00:01:26.420> interaction<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.439> the

dynamic interaction and that's what the

dynamic interaction and that's what the
ancient<00:01:29.220> Hawaiian<00:01:29.579> surfing<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.090> all<00:01:30.210> about

ancient hawaiians were surfing much
better<00:01:32.939> than<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.270> ever<00:01:33.479> possibly<00:01:34.140> imagined

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
better than we ever possibly imagined

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
better than we ever possibly imagined
and<00:01:34.890> they<00:01:35.369> were<00:01:35.430> carving<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> bottom<00:01:36.689> turns

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and they were carving the bottom turns

will do the same and it's about having
that<00:01:41.850> flexion<00:01:42.390> aboard<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.649> don't<00:01:43.890> need

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that flexion aboard and you don't need

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.340 
that flexion aboard and you don't need
fins<00:01:44.280> by<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> way<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.810> surface<00:01:46.110> without<00:01:46.320> a

this is it
there's<00:01:52.930> two<00:01:53.290> sizes<00:01:53.800> there's<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.710> 5<00:01:56.710> 3<00:01:57.100> and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
there's two sizes there's the 5 3 and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.620 
there's two sizes there's the 5 3 and
the<00:01:58.000> 6<00:01:58.270> 2<00:01:58.660> and<00:01:59.160> the<00:02:00.160> 6<00:02:00.340> 2<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.060> smaller<00:02:01.360> wave

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
the 6 2 and the 6 2 is the smaller wave

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.470 
the 6 2 and the 6 2 is the smaller wave
4<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.620> 5<00:02:02.830> 3<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.670> bigger<00:02:03.880> wave<00:02:04.120> Lord

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
4 and the 5 3 is the bigger wave Lord

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.940 
4 and the 5 3 is the bigger wave Lord
and<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:07.540> actually<00:02:07.750> have<00:02:08.140> just<00:02:08.619> about<00:02:08.800> the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
and they actually have just about the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.300 
and they actually have just about the
same<00:02:09.190> flotation<00:02:09.910> between<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.780> two<00:02:10.960> of<00:02:11.050> us<00:02:11.310> but

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
same flotation between the two of us but

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.700 
same flotation between the two of us but
the<00:02:12.460> 5<00:02:12.670> 3<00:02:13.000> has<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> little<00:02:13.510> bit<00:02:13.600> deeper<00:02:14.140> rolls

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
the 5 3 has a little bit deeper rolls

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.610 
the 5 3 has a little bit deeper rolls
right<00:02:15.040> here<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.750> being<00:02:16.750> shorter<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.500> bit

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
right here and being shorter it's a bit

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.000 
right here and being shorter it's a bit
easier

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
easier

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.580 
easier
the<00:02:18.640> people<00:02:19.480> say<00:02:19.630> can<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.870> make<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.050> longer<00:02:20.380> one

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
the people say can you make a longer one

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.440 
the people say can you make a longer one
and<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.250> actually<00:02:21.580> really<00:02:21.700> hard<00:02:22.030> because<00:02:22.210> no

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
and it's actually really hard because no

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.120 
and it's actually really hard because no
matter<00:02:22.570> where<00:02:22.900> you're<00:02:23.470> only<00:02:23.530> standing<00:02:24.010> right

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
matter where you're only standing right

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.130 
matter where you're only standing right
about<00:02:24.340> here<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.880> board<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.690> even<00:02:25.810> if<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
about here on the board and even if the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.750 
about here on the board and even if the
board<00:02:26.350> was<00:02:26.560> eight<00:02:26.680> feet<00:02:26.950> long<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.370> could<00:02:27.610> be

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
board was eight feet long you could be

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.670 
board was eight feet long you could be
standing<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.240> tail<00:02:28.450> there<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.050> that's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
standing on the tail there and that's

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.920 
standing on the tail there and that's
why<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.370> longer<00:02:31.060> one<00:02:31.210> actually<00:02:31.570> doesn't<00:02:31.720> help

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
why a longer one actually doesn't help

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.140 
why a longer one actually doesn't help
you<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.260> much<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.280> we're<00:02:33.520> paddling<00:02:33.700> these

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
you so much and we're paddling these

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.240 
you so much and we're paddling these
guys<00:02:34.360> have<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.750> lot<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.140> flotation<00:02:35.830> jib<00:02:36.010> and

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
guys have a lot of flotation jib and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.880 
guys have a lot of flotation jib and
that's<00:02:36.760> why<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.000> thick<00:02:37.360> tail<00:02:37.660> just<00:02:38.530> slides

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that's why the thick tail just slides

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.500 
that's why the thick tail just slides
into<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.250> way<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.760> easily<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.270> way<00:02:40.390> it

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
into the way and so easily the way it

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.840 
into the way and so easily the way it
comes<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.020> just<00:02:41.080> lifts<00:02:41.440> all<00:02:41.530> this

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
comes up and just lifts all this

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.070 
comes up and just lifts all this
flotation<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.360> slide<00:02:43.630> right<00:02:43.660> in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
flotation that we just slide right in

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.580 
flotation that we just slide right in
so<00:02:44.830> I'm<00:02:45.040> high<00:02:45.700> right<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:46.030> 5:3<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.110> plenty

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
so I'm high right of 5:3 and it's plenty

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.100 
so I'm high right of 5:3 and it's plenty
long<00:02:47.890> for<00:02:48.160> me<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:48.880> if<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.330> did<00:02:49.510> two

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
long for me it's like if I did two

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.580 
long for me it's like if I did two
different<00:02:50.290> style<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.400> surfing

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
different style of surfing

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.930 
different style of surfing
whoo-whoo-whoo<00:02:54.540> one<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.720> breather
