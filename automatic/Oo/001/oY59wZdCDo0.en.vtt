00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.028
 We were hunters and foragers 

00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:22.998
 The border was everywhere 

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:29.998
 We are surrounded by the sky, and ocean only, and the sky is in the sky 

00:00:30.428 --> 00:00:35.640
 The open road is still calling slowly 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.640
 Our little amphibious globe is the millions of madars, hundreds of thousands of worlds, millions of worlds 

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:49.308
 We can not even put our own planetary home in order 

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:56.299
 We are venture out of space? 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.788
 By the time we are ready to settle for even the nearest planet of another planet 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.079
 We will change 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.180
 So many generations passaged us easier to pass 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.620
 We need to change 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.079
 We're an adaptive species 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.939
 It will be a species like us too 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.269
 And the next millennium? 

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:12.310
 Through our solar system safely through the solar system and beyond so many remote worlds, 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.830
 Unified 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.560
 By their common heritage, their home for their planets 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.449
 And by the knowledge that whatever other life can be, only the people of all the universe 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.810
 Come from the world 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.140
 They would think up and hug out the blue dot in their skies 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.979
 They will be marveled at how vulnerable they were once at our raw potential repository 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.560
 How dangerous our childhood 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.080
 How humble our startups 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.990
 How many rivers we had to cross before we found our way
