he's so superb on knowing when and when

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.550 
he's so superb on knowing when and when
not<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.800> throw<00:03:22.190> punches<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.870> frustrate<00:03:24.380> his

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
opponents with his great shoulder roll

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.699 
opponents with his great shoulder roll
defense<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:28.810> don't<00:03:29.810> think<00:03:29.900> he's<00:03:30.260> going<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.470> be

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
defense I don't think he's going to be

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.670 
defense I don't think he's going to be
too<00:03:31.010> successful<00:03:31.670> with<00:03:31.850> that<00:03:32.290> tactic<00:03:33.290> he<00:03:33.440> likes

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
too successful with that tactic he likes

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.150 
too successful with that tactic he likes
to<00:03:33.830> do<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.040> like<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:34.910> know<00:03:35.030> who<00:03:35.270> likes<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:36.160> stay

to do it like you know who likes to stay

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.580 
to do it like you know who likes to stay
on<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.340> ropes<00:03:37.580> or<00:03:37.940> in<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.120> corner<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.810> wait

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
on the ropes or in the corner and wait

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.340 
on the ropes or in the corner and wait
for<00:03:39.860> his<00:03:39.950> opponent<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.840> grow<00:03:41.840> three<00:03:42.080> or<00:03:42.200> four

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
for his opponent to grow three or four

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.680 
for his opponent to grow three or four
punches<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.100> deflect<00:03:43.610> them<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.000> throw<00:03:44.660> a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
punches and deflect them and throw a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.979 
punches and deflect them and throw a
combination<00:03:45.380> back<00:03:46.330> he's<00:03:47.330> great<00:03:47.600> at<00:03:47.840> that

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
combination back he's great at that

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.809 
combination back he's great at that
technique

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
technique

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.530 
technique
he's<00:03:50.390> really<00:03:50.689> good<00:03:50.930> at<00:03:51.109> it<00:03:52.180> but<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.239> don't<00:03:53.329> think

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
he's really good at it but I don't think

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.619 
he's really good at it but I don't think
he's<00:03:53.689> gonna<00:03:53.749> work<00:03:54.049> Nia's<00:03:54.290> Canelo<00:03:55.450> being<00:03:56.450> that

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
he's gonna work Nia's Canelo being that

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.069 
he's gonna work Nia's Canelo being that
you<00:03:56.870> know<00:03:57.939> Canelo<00:03:58.939> doesn't<00:03:59.629> really<00:03:59.749> have<00:03:59.930> to

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
you know Canelo doesn't really have to

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.170 
you know Canelo doesn't really have to
do<00:04:00.260> that<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:02.139> believe<00:04:03.139> Canelo<00:04:03.499> was<00:04:03.769> gonna

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
do that I believe Canelo was gonna

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.610 
do that I believe Canelo was gonna
believe<00:04:05.180> in<00:04:05.329> his<00:04:05.510> underrated<00:04:06.170> technical

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
believe in his underrated technical

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.339 
believe in his underrated technical
ability<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.010> think<00:04:07.310> he<00:04:07.459> has<00:04:07.609> really<00:04:08.480> underrated

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
ability I think he has really underrated

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.330 
ability I think he has really underrated
technical<00:04:09.950> ability<00:04:10.599> he's<00:04:11.599> a<00:04:12.159> previous<00:04:13.159> and

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
technical ability he's a previous and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.159 
technical ability he's a previous and
counter<00:04:13.639> puncher<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:16.370> believe<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.169> he's

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
counter puncher and I believe that he's

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.839 
counter puncher and I believe that he's
not<00:04:18.440> going<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.680> fall<00:04:19.160> for<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.430> trap<00:04:19.820> like

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
not going to fall for that trap like

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:26.200 
not going to fall for that trap like
other<00:04:20.239> fighters<00:04:20.720> have<00:04:20.870> fallen<00:04:21.259> for<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:25.210> I

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
other fighters have fallen for it I

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.150 
other fighters have fallen for it I
believe<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.199> is<00:04:27.259> going<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.470> be<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> very<00:04:27.680> close

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
believe this is going to be a very close

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.930 
believe this is going to be a very close
fight<00:04:29.800> if<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:30.919> was<00:04:31.039> a<00:04:31.099> pic<00:04:31.280> more<00:04:31.460> fighter<00:04:31.729> i'll

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
fight if I was a pic more fighter i'll

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.550 
fight if I was a pic more fighter i'll
pick<00:04:32.180> Floyd<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:34.340> win<00:04:34.580> by<00:04:34.910> split<00:04:35.360> decision<00:04:38.560> you

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
pick Floyd to win by split decision you

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.830 
pick Floyd to win by split decision you
know<00:04:39.759> by<00:04:40.759> about<00:04:40.970> two<00:04:41.240> points<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:46.599> as<00:04:47.599> well<00:04:47.780> see

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
know by about two points and as well see

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.310 
know by about two points and as well see
how<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:48.080> see<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.710> can<00:04:49.430> also<00:04:49.820> see<00:04:50.300> Canelo<00:04:50.660> win<00:04:51.110> in<00:04:51.229> a

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
how I see I can also see Canelo win in a

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.640 
how I see I can also see Canelo win in a
fight<00:04:51.580> by<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.610> close<00:04:52.910> decision<00:04:53.470> but<00:04:54.470> most

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
fight by a close decision but most

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.800 
fight by a close decision but most
likely<00:04:54.889> if<00:04:55.220> Canelo<00:04:56.030> Thunder<00:04:56.360> win<00:04:56.479> this<00:04:56.570> fight

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
likely if Canelo Thunder win this fight

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.760 
likely if Canelo Thunder win this fight
is<00:04:56.930> going<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.110> be<00:04:57.199> by<00:04:57.320> Mac<00:04:57.560> out<00:04:59.560> he's<00:05:00.560> going<00:05:00.710> to

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
is going to be by Mac out he's going to

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.320 
is going to be by Mac out he's going to
go<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.009> cards<00:05:01.520> I<00:05:01.840> believe<00:05:02.840> fully<00:05:04.150> will<00:05:05.150> win

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
go to the cards I believe fully will win

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.790 
go to the cards I believe fully will win
it<00:05:05.479> if<00:05:05.659> he<00:05:06.110> goes<00:05:06.229> a<00:05:06.320> distance<00:05:08.080> if<00:05:09.080> he<00:05:09.229> drags<00:05:09.530> to

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
it if he goes a distance if he drags to

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.120 
it if he goes a distance if he drags to
fight<00:05:10.009> alone<00:05:11.860> canela's<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.039> you're

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
fight alone canela's and you're

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.610 
fight alone canela's and you're

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
frustrated if he can't hit Floyd do I

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.779 
frustrated if he can't hit Floyd do I

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
think he's going to fall for the trap

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.149 
think he's going to fall for the trap
