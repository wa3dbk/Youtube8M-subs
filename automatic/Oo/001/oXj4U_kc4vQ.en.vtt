because that could have been right there

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.420 
because that could have been right there
two-nil<00:01:31.200> before<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> half<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.159> right<00:01:32.250> let's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
two-nil before the half all right let's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.710 
two-nil before the half all right let's
see<00:01:32.549> what<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:33.390> pull<00:01:33.570> back

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
see what we can do here let's pull back
