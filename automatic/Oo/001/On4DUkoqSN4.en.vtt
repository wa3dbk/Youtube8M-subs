middle yet i'm just going to really

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.799 
middle yet i'm just going to really
focus<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> end<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> front

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
focus on the end and also in the front

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.410 
focus on the end and also in the front
and<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.980> keeping<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.670> straight<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and like keeping it really straight so

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.119 
and like keeping it really straight so
all<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> lines<00:00:46.110> are<00:00:46.260> nice<00:00:46.530> short<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
all the lines are nice short and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.600 
all the lines are nice short and
straight<00:00:47.340> um<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:50.039> creates<00:00:50.430> an

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
straight um so it just really creates an

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670 
straight um so it just really creates an
angle<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.690> lot<00:00:51.840> easier<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
angle and is a lot easier for you to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.979 
angle and is a lot easier for you to
create<00:00:52.920> angle<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:54.030> once<00:00:54.480> i'm<00:00:54.600> done<00:00:54.629> i

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
create angle and then once i'm done i

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
create angle and then once i'm done i
like<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.289> use<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.760> spoolie<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.239> sort<00:00:57.360> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
like to use a spoolie to just sort of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
like to use a spoolie to just sort of
blend<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.870> liner<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:59.010> make<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
blend out the liner and not make it so

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
blend out the liner and not make it so

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.700 
don't go I'm interesting the dots and
just<00:01:34.560> don't<00:01:34.740> go<00:01:34.920> past<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.460> dots<00:01:35.640> um<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.810> yeah

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
just don't go past the dots um and yeah

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
just don't go past the dots um and yeah
and<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> straight<00:01:38.460> bro<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.180> trick<00:01:39.570> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and so for the straight bro the trick is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.889 
and so for the straight bro the trick is
basically<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.590> fill<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.909> under<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
basically just to fill in the under the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.889 
basically just to fill in the under the
arch<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.320> there's<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.979> no<00:01:44.189> arch<00:01:44.899> like

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
arch so there's not like no arch like

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.649 
arch so there's not like no arch like
that<00:01:46.380> yeah<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.820> creates<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> much<00:01:48.479> more

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that yeah so it just creates a much more

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.200 
that yeah so it just creates a much more
straighter<00:01:48.990> brow<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> instead<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.399> having<00:01:51.030> an

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
straighter brow and instead of having an

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.600 
straighter brow and instead of having an
arch<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.780> basically<00:01:52.020> fill<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.310> part

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
arch you just basically fill in the part

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.060 
arch you just basically fill in the part
where<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.000> normally<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.479> an<00:01:54.659> arch<00:01:55.070> so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
where you normally have an arch so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
where you normally have an arch so
that's<00:01:56.700> basically<00:01:56.880> how<00:01:57.180> i<00:01:57.360> did<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.689> straight

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that's basically how i did a straight

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660 
that's basically how i did a straight
brown<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.439> again<00:01:58.829> i'm<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.100> using<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.399> spoolie

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
brown and again i'm just using a spoolie

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.580 
brown and again i'm just using a spoolie
to

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.190 
to
it<00:02:00.890> out<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.539> looks<00:02:02.689> a<00:02:02.780> little<00:02:02.869> bit<00:02:03.079> more

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
it out so it looks a little bit more

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.520 
it out so it looks a little bit more
natural<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.770> it<00:02:03.890> doesn't<00:02:04.159> look<00:02:04.189> at<00:02:04.399> harsh<00:02:05.530> so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
natural and it doesn't look at harsh so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.499 
natural and it doesn't look at harsh so
that's<00:02:06.679> basically<00:02:06.890> this<00:02:07.640> straight<00:02:08.090> brow<00:02:08.330> I

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
that's basically this straight brow I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.059 
that's basically this straight brow I
