00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.889
 What is what alckmin was going to me is a 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.220
 concept that was very misrepresented with a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.050
 materialistic view of her or that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 thing that we sometimes see in movies 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.660
 even in soap operas to turn lead into 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.080
 gold is not a heavy metal 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.279
 the noble metal in precious metal as it is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.219
 the case of gold 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.070
 This has a real relationship but not 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.290
 the alchemists sought to help 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.070
 people to turn lead into 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 inner in the glittering gold of our soul 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.460
 in a sense there from gold to chemist or even 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.649
 even from our philosopher's stone that would 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.960
 nothing less than being our 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.340
 potential because many times the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.449
 people are here and I lived the life 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.960
 simply to have pleasures to have 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.699
 a common life and family have children 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.719
 and such, and do not live a life for 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.880
 get better 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.090
 many people are satisfied with you 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.340
 even simply because they are happy 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.650
 At first it has stagnated and will not go beyond 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.990
 do not seek this inner transformation 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.750
 an alchemist he is present in life 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.210
 of a person when she wants to do this 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.770
 transformation is not good for you 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 search for an alchemist 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.729
 if you think that it's just him 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.130
 to do the job or just a floral 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.079
 example he will suggest will only do the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.390
 what's internal is important for you 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.700
 be willing to change to change 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.140
 your standards that you are willing 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.299
 to really look at their 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.460
 shadows and put your hand in the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.030
 to transform them because we do not 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.060
 can effectively produce changes 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.930
 if another is not willing to do the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.549
 changes 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.840
 another thing that is important to say that 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.159
 you should not also look for a 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.799
 optimistic if you want your life 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 It stays the same, because otherwise you stay in the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.829
 same point gets lead does not try 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.250
 to seek gold alchemy is something very 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:09.149
 deep is a subject so it 's got 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.489
 many sub-themes within this larger theme 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.610
 and that I 'll be talking about them 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.510
 Also here 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.510
 ever
