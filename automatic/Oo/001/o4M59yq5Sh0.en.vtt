00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
password and i can click join I would be

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.720 
password and i can click join I would be
absolutely<00:02:52.459> flabbergasted<00:02:53.459> if<00:02:53.549> their

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
absolutely flabbergasted if their

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.759 
absolutely flabbergasted if their
password<00:02:54.150> was<00:02:54.269> password<00:02:54.329> it's<00:02:54.959> not<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.739> know

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
password was password it's not you know

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.890 
password was password it's not you know
so<00:02:56.099> that<00:02:56.129> fails<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.090> I'm<00:02:57.150> not<00:02:57.299> able<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.690> join

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
so that fails and I'm not able to join

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.949 
so that fails and I'm not able to join
it<00:02:58.109> some<00:02:58.799> networks<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.879> what's<00:03:00.420> called<00:03:00.629> a

it some networks have what's called a

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.199 
it some networks have what's called a
guest<00:03:01.319> account<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.730> when<00:03:02.879> you<00:03:03.000> select

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
guest account and so when you select

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.490 
guest account and so when you select
that<00:03:03.560> account<00:03:05.090> you'll<00:03:06.090> select<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.989> in

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
that account you'll select it and in

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
that account you'll select it and in
some<00:03:07.739> cases<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.250> going<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.609> prompt<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.150> to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
wireless pop right up and you put the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.640 
wireless pop right up and you put the

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650

uppercase<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.790> lowercase<00:04:33.009> convention

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
uppercase and lowercase convention

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.879 
uppercase and lowercase convention
because<00:04:34.430> passwords<00:04:35.419> for<00:04:35.630> wireless<00:04:36.080> are<00:04:36.320> case

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
because passwords for wireless are case

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.920 
because passwords for wireless are case
sensitive<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.639> so<00:04:38.389> you're<00:04:38.570> going<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.750> want<00:04:38.870> to

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
sensitive and so you're going to want to

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.050 
sensitive and so you're going to want to
make<00:04:39.080> sure<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.350> follow<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:39.889> some<00:04:40.699> wireless

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
make sure you follow that some wireless

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.939 
make sure you follow that some wireless
networks<00:04:41.840> are<00:04:42.050> going<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:42.259> require<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.650> you

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
networks are going to require that you

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.920 
networks are going to require that you
open<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.370> web<00:04:43.580> browser<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:44.300> could<00:04:44.479> be<00:04:44.570> Chrome

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
or Safari Firefox a different browser

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.240 
or Safari Firefox a different browser
and<00:04:48.050> then<00:04:48.410> you're<00:04:48.530> going<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.680> be<00:04:48.800> able<00:04:48.830> to<00:04:49.070> gain

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
and then you're going to be able to gain

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.540 
and then you're going to be able to gain

wireless account however it should save
your<00:04:56.000> password<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:56.900> shouldn't<00:04:57.199> have<00:04:57.350> to

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
connected to my hotspot and I try to go

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.200 
connected to my hotspot and I try to go
to<00:05:03.470> CNN<00:05:03.889> it's<00:05:04.070> going<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.250> come<00:05:04.460> come<00:05:04.850> right<00:05:05.060> up

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
to CNN it's going to come come right up

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.110 
to CNN it's going to come come right up
for<00:05:05.449> me<00:05:05.600> so<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.919> last<00:05:07.460> little<00:05:07.789> things<00:05:08.000> that

for me so the last little things that
I'll<00:05:08.210> say<00:05:08.389> about<00:05:08.600> Wireless<00:05:09.110> are<00:05:09.320> if<00:05:09.530> you<00:05:10.100> have

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
I'll say about Wireless are if you have

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.659 
I'll say about Wireless are if you have
difficulty<00:05:11.030> connecting<00:05:11.979> remember<00:05:12.979> that<00:05:13.190> just

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
difficulty connecting remember that just

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.350 
difficulty connecting remember that just
below<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.930> icon<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:16.010> has<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.490> choice<00:05:16.789> to<00:05:16.850> turn
