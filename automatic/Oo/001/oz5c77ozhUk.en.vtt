00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
simple interface and controls you have

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.539 
simple interface and controls you have
the<00:01:12.969> tilt<00:01:13.240> vice<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:14.560> tilt<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:14.890> device<00:01:15.009> to

fingers to pinch in and zoom to view
more<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.780> level<00:01:29.109> or<00:01:29.289> less<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.009> level

only<00:01:44.619> go<00:01:44.890> through<00:01:45.130> one<00:01:45.310> level<00:01:45.700> in<00:01:45.789> this<00:01:45.909> review

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
only go through one level in this review

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.870 
only go through one level in this review
to<00:01:46.479> keep<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.780> review<00:01:47.249> somewhat<00:01:48.249> short<00:01:48.579> but

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
to keep the review somewhat short but

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.359 
to keep the review somewhat short but
throughout<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.689> levels<00:01:50.409> there's<00:01:50.799> many<00:01:51.100> many

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
throughout the levels there's many many

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.739 
throughout the levels there's many many
different<00:01:51.639> things<00:01:51.999> that<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.420> will<00:01:52.539> encounter

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
different things that you will encounter

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.959 
different things that you will encounter
there's<00:01:53.319> things<00:01:53.649> like<00:01:53.770> saws<00:01:54.219> where<00:01:54.639> you<00:01:54.729> got<00:01:54.939> a

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
there's things like saws where you got a

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.169 
there's things like saws where you got a
duck<00:01:55.299> or<00:01:55.329> jump<00:01:55.780> under<00:01:56.189> there's<00:01:57.189> inversion<00:01:58.090> of

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
duck or jump under there's inversion of

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.849 
duck or jump under there's inversion of
gravity<00:01:58.719> to<00:01:58.929> where<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.229> gravity<00:01:59.679> will

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
gravity to where the gravity will

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.679 
gravity to where the gravity will
actually<00:02:00.280> invert<00:02:00.639> and<00:02:00.850> you'll<00:02:01.030> have<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.359> flip

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
actually invert and you'll have to flip

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.719 
actually invert and you'll have to flip
your<00:02:01.899> device<00:02:02.259> I'll<00:02:02.889> see<00:02:03.069> if<00:02:03.189> I<00:02:03.249> can<00:02:03.459> show<00:02:03.670> you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
your device I'll see if I can show you

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.789 
your device I'll see if I can show you
some<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.149> those<00:02:04.299> things<00:02:04.600> but<00:02:05.530> I'm<00:02:05.619> going<00:02:05.709> to

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
some of those things but I'm going to

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.739 
some of those things but I'm going to
play<00:02:05.950> through<00:02:06.130> one<00:02:06.369> level<00:02:06.759> so<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.359> can<00:02:07.600> see

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
play through one level so you can see

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.300 
play through one level so you can see
that<00:02:07.780> first<00:02:08.259> level<00:02:08.470> again<00:02:08.800> i'm<00:02:08.920> going<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.160> show

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
that first level again i'm going to show

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.640 
that first level again i'm going to show
you<00:02:09.340> just<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:10.000> basics<00:02:10.479> so<00:02:11.319> it's<00:02:11.470> going<00:02:11.590> to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
you just the basics so it's going to

you just the basics so it's going to
show<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.010> exactly<00:02:12.430> how<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> control<00:02:13.030> this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
show you exactly how to control this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.210 
show you exactly how to control this
again<00:02:13.630> i'm<00:02:14.110> going<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.350> read<00:02:14.530> these<00:02:14.710> why<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.070> go

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
control the stuntman in midair you may

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.539 
control the stuntman in midair you may
need<00:02:18.840> some<00:02:19.080> practice<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.650> once<00:02:19.860> he<00:02:19.950> jumps<00:02:20.370> I

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
need some practice so once he jumps I

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.940 
need some practice so once he jumps I
tilt<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.390> phone<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:22.260> use<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> accelerometer

careful<00:02:50.459> when<00:02:50.579> landing<00:02:54.260> really<00:02:55.260> cool<00:02:55.470> thing

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
careful when landing really cool thing

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.860 
careful when landing really cool thing
that<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> noticed<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.090> actual<00:02:57.420> camera

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that you noticed is the actual camera

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.660 
that you noticed is the actual camera
angle<00:02:58.200> once<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.590> actually<00:02:58.799> go<00:02:59.129> off<00:02:59.280> cliffs

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
angle once you actually go off cliffs

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.240 
angle once you actually go off cliffs
the<00:02:59.879> camera<00:03:00.299> angle<00:03:00.450> will<00:03:00.810> change<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:01.950> may

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
the camera angle will change so you may

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.069 
the camera angle will change so you may
be<00:03:02.310> zoomed<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:02.940> or<00:03:03.000> zoom<00:03:03.120> out<00:03:03.390> but<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.720> camera

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
be zoomed in or zoom out but the camera

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.680 
be zoomed in or zoom out but the camera
angle<00:03:04.200> actually<00:03:04.769> changes<00:03:05.280> automatically<00:03:06.000> to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
angle actually changes automatically to

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.300 
angle actually changes automatically to
show<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.069> that<00:03:09.470> or<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.709> show<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.099> good

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
show you that or to show you a good

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.890 
show you that or to show you a good
perspective<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.060> cliff<00:03:12.299> in<00:03:12.450> your<00:03:12.569> landing

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
perspective of the cliff in your landing

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.899 
perspective of the cliff in your landing
so<00:03:13.019> very<00:03:13.230> cool<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:14.220> says<00:03:14.400> note<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.879> will

so very cool it says note that you will

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.849 
so very cool it says note that you will
earn<00:03:15.209> score<00:03:15.629> according<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.290> accuracy<00:03:16.620> of
