00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
guys is your activation method so this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
guys is your activation method so this
uses<00:01:19.049> activator<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
uses activator and there are all the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.609 
uses activator and there are all the
options<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.990> an<00:01:22.110> activator

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
options that you can have an activator

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.109 
options that you can have an activator
to<00:01:22.830> activate<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.400> app<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:25.700> actually<00:01:26.700> want<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to activate this app I actually want to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
to activate this app I actually want to
get<00:01:27.330> rid<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.689> hold<00:01:31.229> home

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
get rid of this and just have hold home

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.160 
get rid of this and just have hold home
button<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.640> i<00:01:33.030> think<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.360> actually<00:01:33.869> holding

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
button so i think that actually holding

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.160 
button so i think that actually holding
status<00:01:34.619> bar<00:01:34.890> might<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.720> original

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
status bar might be the like original

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740 
status bar might be the like original
way<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> doing<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.070> i<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> hold<00:01:39.570> home

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
way of doing it but i like the hold home

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
way of doing it but i like the hold home
button<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.710> easier<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
button because it's way easier so you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
button because it's way easier so you
can<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.840> my<00:01:42.960> background<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.040> don't
