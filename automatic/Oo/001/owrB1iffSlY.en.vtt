00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
all right guys it's been a while since

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.740 
all right guys it's been a while since
I've<00:00:01.890> made<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:02.159> towards<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.879> floor<00:00:03.090> fan<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.540> tech

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
I've made a towards a floor fan of tech

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.380 
I've made a towards a floor fan of tech
drift<00:00:04.380> video<00:00:04.740> so<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.549> thought<00:00:05.609> I'd<00:00:06.210> make<00:00:06.359> one

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
drift video so I thought I'd make one

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.810 
drift video so I thought I'd make one
now<00:00:06.750> showing<00:00:07.080> off<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:08.040> changes<00:00:08.429> I've<00:00:08.550> made<00:00:08.580> to

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
now showing off the changes I've made to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.209 
now showing off the changes I've made to
my<00:00:08.849> ragle<00:00:09.389> first<00:00:10.230> off<00:00:10.440> obviously<00:00:10.679> I've<00:00:11.070> got

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
my ragle first off obviously I've got

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.209 
my ragle first off obviously I've got
the<00:00:11.400> fan<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.240> tech<00:00:12.420> CSL<00:00:13.290> see<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.980> I've<00:00:14.070> got

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the fan of tech CSL see that I've got

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.480 
the fan of tech CSL see that I've got
everything<00:00:14.490> mounted<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.210> now<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:16.289> I've<00:00:16.890> got<00:00:17.130> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
everything mounted to now so I've got a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.740 
everything mounted to now so I've got a
new<00:00:18.060> shifted<00:00:18.660> position<00:00:20.420> down<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> more

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
new shifted position down a more

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.689 
new shifted position down a more
ergonomic<00:00:22.140> position<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.010> guess<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.369> could<00:00:23.519> say

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
ergonomic position I guess you could say

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.480 
ergonomic position I guess you could say
it<00:00:23.820> also<00:00:24.029> allows<00:00:24.390> me<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.869> my<00:00:25.050> e-brake<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it also allows me to have my e-brake and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.630 
it also allows me to have my e-brake and
my<00:00:26.609> shifter<00:00:27.060> separated<00:00:27.750> more<00:00:28.220> as<00:00:29.220> far<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.580> e

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
my shifter separated more as far as my e

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
my shifter separated more as far as my e
breaking<00:00:30.000> ship<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> actually<00:00:30.689> used<00:00:31.349> an

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
breaking ship to go I actually used an

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.350 
breaking ship to go I actually used an
old<00:00:31.560> BMX<00:00:32.099> peg<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.440> e<00:00:34.469> break<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
old BMX peg for my for my e break and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.650 
old BMX peg for my for my e break and
then<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.660> took<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.989> rubber<00:00:37.500> band<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.660> used

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
then I took a rubber band here and used

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.139 
then I took a rubber band here and used
it<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.870> hold<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> ebrake<00:00:40.800> forward<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it to hold the ebrake forward so it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
it to hold the ebrake forward so it
actually<00:00:42.420> gives<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.750> more<00:00:42.930> travel<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
actually gives me more travel and that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.950 
actually gives me more travel and that
extra<00:00:44.129> resistance<00:00:44.489> provides<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> really

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
extra resistance provides a a really

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.799 
extra resistance provides a a really
good<00:00:46.200> feel<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:47.910> shifter<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.570> went

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
good feel then for my shifter I went

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.380 
good feel then for my shifter I went
ahead<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> got<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.760> $15.00<00:00:50.760> autosome

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
ahead and I got a $15.00 autosome

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
ahead and I got a $15.00 autosome
shifters<00:00:51.840> cheapo<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:54.289> it<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.680> also<00:00:55.949> went<00:00:56.250> in

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
shifters cheapo and it I also went in

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.599 
shifters cheapo and it I also went in
and<00:00:56.640> filed<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.690> detents<00:00:58.260> inside<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and filed down the detents inside the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.970 
and filed down the detents inside the
inside<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> actual<00:01:00.600> shifter<00:01:01.020> body<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
inside the actual shifter body so the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.280 
inside the actual shifter body so the
shifting<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> quite<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.910> quieter<00:01:03.359> now<00:01:03.510> but

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
shifting is quite a bit quieter now but

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.859 
shifting is quite a bit quieter now but
I<00:01:04.320> mean<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.040> still<00:01:05.220> clicks<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.670> occasion<00:01:06.270> but

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
I mean it still clicks on occasion but

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.300 
I mean it still clicks on occasion but
once<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.200> driving<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.710> hardly<00:01:08.040> notice

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
once you're driving you hardly notice

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.219 
once you're driving you hardly notice
that<00:01:09.350> yeah<00:01:10.350> those<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.280> main<00:01:11.460> changes

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
that yeah those are the the main changes

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.740 
that yeah those are the the main changes
I've<00:01:13.229> made<00:01:14.330> as<00:01:15.330> far<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> CSL<00:01:16.170> seat<00:01:16.530> goes<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
I've made as far as the CSL seat goes it

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.950 
I've made as far as the CSL seat goes it
feels<00:01:18.750> really<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.270> fit<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.479> feels

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
feels really good it's a fit I'm feels

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.600 
feels really good it's a fit I'm feels
fairly<00:01:22.259> rigid<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
fairly rigid you know a little bit of a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.850 
fairly rigid you know a little bit of a
wobble<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.470> only<00:01:25.590> thing

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
wobble here and there the only thing

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.120 
wobble here and there the only thing
I'll<00:01:26.640> say<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.240> seat<00:01:27.509> cover<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.979> don't

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I'll say is the seat cover if you don't

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.620 
I'll say is the seat cover if you don't
sit<00:01:29.430> down<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> perfectly<00:01:30.329> every<00:01:30.600> time

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
sit down in it perfectly every time

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
sit down in it perfectly every time
you'll<00:01:31.049> end<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.259> getting<00:01:31.409> wrinkles<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.280> it'll

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you'll end up getting wrinkles and it'll

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.240 
you'll end up getting wrinkles and it'll
end<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.759> sliding<00:01:33.630> around<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.470> bit<00:01:34.799> but

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
end up sliding around a little bit but

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.870 
end up sliding around a little bit but
it's<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.329> big<00:01:36.570> deal<00:01:37.610> yes<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's it's not really a big deal yes so I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.130 
it's it's not really a big deal yes so I
figured<00:01:39.210> I'd<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.770> drift<00:01:40.770> run<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:42.140> road

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
figured I'd do a drift run on the road

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.499 
figured I'd do a drift run on the road
