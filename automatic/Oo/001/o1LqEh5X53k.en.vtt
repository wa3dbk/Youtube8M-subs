00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
started so this is my goal zero solar

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.350 
started so this is my goal zero solar
panel

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
panel

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.350 
panel
it's<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.690> Nomad<00:00:13.110> 20<00:00:13.849> so<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.030> 20<00:00:15.330> watt

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
it's the Nomad 20 so it's a 20 watt

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.920 
it's the Nomad 20 so it's a 20 watt
solar<00:00:15.719> panel<00:00:15.920> alrighty<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.750> my

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
solar panel alrighty so this is my

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.630 
solar panel alrighty so this is my
official<00:00:19.380> unboxing<00:00:19.650> right<00:00:20.189> here

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
official unboxing right here

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
official unboxing right here
I<00:00:22.160> think<00:00:23.160> that's<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> when<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.170> pull

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
I think that's it so when you first pull

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.410 
I think that's it so when you first pull
it<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.130> haven't<00:00:26.699> figured<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.300> this

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
it out I haven't figured out what this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.179 
it out I haven't figured out what this
is<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> already<00:00:27.930> did<00:00:28.170> open<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> get<00:00:28.800> received

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
is I already did open it I get received

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.860 
is I already did open it I get received
before<00:00:29.429> Christmas<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.029> hey<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:31.080> there<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.289> go

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
so with this guy you have a 12 volt car

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.270 
so with this guy you have a 12 volt car
adapter<00:00:37.500> apparently<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.860> let's<00:00:40.860> see<00:00:41.100> what

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
adapter apparently and let's see what

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.910 
adapter apparently and let's see what
else<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> back<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.440> gonna<00:00:43.590> show<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
else so on the back it's gonna show you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.910 
else so on the back it's gonna show you
how<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.399> works<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.940> right<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.829> there's<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
how it works so right here there's a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
how it works so right here there's a
sunlight<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:48.090> gonna<00:00:48.360> hit<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> solar<00:00:48.899> pin

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
sunlight it's gonna hit the solar pin

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.090 
sunlight it's gonna hit the solar pin
and<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.070> gonna<00:00:50.190> recharge<00:00:50.840> your<00:00:52.100> laptop

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and then it's gonna recharge your laptop

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
and then it's gonna recharge your laptop
or<00:00:53.280> device<00:00:53.420> whatever<00:00:54.420> maybe<00:00:54.629> sine<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> let's

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
or device whatever maybe sine is let's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.990 
or device whatever maybe sine is let's
get<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.489> open<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.850> up

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
get on with it so when you open it up

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.250 
get on with it so when you open it up
you'll<00:00:57.210> notice<00:00:57.390> there's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> pocket<00:00:58.109> right

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you'll notice there's a pocket right

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.479 
you'll notice there's a pocket right
here<00:00:58.609> start<00:00:59.609> off<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:01.309> which<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
here start off with that so which I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
here start off with that so which I
fixed<00:01:02.879> camera<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:05.540> yeah<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.290> go

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
fixed camera here yeah there we go

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.280 
fixed camera here yeah there we go
so<00:01:07.890> inside<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:08.400> here's<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.990> 12-volt<00:01:09.990> car

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so inside here here's a 12-volt car

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.460 
so inside here here's a 12-volt car
battery<00:01:10.880> cable<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.380> exactly<00:01:13.530> sure

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
battery cable so I'm not exactly sure

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.690 
battery cable so I'm not exactly sure
well<00:01:16.470> I'm<00:01:16.830> sure<00:01:17.040> I'll<00:01:17.159> figure<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.430> how<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
well I'm sure I'll figure out how it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.850 
well I'm sure I'll figure out how it
works<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.270> second<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> comes

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
works in just a second and then it comes

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.550 
works in just a second and then it comes
with<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> few<00:01:20.220> other<00:01:20.369> cables<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.409> one

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
with a few other cables so this one

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.440 
with a few other cables so this one
right<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:22.890> would<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.520> USB<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
right here would be for USB for the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.850 
right here would be for USB for the
phone<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:26.009> couple<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.340> Clips<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
phone and a couple little Clips and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.620 
phone and a couple little Clips and
don't<00:01:29.030> climb<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.240> these<00:01:30.710> because<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.189> break

go<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.379> once<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.129> have<00:02:17.249> those<00:02:17.430> out<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:18.389> is

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
go so once you have those out that is

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.390 
go so once you have those out that is
when<00:02:19.200> you're<00:02:19.319> gonna<00:02:19.819> take<00:02:21.920> one<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.040> these<00:02:23.129> guys

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
when you're gonna take one of these guys

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.530 
when you're gonna take one of these guys
out<00:02:24.109> right<00:02:25.109> here<00:02:25.230> okay<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.159> this<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> mini

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
out right here okay so this is a mini

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
out right here okay so this is a mini
solar<00:02:27.780> port<00:02:28.790> solar<00:02:29.790> port<00:02:30.150> okay<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.290> is

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
solar port solar port okay so this is

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.839 
solar port solar port okay so this is
solar<00:02:32.730> port<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.629> chaining<00:02:34.609> still<00:02:35.609> don't<00:02:35.790> know

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
solar port for chaining still don't know

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.470 
solar port for chaining still don't know
what<00:02:35.939> that<00:02:35.969> is

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
what that is

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.649 
what that is
so<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.170> port<00:02:37.469> for<00:02:37.650> power<00:02:38.419> still<00:02:39.419> don't<00:02:39.599> know

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
so the port for power still don't know

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.289 
so the port for power still don't know
what<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.519> USB<00:02:41.519> output<00:02:41.849> so<00:02:41.969> obviously

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
what that is and USB output so obviously

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.420 
what that is and USB output so obviously
this<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:43.019> only<00:02:43.200> thing<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.530> know<00:02:43.590> about<00:02:43.709> thus

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
this is the only thing I know about thus

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.240 
this is the only thing I know about thus
far<00:02:44.459> let's<00:02:45.419> go<00:02:45.510> check<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.900> okay<00:02:46.169> so<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.069> mini

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
far let's go check that okay so the mini

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.800 
far let's go check that okay so the mini
solar<00:02:47.519> one<00:02:47.790> which<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:48.389> guy<00:02:48.599> right<00:02:48.780> here

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
solar one which is this guy right here

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.280 
solar one which is this guy right here
it's<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.889> charge<00:02:50.459> guide<00:02:50.819> ten<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.900> exactly<00:02:52.139> sure

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it's a charge guide ten not exactly sure

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.899 
it's a charge guide ten not exactly sure
what<00:02:52.319> you'd<00:02:52.620> put<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:52.949> in<00:02:53.069> but<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.549> personally

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
what you'd put it in but I personally

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.199 
what you'd put it in but I personally
have<00:02:54.090> no<00:02:54.239> use<00:02:54.389> for<00:02:54.419> asthma<00:02:54.959> now<00:02:55.579> let's<00:02:56.579> see<00:02:56.819> oh

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
have no use for asthma now let's see oh

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.869 
have no use for asthma now let's see oh
okay<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.349> this<00:02:58.769> solar<00:02:59.010> port<00:02:59.310> right<00:02:59.489> here<00:02:59.519> the

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
okay so this solar port right here the

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.759 
okay so this solar port right here the
one<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.120> says<00:03:00.329> it's<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.750> chaining<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.409> mean

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
one that says it's for chaining I mean

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.319 
one that says it's for chaining I mean
you<00:03:01.980> could<00:03:02.129> chain<00:03:02.370> other<00:03:02.609> solar<00:03:02.909> panels

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
you could chain other solar panels

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.849 
you could chain other solar panels
together<00:03:03.659> so<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.109> how<00:03:04.349> you'll<00:03:04.530> connect

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
together so this is how you'll connect

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.640 
together so this is how you'll connect
each<00:03:05.040> one<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.609> this<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.750> solar<00:03:07.019> port<00:03:07.409> so

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
each one and this is the solar port so

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.099 
each one and this is the solar port so
I'm<00:03:07.889> guessing<00:03:08.310> right<00:03:09.209> here<00:03:09.540> if<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.989> have

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
I'm guessing right here if you have

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.080 
I'm guessing right here if you have
another<00:03:10.439> solar<00:03:11.040> panel<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.459> connect<00:03:11.969> these

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
another solar panel you connect these

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.500 
another solar panel you connect these
two<00:03:12.299> guys<00:03:12.449> like<00:03:13.169> this<00:03:13.430> beside<00:03:14.430> by<00:03:14.609> side<00:03:14.819> into

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
two guys like this beside by side into

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.349 
two guys like this beside by side into
each<00:03:15.659> other<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.489> that's<00:03:18.209> pretty

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
each other like that so that's pretty

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:18.740 
each other like that so that's pretty
cool

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
cool

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.439 
cool
and<00:03:19.220> USB<00:03:20.220> output<00:03:20.579> we<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:20.970> went<00:03:21.120> over<00:03:21.239> there

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
and USB output we just went over there

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.379 
and USB output we just went over there
so<00:03:22.229> it'll<00:03:22.859> give<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.159> some<00:03:23.370> directions<00:03:23.669> right

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
so it'll give you some directions right

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.749 
so it'll give you some directions right
here<00:03:24.689> everything's<00:03:25.169> pretty<00:03:25.409> bright<00:03:25.829> just<00:03:26.639> to

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:26.759 
here everything's pretty bright just to

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.249 
here everything's pretty bright just to
make<00:03:26.909> sure<00:03:26.939> that<00:03:27.180> you're<00:03:27.329> able<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.810> read<00:03:27.959> it

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:28.259 
make sure that you're able to read it

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.339 
make sure that you're able to read it

that says note keeper gear cool once
recharging<00:03:59.729> so<00:04:00.629> this<00:04:00.840> guy<00:04:00.989> right<00:04:01.139> here<00:04:01.169> the

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
recharging so this guy right here the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.170 
recharging so this guy right here the
some<00:04:02.189> of<00:04:02.219> the<00:04:02.340> cool<00:04:02.519> things<00:04:02.729> that<00:04:02.819> have<00:04:03.000> been

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
some of the cool things that have been

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.659 
some of the cool things that have been
able<00:04:03.530> or<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:04.829> would<00:04:05.069> want<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.430> do<00:04:05.549> with

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
able or that I would want to do with

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.959 
able or that I would want to do with
that<00:04:05.939> found<00:04:06.239> would<00:04:06.719> be<00:04:06.840> useful<00:04:07.259> as<00:04:08.189> if<00:04:08.849> you

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
that found would be useful as if you

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.390 
that found would be useful as if you
were<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.180> open<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.569> up<00:04:09.689> like<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.049> right<00:04:10.400> I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
were to open it up like this right I

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.809 
were to open it up like this right I
don't<00:04:12.090> know<00:04:12.209> if<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.359> can<00:04:12.479> see<00:04:12.689> it<00:04:13.129> okay<00:04:14.159> so<00:04:14.759> if

the way concerning weight of this thing

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.070 
the way concerning weight of this thing
it's<00:04:57.300> not<00:04:57.449> too<00:04:57.630> bad

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
it's not too bad

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
it's not too bad
you'll<00:04:58.500> get<00:04:58.680> used<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:59.039> it<00:04:59.100> I<00:05:00.110> mean<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.380> couldn't

solar charge for a smart phone in one
two<00:05:24.479> three<00:05:24.690> hours<00:05:24.979> I<00:05:25.979> guess<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.090> will<00:05:27.180> fully

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
two three hours I guess it will fully

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.310 
two three hours I guess it will fully
charge<00:05:27.510> up<00:05:27.900> maybe<00:05:28.849> so<00:05:29.849> there<00:05:30.720> we<00:05:30.870> go<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.199> I

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
charge up maybe so there we go and I

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.120 
charge up maybe so there we go and I
guess<00:05:31.470> for<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.680> laptop<00:05:33.110> charge<00:05:34.110> from<00:05:34.380> 10<00:05:34.710> so

guess for a laptop charge from 10 so
name<00:05:35.280> it<00:05:35.400> there<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:35.970> have<00:05:36.090> it<00:05:36.300> not<00:05:37.199> too<00:05:37.380> shabby

name it there you have it not too shabby
I'm<00:05:38.970> not<00:05:39.150> exactly<00:05:39.449> sure<00:05:39.659> how<00:05:39.840> much<00:05:40.139> this<00:05:40.320> thing

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
I'm not exactly sure how much this thing

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.330 
I'm not exactly sure how much this thing
was<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:41.120> think<00:05:42.120> it<00:05:42.960> was<00:05:43.020> named<00:05:43.530> were<00:05:43.680> from<00:05:46.340> 160

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
was I think it was named were from 160

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.550 
was I think it was named were from 160
to<00:05:47.510> 210<00:05:48.510> I<00:05:48.780> know<00:05:48.930> that's<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.260> big<00:05:49.409> difference

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
to 210 I know that's a big difference

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.550 
to 210 I know that's a big difference
but<00:05:50.099> maybe<00:05:50.750> 189<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:52.020> don't<00:05:52.199> know<00:05:52.289> why<00:05:52.409> that

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
but maybe 189 I don't know why that

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.409 
but maybe 189 I don't know why that
sounds<00:05:52.740> right<00:05:53.039> but<00:05:53.220> I<00:05:53.760> think<00:05:53.940> last<00:05:54.210> time<00:05:54.300> I

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
sounds right but I think last time I

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.830 
sounds right but I think last time I
took<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.630> look<00:05:54.810> at<00:05:54.960> this<00:05:55.110> in<00:05:55.289> a<00:05:56.030> Costco<00:05:57.030> that's

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
took a look at this in a Costco that's

how much was same ways so far I really

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.230 
how much was same ways so far I really

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
like it really like how compact it is as

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.610 
like it really like how compact it is as
well<00:06:03.419> I<00:06:03.690> mean<00:06:03.840> just<00:06:03.900> look<00:06:04.139> how<00:06:04.260> thin<00:06:04.440> this<00:06:04.560> is

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
well I mean just look how thin this is
