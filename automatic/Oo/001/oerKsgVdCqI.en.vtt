the runs we needed this win very badly
and<00:00:23.650> we<00:00:24.460> spoke<00:00:24.670> about<00:00:24.730> that<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.260> I'm<00:00:26.410> I'm<00:00:26.860> glad

and we spoke about that so I'm I'm glad

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.920 
and we spoke about that so I'm I'm glad
that<00:00:27.370> you<00:00:27.610> know<00:00:27.730> it<00:00:27.850> came<00:00:28.060> out<00:00:28.210> at<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.780> right

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
that you know it came out at the right

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:47.819 
that you know it came out at the right
time<00:00:44.550> well<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.750> be<00:00:46.900> honest<00:00:47.170> when<00:00:47.290> we<00:00:47.410> started

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
time well to be honest when we started

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.500 
time well to be honest when we started
that<00:00:48.040> we<00:00:48.700> we<00:00:49.570> did<00:00:50.520> speak<00:00:51.520> about<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:52.090> you<00:00:52.390> know

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
that we we did speak about that you know

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.080 
that we we did speak about that you know
that<00:00:52.720> we<00:00:53.050> might<00:00:53.230> be<00:00:53.410> 1015<00:00:53.860> runs<00:00:54.280> short<00:00:54.550> but<00:00:54.850> I

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
that we might be 1015 runs short but I

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.680 
that we might be 1015 runs short but I
think<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.800> lot<00:00:57.310> of<00:00:57.430> credit<00:00:57.820> must<00:00:58.030> go<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.510> way<00:00:58.660> we

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
think a lot of credit must go the way we

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.630 
think a lot of credit must go the way we
filled<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.260> today<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.710> think<00:01:00.040> we<00:01:00.130> saved<00:01:00.309> about

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
filled it today I think we saved about

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.240 
filled it today I think we saved about
20<00:01:01.300> or<00:01:01.480> runs<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.020> that's<00:01:02.470> what<00:01:02.710> we<00:01:02.860> discussed

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
20 or runs and that's what we discussed

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.880 
20 or runs and that's what we discussed
when<00:01:03.430> we<00:01:03.460> was<00:01:03.760> we<00:01:04.360> were<00:01:04.509> about<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.989> go<00:01:05.530> into<00:01:05.560> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
when we was we were about to go into the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.569 
when we was we were about to go into the
ground<00:01:06.040> for<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:07.390> fielding<00:01:07.719> and<00:01:08.579> and

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
ground for for fielding and and

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.330 
ground for for fielding and and
obviously<00:01:10.030> that<00:01:10.540> was<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:11.680> biggest<00:01:12.040> thing<00:01:12.190> you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
obviously that was the biggest thing you

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.880 
obviously that was the biggest thing you
know<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.640> was<00:01:12.850> if<00:01:13.150> we<00:01:13.360> compare<00:01:13.750> what<00:01:14.320> we<00:01:14.500> did

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
know that was if we compare what we did

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.160 
know that was if we compare what we did
better<00:01:15.100> than<00:01:15.370> Jenny<00:01:15.820> I<00:01:15.850> think<00:01:16.299> we<00:01:16.780> filled<00:01:17.020> it

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
better than Jenny I think we filled it

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.289 
better than Jenny I think we filled it
much<00:01:17.350> better<00:01:17.500> than<00:01:17.650> Chennai<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.790> obviously

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
much better than Chennai and obviously

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.300 
much better than Chennai and obviously
we<00:01:19.450> know<00:01:19.570> how<00:01:20.110> strong<00:01:20.470> side<00:01:20.770> they<00:01:20.979> are<00:01:21.010> and

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
we know how strong side they are and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.210 
we know how strong side they are and
it's<00:01:22.060> always<00:01:22.510> nice<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.720> beat<00:01:23.590> this<00:01:23.830> strong

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
it's always nice to beat this strong

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:33.040 
it's always nice to beat this strong
opposition<00:01:24.790> and<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.420> am<00:01:25.900> going<00:01:26.170> forward

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.990 

well<00:01:34.050> it's<00:01:34.230> always<00:01:34.740> nice<00:01:34.980> to<00:01:35.010> have<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.940> know

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
tall fielder at the boundary lines since

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.630 
tall fielder at the boundary lines since
the<00:01:37.950> boundary<00:01:38.220> lines<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.610> very<00:01:38.900> small<00:01:40.640> yeah

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the boundary lines are very small yeah

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.460 
the boundary lines are very small yeah
obviously<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.900> nice<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.320> have

these<00:01:43.620> guys<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:44.250> probably<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:45.570> know

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
these guys and they're probably you know

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.090 
these guys and they're probably you know
one<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.760> those<00:01:48.140> they<00:01:49.140> definitely<00:01:49.560> come<00:01:49.890> in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
one of those they definitely come in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.040 
one of those they definitely come in
that<00:01:50.820> category<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.510> in<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> best

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
that category you know in the best

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.410 
that category you know in the best
fielders<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.650> world<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.640> look<00:01:54.300> at

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
fielders in the world and and look at

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.900 
fielders in the world and and look at
the<00:01:54.510> way<00:01:54.680> he<00:01:55.680> took<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.070> brilliant<00:01:56.520> catch<00:01:56.700> of

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
the way he took that brilliant catch of

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.760 
the way he took that brilliant catch of
Hussey<00:01:57.300> probably<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.200> was<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.470> turning

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
Hussey probably that was the turning

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469 
Hussey probably that was the turning
point<00:01:58.800> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.220> game<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.670> from<00:02:00.119> there<00:02:00.300> onwards

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
point in the game and from there onwards

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.810 
point in the game and from there onwards
I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.500> everybody<00:02:01.890> chipped<00:02:02.160> in<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.550> row<00:02:02.700> he

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
I think everybody chipped in and row he

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.430 
I think everybody chipped in and row he
took<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> brilliant<00:02:03.479> catch<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.140> Tony

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
took the brilliant catch and of Tony

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.219 
took the brilliant catch and of Tony
that<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.920> also<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.550> mean<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.930> Dhoni

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that was also I mean I see and Dhoni

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
that was also I mean I see and Dhoni
you<00:02:07.800> know<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> know<00:02:08.280> when<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.119> going

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
you know you know when they get going

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.199 
you know you know when they get going
you<00:02:09.540> know<00:02:09.660> any<00:02:09.989> target<00:02:10.709> will<00:02:10.830> look<00:02:11.009> small<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.670> I

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
you know any target will look small so I

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.360 
you know any target will look small so I
think<00:02:12.780> fielding<00:02:13.530> was<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> main<00:02:13.920> reason<00:02:14.280> we

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
think fielding was the main reason we

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.550 
think fielding was the main reason we
won<00:02:14.520> today<00:02:16.310> well<00:02:17.310> there<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> bit<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:17.940> do<00:02:18.180> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
won today well there was a bit of do and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.949 
won today well there was a bit of do and
you<00:02:19.560> know<00:02:19.760> when<00:02:20.760> when<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.600> pressure

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
you know when when you have a pressure

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.470 
you know when when you have a pressure
of<00:02:22.350> scoring<00:02:23.280> 10<00:02:23.489> runs<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:23.850> an<00:02:24.000> over<00:02:24.270> then

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
of scoring 10 runs in an over then

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.570 
of scoring 10 runs in an over then
obviously<00:02:24.690> batsman<00:02:25.410> will<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.430> take

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
obviously batsman will have to take

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.770 
obviously batsman will have to take
chances<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.650> I'm<00:02:28.650> lucky<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.510> got

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
