00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.599 

okay<00:00:01.909> so<00:00:02.909> let's<00:00:03.149> try<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.540> one

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:04.609 
okay so let's try this one

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.160 
okay so let's try this one
Java<00:00:05.609> condensed<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.480> bottom<00:00:06.870> line<00:00:07.020> in

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
Java condensed and bottom line in

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.360 
Java condensed and bottom line in
structure<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.160> formula<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:10.370> personally

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
structure of this formula so personally

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.190 
structure of this formula so personally
the<00:00:11.490> first<00:00:11.730> thing<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.059> would<00:00:12.240> do<00:00:12.599> maybe<00:00:12.870> just

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the first thing I would do maybe just

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.379 
the first thing I would do maybe just
drop<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.469> bottom<00:00:13.889> line<00:00:14.040> formula<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.179> this

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
drop a bottom line formula you know this

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.990 
drop a bottom line formula you know this
is<00:00:15.540> easier<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:15.990> me<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> do<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.760> first

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
is easier for me to do so the first

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.210 
is easier for me to do so the first
thing<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.390> would<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.900> count<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.470> carbons<00:00:20.039> in

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
thing I would do is count my carbons in

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.470 
thing I would do is count my carbons in
my<00:00:20.250> longest<00:00:20.850> chain<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.170> two<00:00:22.560> three<00:00:23.480> four

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
my longest chain so one two three four

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:38.549 
my longest chain so one two three four
five<00:00:25.230> six

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.700 

and<00:00:39.559> on<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.579> third<00:00:40.850> carbon<00:00:41.269> here<00:00:41.929> there's<00:00:42.440> two

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
and on the third carbon here there's two

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.329 
and on the third carbon here there's two
methyl<00:00:43.190> groups<00:00:44.019> so<00:00:45.159> one<00:00:46.159> two<00:00:46.609> three<00:00:48.190> put<00:00:49.190> the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
methyl groups so one two three put the

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.779 
methyl groups so one two three put the
two<00:00:49.519> methyl<00:00:49.909> groups<00:00:49.940> in<00:00:50.979> then<00:00:51.979> we<00:00:52.100> go<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.309> four

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
two methyl groups in then we go to four

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.469 
two methyl groups in then we go to four
five<00:00:53.089> six<00:00:53.449> carbon<00:00:54.019> there's<00:00:54.289> a<00:00:54.379> methyl<00:00:54.739> group

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
five six carbon there's a methyl group

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:01.689 
five six carbon there's a methyl group
three<00:00:56.479> four<00:00:56.839> five<00:00:57.260> six<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:01.010> that's<00:01:01.309> that

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
three four five six so that's that

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.889 
three four five six so that's that
structure<00:01:02.359> in<00:01:02.510> bottom<00:01:02.899> line<00:01:03.049> one

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
structure in bottom line one

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.600 
structure in bottom line one
now<00:01:05.899> let's<00:01:06.170> go<00:01:06.350> ahead<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.890> condense<00:01:07.310> this

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
now let's go ahead and condense this

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.590 
now let's go ahead and condense this
structure<00:01:08.210> which<00:01:09.200> might<00:01:09.440> be<00:01:09.679> a<00:01:10.270> little<00:01:11.270> more

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
structure which might be a little more

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.260 
structure which might be a little more
straightforward<00:01:11.990> okay<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:13.700> just<00:01:13.759> squish

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
straightforward okay so you just squish

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.279 
straightforward okay so you just squish
the<00:01:14.630> ages<00:01:15.110> into<00:01:15.799> all<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.100> seats<00:01:16.399> okay<00:01:17.179> so<00:01:17.899> I'll

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
the ages into all the seats okay so I'll

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.770 
the ages into all the seats okay so I'll
show<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.560> what<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:18.770> mean<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.210> first<00:01:20.479> one<00:01:20.750> is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
show you what I mean so the first one is

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:33.760 
show you what I mean so the first one is
ch3<00:01:27.100> ch2<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.770> then<00:01:31.100> C<00:01:31.840> but<00:01:32.840> off<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:33.440> thing

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
ch3 ch2 and then C but off of this thing

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.710 
ch3 ch2 and then C but off of this thing
there's<00:01:33.979> no<00:01:34.190> anxious<00:01:34.729> but<00:01:35.030> there's<00:01:35.270> these<00:01:35.450> two

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
there's no anxious but there's these two

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
there's no anxious but there's these two
methyl<00:01:36.200> groups

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
methyl groups

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:49.389 
methyl groups
so<00:01:37.310> we'll<00:01:37.459> just<00:01:37.640> put<00:01:37.700> one<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.240> them<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:48.399> carbon

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
so we'll just put one of them to carbon

00:01:49.399 --> 00:02:06.910 
so we'll just put one of them to carbon
5<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:52.570> 6<00:01:53.799> CH

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.059 

I<00:02:06.950> think<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:07.940> key<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.929> something<00:02:09.530> like<00:02:09.860> this

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
I think the key to something like this

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.870 
I think the key to something like this
would<00:02:10.429> be<00:02:11.440> really<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.830> label<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> department

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
would be really to label the department

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.309 
would be really to label the department
one<00:02:14.150> two<00:02:14.330> three<00:02:14.540> four<00:02:14.750> five<00:02:14.959> six<00:02:16.540> because<00:02:17.540> then

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
one two three four five six because then

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.970 
one two three four five six because then
you<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.709> actually<00:02:19.090> count<00:02:20.590> when<00:02:21.590> you're<00:02:21.709> doing

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
you can actually count when you're doing

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.100 
you can actually count when you're doing
your<00:02:22.010> other<00:02:22.310> structures<00:02:22.970> where<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.690> actually

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
your other structures where you actually

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.130 
your other structures where you actually
are<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.890> this
