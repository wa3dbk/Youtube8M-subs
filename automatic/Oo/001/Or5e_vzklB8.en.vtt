00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.870
 clear to me very quickly 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.240

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.820
 in all restaurants where forgot our 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.680
 20 years of training followed to the

 very best things from the Netherlands and even 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.699
 out there 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.440
 then the city three years ago 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.990
 formats for themselves 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.320

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.290
 amazing new concept of the sea 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.690

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.430
 indicate celcius 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.770
 we will classify all dishes 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.200
 temperature zones so a group of 20 degrees 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.430
 group of 80 degrees angle of 100 tears 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.800
 and a group of quickly trusted 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.990
 the name two precedes celcius 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.580

 Confidence then cultures also to them 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.110
 calmly 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.400
 yes there we are in c former builds 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.880
 spinning tables 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.510
 a bit more luxurious on the other hand, sudden tables 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.230
 and on the front 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.230
 with the bar area 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.590

 for from 8 people to 150 people 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.510
 therefore approx 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.330
 clearly bolted for three years 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.430
 this place we are finally moving 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.530
 investment 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.790

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.830
 seat for standard stool 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.690
