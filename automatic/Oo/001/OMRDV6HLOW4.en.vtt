00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 but data from the chips there are delays 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.400
 physical and on strokes are called under 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.309
 relatively called latency of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.470
 memory and are measured in the cycle of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.330
 but I did not understand then 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.830
 I will explain in a different way and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.830
 I'm going to in this case 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.019
 to know the inside of the support and I'm going 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.599
 to sell my explain a little more than 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.289
 what is latency 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.290
 imagine that you are going to play the national team 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.870
 Jamaican 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.580
 and we have to prepare the dinner the poor 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.540
 home to have on television if the 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.300
 tampiqueÃ±os 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.680
 3d imagination of 55 points 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.010
 55 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.010
 the number 55 of the kitchen 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.230
 let's go with the snack 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:03.960
 at half past eight to seven and he sent 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 angel the angel will take in this case 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.600
 If I go, I will take 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.500
 all questions is faster 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.500
 someone or me 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.860
 to that we can define it as the tense 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.860
 latency is a measure 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.220
 and the production of memory have certain 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.520
 refresh crop 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.740
 then the time is in each 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.770
 of the stores memory is what you 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.950
 known as a 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.840
 alive to give it a more interesting turn 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.840
 we will give you a note 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.540
 it can be now 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.210
 in this case of 1600 trips 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.550
 I am a memory jaimes of 1600 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.970
 the frequency we are talking about is the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.970
 same 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.940
 to make this point and before 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.590
 out you have to count up to 5 1 2 3 4 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.290
 5 and you go out at the speed of 1600 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.330
 you take the coffee and before returning all 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.220
 the stories up to 5 1 2 3 4 5 pibes 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.430
 because it is a memory 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.500
 every time I am a memory there are 3 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.860
 I'm going to tell the actress 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.739
 is something triggered only language already as 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.480
 the paper interests when it is 3 1 2 3 and 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.450
 he remembered 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.060
 well it has the same different frequency 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.459
 memory the question is do they have more 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.459
 because she is the mother of the skirts 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.370
 then this gesture is precisely the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.310
 objective to define the latency between 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.520
 lower is better correct then 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.530
 starting on this subject the memories 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.570
 like for example also like what 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.120
 have the agencies and while we have 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.580
 a lower latency is going to be much more 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.820
 easy even if we have the same prudence 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.000
 correct then returning the subject of 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.790
 the standard four simple lines can you 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.150
 make it more rangel clarified get it before 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.040
 nothing more because of having hypers 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.290
 you will have a point of entry 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.350
 lowest latency what you believe and make it a 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.600
 more memory 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.890
 fast so I hope it takes very 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.970
 well then moving forward a little bit more 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.760
 the purpose of making a model and for 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.400
 what do I have to do inside obviously 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.400
 when I need I do a retouch 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.970
 thousand 915 can do two ways in 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.630
 manually or automatically 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.550
 to see first manually when 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.320
 they achieve themselves in a normal way we have it 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.780
 what do we do in 24 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.850
 components in the processor in the 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.980
 video card in the chipset and 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.019
 obviously in the memory part 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.890
 How am I going to do it good? 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.930
 to the virus 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.880
 that's why they mention that it has to be a 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.070
 woman cut in medium or high performance 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.370
 so that it allows me to enter the virus 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.650
 because if it's an entry platform 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.960
 many times the video has closed and not 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.670
 there is a way to make the new blockade 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.220
 finger 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.100
 I send shipments back to the processor to the 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.130
 video card to the chipset and obviously 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.790
 to memory once I moved it I have 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.250
 what to do 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.620
 obviously going down to confirm it and in 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.780
 this case to eliminate the performance 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.850
 I have to choose is a test of 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.240
 performance that goes by the name of 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.400
 think twice are literally 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.290
 some good videos let's see some 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.129
 videos that can be of carts that 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.589
 are playing or can be of nature 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:13.619
 but what these thinkers do is that 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:16.439
 they will express to the components is a 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:19.050
 synthetic test then express the 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:21.029
 components and at the end of the video gives you 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.610
 a happy marker is the game for this 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:25.709
 modification you achieve 10 points now 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.229
 no more again the processor again 

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:30.719
 the video card game again the 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.309
 bersa and now means 15 points 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.639
 now again the memory of the number 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:38.189
 calendar and a half 20 points 25 points and 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.769
 there I'm going up the performance I fear 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.000
 that does not happen when I exceed 

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:44.820
 parameters 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.750
 when it exceeds the parameters the system 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.970
 will work in a state 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.650
 What means of corven being and can 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.750
 be that in this case the machine does not 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.370
 It starts at that moment when it is 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.950
 running the video shaking on the 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.950
 blue screen or simply in this case 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.890
 this means that you have exhibited your 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.780
 Parameters thus people 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.840
 does an overclocking is very important 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.750
 bring a specialist 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.430
 where will you put in each position the 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.800
 two components and it will give you the 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.070
 performance where he has managed to do the 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.070
 best 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.960
 but then it will be your own 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.820
 integral of uneven one more device 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.820
 Beyond the production
