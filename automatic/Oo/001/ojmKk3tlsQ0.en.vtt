00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.540
 specifications according to what has been 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.549
 could the rumor no longer be the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.729

 megapixels an internal memory of 8 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.500
 as well as 16 gigabytes we go to the 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.330
 third news and this referring to 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.490
 samsung we are talking about that according 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.459
 a patent they would be entering 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.049
 also to the market the lenses 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.509
 Smart now we know that 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.880
 there are the google class is already 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.590
 introducing the new generation to the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.020
 second generation that supposedly was 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.789
 to those who have the ability to 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.560
 spend $ 1,500 as well 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.640
 they have to be invited for this 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.590
 second generation have to be 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.959
 invited by someone who has acquired 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.850
 the first version unfortunately 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.950
 we do not have someone that we 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.390
 I can recommend in case you 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.980
 know please tell him here in 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.269
 techno fanatic we are interested to 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.170
 see if we can do a review of those 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.840
 lenses so 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.670
 if someone of you has what 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.349
 google glass first generation here 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.150
 we need an invitation to 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.950
 this way we can perform the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.660
 unpacked and made respective 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.530
 it would be very interesting to do these 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.520
 good lenses the samsung lenses do not 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.830
 know when it would be presenting 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.540
 possibly next year but according to 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.030
 what has been observed within 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.520
 the patent these lenses would behave 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.950
 as a personal assistant they would have 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.840
 logically a front camera would have 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.819
 also the tractor or some buttons 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.340
 to be able to manipulate these lenses and 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.370
 I would be with what comes to be 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.530
 Built-in headphones and microphones 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.580
 there is no value on this part either 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.280
 because what they have done is 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.540
 patent their lenses we say in 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.040
 that they are developing have 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.470
 patented so that other companies then 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.330
 I do not know what I thought was something 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.280
 interesting is the fact that according to the 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.500
 information would be answered by 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.360
 half of a cable to the cell phone is not going 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.250
 to be wirelessly as in what 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.390
 that we see in google glass in 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.040
 this case you are going to have to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.180
 stay connected via cable to your 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.040
 device so that this way you 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.980
 they have the direct personal assistant 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.480
 in the samsung lenses the 2014 is going to 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.459
 be very interesting there will be a lot 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.859
 dress technology as they are the 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.390
 smart glasses watches 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.310
 smart that this year has been 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.260
 really the year of the watches 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.599
 smart but next year I think 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.150
 that is going to solidify this kind of 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.700
 products and in turn will include what 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.260
 that come to be google glass or the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.060
 smart glasses not only owl 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.280
 but from other brands fluid as per 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.049
 example already has its own lenses and 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.120
 smart people who will be introducing themselves to 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.709
 end of December hopefully we 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.540
 can send a sample to be able to 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.680
 perform already requested 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.260
 let's wait nothing more to December 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.150
 so that the lenses go to the market 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.409
 that they can not send it to 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.450
 can you perform the 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.889
 unpacked respective review but it's going 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.720
 to be very interesting anyway 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.400
 next year with respect to everything 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.680
 that comes to be dressed technology 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.540
 like what are watches and lenses 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.400
 smart 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.200
 we go with the fourth news that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.940
 possibly a rumor is a leaked 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.450
 draw your own conclusions 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.060
 we're talking about google and a possible 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.120
 8 inch tablet because I possible 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.790
 tablet according to several portals if you 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.280
 enter the android page go to 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.780
 to be able to visualize one of the images in 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.260
 where you find nothing miss a 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.460
 girl with a tablet that is not the nexus 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.010
 next you can see that 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.500
 physically it is not the nexus 7 and according to 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.390
 these web pages that have been 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.520
 investigating a bit the image has been 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.230
 make sure that this list is 8 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.850
 inches now something that is very 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.450
 interesting is that woods is characterized 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.580
 by last to filter some images 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.590
 by chance or by mistake in quotes 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.270
 I do not think there are mistakes in that kind of 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.650
 aspects such as the nexus 7 the 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.960
 person who was taking the photo together 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.610
 with a girl with links 4 please 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.010
 there were the girl of nexuses four the 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.500
 boy with the supposed nexus 5 in that 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.120
 moment and the photo is perfect captured from 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.250
 an angle where you can visualize that 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.500
 they say nexuses taking as conclusion that 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.880
 that's the new smart cell phone that 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.980
 is going to present this year 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.050
 I think a little expectation to people is 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.820
 with all the enthusiasm of nexus 5 and it was 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.290
 perfect in advertising I hate you because 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.880
 it was for me an advertisement because 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.710
 appeared on all the portals of 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.960
 technology and it may be that the same 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.620
 I would be kids doing with this tablet 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.240
 that according to these these web pages things 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.260
 portals say it could be the nexus 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.830
 8 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.240
 let's see again these are rumors are 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.400
 filtered in this case are also not 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.410
 filtered because everything is the image is 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.730
 keeps on the android website that 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.200
 if you 're going, they 're going to put them 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.480
 visualize that you are going to be able to take 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.800
 your own conclusions we go to the 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.020
 fifth news and this is very interesting 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.110
 referring to sonny and his devices 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.630
 expert since they just announced them 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.970

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.680
 which is the xperia z1 and the xperia 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.180
 ultra that they would be receiving or 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.550
 currently they handle what is 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.620
 Android 4.2.2 and the living would be 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.260
 receiving no 4.3 who had

 we talked about the xperia zzl and cdr would be 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.689
 receiving in these devices the 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.809
 it comes to Android 4.3 and the living

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.559
 operating systems do not know I repeat the 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:51.659
