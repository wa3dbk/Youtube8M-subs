00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.889
 so far, something had faded that did not exactly say he was 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.869
 always ready to make a movie with you again Euro 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.009
 the project will or will not or is there Fri 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.320
 Fri. 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.769
 whether the door 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.109
 okay i have to ask questions of course percent 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.529
 after Leo Aberer complements why American kids do not need any 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.699
 German children 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.909
 Helpers need a de 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.840
 how did the designs find the whole world 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 and the children have searched 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.159
 and try us all processes 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.079
 occupations 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.530
 because most important 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.640
 Character, so to speak, were in the arms 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 her two sons then 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.690
 an Indian - of course 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.260
 The best helper to find out how many children were if at all then 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.440
 select 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.700
 also around the 4000 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.760
 were asked 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.920
 who sends that says Wahlers send 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.720
 to create such loans over the sound 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.880
 I can imagine what that was of my work I had to say it 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.260
 Probably a tremendous courage to such a movie belongs 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.630
 at the train 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.410
 he can give it a replacement 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.640
 dpa b 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.670
 Marathon runners 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.400
 he explains Perry feat he calls for a quick thick clouds but I think 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.850
 So I was a bit before the boat did the Doctor WHO 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.270
 Has 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.960
 had been produced 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.260
 and far 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.370
 which was surprising for us all for the German film 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.960
 the great success I believe 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.590
 good to the consumers, I have the right one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.530
 to entrust such a story as the infinite story through 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.770
 to his other stations since everyone said that you can not do something 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.770
 we may also want to end it a bit 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.140
 if that annoying name arose with Michael Ende the author of the book 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.470
 "I do not think so today 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.909
 has decided to confess to the film 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.450
 Meters was also difficult at the moment because he has not seen the movie yet 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.649
 annoying personal and is always someone to Schattera it is indeed the movie 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.780
 had not seen yet but we think we got to the movie 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.720
 Werder already 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.240
 I often say that and I find that his defender Mamadou Emmanuel 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.470
 Laurent 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.710
 where can the money if that was already the idea of ​​Bernd Eichinger 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.560
 Movie has about 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.810
 60 million tasted is Ulrich Müller 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.760
 yes the state even the racetracks where the money comes from they have so much 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.310
 Money Melle would then of course rare in the country though 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.490
 It's so financially running that you can make any case of the world 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.349
 Percentage for the individual all countries of the world shown as the publisher 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.209
 must give an advance for the will and consequently must do so 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.949
 Sophie Dal make that at least close 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.289
 the pollution has come and now 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.929
 own 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:42.339
 m which is very rarely the train very briefly in the studio two weeks ago and what 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.469
 It's never been done that you can look behind the scenes like 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.469
 Things have been done there we have seen something with the 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:55.009
 Technology has nothing to do with it like the big one, for example, that suddenly turns up 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.799
 that was so impressive 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.849
 The stock of the cheerful Eichinger Prayer Lamo makes it a cheap one 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.890
 excellent reputation 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.610
 by Edda Weise work said yes 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.949
 I'll take a look at it 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:09.369
 like the big light in it this studio of the Bavaria Film Society 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.369
 desired breaks in I finds missed 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.909
 Thomalla 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.149
 wage increases 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.149
 9 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.439
 yes, I saw it as a thing 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.860
 the club is full of praise for the fairytale of this movie 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.849
 these are these animals like for example 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.089
 our racetrack here are all here as they are here «We 

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:44.430
 Everyone has us in Dessau 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.889
 formed in this 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.219
 decomposed 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.210
 Do you like to like you? 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.650

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.110
 the Migros earth 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.749
 Creatures the other animals too 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:58.339
 Hanau did you but I investor and in Miami how long have you been in Munich 

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.169
 worked 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.629
 also revealed here 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.240
 Thielemann two months 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.620
 the students become 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.789
 yes have arisen 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:06.879
 Dr 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.610
 also be Marta Beate game then 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.919
 Herdecke but IT like Most that would have tasted better 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.129
 www skionline Ideas of Letters East German is white is getting close 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.150
 slim figure 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.490
 Schweinfurt 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.490
 no breakfast 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.259
 a market share 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.509
 Karl thanks Zyl two and a half months 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.520
 but he expresses in vain St 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.449
 Euro it is a vegetarian 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.240
 Against the website probably in Miami they have no vegetables in human years 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.150
 the worst injured times 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.120
 KR 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.159
 all right 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.930
 Knight Rider 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.470
 he had doubts that the Tibetan found as his friend 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.599
 especially Android 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.839
 Eagle 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.550
 hahahaha Baghdad 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.969
 who is the best 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:07.539
 OK 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.759
 yes thank you very much i would like to ask one more questions 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.399
 Wolfgang Petersen has made the first major international film 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:19.520
 when was Sommerfeldt Eastern Europe year that Foht 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.900
 that he caused such a sensation in the whole world and now this » 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.900
 Cindy is a jump from a war zone 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.199
 in a fairytale movie 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.069
 The fact was that even his thing was his craft or be seen 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.749
 30 counters I would say yes not only that he is his son behind it 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:38.800
 so far 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.159
 to the ground 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.479
 but do not really make friends with the right words with their counterparts 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.479
 Nobody bothered about the premiere 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.610
 Also in particular was fallen in the moment there was 13 at the time 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.840
 single the moment I was in front of the TV with the logo of the infinite 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.400
 history 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.169
 that was really for me at first the main reason was the room 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.399
 removed 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.699
 I also really felt the format for myself personally 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:05.360
 Fabric the ground 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.669
 Brown he needs 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.159
 so to speak for my albums in the last weeks something 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:14.229
 so under nice positive force jump and give strength story 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:17.849
 4 not only for myself and then the Condor flies 

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:19.469
 to have to do 

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:22.469
 five of April is the premiere of what could 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.979
 Sixth was to be exact Sixth of April is the premiere 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.319
 and l 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:31.929
 Of course you could talk a lot about the risk with so much money 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:33.960
 Grefrath 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.319
 Of course you have the carousel and host for everyone involved 

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:41.179
 and bad for the German movie that the risk is not admission but 

00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:43.930
 That is the success that has been going on for the book 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.850
 and that this movie is all human 

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.740
 may that be the Forum Tech be thanked everything 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.040
 good second part 1 maybe we'll meet again on 15 April in Munich Bernd 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.050
 sharp every racetrack 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.610
 I'm really in love with Liebermann 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.610
 and I did not need routes so far and certainly not noble 

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:04.119
 goodbye he teaches
