00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.450 
in terms of degree of difficulty of the
judges<00:06:02.930> recognize<00:06:03.319> how<00:06:03.710> difficult<00:06:04.219> it<00:06:04.310> is<00:06:04.430> to

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
keep that rhythm and expression and

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.339 
keep that rhythm and expression and
actually<00:06:08.150> I<00:06:08.210> think<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.509> horse<00:06:08.659> is<00:06:08.840> going<00:06:09.080> with

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
actually I think the horse is going with

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.129 
actually I think the horse is going with
more<00:06:09.529> expression<00:06:10.159> now<00:06:10.719> certainly<00:06:11.719> warmed<00:06:12.020> up

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
more expression now certainly warmed up

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:12.550 
more expression now certainly warmed up
early

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
early

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.409 
early
yeah<00:06:12.770> really<00:06:13.159> warm<00:06:13.340> to<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:13.490> turf<00:06:13.759> and

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
yeah really warm to the turf and

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.070 
yeah really warm to the turf and
beautifully<00:06:15.050> in<00:06:15.169> time<00:06:15.379> of<00:06:15.499> the<00:06:15.560> music

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
beautifully in time of the music

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.370 
beautifully in time of the music
it<00:06:17.500> has<00:06:17.650> a<00:06:17.680> great<00:06:18.250> fun<00:06:18.610> leg<00:06:18.849> action

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
it has a great fun leg action

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.680 
it has a great fun leg action
which<00:06:21.010> of<00:06:21.310> course<00:06:21.340> really<00:06:22.000> complements<00:06:22.570> a

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
which of course really complements a

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.630 
which of course really complements a
rhythmical<00:06:23.410> music<00:06:25.980> yeah<00:06:26.980> that's<00:06:27.370> where<00:06:27.550> they

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
rhythmical music yeah that's where they

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.630 
rhythmical music yeah that's where they
almost<00:06:28.240> plot<00:06:28.780> on<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.020> spot<00:06:29.350> but<00:06:30.130> they<00:06:30.430> should

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
almost plot on the spot but they should

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.850 
almost plot on the spot but they should
never<00:06:30.940> go<00:06:31.360> backwards<00:06:31.690> or<00:06:32.110> appear<00:06:32.500> to<00:06:32.710> go

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
never go backwards or appear to go

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.910 
never go backwards or appear to go
backwards<00:06:33.400> and<00:06:33.520> you<00:06:33.640> could<00:06:33.850> see<00:06:34.060> um<00:06:34.360> just

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
backwards and you could see um just

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.180 
backwards and you could see um just
helping<00:06:35.670> the<00:06:35.760> last<00:06:35.940> few<00:06:36.210> steps<00:06:36.390> to<00:06:37.100> gather<00:06:38.100> a

helping the last few steps to gather a

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.989
