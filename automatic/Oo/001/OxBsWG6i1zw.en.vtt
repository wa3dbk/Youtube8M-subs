00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:15.509
 we come back 3rd gl of the witcher 3 on 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.820
 is always with two banks the black and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.770
 with two giralt shores that is behind 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.930
 with a magnificent font there we go 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
 fade to let the sun speak 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.680
 to let talk let's let the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.599
 sunshine coast so let's talk about the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.399
 technique of the game and the technique of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.090
 graphics maybe even some 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.520
 small problems 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.770
 this discussion will concern the version 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 ps 4 in debug version of course still 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.840
 once we saw a little bit turn the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.680
 pc version we will return so controversial 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 on the ikke gene for polemic mic 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 olala the witcher 3 was a strike 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.660
 compared to what we showed 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.789
 during the first trailer it's awful 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.140
 the game is beautiful but we are far from 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.809
 as beautiful as we had seen in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 the first shame videos this is a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.449
 woman and not really it's not 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.980
 really there is sales 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.420
 yes there have been some well 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
 obviously what I can tell you 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.080
 is that actually the game is less 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.340
 beautiful than what we had seen in the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.350
 first trailer is even obvious 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.909
 it's obvious the first trailer 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.350
 had some push options 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.290
 was maybe even more target 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 render what so called the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.850
 ideal versions of the game - the developer 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.700
 on psychopath machines the game 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.860
 and effect with its small time x is 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.650
 actually less beautiful it remains 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.659
 not less splendid very beautiful 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.790
 it is still splendid and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 I would say splendid for ps4 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.509
 the splendid also for a world 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.579
 open look here 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.159
 look look at it all as I 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.659
 were saying in fact in the test in the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.579
 first story I did on the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.649
 game the game is beautiful in his 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.970
 together he is actually a little 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.950
 little less when we focus on 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.500
 details including vegetation 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.259
 you see if I look a little here 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.479
 on the ground you see that it is then 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.590
 beautiful but it's not as clean as this 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.900
 we had seen the first times 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.090
 the grass and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.090
 and rather rough it must be said you 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.500
 see it's my sense without the texture 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.360
 it's always something that is 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.280
 who finally it's for me that's always 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.110
 been the element that is the hardest 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.380
 to do anyway greenery because 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.430
 that it's full of micro elements 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.770
 in fact it's a little bit the same with 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.270
 hair in normal times that's what 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.950
 is more complicated and often in the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.140
 games that have left the games that 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.160
 technically are a little weaker 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.810
 that's what feels the most what 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.670
 of course of course but as I 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.590
 said look here we run we can 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.590
 not decently complain about the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.650
 game technique here it is and we have a 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.520
 perfect example of what I would call 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.470
 the inconsistency of lighting 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.700
 the game is very beautiful actually when you 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.290
 see he puts us like that 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.120
 light effects with which gives a 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.790
 atmospheric side quite powerful enough 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.800
 to play with a little fog that 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.270
 see in the distance it's still quite pretty 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.400
 on the other hand there you see right away 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.630
 when it's less lit seas it's 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.310
 a lot less pretty you do not see these 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.440
 knowledge but vegetation 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.420
 while it is also due to the presence 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.920
 of a clipping years I want you see if 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.489
 I go forward and that the shadows go 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.989
 appear 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.700
 it's a little prettier you see that 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.470
 start a little it moves already it moves 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.880
 a little worse so the version the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.380
 version we have the debug version but I 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.930
 think the commercial ps 4 version 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.540
 also will be subject to clipping 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.890
 it's a pity but it's not dramatic 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.239
 for sure you do not have to have your eyes 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.230
 set on the horizon because you'll see 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.940
 the pop trees and we see we had 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.470
 but well frankly me I 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.180
 did not stop there what when and in 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.860
 the world you were good in there 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.860
 slumped made his taf 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.140
 I was left or the sweet mans to 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.489
 white malta a little plan I was a 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.290
 little bit more do we do the same 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.360
 thing that on the name this because you have 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.780
 a katla who goes the guy who wanted 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.299
 discuss 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.190
 good it's time to type the discussion 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.840
 discuss one is in the universe of the 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.670
 witcher he could he wait for you for 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.769
 I could talk but here I 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.019
 no time so you see this 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.700
 medallion we will let the chief chefs on 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.200
 has a problem 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.900
 what happens beyond that if you 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.439
 please as I passed 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.019
 and that's where the dialogues 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.280
 do I say drowning them I take advantage of this 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.930
 combat led level iv that I 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.009
 absolutely smashed a seat then 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.479
 how you were started with a 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.299
 small very fast qualifications 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.889
 called me excuse me maintain that allows 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.990
 also to address the technical side of 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.949
 fighting I'll go between decapitation 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.900
 sheaves of blood 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.360
 it's pretty good, huh look 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.259
 look at this attention to detail on the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.310
 creative aspers he is leaking cambalache 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.900
 is sprinkled is there you deny by the way 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.389
 rules that do not see at all what you have 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.190
 read do we go a good wine the powers 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.660
 we're going to control the magnet finally the stone 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.169
 and we will make a small joke 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.870
 back like that bin here's a laugh there is a 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.699
 constant attention to detail in a winner 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.780
 which is still very appreciable 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.430
 thomas say we'll do better 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.960
 very reason in the arm we remind that 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.580
 here are the pages of one 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.030
 risk of being something else than this 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.860
 that you see there it will not be alone in 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.120
 going through different all around 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.410
 attention there were stories that the 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.610
 framerate also there were stories 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.960
 of framerate are a few small 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.930
 framerate issues on this version 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.310
 especially when the climate is racing 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.599
 little since we can wish I'll go 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.190
 show just show the night one can 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.169
 always meditate in the game I'm going 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.520
 to meditate long enough until 9 pm 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.110
 see what gives this environment 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.150
 by night 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.970
 there are fairly regular thunderstorms when 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.370
 the wind chains the vegetation the ps4 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.440
 a little more a bit abrupt and she 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.460
 everything jumps a bit I find it nights 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.350
 are pretty pretty blonde 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.110
 we are really early in the beginning of 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.580
 night is ok it's pretty dark but it 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.560
 stay pretty I think the nights are 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.720
 a little too light unfortunately it's me 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.130
 stiff falls breakaway light this 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.300
 bagad and even the total night in the 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.100
 forests to be nice to have a small 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.270
 loupiote sorlin here we are on the 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.980
 hit luck and yes the neighbors had 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.380
 given that we still have all this so this 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.910
 what we are going to do is that I avoided 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.740
 to hit me a tree we're going to go in 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.510
 a city we will go to a city on 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.030
 will go to novi grad to show the 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.290
 second roles the concern precisely 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.850
 details and to show that the wound of 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.970
 the playstation 4 gets away beautifully 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.330
 well without loading time without 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.070
 messed up wen had during the season you 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.750
 come home in a city there is no 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.790
 charging time the only times of 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.880
 loading in play this happen 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.710
 so when you truce the game recharge in 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.930
 do not do to Gabon it's to backup 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.260
 so it's a little long at the castle 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.940
 it recharges the world in fact overcharging 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.180
 outright yes when you did so 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.100
 it 's going to take until web well 30 30 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.840
 30 to 40 seconds but already you do not break 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.010
 every two seconds in the game on 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.110
 following the bad unless you are very 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.280
 bad or at the site and angers l wait 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.110
 I will try to find my way 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.310
 dead no I must have I right there 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.940
 I'm not tidy by hand full 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.260
 so lakes that wrote the win the 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.580
 I also do the loading times 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.080
 more or less long when you use the 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.700
 fast moving system so he 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.410
 allows to travel from panels to 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.510
 signs the green ring down to green 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.130
 to go much faster so we go 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.450
 go to novi grad 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.790
 will you have a lot of things to 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.710
 show to novi grad have made a game 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.510
 to make a fourth g is a 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.310
 possibility that will happen in a 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.380
 big city you had something to show on 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.790
 is crazy finally fourth day of
