00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.640
 emergency 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.960
 My name is Ana, and my family is 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.359
 basically I came someone will vehicular 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 Your family is not a real family. 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:38.530
 This is absurd for many countries. 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.989
 they have not sculpted it, it's not even 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.199
 an issue this is not even one more 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.479
 problem is a reality with respect to the 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.540
 people's lives people are like this 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:52.330
 a lot of people this is how I 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.500
 I see news like this really is 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:59.170
 one thing that gives a certainty then is how 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.540
 if it was a stab because we 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.760
 we are a family like any other 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.130
 people have our things we have to 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.439
 Our house has more work, we have 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.270
 our day to day life in an arm is an arena 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.460
 discussion of national themes is not 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.860
 only a place of proposition of 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.290
 bills, which is not 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.640
 it is not possible is from this space 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.130
 of this mobilization 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.080
 You try to criminalize the posture. 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.580
 behavior of individuals by 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.150
 account of what they do with their 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.000
 affection and with your body has a mismatch 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.120
 growing more and more intense 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.210
 between what is our reality is the 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.050
 reality of civil society to them 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 proposes that they present that they will 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.490
 to vote as a bill is very 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.070
 easy to talk I do not have net prejudice 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.950
 act until I have friends who are just there 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.659
 When you have to deal with that? 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.180
 continuously the soap opera talent 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.890
 your house with your family having dinner 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.830
 appears dancing and kissing 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.900
 there you bother me you do not want to know 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.049
 What was a character to be a mother? 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.539
 single mother in the early 1970s was a 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.470
 chain case for example is a rose 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.560
 with love 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.040
 there were in 72 caused a controversy because 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.800
 You had a 50-year-old woman who was 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.290
 actor 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.170
 a diva who falls in love with a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.470
 boy 20 or 30 years younger than her 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.110
 or is this today as it is now if this 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.260
 like today but this shocked at the beginning of 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.270
 70's when that happens I believe 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.240
 that the most conservative people 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.120
 they do not even think the world is walking 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.830
 day the concept of family only with 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.720
 woman man changed 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.610
 There are children who do not have parents. 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.370
 children without mothers have children 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.310
 have two parents or two mothers do not think 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.190
 it's a super revolutionary thing but it's not 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.680
 good low traffic negotiable exists 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.370
 these kind of people are not that type 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:16.670
 couple is to exist new forms of family 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:20.750
 She is a mother and always asks Sergio. 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:25.070
 My husband is because he was not married. 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.150
 we decided not to go and choose the 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.400
 cm 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.489
 I thought it would be to 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.160

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.390

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.020

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:50.720

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:52.610
 mother living with such a girl 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.620
 I started dating my girlfriend in the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.820
 at the end of the 50's the son he thinks 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.100

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.560

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.890

 I was going to confess, the father told her. 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.120

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.590
