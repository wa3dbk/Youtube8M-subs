inches longer than my regular hair and I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
need use about four of them I don't use

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.030 
need use about four of them I don't use
all<00:01:15.000> ten<00:01:15.420> because<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> very<00:01:16.380> very<00:01:16.710> tiny

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
all ten because I have a very very tiny

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.320 
all ten because I have a very very tiny
height<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.360> my<00:01:18.659> hair<00:01:18.900> doesn't<00:01:19.170> need<00:01:19.439> all

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
height so like my hair doesn't need all

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.679 
height so like my hair doesn't need all
ten<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.360> them<00:01:21.750> set<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.460> four<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:24.659> are

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
ten of them set there are four there are

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.710 
ten of them set there are four there are
two<00:01:25.380> pieces<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> four<00:01:26.850> clips<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.540> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
two pieces with the four clips on it so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
two pieces with the four clips on it so
this<00:01:27.840> would<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.430> in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
this would go kind of like more so in

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
this would go kind of like more so in
the<00:01:29.610> middle<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.150> head<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.900> gets<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.439> like

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the middle of your head it gets you like

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.550 
the middle of your head it gets you like
right<00:01:32.070> around<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.420> two<00:01:33.750> four<00:01:34.290> pieces

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
right around so it's two four pieces

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.640 
right around so it's two four pieces
there's<00:01:35.250> two<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.630> ones<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:36.960> three<00:01:37.320> clips

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
there's two of the ones with three clips

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.600 
there's two of the ones with three clips
on<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.509> there's<00:01:39.509> two<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.159> ones<00:01:41.400> with

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
on them and there's two of the ones with

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.990 
on them and there's two of the ones with
two<00:01:41.880> clips<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.450> them<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.220> then<00:01:44.220> there<00:01:44.670> are

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
two clips on them and then there are

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.660 
two clips on them and then there are
four<00:01:45.930> single<00:01:46.829> clips<00:01:47.329> little<00:01:48.329> ones<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:49.020> this

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
four single clips little ones like this

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.330 
four single clips little ones like this
so<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.960> use<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.680> two<00:01:52.920> four

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so I really don't use the two four

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.880 
so I really don't use the two four
pieces<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.180> don't<00:01:54.360> use<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.140> single

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.700 
so that's the only time I wear it and
don't<00:02:33.390> worry<00:02:33.540> them<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> regular<00:02:34.170> basis<00:02:34.560> only

don't worry them on a regular basis only

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.460 
don't worry them on a regular basis only
because<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.340> don't<00:02:35.460> like<00:02:35.880> wearing<00:02:36.330> them<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:36.870> my

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
because I don't like wearing them in my

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.290 
because I don't like wearing them in my
hair<00:02:37.770> when<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.220> straight<00:02:38.580> as<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.120> see

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
hair when it's straight as you can see

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.240 
hair when it's straight as you can see
these<00:02:39.510> ones<00:02:39.720> were<00:02:39.960> all<00:02:40.140> previously<00:02:40.770> curls

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
these ones were all previously curls

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.880 
these ones were all previously curls
whereas<00:02:42.120> these<00:02:42.420> ones<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.870> don't<00:02:43.110> use<00:02:43.350> are

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
whereas these ones that I don't use are

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.610 
whereas these ones that I don't use are
just<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.400> straight<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.120> never<00:02:45.240> ever<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.500> I

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
just all straight so I never ever like I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.410 
just all straight so I never ever like I
want<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> do<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.490> straight<00:02:47.880> hair<00:02:48.120> style

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
want to do like a straight hair style

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.380 
want to do like a straight hair style
I'll<00:02:48.600> probably<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:49.380> use<00:02:49.470> those<00:02:49.830> ones<00:02:50.390> rather

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
I'll probably just use those ones rather

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880 
I'll probably just use those ones rather

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
what you curl them it's not that it's

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.880 
what you curl them it's not that it's
hard<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:56.030> straighten<00:02:57.030> them<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.680> I

hair that's down there so we just do
that<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.590> I<00:04:48.650> do<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.980> right<00:04:49.310> in<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.820> middle

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120

clip<00:05:32.600> right<00:05:32.630> on<00:05:33.050> top<00:05:33.260> of<00:05:33.290> that<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:33.770> it'll<00:05:33.890> be

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
clip right on top of that and it'll be

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.280 
clip right on top of that and it'll be
easier<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.550> it<00:05:34.640> won't<00:05:34.820> like<00:05:34.970> fall<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:36.080> then<00:05:36.260> I

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
easier and it won't like fall so then I

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.890 
easier and it won't like fall so then I
go<00:05:36.770> ahead<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.250> would<00:05:37.310> use<00:05:37.580> a<00:05:37.790> three<00:05:38.419> clipped

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
go ahead and I would use a three clipped

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.560 
go ahead and I would use a three clipped
one<00:05:42.520> just<00:05:43.520> like<00:05:43.700> so

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
one just like so

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.900 
one just like so
all<00:05:45.380> right<00:05:45.560> something<00:05:45.800> like<00:05:45.830> weird<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.730> other

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
all right something like weird the other

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.870 
all right something like weird the other
fungus<00:05:47.480> and<00:05:48.440> use<00:05:48.620> a<00:05:48.650> three<00:05:48.980> clip<00:05:49.190> one<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.700> clip

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
fungus and use a three clip one and clip

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.100 
fungus and use a three clip one and clip
it<00:05:50.060> a<00:05:50.270> little<00:05:50.660> bit<00:05:50.810> closer<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.410> the<00:05:51.530> ending<00:05:52.250> a

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
it a little bit closer to the ending a

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:01.230 
it a little bit closer to the ending a
little<00:05:54.110> bit<00:05:54.470> into<00:05:54.950> the<00:05:55.130> middle<00:05:55.550> part<00:05:59.169> like<00:06:00.169> so

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
little bit into the middle part like so

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.730 
little bit into the middle part like so
and<00:06:02.240> then<00:06:02.390> again<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:03.290> that<00:06:03.500> part

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
and then again to that part

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.499 
and then again to that part
just<00:06:06.430> like<00:06:06.580> that<00:06:06.819> and<00:06:07.030> you<00:06:07.120> want<00:06:07.270> to<00:06:07.300> make<00:06:07.479> sure

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
just like that and you want to make sure

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.249 
just like that and you want to make sure
it's<00:06:07.810> tight<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.590> secure<00:06:09.509> go<00:06:10.509> back<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.050> feel

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
it's tight and secure go back and feel

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:12.990 
it's tight and secure go back and feel
around<00:06:11.440> and<00:06:11.979> there<00:06:12.250> you<00:06:12.370> go<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:12.550> have<00:06:12.819> that

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
around and there you go you have that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.600 
around and there you go you have that
then<00:06:13.750> you<00:06:13.930> let<00:06:14.110> it<00:06:14.259> down<00:06:14.410> and<00:06:14.830> basically<00:06:15.160> the

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
then you let it down and basically the

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.240 
then you let it down and basically the
same<00:06:15.819> thing<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.630> I<00:06:16.660> would<00:06:17.020> do<00:06:17.169> a<00:06:17.470> two<00:06:17.770> clip<00:06:18.069> a

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
same thing so I would do a two clip a

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.330 
same thing so I would do a two clip a
three<00:06:18.580> clip<00:06:19.110> another<00:06:20.110> three<00:06:20.560> clip<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.069> then<00:06:21.250> a

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
three clip another three clip and then a

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.870 
three clip another three clip and then a
two<00:06:21.580> clip<00:06:21.910> finally<00:06:22.360> closer<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:23.289> the<00:06:23.440> top<00:06:23.880> just

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
two clip finally closer to the top just

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:38.820 
two clip finally closer to the top just
like<00:06:24.970> so<00:06:25.380> right<00:06:26.380> on<00:06:26.530> top<00:06:26.860> snap<00:06:27.819> that<00:06:28.150> in<00:06:37.830> and

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
like so right on top snap that in and

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.860 
like so right on top snap that in and
there<00:06:39.099> you<00:06:39.159> go<00:06:39.340> as<00:06:39.639> you<00:06:39.819> can<00:06:40.000> see<00:06:40.240> getting

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
there you go as you can see getting

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.879 
there you go as you can see getting
longer<00:06:41.409> and<00:06:42.340> then<00:06:43.180> finally<00:06:43.870> I<00:06:46.620> mean<00:06:47.620> you<00:06:47.710> could

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
longer and then finally I mean you could

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.740 
longer and then finally I mean you could
just<00:06:48.069> do<00:06:48.220> that<00:06:48.430> but<00:06:48.849> if<00:06:49.090> you<00:06:49.240> just<00:06:49.419> want<00:06:49.630> a

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
just do that but if you just want a

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.659 
just do that but if you just want a
little<00:06:49.930> bit<00:06:50.169> more<00:06:50.560> of<00:06:50.889> volume<00:06:53.310> can<00:06:54.310> we<00:06:54.460> just

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
little bit more of volume can we just

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:05.530 
little bit more of volume can we just
grab<00:06:58.800> do<00:06:59.800> the<00:06:59.949> same<00:07:00.190> thing<00:07:00.460> basically

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.810 

put<00:07:06.200> that<00:07:06.410> down<00:07:06.590> into<00:07:06.800> the<00:07:06.980> front<00:07:07.280> and<00:07:07.520> then<00:07:07.640> go

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
put that down into the front and then go

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.960 
put that down into the front and then go
ahead<00:07:07.940> and<00:07:08.180> snap<00:07:08.420> in<00:07:08.660> the<00:07:08.870> two<00:07:09.970> right

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
ahead and snap in the two right

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.150 
ahead and snap in the two right
basically<00:07:11.630> at<00:07:11.840> the<00:07:12.080> crown<00:07:12.410> of<00:07:12.440> your<00:07:12.770> head<00:07:15.160> you

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 
basically at the crown of your head you

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.460 
basically at the crown of your head you
also<00:07:16.520> have<00:07:16.940> to<00:07:17.120> be<00:07:17.240> very<00:07:17.480> careful<00:07:18.050> with<00:07:18.260> these

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
also have to be very careful with these

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.880 
also have to be very careful with these
because<00:07:19.480> when<00:07:20.480> you<00:07:20.600> do<00:07:20.810> curl<00:07:21.200> your<00:07:21.530> hair<00:07:21.770> it

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
because when you do curl your hair it

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.250 
because when you do curl your hair it
doesn't<00:07:22.100> lay<00:07:22.430> flat<00:07:22.880> rate<00:07:23.210> because<00:07:23.810> it<00:07:24.020> is

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.260 
doesn't lay flat rate because it is

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.580 
doesn't lay flat rate because it is
curled<00:07:25.480> so<00:07:26.480> you<00:07:26.570> have<00:07:26.720> to<00:07:26.900> make<00:07:27.050> sure<00:07:27.230> when<00:07:27.500> you

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
curled so you have to make sure when you

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.710 
curled so you have to make sure when you
curl<00:07:28.010> it<00:07:29.350> everything<00:07:30.350> is<00:07:30.530> still<00:07:30.830> covered<00:07:31.720> so

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 
curl it everything is still covered so

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.210 
curl it everything is still covered so
there<00:07:32.930> you<00:07:33.020> go<00:07:33.110> you<00:07:33.320> can<00:07:33.350> see<00:07:33.530> and<00:07:33.950> I'll<00:07:34.010> make

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
there you go you can see and I'll make

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.960 
there you go you can see and I'll make
just<00:07:34.250> thicker<00:07:34.760> my<00:07:35.000> hair<00:07:35.240> looks<00:07:35.570> and<00:07:36.790> just<00:07:37.790> like

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.170

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570 
also you can also like while you're

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.000 
also you can also like while you're
doing<00:07:47.900> if<00:07:48.140> you<00:07:48.230> know<00:07:48.350> I<00:07:48.380> was<00:07:48.560> like<00:07:48.710> if<00:07:48.860> it's

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.010 
doing if you know I was like if it's
