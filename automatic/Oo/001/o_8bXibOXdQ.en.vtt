00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
whoa-ohh we're doing robot try áthen and

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.440 
whoa-ohh we're doing robot try áthen and
so<00:00:13.950> what<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.580> you're<00:00:14.790> holding<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.240> this

so what is this you're holding is this

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.000 
so what is this you're holding is this
is<00:00:15.719> one<00:00:15.990> robot<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.619> do<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> whole

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
is one robot going to do the whole

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.050 
is one robot going to do the whole
course<00:00:17.310> actually<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> swimming<00:00:19.650> one

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
course actually this is a swimming one

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.230 
course actually this is a swimming one
unfortunately<00:00:22.369> robot<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> not<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.910> good<00:00:24.029> as

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
unfortunately robot is not as good as

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.009 
unfortunately robot is not as good as
human<00:00:24.600> being

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
human being

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.660 
human being
so<00:00:26.539> each<00:00:27.539> robot<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.740> activities<00:00:29.310> so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
so each robot can do one activities so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.110 
so each robot can do one activities so
this<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.269> for<00:00:30.570> swimming<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.940> we<00:00:32.940> have

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
this one is for swimming and we have

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.190 
this one is for swimming and we have
other<00:00:34.370> two<00:00:35.370> different<00:00:35.760> robots<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.930> for

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
other two different robots one is for

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.700 
other two different robots one is for
running<00:00:38.070> when<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.790> other<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.809> bicycle

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
running when the other is for bicycle

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.799 
running when the other is for bicycle
riding<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:42.059> long<00:00:42.210> did<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.450> take<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
riding and how long did it take you to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.990 
riding and how long did it take you to
design<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.410> three<00:00:43.710> different<00:00:43.860> robots<00:00:44.309> well

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
design these three different robots well

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.840 
design these three different robots well
uh<00:00:45.860> almost<00:00:47.239> six<00:00:48.239> months<00:00:48.829> and<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> tested

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
uh almost six months and have you tested

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.069 
uh almost six months and have you tested
them<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:52.050> home<00:00:52.350> yes<00:00:53.160> yes<00:00:53.750> but<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
them out and at home yes yes but you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.880 
them out and at home yes yes but you
know<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.030> condition<00:00:57.140> test<00:00:58.140> condition<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.649> not

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
know the condition test condition is not

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.319 
know the condition test condition is not
as<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.579> hard<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:02.430> place

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
as you know hard as it is in this place

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.200 
as you know hard as it is in this place
so<00:01:04.369> we<00:01:05.369> did<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:06.020> test<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.670> swimming<00:01:08.670> pool<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so we did like test in swimming pool and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.410 
so we did like test in swimming pool and
also<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:11.600> movie<00:01:12.600> studio<00:01:13.100> for<00:01:14.180> running<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
also like a movie studio for running and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.320 
also like a movie studio for running and
bicycle<00:01:16.140> ones<00:01:16.400> but<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.729> there's<00:01:18.000> no

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
bicycle ones but you know there's no

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.070 
bicycle ones but you know there's no
wind<00:01:18.689> or<00:01:18.930> current<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.250> anything<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
wind or current or you know anything so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.160 
wind or current or you know anything so
here<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.710> much<00:01:22.979> much<00:01:23.189> tougher<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.049> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
here it is much much tougher so this is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.270 
here it is much much tougher so this is
going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> little<00:01:25.710> more<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.070> real

I I understand that they have a week to
finish<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.770> whole<00:01:46.920> event<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.729> tell<00:01:47.909> us

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939

about<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> look<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:48.960> do

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
about what that's going to look like do

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.749 
about what that's going to look like do
they<00:01:49.380> start<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.520> them

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
they start with one or they do them

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.020 
they start with one or they do them
simultaneously<00:01:51.680> well<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.700> start

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
simultaneously well I think we start

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.920 
simultaneously well I think we start
from<00:01:54.240> swimming<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.969> after<00:01:56.969> he<00:01:57.570> finished

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
from swimming one and after he finished

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.069 
from swimming one and after he finished
swimming<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.340> berry<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.969> moved<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.750> just

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
swimming the berry is moved to just

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.399 
swimming the berry is moved to just
exactly<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> same<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.409> bicycle

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
exactly the same one go to the bicycle

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.469 
exactly the same one go to the bicycle
one<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.540> when<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.099> berry-berry<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.789> run<00:02:09.270> out

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
one and when the berry-berry is run out

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.589 
one and when the berry-berry is run out
we<00:02:10.110> recharge<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.160> use<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.180> same<00:02:12.420> one

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
we recharge it and use the same one

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.339 
we recharge it and use the same one
again

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
again

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.449 
again
and<00:02:13.590> keep<00:02:14.280> doing<00:02:14.609> that<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.480> they<00:02:15.719> spend<00:02:16.459> one

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
and keep doing that and they spend one

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.729 
and keep doing that and they spend one
week<00:02:17.700> Wow<00:02:18.719> and<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.049> noticed<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.409> these<00:02:19.590> are

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
week Wow and I noticed that these are
