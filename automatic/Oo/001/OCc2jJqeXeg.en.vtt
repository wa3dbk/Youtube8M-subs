00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.130
 the park is currently showing the whole 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.950
 spectrum of planting possibilities 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.380
 The ponds are dominated by a near-natural 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.169
 planting 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 It is combined with numerous ornamental 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.710
 Perennials for the shore area it is always 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.589
 again impressive as frugal 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.480
 cover the natural stone walls 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:45.000
 an alternative are for example such 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.780
 Roses from above the wall 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.780
 overgrown 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.330
 while they pray so many already 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.890
 impressive blooms will be in new 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.960
 Completed park areas always 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.180
 still planted and there is also one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.520
 new video for you we have at the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.070
 last time a series about swimming pond 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 Construction started and have come to the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.020
 I would like to lay the pond film today 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.030
 show them how to armor the foil 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.430
 like you can before the ultraviolet 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.260
 can protect the light of the sun and me 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.030
 I want to show you what you can do 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.610
 so that no segment on the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.500
 accumulates pond floor because that will be them 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.240
 guaranteed to cause problems 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.580
 Let's just have a look 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 resolution of the grown in winter 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.430
 filthy grass is largely 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.800
 completed 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.170
 in one of the last news videos 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.780
 we had shown the race 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.050
 happy and the short algae 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.149
 filament through the pond drive in the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.289
 Most areas is now 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.929
 completed 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.619
 the filters have the short thread algae 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:11.209
 collected the sight is again 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.209
 at 8 meters 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.010
 what's that supposed to be now? 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.650
 that it is one of the most common questions the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.110
 We are asked if visitors this 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.310
 see temple construction site 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.650
 It is not our first temple 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.270
 but set on what we mean by the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.550
 first and what we did with the first 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.110
 I want to do the second show 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.930
 the idea was born in the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.990
 connection with the construction of the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.390
 temple complex in underwater park with 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.310
 we have an effective lighting 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.650
 there a very unusual ambience 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.770
 created 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.950
 a little later that is complete 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.330
 disappeared under water 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.940
 many were sad that they were this 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.380
 We could not visit the facility anymore 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.710
 have therefore searched for opportunities 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.790
 an already planned building with one 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.620
 to combine such venue 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.540
 this construction site is making good progress 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.270
 in the immediate neighborhood of 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.290
 Underwater park and palms bistro is 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.750
 another aquarium room was created 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.790
 We have over 1000 tons of sand 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.030
 next to the concrete wall one over three 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.320
 meter high wall spilled in between 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.350
 the pond arises the terraces of the 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:37.090
 Hanges are now modeled the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.430
 Installation of the windows is prepared 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.440
 Through these five big windows one becomes 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.660
 not only be able to see fish in the future 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.340
 There are still scuba divers and 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.340
 practice diving course participants 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.560
 The underwater room is located below 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.319
 a seemingly aborted part of the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.910
 temple 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.700
 next to it is still largely 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.290
 intact part of the temple 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.340
 he looks like a scree avalanche 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.519
 shed 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.920
 but there are three levels on which one 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.390
 by torchlight the kitchen of the 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:17.200
 neighboring restaurants can enjoy 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:20.190
 later everything is greened and he jungle 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.190
 look similar
