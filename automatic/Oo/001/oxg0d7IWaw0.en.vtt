00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello guys from the greedy animated series 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.629
 man crossfire and we also have the game 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.130
 official that today I present to you we leave 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.440
 before showing the playing field from 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.360
 characters one of the two available e 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.740
 this personalized thanks to a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 plastic screwdriver we can 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.880
 intervene on the various parts of the body 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.320
 of the same dams we see how it is assembled 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.609
 very easily because then it is able 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.470
 to shoot balls that will then be 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.939
 the protagonists of the game and then a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.770
 dispute had a spring we can 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.700
 insert easily into the ma 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.600
 in this way 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.800
 here it is, so ok we also have a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.780
 ball loader to insert into 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.030
 this other way so and very easily 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.020
 not used while I'm shooting 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.840
 then aligned so it takes a moment 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.000
 to enter things because I have to understand 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.109
 here it is and we pay for balls like 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 these to be inserted inside the da 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.060
 man and as you see the first one is already ready 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.189
 in launch position after having 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.680
 easily squeeze the trigger with the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.939
 spring this way and the ball comes 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.570
 launched at high speed we will see it 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.670
 later in the game the game is 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.979
 interactive multimedia that makes me 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.159
 move directly from game to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.250
 virtuality yes to the virtual world as 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.080
 through the official app b from 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 but also free you can download 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.979
 with which you can also scan vi 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.759

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.710
 arrangement so also ok you see 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.229
 perfect with the layout too 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.790
 you have to register to be able to scan the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.159
 legislation does not provide for any e-mail 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.100
 only the choice of a name and a 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.320
 ok so in focus and a password 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.119

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.020
 in different modes or enter 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.040
 also one of the codes that come 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.450
 released for free inside 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.280
 of the packaging they allow 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.720
 also to play the game not only 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.100
 present on the app but also present 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.319
 online for the link 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.730
 look below in the description of the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.380
 video on youtube 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.489
 the game is very similar to what it is 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.140
 we're going to physically do it 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.900
 let's go then to choose the field of 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.190
 game you can choose playgrounds 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 different we choose a character and the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.290
 I always choose the first option 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.780
 available to speed up the video 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.680
 review not a upload i love le 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.910
 loading instructions we are still 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.459
 fire is exact 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.739
 ok aims at this point as you see 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.080
 jol da man who must try to break down 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.730
 all obstacles available when 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.280
 the strokes finish them reload in this 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.090
 way and then I find myself available 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.690
 also official shots to be able to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.110
 being able to throw ok move the hand towards 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.870
 here ok I start having to reload the shots 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.329
 sorry and started as you see to launch 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.760
 of the shots I then allow to buy 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.290
 acquire points this the game in 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.239
 virtual version as I repeat you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.850
 free so you have to buy the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.340
 play or necessarily have codes from 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.810
 playing these evidently helps me 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.120
 now let's go to the playing field for 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.730
 see how the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.989
 game with the stars from man cross car is so 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.610
 then on the playing field 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.829
 we therefore have two from but one in front 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.799
 to the other in the center we have the wall 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.489
 of blocks that we need to collapse 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.590
 proves to bring the glorious 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.959
 her opponent 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.690
 the door sees a 4 wins the game 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:48.040
 ok we are immediately at action 321 avenue 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.910
 1200 is right the way it made matesino a 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.319
 little everywhere 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.299
 so I recommend party customers 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.340
 they run away when you choose terry 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.019
 download as soon as possible 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.310

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.940
 maximum can keep our polar 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.519
