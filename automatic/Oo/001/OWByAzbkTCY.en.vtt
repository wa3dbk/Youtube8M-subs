00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.619
 welcome saun as dotcom in the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.390
 today's video we will show you how to draw 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.390
 two stars in a very simple way 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.110
 I'm going to teach you two very 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.340
 Simple to draw a star 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.870
 easily one would be 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.870
 make a line like that 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.840
 another to the other side diagonally 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.989
 and another here 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.219
 it was a straight here 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.670
 and the last one joining the two extremes that 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.670
 we are left 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.960
 I'm going to repeat it again faster 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.760
 diagonal line other towards the other 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.300
 another side that goes up straight towards what 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.790
 opposite to the opposite extreme and the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.890
 unite 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.050
 then once the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.110
 stars with a marker 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.530
 review and ice everything except the part 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.530
 central 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.369
 and with a rubber we would save everything 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.369
 it is in the center 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.380
 and the star would be this is one of the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.020
 other options that is even much more 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.740
 simple would be to do better with the pencil 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.740
 a triangle 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.630
 and once this triangle is made 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.630
 another one but the other way around 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.400
 and the same thing we will review with the marker 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.989
 - the central part 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.580
 and with the rubber we would return the inside 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.090
 as you see two very easy stars this 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.210
 last I've done has a two three 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.819
 four five six points and instead the 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.159
 previous only has five points 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.840
 I hope you liked it and do not let 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.840
 to visit us in a like dot
