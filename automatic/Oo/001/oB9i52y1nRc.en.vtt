00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.600
 how to install the jet pack mod of gta 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.400
 5 as I told you, it's not very difficult but 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.410
 I will teach for people who do not 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.630
 you know how this works of the mods 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.700
 then nothing we go to it the first thing 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.059
 what you have to know is where we have 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.000
 installed the gta as always explained if 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.790
 you have it bought physical if you have it 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.350
 you will have it as a social club 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.870
 post presents the club social expo 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.899
 then you will have it on this route if you do not 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.970
 change it clear when installing the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.670
 Local Disk Program Files ago 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.350
 rockstar games great clinical author 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.899
 this is where we will have to pass the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.910
 files it's worth to see now and if 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.340
 you have sting because you bought it is 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.870
 digital and the best contrast style 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.930
 is a key whatever and you have it 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.580
 here you will have also link files 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.330
 of the forum program 86 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.460
 steam estimates common apps and here you would have 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.300
 the grand theft auto the 5 and in my case 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.740
 As you can see I have the trace 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.620
 and if I had grand theft auto 5 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.330
 bought by steel I would have it here 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.670
 are the routes where you can not have 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.740
 the two possible routes where you can 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.810
 have the game installed come once 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.700
 we know we do not have to install the mods 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.800
 let's start downloading all the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.690
 necessary files as always all 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.730
 you will have these links in the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.010
 description of the video so that it is what 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.780
 as comfortable as possible then as you see 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.760
 we are here on this page has this 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.620
 occasion is not that you give five bots what 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.080
 we have another page that is French 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.750
 but well nothing happens that I am 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.580
 explain how it works like always 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.290
 we will need some requirements for 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.230
 can install the mod then in this 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.170
 case we need the writer and the script 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.210
 point of agreement then nothing we 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.480
 we will download the mode we will have here to the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.940
 This green button we give to roof here 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.190
 as a demon he pronounced in French and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.070
 we download the file is also worth 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.620
 I will leave you in the description 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.510
 characters that got stuck there 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 I will leave you in the description also the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.310
 link of the hop script and in the link of the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.790
 dot hop script is just the same 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.590
 to double 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.659
 and you download it is as simple as 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.670
 that then we're going to close this already 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.590
 because I already have everything downloaded what 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.340
 I have everything prepared and I have it here 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.590
 ok as you see I have the hop script here 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.629
 dot net I have the normal hop script and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.000
 I have the jack vale, let's put it like that 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.430
 so everything is in order and then 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.989
 nothing as I have taught before you go 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.549
 you where you have installed the 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.069
 game and in my case as I have it 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.010
 I bought it, it's worth it 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.019
 this is the route we have taught before 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.420
 then we're just going to start with 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.280
 the first one we will see is the normal one 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.590
 and as you see here inside we have a 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.989
 folder that is called a pin 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.680
 folder that is called bin we enter inside 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.870
 and as we see we have three files on 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.060
 native trailer is not necessary so that 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.489
 work is more as the name indicates is 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.650
 a trainer is worth I already have the files 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.150
 placed in the game but also the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.370
 I'm going to put it again so you can see it 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.049
 perfectly as it is 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.200
 we decompress it as you see with the 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.540
 winrar and we take the two files and the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.400
 we went to the folder of a placard in 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.560
 term in this case because I already have them 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.970
 as I tell you but you are the 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.790
 first time you have to install them 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.379
 we will replace any file 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.420
 then it's that easy and we install the 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.480
 spirit cop now we are going to go for the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.090
 next that is the point need to to win 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.700
 real and its advertising really good 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.099
 As you can see here we have two files that 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.340
 we're going to have to go to the folder 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.319
 game and also a folder that is called 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.780
 scripts as you see we take these three 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.920
 files these two files and the folder 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.739
 and for we went to the gta folder 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.629
 It's worth as you see, I have to replace 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.489
 again because I already have everything but 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.659
 you did not want to replace you here 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.849
 you are seeing what you have to do 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.090
 pass the two hot script files 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.370
 zone net and the scripts folder because nothing 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.500
 we are this that we already need and 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.380
 to install bases is so simple 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.910
 how to come here to the scripts folder 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.550
 you have seen that entry that starts from 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.349
 scripts and if you are already setting here 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.509
 we have the installed mode I'm going to 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.870
 put back so you can see how 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.430
 it would work but as you can see it does not 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.659
 no mystery we just have it 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.810
 what to put in the scripts folder 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:39.210
 he even comes here with him 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.830
 script hop dot net just in case 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.419
 we had but equally I have 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.040
 taught how you have to do to 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.960
 that you know well how to install 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.120
 this mode then nothing like you see 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.250
 entered inside the scripts folder 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.730
 here to catch the two files of the 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.820
 jetpack and the nif mods and I've passed them to 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.860
 the scripts folder of the game that yes 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.050
 yes everything we do talk about any 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.700
 exam that ends the video well then 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.220
 As you can see there is no mystery what 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.200
 what we have to do is catch 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.360
 what of the script and pass it to the folder 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.460
 Main game pass the script 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.530

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.760
