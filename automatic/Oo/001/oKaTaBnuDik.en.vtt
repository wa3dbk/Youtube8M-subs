00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
backpack and obviously helmet and then a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.090

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
I can't see at the moment other than

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.779 
I can't see at the moment other than
that<00:02:04.670> it's<00:02:04.880> really<00:02:05.240> all<00:02:05.539> repacks<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.789> only

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
that it's really all repacks the only

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.910 
that it's really all repacks the only
one<00:02:07.939> that's<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.239> little<00:02:08.450> bit<00:02:08.750> different<00:02:09.319> is<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
one that's a little bit different is the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.640 
one that's a little bit different is the
CAD<00:02:10.280> Bane<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.390> wasn't<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.050> one<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.530> was

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
CAD Bane now it wasn't the one that was

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.350 
CAD Bane now it wasn't the one that was
released<00:02:12.950> on<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> shadows<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.730> dark<00:02:14.120> side

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
released on the shadows of dark side

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.479 
released on the shadows of dark side
packaging<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.410> was<00:02:15.590> actually<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.220> original

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
packaging it was actually the original

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.940 
packaging it was actually the original
one<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.299> came<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.930> red<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.410> white<00:02:18.470> card

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
one that came on the red and white card

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.120 
one that came on the red and white card
I<00:02:19.069> believe<00:02:19.870> when<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.019> first<00:02:21.290> came<00:02:21.560> out<00:02:21.709> now<00:02:22.069> the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
I believe when it first came out now the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.530 
I believe when it first came out now the
thing<00:02:22.250> with<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.090> only<00:02:23.180> thing<00:02:23.420> they

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
thing with it is the only thing they

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.360 
thing with it is the only thing they

changes they added a couple of weapons
they<00:02:25.900> got<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.110> sniper<00:02:27.590> rifles<00:02:28.069> in<00:02:28.220> there<00:02:28.489> is

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
they got to sniper rifles in there is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
two regular pistols another pistol so

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.900 
two regular pistols another pistol so
really<00:02:33.230> not<00:02:33.380> worth<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.860> money<00:02:34.069> maybe<00:02:34.519> if<00:02:34.760> it

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
really not worth the money maybe if it

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.110 
really not worth the money maybe if it
was<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:36.769> shadows<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.220> dark<00:02:37.459> side<00:02:37.700> one<00:02:37.910> which

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
was the shadows a dark side one which

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.920 
was the shadows a dark side one which
came<00:02:38.360> with<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.630> todo<00:02:39.970> figure<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.569> isn't

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
came with the todo figure but it isn't

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.520 
came with the todo figure but it isn't
so<00:02:42.670> basically<00:02:43.670> these<00:02:44.480> are<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.870> three<00:02:45.260> figures

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
so basically these are the three figures

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.190 
so basically these are the three figures
that<00:02:45.920> are<00:02:45.950> brand<00:02:46.940> new<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.359> the<00:02:47.480> wave<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:47.989> kind

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
that are brand new to the wave it's kind

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.979 
that are brand new to the wave it's kind
of<00:02:48.260> weird<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.560> they<00:02:48.769> didn't<00:02:49.040> have<00:02:49.190> more<00:02:49.989> and

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
of weird that they didn't have more and

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.069 
of weird that they didn't have more and
then<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.350> rest<00:02:51.530> are<00:02:51.799> religious<00:02:52.690> repacks<00:02:53.690> but

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
then the rest are religious repacks but

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.990 
then the rest are religious repacks but
definitely<00:02:54.950> like<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.100> Clone<00:02:55.459> Trooper<00:02:55.489> and

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
definitely like the Clone Trooper and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.729 
definitely like the Clone Trooper and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
Phantom Menace line he was one of the

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.909 
Phantom Menace line he was one of the
harder<00:05:45.210> ones<00:05:45.389> to<00:05:45.569> come<00:05:45.750> by<00:05:45.990> one<00:05:46.349> of<00:05:46.469> the<00:05:46.710> ones

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
harder ones to come by one of the ones

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.420 
harder ones to come by one of the ones
that<00:05:47.069> was<00:05:48.289> last<00:05:49.289> in<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.860> wave<00:05:50.039> I<00:05:50.250> don't

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
that was last in the wave I don't

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.430 
that was last in the wave I don't
remember<00:05:50.520> if<00:05:50.879> I<00:05:51.000> got<00:05:51.300> him<00:05:51.569> when<00:05:51.900> I<00:05:51.930> collect<00:05:52.289> him

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.209 
remember if I got him when I collect him
back<00:05:52.650> then<00:05:52.889> or<00:05:53.219> not<00:05:53.460> but<00:05:54.349> he's<00:05:55.349> hard<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.650> get<00:05:55.979> by

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
back then or not but he's hard to get by

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.339 
back then or not but he's hard to get by
but<00:05:56.460> this<00:05:56.699> is<00:05:56.819> definitely<00:05:57.060> not<00:05:57.389> a<00:05:57.659> character
