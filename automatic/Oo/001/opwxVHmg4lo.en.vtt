getting up you can uppercut them out of
the<00:00:05.430> air<00:00:05.580> but<00:00:05.790> there<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> certain<00:00:06.450> timing<00:00:06.899> in

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
the air but there is a certain timing in

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.870 
the air but there is a certain timing in
which<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.649> could<00:00:07.830> do<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> jump<00:00:08.309> attack<00:00:08.580> if<00:00:08.820> they

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
which you could do a jump attack if they

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.299 
which you could do a jump attack if they
get<00:00:09.150> up<00:00:09.300> they<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.929> block<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.440> but<00:00:11.070> if<00:00:11.190> they

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
get up they have to block it but if they

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.339 
get up they have to block it but if they
do<00:00:11.460> an<00:00:11.610> uppercut<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.300> uppercut<00:00:12.750> takes<00:00:13.049> long

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
do an uppercut the uppercut takes long

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.780 
do an uppercut the uppercut takes long
enough<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.679> start<00:00:13.889> up<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> could<00:00:14.519> land

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
enough to start up that you could land

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.240 
enough to start up that you could land
and<00:00:15.000> block<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.529> what<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> safe<00:00:17.010> jump

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
and block so that is what the safe jump

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.040 
and block so that is what the safe jump
is<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.580> basically<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.150> way<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> make<00:00:18.900> your

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
is it's basically a way to make your

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.429 
is it's basically a way to make your
jump<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.439> attack<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.949> their<00:00:20.220> wakeup<00:00:20.699> situation

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
jump an attack on their wakeup situation

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
jump an attack on their wakeup situation
safe<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.710> yourself<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.820> Konica<00:00:24.210> vs

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
safe for yourself so this is Konica vs

from that he got beat up he got a
perfect<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.690> first<00:02:29.870> round<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.260> second

one<00:02:30.740> yeah

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
one yeah

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.760 
one yeah
looked<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.340> was<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:32.360> know<00:02:32.440> pretty<00:02:33.440> bleak

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
looked like it was you know pretty bleak

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.170 
looked like it was you know pretty bleak
but<00:02:34.010> then<00:02:34.130> he<00:02:34.220> started<00:02:34.580> mounting<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.030> comeback

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
but then he started mounting a comeback

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.210 
but then he started mounting a comeback
so<00:02:36.170> he's<00:02:36.290> got<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.560> take<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.860> ride<00:02:37.040> that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
so he's got to take that ride that

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.210 
so he's got to take that ride that
momentum<00:02:37.370> in<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:38.990> next<00:02:39.290> game<00:02:39.410> right<00:02:39.980> now

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.990 
yeah there was no and that doesn't have
to<00:04:06.440> be<00:04:06.500> blocked<00:04:06.770> hi<00:04:07.180> dad<00:04:09.640> how<00:04:10.640> could<00:04:10.790> be<00:04:10.850> hard

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
to be blocked hi dad how could be hard

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.400 
to be blocked hi dad how could be hard
for<00:04:11.120> her<00:04:11.210> to<00:04:11.300> find<00:04:11.330> opportunities<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:12.110> really

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
for her to find opportunities to really

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.110 
for her to find opportunities to really
set<00:04:12.620> up<00:04:12.740> some<00:04:13.490> mix-ups

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
set up some mix-ups

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.390 
set up some mix-ups
she<00:04:14.510> certainly<00:04:14.690> has<00:04:14.900> those<00:04:15.710> opportunities

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
she certainly has those opportunities

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.060 
she certainly has those opportunities
but<00:04:16.790> we<00:04:16.850> didn't<00:04:17.209> see<00:04:17.299> great<00:04:18.019> fire<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:18.530> all<00:04:18.799> time

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
but we didn't see great fire of all time

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.190 
but we didn't see great fire of all time
in<00:04:19.220> theory<00:04:19.400> sorry<00:04:19.730> jump<00:04:20.030> back<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.780> was<00:04:20.959> risky

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
in theory sorry jump back that was risky

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.200 
in theory sorry jump back that was risky
because<00:04:21.530> against<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.070> de<00:04:22.430> capper<00:04:22.790> they<00:04:22.940> could

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
because against the de capper they could

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.000 
because against the de capper they could
do<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.480> drill<00:04:23.780> in<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.080> air<00:04:24.230> that's<00:04:24.680> true<00:04:24.860> but<00:04:24.950> I

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
do a drill in the air that's true but I

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.770 
do a drill in the air that's true but I
think<00:04:25.250> he<00:04:25.400> just<00:04:25.760> walked<00:04:26.030> forward<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.540> jumped

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
think he just walked forward and jumped

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.630 
think he just walked forward and jumped
back<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.230> much<00:04:27.500> in<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.100> he<00:04:28.160> would<00:04:28.430> not<00:04:28.580> be

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
back so much in you that he would not be

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.900 
back so much in you that he would not be
charged<00:04:29.150> up<00:04:29.330> long<00:04:29.600> enough
