00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.170
 television we are also now like this 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.910
 that the reality of things was outside of 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.969
 the television shows and that's 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.380
 have plastic containers 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.089
 usually in the programs of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.250
 television we use crystal bonuses and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.230
 everything so you can see beautiful is the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.580
 product was not fair you know then 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.410
 holdings we are talking with what 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.300
 has exact with plastic it should not be 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.580
 well because they are bad this driver of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.519
 heat to us it touches if it is cold the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.470
 next to ok then number 12 that 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.030
 melt chocolate from 500 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.380
 grams or half a kilo 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
 we need to put it in a microwave 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.540
 let it be rotated and let's put it 45 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 seconds and we're going to hit him 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 45 seconds to be moving it until 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.670
 It completely melts ok package to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.670
 micro does not have to be the only 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.969
 for the tray so much then it does not 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.620
 I would get the melted chocolate now 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.320
 we have to check that I have good 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.320
 ruiz is a dive 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:14.070
 and then we are going to pour the 70 by 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.250
 hundred in the marble we are going to add the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.250
 in 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.580
 and then we are going to cut here 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:33.630
 well to spend a little bit not completely 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.630
 which is very beautiful 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.829
 we are going to use this which is a 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.890
 duck spatula is a spatula that 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.359
 antonia has a one detonation here 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.740
 then this is going to help us have 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:52.259
 control of things we are going to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.720
 earl scattering let's work 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.979
 making this chocolate crystallized 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.110
 what we need is 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.820
 crystallize the choco for 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.940
 thanks to that we are going to be able to 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.410
 work that gets hard faster 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.760
 we have to generate the crystals 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.500
 that in every particle we have to 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.539
 generate the crystals so that they collide and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.260
 re-tie if they always go to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.150
 to be where it is and they are going to crackle 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.190
 that we can have that crystallization is 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.480
 everything we do is very important 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.840
 chocolate we have to do this 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.640
 exercise to put it to do it because 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.860
 we do not have a budget 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.610
 huge or something like that if we do not have a paper 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.610
 electoral 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.170
 but we 're going to see you, you're looking for 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.270
 but if it is working with costs 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.870
 can use granite also that 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.880
 now our with what we are going to climb 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.770
 this is a very easy exercise I do not know anymore 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.209
 use that we have the exiles I 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.770
 I recommend that they are not of these - that 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.660
 they are very liquid but these are 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.920
 dry that you can work differently 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.690
 we were going to put 90 percent and 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.550
 let's make this movement 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.550
 as if you were a basketball 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.240
 scraped one or two or three I put on my paper 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.240
 and pushed two centimeters 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.240
 they are very rich percent they are juicy 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.250
 They are smile very good quality too 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.350
 they are well well cured they are well more 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.850
 closed however are dry by 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.160
 outside it looks better right of course 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.410
 then we go in the same doral but 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.230
 that we are not going to start 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.959
 we are not going to stretch because it's round if 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.850
 it would not fall our chocolate and as 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.880
 we put it on glass tables 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.410
 cut then I would roll here if 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.440
 needed 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.570
 which gives the recipe if you want more you 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.670
 I invite you to subscribe to the YouTube channel 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.860
 and so you can have with us our 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.860
 virtual recipe book when you need it
