00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:52.480 

my<00:05:22.189> dad<00:05:22.429> taught<00:05:22.639> me

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.640 

kind<00:05:53.120> of<00:05:53.180> obviously<00:05:53.990> this<00:05:54.140> is<00:05:54.320> just<00:05:54.560> the

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
kind of obviously this is just the

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.320 
kind of obviously this is just the
beginning<00:05:55.010> of<00:05:55.100> the<00:05:55.190> game

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.480 

and<00:06:01.020> like<00:06:01.260> I<00:06:01.290> said<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.680> graphics<00:06:02.340> are<00:06:02.460> pretty

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
and like I said the graphics are pretty

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.720 
and like I said the graphics are pretty
good<00:06:02.810> very<00:06:03.810> good<00:06:03.900> in<00:06:04.170> fact

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.510 

the<00:06:08.270> sound<00:06:08.780> effect<00:06:09.140> is<00:06:09.500> sound<00:06:09.980> the<00:06:10.130> sound

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
the sound effect is sound the sound

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.340 
the sound effect is sound the sound
effects<00:06:10.940> and<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.210> music<00:06:11.300> could<00:06:11.930> good<00:06:12.050> as<00:06:12.200> well

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
effects and the music could good as well

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:23.560 
effects and the music could good as well
let's<00:06:15.350> get<00:06:15.530> past<00:06:15.770> that<00:06:16.010> they're<00:06:22.540> okay<00:06:23.540> and

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
let's get past that they're okay and

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.450 
let's get past that they're okay and
then<00:06:23.840> I<00:06:23.900> got<00:06:24.080> my<00:06:24.200> new<00:06:24.410> tune<00:06:24.920> I<00:06:25.010> think<00:06:25.220> this<00:06:25.310> is

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
then I got my new tune I think this is

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:33.910 
then I got my new tune I think this is
my<00:06:25.610> 2099<00:06:26.890> version<00:06:27.890> of<00:06:27.980> spider-man<00:06:28.400> here<00:06:32.920> so

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
my 2099 version of spider-man here so

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.080 
my 2099 version of spider-man here so
I'm<00:06:34.040> gonna<00:06:34.130> pretty<00:06:34.430> well<00:06:34.580> leave<00:06:34.790> it<00:06:34.820> here<00:06:35.210> I

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
I'm gonna pretty well leave it here I

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.590 
I'm gonna pretty well leave it here I
think<00:06:38.090> maybe<00:06:38.780> just<00:06:39.050> showing<00:06:39.590> one<00:06:39.860> more<00:06:40.040> minute

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.120

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
and then we'll do another gameplay video

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.260 
and then we'll do another gameplay video
