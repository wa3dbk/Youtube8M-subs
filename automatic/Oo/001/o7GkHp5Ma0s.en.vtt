00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 very good people in this video we are going to 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.589
 make an air attack as he did 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.630
 previously the big account but 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.830
 now in the small account before 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.470
 start I wanted to tell you that the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.080
 install to the maximum with which we are going to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.520
 start 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.520
 to climb the town hall 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.900
 I feel will not have uploaded video from 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.610
 this account before 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.590
 we already have gems for the next 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.310
 builder that we are going to put now 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.120
 same 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.620
 the gems because I have achieved it very 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.170
 easy have been through the o2 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.380
 and by collecting gems boxes 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.920
 shrubs and so on and that's it 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.240
 come on I have not had to do what it is 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.180
 too difficult 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.130
 I've got things and dubs more 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.990
 almost unintentionally good 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.200
 to see what I'm taking for the air attack 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.100
 well I have 15 balloons to 2 and 5 archers 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.740
 the archers so that very simple with the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.360
 aerial attack always especially if it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.580
 use balloons and thorns must always 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.160
 to be made 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.200
 units to take out and kill the castle 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.930
 I have made five archers in my case 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.750
 which I think would be enough in 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.630
 castle took henchmen five minions and 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.630
 five archers to 5 and good 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.610
 I do not wear which is bad spells good 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.130
 all these robots me because of mines and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.280
 others and because it was buzzing with let's 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.280
 watch 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.790
 this village for example at low levels is 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.260
 very good to use the balloons although not 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.930
 let's have spells and be slow because 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.690
 for the simple fact that they have 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.760
 people do not have air defense and ground 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.590
 if they release many balloons 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.200
 it is almost certain that he does it is a hundred 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.080
 per cent easily let's start 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.090
 taking out the castle well does not have 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.090
 that does not have a castle is always good 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.319
 the bad balloons that you have is that 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.810
 they will fall enough with tower 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.159
 magicians that will annoy me enough 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.560
 but at the moment it has fallen as 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.690
 now the attack is practically 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.430
 fact 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.500
 already 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.590
 is to wait 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.170
 the village was loaded with resources is 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.290
 laden with resources that's good 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.740
 thorns because the pines and no more balloons 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.730
 because the thorns would act as a unit 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.890
 for communes as the archer payment for 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.740
 add score to add percentage 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.060
 the balloons go only by defenses what 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.290
 which is good 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.120
 for two aerial bombs but good 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.520
 pumps to them with the dogs you have to 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.820
 be very careful because they can kill 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.780
 to a group of thorns quite large and 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.840
 you can act the attack but good 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.010
 also say that with the balloons if not 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.349
 we have spells and so on 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.299
 you have to hurry, you have to attack 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.599
 fast always knowing where you're going to 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.280
 attack because the balloons will do a lot 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.870
 damage and all that but move slow 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.860
 slow as they are are very slow 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.460
 to see if anyone sees this hut over here 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.460
 but not 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.040
 as you see a very easy attack if not 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.350
 you have the good dog this attack without 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.970
 henchmen could have done the same 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.660
 archers to 5 have also not made great 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.840
 thing they have all died 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.140
 but good weisman have lived follow 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.730
 alive the six balloons more or less 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.690
 the cleaning services very well 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.690
 because they are very fast 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.690
 and they hurt 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.330
 giving the two do a lot of damage is 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.870
 move faster than balloons that's why 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.870
 I use them 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.230
 and it's a very good combination of balloons and 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.230
 dogs 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.090
 and at low levels it is very easy to do 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.829
 100% look at another achievement for the cabin and 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.709
 it brings me a pretty good booty and 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.350
 over 45 glasses that come very very 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.340
 all right 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.370
 good 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.820
 sweet victory look two achievements for 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.820
 most 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.510
 and the experience that never comes bad 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.510
 good 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.919
 at the town hall it is going up 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.349
 when they are when they are up when 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.150
 strange to the maximum the city council is 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.820
 have built and so on I'll make a 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.449
 video explaining 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.490
 what do I usually go up 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.069
 when I go up to the town council level 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.680
 why and all that is also worth a 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:58.849
 Village design for five municipalities 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.080
 and five and I'll explain a couple of little things 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.090
 of the town hall as the subject of 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.100
 Lightning spells and other 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.540
 to see I feel at war with this account and 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.540
 I will also make a war design 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.199
 of village boy for war 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.590
 and well that's all for today until the 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.600
 next 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.600
