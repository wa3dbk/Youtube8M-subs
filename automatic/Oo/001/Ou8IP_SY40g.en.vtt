80<00:01:26.520> well<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.210> necessarily<00:01:27.390> halfway

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
80 well not necessarily halfway

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.420 
80 well not necessarily halfway
considering<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> gets<00:01:28.890> hard<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> level

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
considering that it gets hard to level

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.010 
considering that it gets hard to level
up<00:01:29.520> when<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.060> high<00:01:30.240> levels<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:30.810> um

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
up when you get high levels but um

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
up when you get high levels but um
nevertheless<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:32.070> having<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.369> lot<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.520> fun<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
nevertheless I'm having a lot of fun a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.480 
nevertheless I'm having a lot of fun a
couple<00:01:33.540> things<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> talk<00:01:34.439> about

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
couple things that I want to talk about

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.550 
couple things that I want to talk about
would<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.540> fact<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.200> lot<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> people

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
would be the fact that a lot of people

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
would be the fact that a lot of people
are<00:01:37.829> calling<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.310> modern<00:01:38.729> warfare<00:01:38.939> two<00:01:39.299> point

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
are calling it modern warfare two point

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.899 
are calling it modern warfare two point
five<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.250> people<00:01:41.520> always<00:01:41.579> saying

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
five and you know people always saying

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.950 
five and you know people always saying
this<00:01:42.000> basically<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
this basically because they see the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.899 
this basically because they see the
trailers<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.430> graphics<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
trailers and they see the graphics and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.850 
trailers and they see the graphics and
stuff<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.360> does<00:01:45.509> look<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.960> lot<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.590> mine

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
stuff and it does look a lot like mine

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.649 
stuff and it does look a lot like mine
warfare<00:01:47.070> two<00:01:47.520> there's<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.240> things<00:01:48.509> in

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
warfare two there's a lot of things in

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.090 
warfare two there's a lot of things in
there<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.869> are<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.470> know<00:01:49.560> pretty<00:01:49.590> much<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
there that are you know pretty much the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.920 
there that are you know pretty much the
exact<00:01:50.460> same<00:01:50.700> graphics<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> same<00:01:51.630> engine

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
exact same graphics it's the same engine

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.569 
exact same graphics it's the same engine
from<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.140> referred<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:53.070> also<00:01:53.189> use<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> lot

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
from on referred to they also use a lot

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.460 
from on referred to they also use a lot
of<00:01:53.610> stuff<00:01:53.820> from<00:01:53.939> call<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.240> duty<00:01:54.540> 4<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.350> lot

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
of stuff from call of duty 4 and a lot

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.630 
of stuff from call of duty 4 and a lot
of<00:01:55.500> people<00:01:55.649> were<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:55.950> happy<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
of people were not happy about this I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.219 
of people were not happy about this I
think<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:56.939> wanted<00:01:56.969> kind<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.780> UH<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.020> newer

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
think they wanted kind of a UH a newer

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.709 
think they wanted kind of a UH a newer
game<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.640> jump<00:01:59.850> from<00:02:00.030> cod4<00:02:00.270> c'mon

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
game you know the jump from cod4 c'mon

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.179 
game you know the jump from cod4 c'mon
refer<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.290> actually<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> pretty<00:02:01.770> big<00:02:01.979> jump

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
refer to is actually a pretty big jump

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.800 
refer to is actually a pretty big jump
if<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.969> look<00:02:03.149> at<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> change<00:02:03.659> in

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
if you if you look at the change in

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.480 
if you if you look at the change in
graphics<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.320> change<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.710> pretty<00:02:05.460> much

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
graphics a change in pretty much

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
graphics a change in pretty much
everything<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.600> everything<00:02:07.079> was

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
everything it was just everything was

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.410 
everything it was just everything was
more<00:02:07.500> advanced<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.700> monomer<00:02:08.970> 43<00:02:09.300> it's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
more advanced and the monomer 43 it's

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
more advanced and the monomer 43 it's
not<00:02:09.509> necessarily<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> step<00:02:10.170> back<00:02:10.379> but<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.069> know

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
not necessarily a step back but you know

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.890 
not necessarily a step back but you know
it's<00:02:11.280> not<00:02:11.400> necessary<00:02:11.700> huge<00:02:12.060> step<00:02:12.330> forward<00:02:12.629> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it's not necessary huge step forward so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
it's not necessary huge step forward so
I<00:02:12.930> think<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.260> lot<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.410> people<00:02:13.530> are

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I think a lot of people are

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710 
I think a lot of people are
have<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.130> prehensile<00:02:14.400> about<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.030> didn't

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
have a prehensile about this didn't

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540 
have a prehensile about this didn't
really<00:02:15.870> know<00:02:15.990> what<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.140> think<00:02:16.230> about<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.950> I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
really know what to think about it and I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.830 
really know what to think about it and I
think<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.970> lot<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> people<00:02:18.150> are<00:02:18.390> kind<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.569> upset

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
think a lot of people are kind of upset

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.120 
think a lot of people are kind of upset
because<00:02:18.989> they<00:02:19.260> think<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:19.800> going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> be

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
because they think that it's going to be

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.949 
because they think that it's going to be
just<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.430> repeat<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.730> mine<00:02:20.880> warfare<00:02:21.060> two<00:02:21.360> now<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
just a repeat of mine warfare two now I

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.660 
just a repeat of mine warfare two now I
can<00:02:22.230> assure<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.500> guys<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.280> not<00:02:23.610> a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
can assure you guys that it is not a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.970 
can assure you guys that it is not a
repeat<00:02:24.150> amount<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.420> warfare<00:02:24.690> two<00:02:24.900> albeit<00:02:25.830> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
repeat amount of warfare two albeit it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.070 
repeat amount of warfare two albeit it
is<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.130> lot<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.640> modern<00:02:26.940> warfare<00:02:27.060> 2<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:27.989> I

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
is a lot like modern warfare 2 but if I

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.479 
is a lot like modern warfare 2 but if I
had<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.260> describe<00:02:28.410> modern<00:02:28.890> warfare<00:02:29.010> 3<00:02:29.190> i'll

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
had to describe modern warfare 3 i'll

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.190 
had to describe modern warfare 3 i'll
probably<00:02:29.760> say<00:02:30.150> perfected<00:02:30.780> modern<00:02:31.050> warfare

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
probably say perfected modern warfare

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.160 
probably say perfected modern warfare
two<00:02:31.500> now<00:02:32.270> again<00:02:33.270> I'm<00:02:33.569> not<00:02:33.720> saying<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.020> the

two now again I'm not saying that the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.110 
two now again I'm not saying that the
game<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:35.010> exactly<00:02:35.459> like<00:02:35.790> my<00:02:35.970> don't

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
game is we know exactly like my don't

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
a huge problem with there's no commando

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.850 
a huge problem with there's no commando

perk or anything like that but I have

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.160 
perk or anything like that but I have
noticed<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:18.090> lunch<00:03:18.329> distance<00:03:18.989> is

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
noticed that the the lunch distance is

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.680 
noticed that the the lunch distance is
kind<00:03:19.859> of<00:03:20.010> ridiculous<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.790> could<00:03:21.420> seem

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
kind of ridiculous I could seem

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.090 
kind of ridiculous I could seem
ridiculous<00:03:22.170> because<00:03:22.350> maybe<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.920> connection

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
ridiculous because maybe this connection

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.650 
ridiculous because maybe this connection
thing<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.640> lot<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.910> times<00:03:24.090> what<00:03:24.209> happens<00:03:24.269> is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
thing a lot of times what happens is

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.360 
thing a lot of times what happens is
people<00:03:24.870> think<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.709> they're<00:03:25.859> getting<00:03:25.950> 12

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
people think that they're getting 12

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.590 
people think that they're getting 12
that<00:03:26.489> from<00:03:26.609> long<00:03:26.760> distance<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.329> really

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
that from long distance but really

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300 
that from long distance but really
because<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.470> connection<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:28.950> just<00:03:29.130> lagging

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
because the connection is just lagging

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.920 
because the connection is just lagging
so<00:03:29.579> it's<00:03:29.730> showing<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.030> person<00:03:30.480> far<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.840> way

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
so it's showing that person far the way

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.539 
so it's showing that person far the way
than<00:03:31.109> they<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.500> are<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.890> that's<00:03:32.400> really

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
than they really are and that's really

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.370 
than they really are and that's really
you<00:03:32.730> know<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:33.000> person's<00:03:33.359> connection<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:33.959> you

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
you know that person's connection so you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.590 
you know that person's connection so you
can't<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:35.070> can't<00:03:35.280> judge<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.760> one<00:03:35.940> too<00:03:36.239> too

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
can't you can't judge that one too too

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.720 
can't you can't judge that one too too

put it back on to kind of the player
skill<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:18.900> one<00:04:19.320> way<00:04:19.470> they're<00:04:19.620> doing<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.010> is

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
skill and one way they're doing that is

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.680 
skill and one way they're doing that is
you<00:04:20.220> know<00:04:20.370> they're<00:04:20.609> they<00:04:20.940> made<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.389> the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
you know they're they made the the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.540 
you know they're they made the the
weapon<00:04:21.989> rank<00:04:22.229> up<00:04:22.380> system<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.830> lot<00:04:23.010> more<00:04:23.340> on

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
weapon rank up system a lot more on

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.520 
weapon rank up system a lot more on
complex<00:04:24.090> as<00:04:24.300> I'm<00:04:24.840> sure<00:04:24.870> most<00:04:25.260> of<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.440> know

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
complex as I'm sure most of you know

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.670 
complex as I'm sure most of you know
they<00:04:25.770> added<00:04:26.039> weapon<00:04:26.310> proficiencies<00:04:26.880> which<00:04:27.390> I

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
they added weapon proficiencies which I

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680 
they added weapon proficiencies which I
really<00:04:28.130> enjoying<00:04:28.580> basically<00:04:29.030> if<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.389> find<00:04:29.630> a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
really enjoying basically if you find a

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.730 
really enjoying basically if you find a
weapon<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.169> like<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:30.590> you<00:04:30.650> know

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
weapon that you like but you know

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.620 
weapon that you like but you know
there's<00:04:31.130> kind<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.340> one<00:04:31.580> flaw<00:04:31.880> with<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.600> can

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
there's kind of one flaw with it you can

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.450 
there's kind of one flaw with it you can
usually<00:04:32.870> fix<00:04:33.289> that<00:04:33.500> flat<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:33.949> then<00:04:34.039> make<00:04:34.280> that

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
usually fix that flat and then make that

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.340 
usually fix that flat and then make that
a<00:04:34.490> better<00:04:34.820> gun<00:04:35.090> for<00:04:35.330> you<00:04:35.419> but<00:04:35.930> it's<00:04:36.050> not<00:04:36.110> like

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
a better gun for you but it's not like

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.230 
a better gun for you but it's not like
the<00:04:36.470> proficiencies<00:04:37.070> are<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:37.400> crazy<00:04:37.610> you<00:04:37.789> can't

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
the proficiencies are so crazy you can't

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.640 
the proficiencies are so crazy you can't
use<00:04:38.419> a<00:04:38.449> gun<00:04:38.720> unless<00:04:38.900> you<00:04:39.169> have<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.380> specific

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
use a gun unless you have a specific

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.300 
use a gun unless you have a specific
proficiency<00:04:40.520> for<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.600> know<00:04:41.690> for<00:04:41.870> example<00:04:42.310> the

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
proficiency for you know for example the

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.460 
proficiency for you know for example the
UMP<00:04:43.970> has<00:04:44.090> really<00:04:44.300> good<00:04:44.419> up<00:04:44.539> close<00:04:44.570> but<00:04:45.289> if<00:04:45.380> you

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
UMP has really good up close but if you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.390 
UMP has really good up close but if you
want<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.680> use<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:45.919> little<00:04:46.009> bit<00:04:46.160> longer

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
want to use it a little bit longer

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.340 
want to use it a little bit longer
distances<00:04:46.820> you<00:04:46.970> can<00:04:47.120> put<00:04:47.240> range<00:04:47.479> on<00:04:47.690> there<00:04:47.900> now

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
distances you can put range on there now

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.290 
distances you can put range on there now
the<00:04:48.800> range<00:04:49.039> on<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.250> UMP<00:04:49.610> is<00:04:49.639> kind<00:04:50.210> of

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
the range on the UMP is kind of

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.760 
the range on the UMP is kind of
ridiculous<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.810> turns<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.139> into<00:04:51.289> kind<00:04:51.560> of<00:04:51.650> an

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
ridiculous it turns it into kind of an

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.379 
ridiculous it turns it into kind of an
assault<00:04:52.009> rifle<00:04:52.100> but<00:04:52.460> still<00:04:52.669> if<00:04:52.850> you're<00:04:53.240> facing

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
assault rifle but still if you're facing

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.120 
assault rifle but still if you're facing
someone<00:04:53.810> at<00:04:54.080> kind<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.440> medium<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.949> long<00:04:55.100> range

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
someone at kind of medium to long range

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.430 
someone at kind of medium to long range
and<00:04:55.699> you<00:04:55.759> have<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.000> UMP<00:04:56.330> with<00:04:56.479> range<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:57.050> they

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
and you have the UMP with range and they

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.129 
and you have the UMP with range and they
have<00:04:57.620> say<00:04:57.949> an<00:04:58.610> m4<00:04:59.030> most<00:04:59.600> likely<00:04:59.900> they're<00:05:00.050> going

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
have say an m4 most likely they're going

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.360 
have say an m4 most likely they're going
to<00:05:00.229> win<00:05:00.349> that<00:05:00.380> battle<00:05:00.710> if<00:05:00.889> you<00:05:00.979> guys<00:05:01.130> have

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
to win that battle if you guys have

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.640 
to win that battle if you guys have
pretty<00:05:01.610> much<00:05:01.669> even<00:05:01.940> skill<00:05:02.449> so<00:05:02.660> it's<00:05:03.080> not<00:05:03.259> crazy

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
pretty much even skill so it's not crazy

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.170 
pretty much even skill so it's not crazy
the<00:05:04.009> proficiencies<00:05:04.610> you<00:05:04.759> know<00:05:04.880> they<00:05:05.060> don't

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
the proficiencies you know they don't

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.150 
the proficiencies you know they don't
like<00:05:05.479> throw<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.110> know<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.500> gun<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.770> one<00:05:06.979> end

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
like throw you know the gun to one end

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.260 
like throw you know the gun to one end
of<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.340> spectrum<00:05:07.460> where<00:05:07.849> it's<00:05:07.970> super

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
of the spectrum where it's super

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.909 
of the spectrum where it's super
overpowered<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:08.930> if<00:05:09.410> you<00:05:09.500> don't<00:05:09.650> have<00:05:09.830> them

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
overpowered and if you don't have them

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.499 
overpowered and if you don't have them
on<00:05:10.039> it's<00:05:10.280> not<00:05:10.340> that<00:05:10.520> big<00:05:10.910> of<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.150> deal<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.360> mean

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
on it's not that big of a deal I mean

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.020 
on it's not that big of a deal I mean
it's<00:05:11.750> not<00:05:11.930> unusable<00:05:12.470> so<00:05:13.250> what<00:05:13.699> I've<00:05:13.820> seen<00:05:13.970> so

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
it's not unusable so what I've seen so

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.790 
it's not unusable so what I've seen so
far<00:05:14.210> is<00:05:14.539> that<00:05:14.570> there's<00:05:14.960> really<00:05:15.139> not<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.440> lot<00:05:15.560> of

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
far is that there's really not a lot of

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.219 
far is that there's really not a lot of
gay<00:05:16.009> stuff<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:16.789> mean<00:05:17.000> I<00:05:17.300> pretty<00:05:17.599> much<00:05:17.690> gays<00:05:18.020> the

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
gay stuff I mean I pretty much gays the

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.659 
gay stuff I mean I pretty much gays the
word<00:05:18.380> that<00:05:18.560> everyone<00:05:18.860> uses<00:05:18.979> so<00:05:19.280> might<00:05:19.430> as<00:05:19.520> well

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
word that everyone uses so might as well

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.339 
word that everyone uses so might as well
use<00:05:19.849> it<00:05:19.880> but<00:05:20.180> there's<00:05:20.630> not<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.810> lot<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.050> them

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
use it but there's not a lot of them

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.110

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
you know I've only been playing it for a

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.030 
you know I've only been playing it for a
couple<00:06:53.390> days<00:06:53.660> now<00:06:53.720> so<00:06:54.200> my<00:06:54.470> opinions<00:06:54.830> might

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
couple days now so my opinions might

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.290 
couple days now so my opinions might
change<00:06:55.280> and<00:06:55.490> I'm<00:06:55.580> sure<00:06:55.700> they<00:06:55.850> will<00:06:55.970> change

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
change and I'm sure they will change

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.850 
change and I'm sure they will change
because<00:06:56.540> a<00:06:56.720> lot<00:06:56.960> of<00:06:56.990> times<00:06:57.230> in<00:06:57.380> a<00:06:57.470> game<00:06:57.500> comes

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860

because a lot of times in a game comes
out<00:06:58.010> everyone<00:06:58.940> thinks<00:06:59.060> it's<00:06:59.300> great<00:06:59.420> and<00:06:59.660> then
