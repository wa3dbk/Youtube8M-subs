00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
across his chest it's going to be a left

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.370 
across his chest it's going to be a left
magic<00:00:54.460> hit<00:00:54.940> which<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.510> want<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.810> dodge<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.350> the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
magic hit which you want to dodge to the

magic hit which you want to dodge to the
right<00:00:56.680> foot<00:00:57.040> if<00:00:57.760> he<00:00:57.970> puts<00:00:58.240> his<00:00:58.420> right<00:00:58.450> arm<00:00:59.020> up

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230

in the air and comes down the center

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.229 
in the air and comes down the center
then<00:01:01.780> that's<00:01:02.050> gonna<00:01:02.290> be<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.560> sense<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.250> magic<00:01:03.670> so

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
then that's gonna be a sense of magic so

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.530 
then that's gonna be a sense of magic so
dodge<00:01:04.629> left<00:01:05.049> or<00:01:05.320> right<00:01:05.560> however<00:01:06.490> if<00:01:06.970> he<00:01:07.000> uses

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
his left arm then it's going to be a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.710 
his left arm then it's going to be a
right<00:01:10.420> magic<00:01:11.320> hit<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.890> hit<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.790> your<00:01:13.000> right<00:01:13.329> so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
you'll need to do a left dodge so

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.719 
you'll need to do a left dodge so
identifying<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.380> direction<00:01:18.190> can<00:01:18.400> really

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
identifying the direction can really

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.790 
identifying the direction can really
help<00:01:18.909> you<00:01:19.180> get<00:01:19.450> out<00:01:19.510> of<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.990> way<00:01:20.170> quick<00:01:20.500> enough

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
help you get out of the way quick enough

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.640 
help you get out of the way quick enough
by<00:01:21.070> dodging<00:01:21.610> when<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.690> comes<00:01:22.900> to<00:01:23.140> parry<00:01:23.440> in

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
by dodging when it comes to parry in

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.910 
by dodging when it comes to parry in
then<00:01:24.400> once<00:01:25.240> again<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.960> need<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.590> get<00:01:26.799> the

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
then once again you need to get the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.910 
then once again you need to get the
timing<00:01:27.220> right<00:01:27.549> and<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.690> means<00:01:28.960> wait<00:01:29.500> until

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
timing right and that means wait until

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.160 
timing right and that means wait until
the<00:01:30.100> magic<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.700> quite<00:01:31.000> near<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:31.570> before<00:01:32.020> you

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
the magic is quite near you before you

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.580 
the magic is quite near you before you
hit<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:33.220> when<00:01:33.820> he<00:01:33.940> does<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.330> right<00:01:34.540> magic<00:01:34.810> hit

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
hit so when he does the right magic hit

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.670 
hit so when he does the right magic hit
to<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.860> right<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.659> left<00:01:37.659> magic<00:01:37.960> hit

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
to the right and left magic hit

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.280 
to the right and left magic hit
horizontally<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.700> left<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.600> if<00:01:40.960> he<00:01:41.080> does

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
horizontally to the left and if he does

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.380 
horizontally to the left and if he does
it<00:01:41.500> down<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.830> center<00:01:42.070> then<00:01:42.790> do<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.060> vertical

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
it down the center then do a vertical

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.890 
it down the center then do a vertical
hit<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.470> as<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.619> say<00:01:44.979> wait<00:01:45.820> until<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.510> magics

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
hit and as I say wait until the magics

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.859 
hit and as I say wait until the magics
quite<00:01:47.200> close<00:01:47.530> before<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.280> hit<00:01:48.490> now<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.540> can

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
quite close before you hit now you can

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.350 
quite close before you hit now you can
do<00:01:50.049> a<00:01:50.080> combination<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:51.070> both<00:01:51.250> dodge<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.909> parry

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
do a combination of both dodge and parry

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.620 
do a combination of both dodge and parry
and<00:01:53.020> some<00:01:53.470> people<00:01:53.830> do<00:01:54.070> alternate<00:01:54.970> like<00:01:55.240> parry

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
and some people do alternate like parry

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.310 
and some people do alternate like parry
1.1<00:01:56.560> otherwise<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:57.880> can<00:01:58.119> parry<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.600> few<00:01:59.020> and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
1.1 otherwise you can parry a few and

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.030 
1.1 otherwise you can parry a few and
dodge<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.310> odd<00:02:00.460> one<00:02:00.760> or<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.600> my<00:02:02.140> case<00:02:02.439> I<00:02:02.770> like

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
dodge the odd one or in my case I like

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.969 
dodge the odd one or in my case I like
to<00:02:03.100> actually<00:02:03.580> dodge<00:02:03.880> most<00:02:04.270> magic<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.290> then<00:02:05.770> do

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
to actually dodge most magic and then do

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.639 
to actually dodge most magic and then do
the<00:02:06.130> odd<00:02:06.250> parry<00:02:06.670> if<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.450> find<00:02:07.810> my<00:02:07.990> timing<00:02:08.560> is

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
the odd parry if I find my timing is

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.640 
the odd parry if I find my timing is
going<00:02:09.009> out<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.479> way<00:02:10.689> I<00:02:10.720> can<00:02:11.019> catch<00:02:11.349> up

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
going out and that way I can catch up

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.280 
going out and that way I can catch up
