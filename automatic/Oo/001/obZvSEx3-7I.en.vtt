00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.910
 great desire for all guys I play 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.140
 mister rugby I bring this cool video 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.840
 fresh from the audience 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.520
 let's see immediately how to activate the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.990
 current this this map a 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.980
 little bit different than usual 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.059
 we have to activate 6 generators and all 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.430
 more or less the same way 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:33.079
 what is to activate one of the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.300
 three columns the central one of this 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.239
 crunch here is the goal is to 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.070
 survive during a certain phase in 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.710
 this time this invasion 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.280
 of Templars and Zombie templars 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.960
 time is marked by this blue bar e 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.500
 we must stay within this 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.420
 platform 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.760
 metallic that we find under a little like 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.130
 if it was a domain mode 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.690
 survived the necessary time yes 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.420
 will activate this thing that will kill everyone 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.430
 the templar zombies did this we will have 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.470
 active a component in this case was 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.660
 the quick and ride so let's see how 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.620
 practically part of the shock and mother yes 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.140
 activates the quick race 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.880
 let's move on to the second element is the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.500
 cash long rapporteur therefore there 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.960
 lets you activate the cashier here too 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.450
 same logic we activate the column 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.770
 time starts and we stay 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.650
 inside the piazza della 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.010
 metal platform we survive the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.260
 horde of templar zombies and do it once 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.780
 finished the time of Zombies Templars who 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.790
 remain will die because of the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.440
 this last we see in this case 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.869
 we have activated the cashier 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.190
 the third is the attention that nemo 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.530
 see how to activate speedy instead 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.399
 here too, a new one is activated 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.720
 generator that has as usual itself 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.229
 mechanism clearly for each 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.090
 component change the timing and one 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.950
 once this is done we will have the active 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.600
 speedy cola the other element is the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.070
 juggernaut of the same new logic 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.130
 we activate the central corolla 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.259
 survive ae Zombie templar up 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.539
 get to the end at the end of 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.759
 time we freed ourselves from these 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.979
 work from this last done this 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.590
 we will have active juggernaut again itself 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.090
 what among stamina prof 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.280
 I save you because so much the thing always 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.019
 the same and a little bit more 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.840
 interesting is the stick instead 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.000
 practically in this case we have 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.180
 to do with a component in reality 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.099
 of the stick we have with this procedure 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.810
 one of the components can be created 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.580
 so one of the plants is here 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.069
 this is done by activating the generator 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.900
 we could take it as a last treat is 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.910
 that I have to tell you that once 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.000
 activated all 6 generators we have 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.000
 fresh fresh tronto and usable the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.750
 pack up launches with renewed graphics 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.900
 very cool never seen such a thing 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.939
 wonderful and 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.590
 for the accuracy of the comes practically 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.000
 to add a piece to the pack a 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.920
 belly once active then for 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.540
 understand if this is the active image that 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.790
 you must see this from the pacan 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.290
 represents the fact that it is active 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.120
 the boys don't have to tell you anything else 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.470
 keep following us a nice like if 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.939
 you liked the video sign up 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.920
 because there will be so many other videos a 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.810
 regard and we will never stop until 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.880
 we will not debase your hello 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:21.560
 ma'am boys but how many years remain 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:26.860
 the first lie causin is that seen in 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.860
 salvation that no bishop just miur
