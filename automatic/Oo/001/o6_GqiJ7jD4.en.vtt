00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
I'm sure the paint's dry by now it's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.460 
I'm sure the paint's dry by now it's
been<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.699> least<00:00:26.730> 30<00:00:27.090> seconds<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.840> should<00:00:28.380> be

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
been at least 30 seconds and should be

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.460 
been at least 30 seconds and should be
close<00:00:28.650> enough

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
close enough

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.389 
close enough
all<00:00:31.470> right<00:00:31.619> let's<00:00:31.740> see<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.250> this

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
all right let's see if we can do this

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.690 
all right let's see if we can do this
this<00:00:32.610> time<00:00:40.309> almost<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.460> they're<00:00:41.640> supposed

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
this time almost like they're supposed

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.440 
this time almost like they're supposed
to<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.149> way<00:00:42.860> geez<00:00:44.030> you're<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.180> sliding

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
to be that way geez you're not sliding

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.869 
to be that way geez you're not sliding
them<00:00:45.629> back<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.020> forth<00:00:46.610> did<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.700> want<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
them back and forth did you want to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.160 
them back and forth did you want to
rotate<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.420> bit<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> make<00:00:48.899> sure<00:00:48.960> they

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
rotate a little bit to make sure they

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.580 
rotate a little bit to make sure they
set<00:00:49.379> her<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:50.840> they're<00:00:51.840> way<00:00:51.960> too<00:00:51.989> tight<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
set her up but they're way too tight to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
set her up but they're way too tight to
do<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> paint<00:00:54.840> line

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
do that well you see the paint line

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.400 
do that well you see the paint line
right<00:00:55.170> above<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:57.899> way<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> won't<00:00:58.170> rust

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
right above here that way I won't rust

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.760 
right above here that way I won't rust
right<00:00:58.680> when<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.920> ground<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
right when we ground it the way to get a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.509 
right when we ground it the way to get a
rust<00:01:02.010> trail<00:01:02.250> coming<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.789> block<00:01:02.910> covers

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that to happen you can see the she

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
that to happen you can see the she
should<00:01:20.040> spray<00:01:20.310> painted<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> intertubes

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
should spray painted the intertubes

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.679 
should spray painted the intertubes
block<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.850> next<00:01:23.850> time<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.000> got<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.540> can
