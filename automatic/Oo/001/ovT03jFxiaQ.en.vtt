can heal someone with a gentle nudge and
maybe<00:04:18.320> that's<00:04:18.530> all<00:04:18.709> they<00:04:18.829> need<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:20.660> think

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
maybe that's all they need and I think

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.839 
maybe that's all they need and I think
there's<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.380> place<00:04:21.590> for<00:04:21.620> for<00:04:22.190> acupuncture<00:04:22.760> in

there's a place for for acupuncture in

there's a place for for acupuncture in
that

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
that

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.550 
that
and<00:04:24.009> I<00:04:24.099> think<00:04:24.159> that<00:04:24.370> possibly<00:04:24.819> maybe<00:04:25.060> how

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and I think that possibly maybe how

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.189 
and I think that possibly maybe how
acupuncture<00:04:26.560> might<00:04:26.800> be<00:04:27.009> have<00:04:27.639> a<00:04:27.669> place<00:04:27.969> in<00:04:28.810> in

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
acupuncture might be have a place in in

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.179 
acupuncture might be have a place in in
Western<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.830> in<00:04:30.129> our<00:04:30.280> Western<00:04:30.610> world<00:04:31.139> my

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:32.189 
Western and in our Western world my

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.830 
Western and in our Western world my
observation<00:04:33.189> is<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.669> when<00:04:34.029> people<00:04:34.060> are

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
observation is that when people are

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.330 
observation is that when people are
suffering<00:04:35.999> they<00:04:36.999> will<00:04:37.300> look<00:04:37.749> and<00:04:37.990> ask<00:04:38.499> around

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
suffering they will look and ask around

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.279 
suffering they will look and ask around
to<00:04:39.789> their<00:04:39.939> friends<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:40.569> colleagues<00:04:40.840> and

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
to their friends and colleagues and

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.619 
to their friends and colleagues and
family<00:04:41.710> members<00:04:42.069> about<00:04:42.639> what<00:04:42.699> has<00:04:43.210> helped

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629 
family members about what has helped

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.100 
family members about what has helped
them<00:04:44.039> so<00:04:45.039> that's<00:04:45.249> generally<00:04:45.879> how<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:46.449> often

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
them so that's generally how we often

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.409 
them so that's generally how we often
will<00:04:47.349> have<00:04:47.529> referrals<00:04:48.129> next<00:04:49.029> I'm<00:04:49.120> going<00:04:49.300> to

will have referrals next I'm going to

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.429 
will have referrals next I'm going to
put<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:50.110> needle<00:04:50.490> in<00:04:51.490> both<00:04:51.909> of<00:04:52.120> your<00:04:52.300> hands<00:04:52.659> so
