so this is the 2015 flow chill these

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.980 
so this is the 2015 flow chill these
boards<00:00:08.370> have<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:09.059> they<00:00:09.179> call<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.599> BT

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
boards have what they call a BT

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.990 
boards have what they call a BT
technology<00:00:10.650> or<00:00:10.830> what<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.010> like<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.550> call<00:00:11.700> fake

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
technology or what I like to call fake

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.390 
technology or what I like to call fake
t-t-tech<00:00:12.570> there's<00:00:13.200> actually<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> bubble<00:00:14.070> on

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
t-t-tech there's actually a bubble on

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.220 
t-t-tech there's actually a bubble on
this<00:00:14.820> board<00:00:15.089> it's<00:00:15.240> right<00:00:15.420> here<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.839> some<00:00:16.080> other

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
this board it's right here on some other

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.540 
this board it's right here on some other
boards<00:00:16.529> they<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.010> different<00:00:17.160> places

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
boards they have it in different places

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.290 
boards they have it in different places
this<00:00:17.880> one's<00:00:18.119> perfectly<00:00:18.900> centered<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:20.300> it's

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
this one's perfectly centered and it's

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
this one's perfectly centered and it's
pretty<00:00:21.539> much<00:00:21.710> silicone<00:00:22.710> right<00:00:23.010> underneath

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
pretty much silicone right underneath

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.670 
pretty much silicone right underneath
the<00:00:23.699> surface<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> bottom<00:00:24.840> sheets<00:00:25.109> and

the surface of the bottom sheets and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.950 
the surface of the bottom sheets and
it's<00:00:26.010> actually<00:00:26.460> literally<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.330> same<00:00:27.660> stuff

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
it's actually literally the same stuff

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
it's actually literally the same stuff
that's<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.289> fake<00:00:28.500> tits<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.029> it

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that's in fake tits and you can see it

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
that's in fake tits and you can see it
wrinkling<00:00:30.480> right<00:00:30.689> there<00:00:30.900> when<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> camber<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
wrinkling right there when I camber the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.270 
wrinkling right there when I camber the
board<00:00:32.480> what<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.660> does<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.980> makes<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
board what that does is it makes the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.819 
board what that does is it makes the
board<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:36.000> slight<00:00:36.809> triple<00:00:37.320> base<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
board have a slight triple base so

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.069 
board have a slight triple base so
pretty<00:00:38.640> much<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.210> boards<00:00:39.450> flat<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
pretty much when your boards flat on the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.690 
pretty much when your boards flat on the
ground<00:00:40.320> there's<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.160> little<00:00:41.489> bit

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
ground there's going to be a little bit

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.880 
ground there's going to be a little bit
a<00:00:41.730> few<00:00:42.180> millimeters<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.989> raised<00:00:43.320> edges<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
a few millimeters of raised edges so

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
a few millimeters of raised edges so
when<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.129> board<00:00:44.430> sliding<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> box<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
when your board sliding on a box or on a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
when your board sliding on a box or on a
rail<00:00:45.989> you're<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:46.920> gonna<00:00:47.010> catch<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.489> edge

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
rail you're not gonna catch that edge

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.150 
rail you're not gonna catch that edge
also<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.570> saw<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> flexed<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.680> cambered

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
also you saw when I flexed it cambered

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.279 
also you saw when I flexed it cambered
it<00:00:50.280> wrinkled<00:00:50.789> those<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.840> kind<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.110> does

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
it wrinkled those what that kind of does

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.920 
it wrinkled those what that kind of does
is<00:00:52.440> lock<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> boardslide<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:53.930> so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
is lock you on a boardslide as well so

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.090 
is lock you on a boardslide as well so
this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.610> 2015<00:00:56.610> float<00:00:57.480> chill<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.199> 156

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
this is the 2015 float chill this is 156

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.779 
this is the 2015 float chill this is 156
centimeter<00:00:59.550> board<00:01:00.770> it's<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.309> reverse

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
centimeter board it's got a reverse

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.280 
centimeter board it's got a reverse
camber<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> center<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.049> regular

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
camber in the center and then regular

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.789 
camber in the center and then regular
camber<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.939> insert<00:01:06.450> area<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.020> about<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
camber in the insert area and about to

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:17.100 
camber in the insert area and about to
do<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> Flex<00:01:08.280> test

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.290 

all<00:01:17.830> right<00:01:17.980> so<00:01:18.130> when<00:01:18.250> I'm<00:01:18.340> doing<00:01:18.610> my<00:01:18.640> flex<00:01:19.030> test

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
all right so when I'm doing my flex test

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.900 
all right so when I'm doing my flex test
what<00:01:19.480> I<00:01:19.510> like<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.870> do<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.110> just<00:01:20.140> kind<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.560> lean

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
what I like to do is just kind of lean

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.290 
what I like to do is just kind of lean
with<00:01:21.910> my<00:01:22.090> bodyweight<00:01:22.510> not<00:01:23.140> really<00:01:23.470> trying

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
with my bodyweight not really trying

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.230 
with my bodyweight not really trying
this<00:01:25.300> is<00:01:25.450> just<00:01:26.220> 175<00:01:27.220> pounds<00:01:27.670> leaning<00:01:28.000> on<00:01:28.120> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
this is just 175 pounds leaning on the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.380 
this is just 175 pounds leaning on the
tail<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:29.490> leaning<00:01:30.490> on<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.700> tip<00:01:30.910> I'm<00:01:31.120> trying

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
tail and leaning on the tip I'm trying

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.660 
tail and leaning on the tip I'm trying
not<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.660> pull<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.080> past<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.440> point<00:01:32.680> where<00:01:32.920> it's

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
not to pull it past a point where it's

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.430 
not to pull it past a point where it's
struggling<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.330> get<00:01:34.450> back<00:01:34.600> down<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.140> this<00:01:35.290> is

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
struggling to get back down so this is

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.370 
struggling to get back down so this is
just<00:01:35.590> kind<00:01:35.710> of<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:36.010> lazy<00:01:36.510> chill<00:01:37.510> point<00:01:37.780> I'm

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
just kind of a lazy chill point I'm

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.219 
just kind of a lazy chill point I'm
already<00:01:38.620> feeling<00:01:38.860> some<00:01:39.220> really<00:01:40.229> powerfully

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
already feeling some really powerfully

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.960 
already feeling some really powerfully
stiff<00:01:41.500> zones<00:01:41.800> in<00:01:42.040> here<00:01:42.220> especially<00:01:42.430> right<00:01:42.850> at

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
stiff zones in here especially right at

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.390 
stiff zones in here especially right at
the<00:01:43.090> start<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.570> Flex<00:01:43.840> it's<00:01:44.050> almost<00:01:44.400> harder

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
the start of the Flex it's almost harder

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.490 
the start of the Flex it's almost harder
to<00:01:45.520> start<00:01:45.760> flexing<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.330> than<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.900> once

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
to start flexing it than it is to once

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.840 
to start flexing it than it is to once
you<00:01:47.620> get<00:01:47.740> up<00:01:47.860> here<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.160> actually<00:01:48.490> breaks<00:01:48.670> a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
you get up here it actually breaks a

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.200 
you get up here it actually breaks a
little<00:01:49.060> bit<00:01:49.180> looser<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:51.580> I<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:51.850> see<00:01:52.060> that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
little bit looser and I can see that

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.999 
little bit looser and I can see that
it's<00:01:52.390> flexing<00:01:52.840> right<00:01:52.869> here<00:01:53.410> on<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.650> inside<00:01:53.979> of

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
it's flexing right here on the inside of

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.680 
it's flexing right here on the inside of
the<00:01:54.160> insert<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.490> right<00:01:54.940> here<00:01:55.210> on<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.450> inside

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
the insert and right here on the inside

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.330 
the insert and right here on the inside
of<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.869> answer<00:01:56.110> everywhere<00:01:56.650> else<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:57.100> feel<00:01:57.310> a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
of the answer everywhere else I feel a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.590 
of the answer everywhere else I feel a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
tension torsional flex is super

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.590 
tension torsional flex is super
comfortable<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:03.369> actually<00:02:03.729> raises<00:02:04.119> up<00:02:04.300> really

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
comfortable it actually raises up really

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.990 
comfortable it actually raises up really
easy<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.050> feels<00:02:05.470> like<00:02:05.740> it's<00:02:05.979> raising<00:02:06.250> evenly

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
easy and feels like it's raising evenly

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.729 
easy and feels like it's raising evenly
throughout<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.330> board<00:02:07.690> it's<00:02:07.960> not<00:02:08.020> stiff<00:02:08.530> or

fighting back I would give this board a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.900 
fighting back I would give this board a
6<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.380> 10<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.860> torsional<00:02:39.400> flex<00:02:39.549> and<00:02:39.880> I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
6 out of 10 on the torsional flex and I

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.110 
6 out of 10 on the torsional flex and I
would<00:02:40.030> give<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.540> 7<00:02:40.989> out<00:02:41.080> of<00:02:41.140> 10<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
would give it a 7 out of 10 on the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.509 
would give it a 7 out of 10 on the
overall<00:02:43.420> flex<00:02:43.900> saying<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:45.070> it's<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.280> lot

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
overall flex saying that it's a lot

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.130 
overall flex saying that it's a lot
softer<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.150> center<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.720> board<00:02:46.930> than

softer in the center of the board than

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.220 
softer in the center of the board than
it<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.410> out<00:02:47.590> here<00:02:47.890> it's<00:02:48.160> probably<00:02:48.700> an<00:02:49.019> 8<00:02:50.019> out<00:02:50.200> of

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
it is out here it's probably an 8 out of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.080 
it is out here it's probably an 8 out of
10<00:02:50.440> out<00:02:50.650> here<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.040> 6<00:02:51.310> out<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.489> 10<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:51.970> the

10 out here and a 6 out of 10 in the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.060 
10 out here and a 6 out of 10 in the
