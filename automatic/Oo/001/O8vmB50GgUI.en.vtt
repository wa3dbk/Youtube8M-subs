one<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.900> everybody<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.469> red<00:00:10.650> dragon<00:00:11.070> here

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
one is up everybody the red dragon here

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.999 
one is up everybody the red dragon here
and<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.940> are<00:00:12.150> coming<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.420> top<00:00:12.570> stories<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.259> vgn

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
and we are coming to top stories on vgn

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.439 
and we are coming to top stories on vgn
so<00:00:15.000> if<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.719> don't<00:00:16.049> PC<00:00:16.740> game<00:00:17.119> you<00:00:18.119> still

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
so if you don't PC game you still

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.810 
so if you don't PC game you still
probably<00:00:18.810> kind<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> concept<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.760> would

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
probably kind of get the concept I would

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.630 
probably kind of get the concept I would
imagine<00:00:21.289> the<00:00:22.289> more<00:00:22.529> money<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.980> spend<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
imagine the more money you spend and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640 
imagine the more money you spend and
invest<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.390> different<00:00:24.750> products<00:00:25.230> whether<00:00:25.439> it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
invest in different products whether it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.349 
invest in different products whether it
be<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> GPU<00:00:26.519> or<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> CPU<00:00:27.949> etc<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.820> better<00:00:30.000> system

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
be a GPU or a CPU etc the better system

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.380 
be a GPU or a CPU etc the better system
you're<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.000> be

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you're going to have so it's going to be

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
you're going to have so it's going to be
more<00:00:33.600> capable<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.350> doing<00:00:34.920> extraordinary

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
more capable of doing extraordinary

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
more capable of doing extraordinary
things<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:37.469> incredible<00:00:38.190> speed<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> even<00:00:40.230> if

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
things at an incredible speed so even if

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
things at an incredible speed so even if
you<00:00:40.829> are<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> low<00:00:41.520> budget<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.149> still

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you are on a low budget you can still

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.090 
you are on a low budget you can still
get<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> decent<00:00:42.660> computer<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.379> days<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.950> can

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
get a decent computer these days you can

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.310 
get a decent computer these days you can
go<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.670> into<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> thousands<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
go you know into the thousands of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.590 
go you know into the thousands of
dollars<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.579> could<00:00:47.940> spend<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.270> couple<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
dollars so you could spend a couple of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060 
dollars so you could spend a couple of
thousand<00:00:48.989> dollars<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.890> good

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
thousand dollars and get a really good

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
thousand dollars and get a really good
computer<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.910> could<00:00:51.090> spend<00:00:51.329> ten<00:00:51.570> thousand

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
computer you could spend ten thousand

computer you could spend ten thousand
dollars<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:53.520> an<00:00:53.760> incredible<00:00:54.480> machine

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
dollars and get an incredible machine

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.220 
dollars and get an incredible machine
but<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> think<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.250> could<00:00:56.430> build<00:00:56.640> if

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
but what do you think you could build if

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.830 
but what do you think you could build if
you<00:00:58.230> had<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> million<00:00:58.829> dollars<00:00:59.510> to<00:01:00.510> build<00:01:00.660> a

you had a million dollars to build a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.280 
you had a million dollars to build a
computer<00:01:01.399> or<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:03.000> about<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:04.100> billion<00:01:05.100> dollars

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.760 
people who have ever been on the game
show<00:02:16.739> Jeopardy<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.840> Watson<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.200> isn't<00:02:19.620> a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
show Jeopardy and Watson just isn't a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.100 
show Jeopardy and Watson just isn't a
super<00:02:20.040> computer<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:21.180> built<00:02:21.209> like<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
super computer that is built like on the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.710 
super computer that is built like on the
technology<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.739> we're<00:02:23.160> used<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.610> today<00:02:23.849> so

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
technology that we're used to today so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.440 
technology that we're used to today so
normally<00:02:25.260> if<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.730> computer<00:02:27.150> program

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
normally if you have a computer program

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.650 
normally if you have a computer program
you<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.440> program<00:02:29.370> out<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.030> know<00:02:30.180> if<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
you have to program out you know if the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.470 
you have to program out you know if the
user<00:02:30.870> types<00:02:31.380> in<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.130> then<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.300> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
user types in this then this is the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.589 
user types in this then this is the
response<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.620> way<00:02:34.800> Watson<00:02:35.459> works<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.060> it's

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
response the way Watson works is it's

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.290 
response the way Watson works is it's
actually<00:02:36.900> based<00:02:37.470> off<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:38.040> way<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.910> human

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
actually based off the way the human

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.390 
actually based off the way the human
mind<00:02:39.330> works<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.650> totally

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
mind works they have totally

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.520 
mind works they have totally
reconfigured<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:43.170> computer

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
reconfigured this and the computer

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.300 
reconfigured this and the computer
actually<00:02:43.849> knows<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.420> learns<00:02:46.200> from<00:02:46.680> its<00:02:46.950> past

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
actually knows and learns from its past

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.670 
actually knows and learns from its past
mistakes<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.630> does<00:02:48.870> make<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> mistake

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
mistakes so if it does make a mistake

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.520 
mistakes so if it does make a mistake
then<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.519> takes<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.120> consideration<00:02:51.630> into

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
then it takes that in consideration into

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.039 
then it takes that in consideration into
the<00:02:52.680> future<00:02:53.040> whenever<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.819> as<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.660> do<00:02:55.019> a

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
the future whenever it is as to do a

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.800 
the future whenever it is as to do a
similar<00:02:55.590> problem<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.090> computer<00:02:57.569> is

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
similar problem so the computer is

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.150 
similar problem so the computer is
actually<00:02:58.769> learning<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.799> is

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
actually learning and so this is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.009 
actually learning and so this is
definitely<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.849> frontier<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.660> far<00:03:03.870> as

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
definitely the frontier as far as

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.080 
definitely the frontier as far as
computers<00:03:04.470> are<00:03:04.830> concerned<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.849> course

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
computers are concerned and of course

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.330 
computers are concerned and of course
this<00:03:06.299> is<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.510> thing<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> has<00:03:07.440> been<00:03:07.680> talked

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
this is the thing that has been talked

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.780 
this is the thing that has been talked
about<00:03:08.489> for<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:09.239> long<00:03:09.900> time<00:03:10.319> in<00:03:10.680> science<00:03:11.580> fiction

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
about for a long time in science fiction

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.199 
about for a long time in science fiction
and<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.530> here<00:03:13.920> people<00:03:14.340> are<00:03:14.790> building

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
and it's it's here people are building

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.780 
and it's it's here people are building
quantum<00:03:15.959> computers<00:03:16.530> people<00:03:17.250> are<00:03:17.519> building

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
quantum computers people are building

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.890 
quantum computers people are building
computers<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:20.070> goal<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:21.269> have<00:03:21.510> them

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
computers that the goal is to have them

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.770 
computers that the goal is to have them
learn<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.329> going<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.600> have

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
learn and so this is going to have

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.410 
learn and so this is going to have
profound<00:03:25.290> effects<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.829> course<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.310> even<00:03:27.120> for

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
profound effects of course and even for

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.360 
profound effects of course and even for
IBM<00:03:27.930> they<00:03:28.170> think<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:28.950> could<00:03:29.220> be

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
IBM they think that this could be

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.699 
IBM they think that this could be
something<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.940> could<00:03:30.030> be<00:03:30.090> very<00:03:30.480> useful<00:03:30.709> to

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
something that could be very useful to

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.759 
something that could be very useful to
the<00:03:32.130> average<00:03:32.609> person<00:03:33.180> they<00:03:33.780> say<00:03:33.989> what<00:03:34.319> what's

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
the average person they say what what's

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.740 
the average person they say what what's
going<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.069> happen<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.150> built<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.630> the

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
going to happen is this is built on the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.420 
going to happen is this is built on the
cloud<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.230> developers<00:03:37.859> are<00:03:37.980> going<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.280> have

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
cloud so developers are going to have

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.180 
cloud so developers are going to have
access<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.420> information<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:40.380> can<00:03:40.859> process

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
access to the information it can process

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.240 
access to the information it can process
information<00:03:41.790> faster<00:03:42.650> than<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.829> human<00:03:44.010> brain

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
information faster than the human brain

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.569 
information faster than the human brain
and<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:46.470> they<00:03:46.739> say<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.160> you're<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.549> to

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
and that they say that you're going to

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.569 
and that they say that you're going to
have<00:03:47.730> apps<00:03:48.120> come<00:03:48.690> out<00:03:48.870> then<00:03:49.560> are<00:03:49.829> personalized

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
have apps come out then are personalized

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.250 
have apps come out then are personalized
so<00:03:50.850> they<00:03:51.030> say<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.569> could<00:03:51.750> have<00:03:51.780> an<00:03:52.049> app

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
so they say that you could have an app

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.289 
so they say that you could have an app
for<00:03:52.859> instance<00:03:53.310> where<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:53.850> go<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
for instance where you go to the

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.259 
for instance where you go to the
supermarket<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.799> could<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.459> guess<00:03:56.850> scan

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
supermarket and you could I guess scan

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.590 
supermarket and you could I guess scan
an<00:03:57.480> object<00:03:57.660> or<00:03:58.350> put<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.400> something<00:03:59.700> and<00:04:00.030> it'll

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
an object or put in something and it'll

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.599 
an object or put in something and it'll
tell<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.900> exactly<00:04:01.380> where<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.069> can<00:04:02.100> go<00:04:02.280> in

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
tell you exactly where you can go in

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.479 
tell you exactly where you can go in
town<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:03.150> get<00:04:03.359> that<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.900> cheapest<00:04:04.410> price

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
town to get that for the cheapest price

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.479 
town to get that for the cheapest price
so<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.850> can<00:04:06.120> take<00:04:06.959> in<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.500> an<00:04:07.739> incredible

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
so it can take in and an incredible

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.699 
so it can take in and an incredible
amount<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.120> information<00:04:09.780> at<00:04:09.900> one<00:04:10.109> time<00:04:10.380> and

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
amount of information at one time and

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.520 
amount of information at one time and
they<00:04:11.670> say<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.150> it's<00:04:12.269> also<00:04:12.750> built<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.230> be<00:04:13.410> able

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
they say that it's also built to be able

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.759 
they say that it's also built to be able
to<00:04:13.739> be<00:04:14.010> talked<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.880> in<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.780> natural<00:04:16.260> sense<00:04:16.590> so

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
to be talked to in a natural sense so

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.340 
to be talked to in a natural sense so
you<00:04:16.829> could<00:04:17.070> naturally<00:04:17.850> talk<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.600> kind<00:04:19.260> of

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
you could naturally talk to this kind of

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.250 
you could naturally talk to this kind of
like<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.530> Siri<00:04:20.039> deal<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:21.599> know<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:22.049> this

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
like a Siri deal and you know that this

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.920 
like a Siri deal and you know that this
is<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:22.830> totally<00:04:23.370> science<00:04:24.060> fiction<00:04:24.510> about

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
is this is totally science fiction about

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.620 
is this is totally science fiction about
to<00:04:25.560> play<00:04:25.770> out

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
to play out

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.800 
to play out
the<00:04:26.750> very<00:04:26.960> near<00:04:27.230> future<00:04:27.260> where<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:29.540> has<00:04:29.780> all

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
the very near future where it has all

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.740 
the very near future where it has all
sorts<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:31.280> know<00:04:31.310> implications<00:04:32.270> good

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
sorts of you know implications good

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.480 
sorts of you know implications good
things<00:04:33.050> could<00:04:33.350> definitely<00:04:33.650> come<00:04:34.160> from<00:04:34.370> this

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
things could definitely come from this

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.910 
things could definitely come from this
we<00:04:34.700> could<00:04:34.850> learn<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.060> lot<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.480> things<00:04:35.900> from<00:04:36.620> a

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
we could learn a lot of things from a

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.800 
we could learn a lot of things from a
computer<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:37.730> you<00:04:38.120> know<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.540> more

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
computer that you know is more

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.890 
computer that you know is more
intelligent<00:04:39.440> than<00:04:39.620> most<00:04:39.920> people<00:04:40.460> but<00:04:41.360> of

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
intelligent than most people but of

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.660 
intelligent than most people but of
course<00:04:42.200> there's<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.560> ton<00:04:42.920> of<00:04:42.950> bad<00:04:43.220> things<00:04:43.430> that

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
course there's a ton of bad things that

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.300 
course there's a ton of bad things that
can<00:04:43.820> also<00:04:43.970> happen<00:04:44.360> as<00:04:44.720> well<00:04:44.900> we've<00:04:45.710> all<00:04:45.980> seen

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
can also happen as well we've all seen

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.040 
can also happen as well we've all seen
the<00:04:46.460> Terminator<00:04:46.940> films<00:04:47.330> we've<00:04:47.480> all<00:04:47.690> heard<00:04:47.960> of

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
the Terminator films we've all heard of

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.080 
the Terminator films we've all heard of
Skynet<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.830> what<00:04:49.430> happens<00:04:49.820> when<00:04:50.000> the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
Skynet and what happens when the

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.660 
Skynet and what happens when the
computer<00:04:50.480> becomes<00:04:50.750> self-aware<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.860> itself

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
computer becomes self-aware of itself

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.130 
computer becomes self-aware of itself
and<00:04:53.300> understands<00:04:54.290> how<00:04:55.100> bad<00:04:55.460> some<00:04:55.970> people

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
and understands how bad some people

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.140 
and understands how bad some people
