where they reject the spraying here
we're<00:02:05.600> going<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.780> actually<00:02:05.930> dig<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.350> trench<00:02:06.649> in

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
we're going to actually dig a trench in

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.190 
we're going to actually dig a trench in
the<00:02:06.979> concrete<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:08.060> house<00:02:08.239> our<00:02:08.509> electrical

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
the concrete the house our electrical

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.070 
the concrete the house our electrical
conduit<00:02:10.180> it'll<00:02:11.180> weigh<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.569> trench<00:02:11.870> and

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
conduit it'll weigh in the trench and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500 
conduit it'll weigh in the trench and
will<00:02:12.260> come<00:02:12.500> up<00:02:12.650> right<00:02:13.520> here<00:02:13.850> in<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.300> little

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
will come up right here in this little

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.590 
will come up right here in this little
square<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.400> essentially<00:02:17.300> where<00:02:17.480> our

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
square and this is essentially where our

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:30.490 
square and this is essentially where our
cabin<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.019> going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.320> sit

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.020 

so<00:02:31.500> we've<00:02:31.650> got<00:02:31.830> all<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.190> our<00:02:32.280> concrete<00:02:32.760> cutting

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
so we've got all of our concrete cutting

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.780 
so we've got all of our concrete cutting
done<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:34.650> electrician's<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.370> laid<00:02:35.610> the

done the electrician's have laid the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.060 
done the electrician's have laid the
conduit<00:02:36.240> inside<00:02:36.660> our<00:02:36.810> trench<00:02:37.140> we're<00:02:37.890> at<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
conduit inside our trench we're at the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.650 
conduit inside our trench we're at the
point<00:02:38.250> now<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.880> fill<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.210> trench<00:02:39.480> with

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
between 12 and 1,300 gallons per hour so

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.400 
between 12 and 1,300 gallons per hour so

quarter horsepower JBJ chiller one of
the<00:05:21.030> things<00:05:21.210> I<00:05:21.300> wanted<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.630> point<00:05:21.810> out<00:05:21.990> about

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
the things I wanted to point out about

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.280 
the things I wanted to point out about
the<00:05:22.680> way<00:05:22.830> we<00:05:22.950> installed<00:05:23.340> this<00:05:23.460> chiller<00:05:23.729> is

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
the way we installed this chiller is

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.120 
the way we installed this chiller is
obviously<00:05:25.290> we<00:05:25.440> decided<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.860> keep<00:05:25.979> it

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
obviously we decided to keep it

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.090 
obviously we decided to keep it
underneath<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.640> cabinetry<00:05:27.210> now<00:05:28.100> these

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
underneath the cabinetry now these

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.409 
underneath the cabinetry now these
chillers<00:05:29.490> require<00:05:29.820> a<00:05:29.850> lot<00:05:30.090> of<00:05:30.120> ventilation

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
chillers require a lot of ventilation

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.030 
chillers require a lot of ventilation
and<00:05:30.870> they<00:05:30.930> need<00:05:31.110> plenty<00:05:31.440> of<00:05:31.530> room<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.710> breathe

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
and they need plenty of room to breathe

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.070 
and they need plenty of room to breathe
otherwise<00:05:32.790> they<00:05:33.030> can<00:05:33.210> actually<00:05:33.390> work

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
otherwise they can actually work

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.780 
otherwise they can actually work
backwards<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:34.710> produce<00:05:34.919> produce<00:05:35.460> heat

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
backwards and produce produce heat

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.060 
backwards and produce produce heat
inside<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.330> aquarium<00:05:36.830> because<00:05:37.830> we<00:05:37.950> have

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
inside the aquarium because we have

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.409 
inside the aquarium because we have
other<00:05:38.160> components<00:05:38.760> down<00:05:38.880> here<00:05:39.090> that<00:05:39.210> produce

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
other components down here that produce

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.770 
other components down here that produce
heat<00:05:39.690> like<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.080> UV

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
heat like the UV

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.830 
heat like the UV
and<00:05:41.110> obviously<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.830> pump<00:05:42.389> we<00:05:43.389> wanted<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.720> make

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
and obviously the pump we wanted to make

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.270 
and obviously the pump we wanted to make
sure<00:05:43.870> that<00:05:44.020> this<00:05:44.290> chiller<00:05:44.560> was<00:05:44.740> going<00:05:45.130> to<00:05:45.190> be

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
sure that this chiller was going to be

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.490 
sure that this chiller was going to be
able<00:05:45.370> to<00:05:45.490> work<00:05:45.850> efficiently<00:05:46.150> so<00:05:47.139> you<00:05:47.200> can<00:05:47.380> see

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
able to work efficiently so you can see

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.560 
able to work efficiently so you can see
we<00:05:47.590> have<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.740> lot<00:05:47.860> of<00:05:47.980> insulation<00:05:48.430> tape<00:05:48.790> around

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
we have a lot of insulation tape around

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.180 
we have a lot of insulation tape around
the<00:05:49.750> chiller<00:05:50.050> what<00:05:50.350> we<00:05:50.440> did<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.740> we<00:05:50.860> used<00:05:50.889> a

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
the chiller what we did is we used a

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.060 
the chiller what we did is we used a
foam<00:05:51.490> that's<00:05:52.360> covered<00:05:53.260> in<00:05:53.320> tin<00:05:53.560> foil<00:05:53.800> it's

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
foam that's covered in tin foil it's

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.879 
foam that's covered in tin foil it's
actually<00:05:54.400> a<00:05:54.780> insulate<00:05:55.780> a<00:05:55.960> pipe<00:05:56.290> insulating

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
actually a insulate a pipe insulating

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.010 
actually a insulate a pipe insulating
foam<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:57.370> we<00:05:58.360> sealed<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.780> chiller

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
foam and we sealed the chiller

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.590 
foam and we sealed the chiller
completely<00:06:00.000> what<00:06:01.000> that<00:06:01.150> does<00:06:01.360> is<00:06:01.480> it<00:06:01.570> allows

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
completely what that does is it allows

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.670 
completely what that does is it allows
all<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.260> exhaust<00:06:03.720> to<00:06:04.720> be<00:06:04.840> focused<00:06:05.290> back<00:06:05.410> here

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
all the exhaust to be focused back here

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.740 
all the exhaust to be focused back here
to<00:06:05.830> this<00:06:05.950> vent<00:06:06.250> so<00:06:07.120> all<00:06:07.300> of<00:06:07.419> our<00:06:07.510> chiller

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
to this vent so all of our chiller

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.420 
to this vent so all of our chiller
exhaust<00:06:08.110> comes<00:06:08.380> out<00:06:08.530> of<00:06:08.620> this<00:06:08.710> vent<00:06:09.010> here<00:06:09.250> and

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
exhaust comes out of this vent here and

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.260 
exhaust comes out of this vent here and
in<00:06:10.090> turn<00:06:10.330> on<00:06:10.600> the<00:06:10.840> other<00:06:10.990> side<00:06:11.290> here<00:06:12.120> we<00:06:13.120> have

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
in turn on the other side here we have

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.110 
in turn on the other side here we have
another<00:06:13.620> vent<00:06:14.620> which<00:06:15.100> allows<00:06:15.370> cool<00:06:15.669> air<00:06:15.850> to<00:06:16.000> be

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
another vent which allows cool air to be

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.600 
another vent which allows cool air to be
pulled<00:06:16.360> into<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.720> cabinetry

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
pulled into the cabinetry

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.580 
pulled into the cabinetry
now<00:06:18.610> these<00:06:18.760> chillers<00:06:19.150> they<00:06:19.870> run<00:06:20.200> really

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
now these chillers they run really

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.470 
now these chillers they run really
quietly<00:06:20.950> and<00:06:21.370> they're<00:06:21.520> very<00:06:21.730> efficient<00:06:22.240> they

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
quietly and they're very efficient they

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.860 
quietly and they're very efficient they
also<00:06:22.630> have<00:06:22.810> an<00:06:22.900> internal<00:06:23.200> thermostat<00:06:24.810> so<00:06:25.810> you

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
also have an internal thermostat so you

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.600 
also have an internal thermostat so you
can<00:06:26.380> always<00:06:26.500> rely<00:06:26.919> on<00:06:26.950> them<00:06:27.220> to<00:06:27.250> keep<00:06:27.520> the

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
can always rely on them to keep the

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.120 
can always rely on them to keep the
temperature<00:06:28.000> consistent<00:06:28.800> but<00:06:29.800> from<00:06:30.010> the

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
temperature consistent but from the

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.010 
temperature consistent but from the
chiller<00:06:30.340> here<00:06:30.640> we<00:06:31.390> have<00:06:31.540> the<00:06:31.630> other<00:06:31.750> line

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
chiller here we have the other line

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.930 
chiller here we have the other line
going<00:06:32.440> to<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:32.919> pre-filter<00:06:33.280> and<00:06:33.460> then<00:06:33.790> it's

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
going to the pre-filter and then it's

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.850 
going to the pre-filter and then it's
returning<00:06:34.360> out<00:06:34.510> the<00:06:34.990> opposite<00:06:35.410> side<00:06:35.650> through

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
returning out the opposite side through

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.969 
returning out the opposite side through
the<00:06:35.950> other<00:06:36.100> eyelet<00:06:36.490> bulkhead<00:06:37.470> now<00:06:38.470> you<00:06:38.830> can

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
the other eyelet bulkhead now you can

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:40.440 
the other eyelet bulkhead now you can
see<00:06:39.160> back<00:06:39.340> here<00:06:39.550> in<00:06:39.639> the<00:06:39.700> corner<00:06:40.000> this<00:06:40.120> is<00:06:40.180> our

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
lights and the way we got our lights to

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.690 
lights and the way we got our lights to
work<00:07:08.710> here<00:07:09.010> is<00:07:09.690> in<00:07:10.690> the<00:07:10.780> very<00:07:10.960> back<00:07:11.200> here<00:07:11.700> where

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
work here is in the very back here where

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.610 
work here is in the very back here where
that<00:07:12.729> cord<00:07:13.180> is<00:07:13.300> that's<00:07:13.539> a<00:07:13.690> half<00:07:13.900> inch<00:07:14.140> bulkhead

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
that cord is that's a half inch bulkhead

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.800 
that cord is that's a half inch bulkhead
that's<00:07:15.220> going<00:07:15.610> up<00:07:15.789> through<00:07:16.120> the<00:07:16.210> pre-filter

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
that's going up through the pre-filter

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.020 
that's going up through the pre-filter
and<00:07:16.990> what<00:07:17.770> we<00:07:17.860> did<00:07:18.010> is<00:07:18.100> we<00:07:18.130> used<00:07:18.669> a<00:07:18.789> piece<00:07:19.000> of

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
and what we did is we used a piece of

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.890 
and what we did is we used a piece of
half-inch<00:07:19.570> PVC<00:07:20.080> pipe<00:07:20.620> to<00:07:21.270> act<00:07:22.270> as<00:07:22.450> a<00:07:22.479> conduit

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 
half-inch PVC pipe to act as a conduit

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.370 
half-inch PVC pipe to act as a conduit
and<00:07:23.289> when<00:07:23.410> I<00:07:23.440> open<00:07:23.800> the<00:07:23.919> eye<00:07:24.600> open<00:07:25.600> the<00:07:25.780> canopy

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380 
and when I open the eye open the canopy

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.920 
and when I open the eye open the canopy
here<00:07:26.700> you<00:07:27.700> can<00:07:27.850> see<00:07:28.000> this<00:07:28.120> is<00:07:28.300> where<00:07:28.419> our<00:07:28.600> PVC

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
here you can see this is where our PVC

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.380 
here you can see this is where our PVC
pipe<00:07:29.289> comes<00:07:29.530> out<00:07:29.740> and<00:07:30.130> all<00:07:30.820> we<00:07:30.970> did<00:07:31.120> is<00:07:31.240> we<00:07:31.360> just

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:31.390 
pipe comes out and all we did is we just

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.570 
pipe comes out and all we did is we just
threaded<00:07:31.960> our<00:07:32.050> electrical<00:07:32.830> power<00:07:33.039> cord<00:07:33.400> down

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:33.580 
threaded our electrical power cord down

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.820 
threaded our electrical power cord down
through<00:07:33.850> there<00:07:34.030> so<00:07:34.780> that<00:07:34.960> we<00:07:35.050> have<00:07:35.169> a<00:07:35.200> nice<00:07:35.380> dry

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830 
through there so that we have a nice dry

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.100 
through there so that we have a nice dry
channel<00:07:36.340> to<00:07:37.000> bring<00:07:37.120> our<00:07:37.330> electrical<00:07:37.840> up<00:07:37.990> to

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.110 
channel to bring our electrical up to

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.890 
channel to bring our electrical up to
the<00:07:38.200> top<00:07:38.410> and<00:07:39.250> then<00:07:39.340> we<00:07:39.460> split<00:07:39.669> and<00:07:40.120> obviously

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900 
the top and then we split and obviously

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.150 
the top and then we split and obviously
we<00:07:41.020> have<00:07:41.169> a<00:07:41.280> light<00:07:42.280> on<00:07:42.430> each<00:07:42.580> side<00:07:42.880> here
