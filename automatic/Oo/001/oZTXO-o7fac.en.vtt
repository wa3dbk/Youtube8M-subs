00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.939
 hi i am rodrigo vargas i am a researcher 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.550
 in the ccs I work in the department of 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.080
 conservation biology and I dedicate myself 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.269
 to study how ecosystems 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.849
 terrestrial breathe and what do you mean 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.529
 that means how the 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.269
 carbon dioxide as it enters and exits the 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.429
 water from ecosystems and how 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.560
 climatic variability influences this 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.840
 breathe from ecosystems 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.810
 I am a training biologist and when I 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.070
 I started studying biology I did not 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.550
 they liked mathematics 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.070
 in fact 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.110
 many of my classmates approached 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.280
 biology because they said to be 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.220
 biologist I do not need to study 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.670
 fact math nowadays as 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.930
 biologist as an ecologist in the application of 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.390
 the materials that is fundamental to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.269
 I would dare to say that there is no 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.129
 a good biologist or a good ecologist that 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.670
 do not somehow apply the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670
 maths 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.790
 I want to tell you a little thing that 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.760
 we do what I consider to be very 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.940
 interesting and it's precisely in the subject 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.920
 of how ecosystems breathe when 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.299
 us in our measurements that like 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.220
 it said we generated a series of time 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.630
 we generate measurements to give a 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.060
 thought the amount of information 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.880
 generates we use the sensor is 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.680
 a sonic anemometer for example that is 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 measure the wind direction in three 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.890
 directions in this direction in this 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.710
 address 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.530
 and in this direction and we measure it to 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.479
 sonic scale we measure it at 20 hertz that 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.929
 you mean it 's 20 gerson 20 times 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.729
 second 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.899
 so if you have 5 years of information 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.220
 you do one does not do it 20 times 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.780
 per second for 5 years 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.759
 we are talking about terabytes of 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.710
 information we can see how 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.020
 we like this time we go spinning 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.869
 how are they moving when we see that 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.200
 information we can interpret it from 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.380
 two ways here we are seeing as two 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.920
 beings of time are behaving 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.810
 is the is the temporal correlation of two 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.409
 things in this case we are looking at the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.250
 co2 flows and temperature then 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.860
 this image is an image where the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.620
 colors the red colors are us 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.900
 saying that there is a high correlation 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.260
 temporary between these two series of 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.930
 time and the blue colors tell me that 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.000
 there is no temporal correlation between 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.800
 these two areas of time so that is 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.390
 important this because as is possible 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.060
 that has come to these to these 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.260
 interpretations 1 are numbers the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.420
 numbers we can interpret from 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.950
 a lot of ways and it 's one of those 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.930
 ways to analyze frequencies 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.000
 analyze the frequencies I know how the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.040
 ecosystems are breathing and I can 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.170
 say how is the relations between the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.310
 temperature between precipitation and 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.170
 how will the results be the flows 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.630
 of these ecosystems that has 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.120
 importance because because of one or the other 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.650
 we can implement it or we can 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.019
 put the classes 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.819
 the explanations in contexts of 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.920
 climate change in one way or another 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.780
 how are we going to manage the ecosystems 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.659
 to be influenced by the variability 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.310
 climatic and if we do not know how this 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.829
 climatic variability influences the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.379
 breathe from ecosystems we are not going to 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.840
 be able to do the proper handling for 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.489
 preserve them or for a goal that is 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.099
 could do for example the capture of 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.099
 carbon or efficient water use 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.319
 then when I was commenting on 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.109
 research that we are doing in 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.060
 this laboratory we measure how the 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.829
 ecosystems breathe and what do I mean 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.829
 when an ecosystem breathes as well as 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.540
 we breathe and exhale 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.489
 we are releasing carbon dioxide 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.840
 well the plants also make are the 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.849
 ecosystems do that the plants 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.560
 you can also say that they breathe but 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.299
 to breathe is really to let go of 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.819
 carbon dioxide at least 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.810
 breathe good we have instruments 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.950
 we use micro techniques 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.659
 meteorology and we also use 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.310
 different geometrical measurements that 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.349
 means we are going to measure 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.359
 as a tree is growing simply 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.389
 with a rule and with one and with nothing and with 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.060
 a bullet a scale a scale and what 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.590
 that what the instruments 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.450
 main we use are these two 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.739
 this instrument 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.079
 is a ray sensor unit 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.470
 infrared to measure concentration 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.419
 of co2 in the atmosphere this you this 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.539
 sensor what it does is that it has got 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.669
 infrared light and through as it goes 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.200
 changing the wavelength can we 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.170
 say how much co2 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.030
 is going through here then we 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.270
 we put this in a tower in a 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.150
 ecosystem and the air the atmosphere goes 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.900
 doing it has a turbulence going to 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.640
 move 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.470
 in this way making these 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.270
 circles then these these swirls 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.800
 and those swirling areas are happening 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.430
 here and as the wind is moving the 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.470
 matter 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.910
 in this case the CO2 is modifying the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.310
 wavelength of these from this sensor 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.750
 and you can tell us when it's 2 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.970
 exists in the atmosphere at that time 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.100
 we can also measure with a zinc a 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.990
 sensor similar as is breathing the 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.910
 soil like that co2 is coming out of the 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.550
 I'm going to the atmosphere for that 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.160
 we use these cameras these cameras 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.980
 They are made to be placed on the 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.460
 ground and can we measure the change 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.700
 in the concentration of co2 of the soil that 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.920
 it's going to go and it's filling up 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.910
 is in this camera we put it in the 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.070
 I ground this house low 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.800
 we leave them for a few minutes and he leaves 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.320
 accumulating the co2 inside this inside 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.210
 from this camera we see the 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.490
 pending us and with those we know the 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.250
 time and we know the concentration of 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.140
 co2 and we calculate the slope not how much 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.300
 co2 is increased per unit of time 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.550
 we can calculate a flow on 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.530
 co2 flow and we use these 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.120
 instruments we can have 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.430
 good analysis and we have good 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.170
 analysis we can have good 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.300
 interpretations and interpretations 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.340
 that generate value- added products 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.310
 that those numbers somehow be 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.660
 interpreted in that way be 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.430
 transmitted to society and how they 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.920
 said that they reach students who 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.540
 reach the institutions that arrive 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.340
 to the people who can make decisions 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.230
 so that they take visions with 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.420
 information and that information we are going to 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.990
 create since we connect things to 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.480
 one to one to one a circuit until 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.760
 We analyze them and all that in all 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.980
 the cases the mathematics are are 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.170
 It is present in each one of those 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.930
 those moments in different things from 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.490
 connections that go 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.310
 involved voltage issues and 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.230
 electronics issues until the 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.120
 analysis of the data that come in this 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.520
 case of ecosystem measurements 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.919
 terrestrial 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.770
 then mathematics as they go a lot 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.990
 beyond disciplines can we 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.280
 collaborate with different scientists and 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.080
 for that we have to speak the same 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.360
 language what do I mean with right now 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.069
 good language if I'm going to do something with 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.020
 an engineer I have to know the minimum 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.639
 that the engineer needs to know for 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.229
 that can help me if I go to work 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.629
 with someone who does chemistry I have to 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.159
 know the minimum that a chemist who is 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:13.259
 does so that you can help me if I do not 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:14.879
 I can communicate with a chemical will 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:18.300
 it's very difficult for me to collaborate with that 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:20.460
 person and a lot of that of that union that 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.440
 makes us collaborate among scientists are 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.479
 precisely mathematics thanks to 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.370
 mathematics is an example assuming 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.380
 can we collaborate can we do 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.630
 the interdiscipline and we can answer 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.610
 those questions that motivate us to follow 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.650
 forward and that motivate us because each 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.270
 day I arrive and say I adore my work 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.560
 because I'm going to answer the question that 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.270
 is motivating me today and that 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.340
 that question can help the 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.650
 Mexican society and can help you 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.650
 people to make more informed decisions 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:03.400
 if you like to say he saw and I understood him 

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.710
 what you just saw give us a like and
