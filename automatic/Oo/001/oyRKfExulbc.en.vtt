00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 if everyone is there street slide 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.230
 today we find ourselves in a 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.879
 video I hope everyone is fine 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.170
 personally it can go so when 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.840
 you may have noticed in the title 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.019
 today I'm doing a tutorial or May 2 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.630
 reuters sitting for my videos so this 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.830
 evening but on this vegas is 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.840
 sure I realize all this stuff 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.519
 so this is the special video 115 thousand 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.640
 subscribers be roughly the video reuters 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.779
 the rods side you do it and suddenly 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.279
 for that are fifteen thousand subscribers 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 was falling well my dear fear because there 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.219
 I'm almost 80 miles soon 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.200
 subscribers seems to me but good is better 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.620
 late than never as they say in the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.809
 jargon 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.090
 so let's start we'll start from 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.210
 then I laugh my ropes 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.170
 minecraft game with action may I read 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.059
 think it's the best 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.410
 before it was with fraps but here it is 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.309
 one year or a year and a half 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.909
 now five weeks to the iss 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.720
 finally especially since I have my new pc 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.220
 yeah actually and since I have my new 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.540
 pc according to the express is because in 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.699
 big as those town hall lice it is 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.579
 a lot better fucked up on a good pc 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 rotten rope but strikes I find it 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.909
 had been optimized for fps 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.409
 because I remember that when I 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.450
 filmed with hit I had no lag on 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.250
 my old pc so all filmed with 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.690
 lightened chemistry with some small live 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.009
 so for those who have butchered her from 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.750
 shit they really do not get hungry 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.860
 it's the galley filmed in 60fps years 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.700
 when you film there is to stay at 100 in 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.500
 60 fps 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.509
 it seems to me that typing is better if 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.830
 I say no bullshit but soon those 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.360
 who are no problem they are turning 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.649
 the elysee finally they make milf pay 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.570
 surely icraf and or frankly they get 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.830
 marry high school the best after I know 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.860
 not all the same except that it's really 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.259
 so the best so on time might so 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.860
 algeria body of my screen with action 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.390
 right now actually if it's 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.200
 not the right parameters so then for 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.130
 action what to do is 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.630
 select the game mode so 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.399
 that one did not follow our backgrounds me 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.660
 I took'm here because we will 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.319
 sing in the strings so take 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.729
 the middle one finally I mean the one 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.670
 from the left the as a little 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.289
 ps3 joystick then the format of the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.670
 file put you screw size 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.190
 of the video wanted me it's by default 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.379
 the images per second you put to 60 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.039
 or 120 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:07.840
 me what I advise if she 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.789
 left at 66 26 60 fps 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.950
 because kind of before I put 120 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.470
 but since I do not have any update 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.760
 mirilli action that kind the video she 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.840
 is shifted it does not follow you if I have 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.090
 remembered there was a video on a 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.129
 pickup it was like that it's because 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.660
 I was just looking at 120 kind species 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.860
 actually my voice was not at the same time 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.230
 that the gameplay all that was a little 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.849
 shift and I have not putting off without 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.500
 at once there is no problem with 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.940
 that's so personally I leave it to 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.950
 60fps now but I think that 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.440
 not change much for rendering 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.599
 lived so on youtube 160 fps ps and I 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.519
 do and rhodia in 60 fps so I think 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.470
 that it can not put anything to 120 but 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.650
 hey it's 60 or 120 but much is 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.360
 60 use it mode by sheet of 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.469
 crazy match unchecked the active agile and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 because I'm in active screens 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.219
 so here is not a good example 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.109
 but I hope you have understood 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.730
 that you have to select the game and 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.370
 uncheck its important boxes 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.950
 registered subsystems bah yes if 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.999
 you want to save the game all that 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.769
 if you want to record 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:07.450
 if you wish with your friends etc. 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.709
 that's what it is 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.099
 the enrichment of the fight 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.670
 balls 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.930
 there too so here is then a 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.420
 When I arrived here there nothing 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.769
 interesting if the option 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.819
 recording so you put down 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.439
 high if you put the best 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.930
 quality this normal the betrayed you the 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.189
 put it down as super important the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.170
 input game they go without looking like 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:31.430
 a little listen to him hull and fight like 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.349
 it's ticking as it's here 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.060
 visual attack overlay an image on 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.579
 video is not sure but I have 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.530
 images of the brain the brief a mode 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.670
 this is for the cam 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.219
 is a first step I think it's 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.510
 everything i believe you i love you all 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.000
 shown for shareholders elect therefore 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.629
 we'll go on his vegas line 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.400
 so I'll take a video clip project 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.030
 notice and whoever finds himself by train 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.650
 to register 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.420
 so I took a little clip that I 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.599
 did I collect in the pro but in 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.840
 more than that I did on the first 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.689
 practice the rotten stuff we will remove 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.609
 the sounds I will put a music by 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.129
 on it at the end for rendering I'm going 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.180
 do it fast finally I do not want 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.720
 do the editing now I'll do it 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.489
 after so basically you do files 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.479
 property or there you do it before 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.250
 put the clip makes you new 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.160
 property finally here's a quick snap the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.419
 gym and rich property so but rendered 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.360
 basically it's 1280 720 in width 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.330
 height image rate you put to 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.669
 120 gr of just about everything here it takes 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.500
 put optimized important 8 bits and 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.820
 that's how I do it 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.169
 months directly on the sort be done in 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.449
 two hours later I 'm optimized 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.620
 and then and suddenly it gives that so we 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.240
 look and well everything applied 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.650
 hockey then you select low 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.270
 all the video you want so me 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.409
 say that's all this will be done at 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.240
 mounting a loan to spend without too much 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.949
 long so at the end of the video I you 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.199
 would not put the result of the clip what 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:02.419
 it gives you so you do not hear 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:06.229
 that they select you windows 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:10.120
 media video v11 so in wmv 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.120
 it's the best customize the model 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.340
 so for the job to leave you aulas 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.319
 like that finally see videos on time 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.759
 I leave judges but I leave my 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:24.819
 videos in 780 not pay in mileu that is 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.979
 what I said in 720p 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.599
 I do not put in 1080p because here I am 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.360
 think it's a little useless it takes 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:35.539
 more time to make the video of the shot 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.819
 at the high definition of 1280 x 720 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.979
 important frame rate that's it so 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.840
 you want the 60 fps on youtube so 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.539
 must put 60 fps here it's great 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.819
 important 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:50.630
 key frames per second or put 5 6 4 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.159
 you replace the stamp you check there 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.919
 you put the smoothing videos you 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.139
 put the net right 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.659
 davy venerate you put in 30/5 I think 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.740
 that it is in huis m 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.780
 I do not know I do not know exactly that 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.199
 how much basic Romany language was at 35 m 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.949
 and quality of video rendering will voom been 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.810
 optimized and after that and after I 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.680
 believe it's all good so after fact 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:20.870
 ok that's it and then you're renamed when 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:24.229
 you want guyoult drop to the idea 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.990
 to try the strongest here and after 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.560
 we sleep we click and well and by the way 30 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.430
 and that's great for rendering so here it is 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.990
 so here I'm going to arrive I'm going to stop 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.360
 I want to do it again after the opinion of all 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.430
 a dick or if you want to put 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.229
 a little background also due in early June you 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.250
 do something like that when you 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.479
 start the video stops everything 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.729
 gently mode well if the beautiful 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:48.409
 kids and for the end of the video me 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:51.110
 so this is so perfect 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.610
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.469
 all the same for the assignment of 15 thousand 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.319
 subscribers I did not say but thank you 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:59.090
 please at this pace we will be 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.240
 soon a hundred thousand I started to 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.349
 think a little for the 100,000 g 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.349
 I really want to do something 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:09.460
 ouf because 100,000 is a trick 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:10.389
 phew pole really got hit I'll 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.819
 not start talking about his mine 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.860
 now but here I am going to start 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:16.960
 to think about a good thing I already 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.289
 two or three ideas and start to me there 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.050
 to put 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:21.340
