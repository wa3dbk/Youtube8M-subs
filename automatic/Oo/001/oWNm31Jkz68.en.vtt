in using very very heavy equipment for a
small<00:00:42.490> stream<00:00:42.880> like<00:00:43.060> this<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:44.260> maximum<00:00:44.470> fish

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
small stream like this the maximum fish

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.250 
small stream like this the maximum fish
will<00:00:45.670> actually<00:00:46.120> encounter<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.760> be<00:00:49.260> around

will actually encounter to be around

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.560 
will actually encounter to be around
about<00:00:50.530> one<00:00:50.770> kilograms<00:00:51.340> or<00:00:51.550> two<00:00:51.760> pounds<00:00:52.030> and

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
about one kilograms or two pounds and

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:00.540 
about one kilograms or two pounds and
they're<00:00:52.930> going<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.230> be<00:00:53.320> varying<00:00:59.550> frequency

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
they're going to be varying frequency

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.850 
they're going to be varying frequency
doing<00:01:00.820> this<00:01:00.970> I've<00:01:01.870> got<00:01:02.080> a<00:01:02.110> two<00:01:02.380> weight<00:01:02.560> fly

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
doing this I've got a two weight fly

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.100 
doing this I've got a two weight fly
line<00:01:03.160> on<00:01:04.320> most<00:01:05.320> people<00:01:05.800> fish<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.810> stream

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
line on most people fish in the stream

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.080 
line on most people fish in the stream
like<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.320> are<00:01:08.770> still<00:01:09.010> using<00:01:09.400> four<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.850> five

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
like this are still using four and five

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.700 
like this are still using four and five
weight<00:01:10.300> fly<00:01:10.570> lines<00:01:10.869> now<00:01:11.140> there's<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.440> very<00:01:11.650> good

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
weight fly lines now there's a very good

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.609 
weight fly lines now there's a very good
reason<00:01:11.890> not<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.520> use<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:13.540> fly<00:01:14.050> line<00:01:14.290> of<00:01:14.470> that

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
reason not to use a fly line of that

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.090 
reason not to use a fly line of that
particular<00:01:14.920> weight<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:17.170> heavy<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:17.890> it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
particular weight it's heavy and it

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.999 
particular weight it's heavy and it
splashes<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.840> fish<00:01:20.080> sense<00:01:20.440> that<00:01:20.740> with

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
splashes and the fish sense that with

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.680 
splashes and the fish sense that with
the<00:01:21.100> same<00:01:21.310> lateral<00:01:21.790> line<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.270> can<00:01:22.420> sense

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
the same lateral line that it can sense

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.630 
the same lateral line that it can sense
me<00:01:22.900> wading<00:01:23.290> up<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.590> stream<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.830> alert

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
me wading up the stream and if you alert

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.400 
me wading up the stream and if you alert
fish<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.180> your<00:01:28.300> presence<00:01:28.869> then<00:01:29.200> you've

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
fish to your presence then you've

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.920 
fish to your presence then you've
already<00:01:29.619> lost<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.190> battle<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.690> most

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
already lost the battle for the most

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.130 
already lost the battle for the most
important<00:01:32.500> thing<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.920> do<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.479> be<00:01:34.600> stealthy

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
important thing to do is to be stealthy

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.380 
important thing to do is to be stealthy
and<00:01:35.619> that<00:01:35.830> means<00:01:36.040> using<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.760> correct<00:01:37.180> light

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
and that means using the correct light

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.440 
and that means using the correct light
equipment<00:01:37.930> for<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.170> small<00:01:38.440> stream<00:01:38.800> so<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:40.270> is

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
equipment for a small stream so this is

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.380 
equipment for a small stream so this is
a<00:01:40.480> two<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.650> three<00:01:41.890> weight<00:01:42.130> rod<00:01:43.090> and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
a two to three weight rod and

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.510 
a two to three weight rod and
importantly<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.470> action<00:01:44.800> is<00:01:44.890> progressive

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
importantly the action is progressive

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.560 
importantly the action is progressive
there<00:01:46.180> seems<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.570> have<00:01:46.750> been<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:47.850> an<00:01:48.850> increasing

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
there seems to have been a an increasing

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.730 
there seems to have been a an increasing
tendency<00:01:50.909> with<00:01:51.909> modern<00:01:52.560> manufacturers<00:01:53.560> to

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
tendency with modern manufacturers to

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.980 
tendency with modern manufacturers to
develop<00:01:53.920> faster<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:54.880> faster<00:01:55.120> rods<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:55.780> in

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
develop faster and faster rods that in

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.880 
develop faster and faster rods that in
my<00:01:56.170> opinion<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.120> bad<00:01:58.120> idea<00:01:58.320> very<00:01:59.320> fast<00:01:59.680> very

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
my opinion is a bad idea very fast very

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.730 
my opinion is a bad idea very fast very
tippy<00:02:00.520> rods<00:02:01.170> are<00:02:02.170> not<00:02:03.090> very<00:02:04.090> sensitive

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
tippy rods are not very sensitive

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.890 
tippy rods are not very sensitive
of<00:02:06.340> course<00:02:06.610> manufactures<00:02:07.390> claim<00:02:07.600> they

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
of course manufactures claim they

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900 
of course manufactures claim they
oppositely<00:02:08.410> they<00:02:08.739> claim<00:02:09.040> that<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.369> rod<00:02:09.549> is<00:02:09.700> both

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
oppositely they claim that a rod is both

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.509 
oppositely they claim that a rod is both
sensitive<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.810> fast<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.350> action<00:02:11.709> but<00:02:12.310> that's

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
sensitive and fast in action but that's

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.770 
sensitive and fast in action but that's
not<00:02:12.760> true<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.600> rods<00:02:13.959> fast<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.970> like<00:02:16.180> me<00:02:16.420> to

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
not true the rods fast you like me to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.830 
not true the rods fast you like me to
have<00:02:17.320> problems<00:02:17.799> with<00:02:18.040> tip<00:02:18.370> it's<00:02:18.610> breaking<00:02:19.209> as

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
have problems with tip it's breaking as

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.650 
have problems with tip it's breaking as
you<00:02:20.019> can<00:02:20.200> see

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
you can see

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.210 
you can see
I've<00:02:20.900> been<00:02:21.050> standing<00:02:21.410> here<00:02:21.590> who<00:02:21.800> I've<00:02:22.070> been

talking with Bishop started to rise

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.560 
talking with Bishop started to rise
they're<00:02:24.890> not<00:02:25.160> aware<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.520> my<00:02:25.730> presence<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.390> this

suspect are taking the occasional which
is<00:03:54.040> coming<00:03:55.040> down<00:03:55.280> it's<00:03:56.180> not<00:03:56.330> actually<00:03:56.780> a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
is coming down it's not actually a

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.470 
is coming down it's not actually a
spectacular<00:03:58.190> hatch<00:03:58.400> by<00:03:58.700> any<00:03:58.850> means<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.360> there

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
spectacular hatch by any means and there

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.260 
spectacular hatch by any means and there
aren't<00:03:59.720> many<00:03:59.750> pitch<00:04:00.260> moving<00:04:00.680> but<00:04:01.270> sometimes

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
aren't many pitch moving but sometimes

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.090 
aren't many pitch moving but sometimes
fishings<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.140> sometimes<00:04:03.380> it's<00:04:03.830> hard

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
fishings like this sometimes it's hard

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.280 
fishings like this sometimes it's hard
and<00:04:04.280> we've<00:04:04.400> got<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.730> work

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
and we've got to work

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.100 
and we've got to work
so<00:04:07.290> what<00:04:07.440> I'll<00:04:07.590> do<00:04:07.800> is<00:04:07.830> have<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.220> quick<00:04:09.110> pastor

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
so what I'll do is have a quick pastor

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.690 
so what I'll do is have a quick pastor

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
this rising fishness if we can rise in

this very shortly how to tie it

this very shortly how to tie it
I<00:04:29.850> found<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.990> spectacularly<00:04:31.860> good<00:04:32.160> especially

on on difficult fish but I increasingly

on on difficult fish but I increasingly
use<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.480> as<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.630> general<00:04:37.139> pattern<00:04:37.410> because<00:04:38.100> of

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
use it as a general pattern because of

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.350 
use it as a general pattern because of
its<00:04:38.370> effectiveness

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
its effectiveness

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.940 
its effectiveness
it's<00:04:39.600> not<00:04:39.750> particularly<00:04:40.080> difficult<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.580> tie
