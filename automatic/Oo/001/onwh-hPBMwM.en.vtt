into the game thinking I'm gonna go mute
a<00:00:39.750> link<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.710> happened<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.100> he

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
a link I think what happened was he

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.220 
a link I think what happened was he
killed<00:00:41.820> off<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> couple<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.480> Marines<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.930> fire

killed off a couple of Marines of fire
materials<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:43.890> fireberry<00:00:44.489> heroes<00:00:44.730> making

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
materials as fireberry heroes making

that<00:00:45.210> rather<00:00:45.390> silly<00:00:46.320> push<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.039> just

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that rather silly push out with just

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
that rather silly push out with just
marines<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.730> i<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.510> was<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
marines and i think it was that at that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.959 
marines and i think it was that at that
moment<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.649> yarn<00:00:49.920> i<00:00:49.980> decided<00:00:50.460> switch<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.850> me

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
moment that yarn i decided switch to me

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.060 
moment that yarn i decided switch to me
was<00:00:51.120> ten<00:00:51.329> circlings<00:00:51.780> i<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.829> don't<00:00:53.010> think

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
was ten circlings i really don't think

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
was ten circlings i really don't think
going<00:00:53.430> meddling<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.149> generally<00:00:54.600> successful

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
going meddling is generally successful

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.930 
going meddling is generally successful
against<00:00:55.530> terran<00:00:55.770> player<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.250> um<00:00:56.460> they

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
against terran player because um they

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.310 
against terran player because um they
could<00:00:57.120> go<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.230> many

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
could go for it they just have so many

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
could go for it they just have so many
Marines<00:00:58.680> even<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.070> fast<00:00:59.280> expand<00:00:59.670> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
Marines even if they fast expand and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.580 
Marines even if they fast expand and
they're<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.809> those<00:01:00.960> signs<00:01:01.199> muscles

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
they're going to get those signs muscles

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.709 
they're going to get those signs muscles
eventually<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.430> ruin<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.910> plan<00:01:03.149> but

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
eventually that just ruin your plan but

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
eventually that just ruin your plan but
the<00:01:04.409> difference<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.280> few<00:01:05.549> Marines

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the difference of just a few Marines

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.060 
the difference of just a few Marines
really<00:01:06.930> i<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.110> changed<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> game<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> this

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
really i think changed the game and this

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.210 
really i think changed the game and this
shows<00:01:08.280> how<00:01:08.310> an<00:01:08.490> early<00:01:08.960> early<00:01:10.100> variation<00:01:11.100> from

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
shows how an early early variation from

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.890 
shows how an early early variation from
was<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> standard<00:01:11.970> builders<00:01:12.299> could<00:01:12.450> change<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
was a standard builders could change the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
was a standard builders could change the
entire<00:01:12.930> game<00:01:13.290> around<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.070> mean<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.760> starcraft

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
entire game around I mean in starcraft

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.249 
entire game around I mean in starcraft
that's<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.509> how<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> works<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that's just how it works it's like the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.560 
that's just how it works it's like the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that early group of Marines really a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460

middle lane and deciding to basically
end<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> game<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.170> mute<00:01:37.380> Alaskans

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
end the game with mute Alaskans

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
end the game with mute Alaskans
arrogance<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> email<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> game<00:01:39.150> didn't<00:01:39.420> end

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
arrogance and email the game didn't end

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.810 
arrogance and email the game didn't end
with<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:39.869> mewling<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.520> critical

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
with just mewling I think the critical

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.480 
with just mewling I think the critical
damage<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.479> done<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.930> point<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> anyway

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
damage was done at that point so anyway

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.030 
damage was done at that point so anyway
here<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> two<00:01:45.329> players<00:01:45.540> who<00:01:45.810> were<00:01:46.530> who

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
here we see the two players who were who

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.819 
here we see the two players who were who
lost<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.490> pretty<00:01:47.880> one-sided<00:01:48.470> battles<00:01:49.470> against

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
lost in pretty one-sided battles against

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.980 
lost in pretty one-sided battles against
fireman<00:01:50.159> hero<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.700> yarn<00:01:51.060> ack<00:01:51.210> facing<00:01:51.869> off

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
fireman hero and yarn ack facing off

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.999 
fireman hero and yarn ack facing off

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
against with each other and both are

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.859 
against with each other and both are
going<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.640> rather<00:01:54.090> standard<00:01:54.479> beginnings

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
going for rather standard beginnings

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.780 
going for rather standard beginnings
here<00:01:55.079> standard<00:01:55.560> openings<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.070> probably

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
here standard openings here probably

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.069 
here standard openings here probably
going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> see<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> cybernetics<00:01:57.719> core<00:01:57.899> yeah

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
going to see the cybernetics core yeah

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.149 
going to see the cybernetics core yeah
we're<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> cybernetics<00:01:58.950> core

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
we're going to see the cybernetics core

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.209 
we're going to see the cybernetics core
for<00:01:59.430> mps<00:02:00.149> probably<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:01.079> least<00:02:01.259> probably<00:02:02.100> i'm

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
for mps probably at least probably i'm

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.410 
for mps probably at least probably i'm
going<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> guess<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.759> factory<00:02:03.180> into

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
going to guess one factory into

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.459 
going to guess one factory into
expansion<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:05.119> for<00:02:06.119> koala<00:02:06.509> because<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.020> map

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
expansion for for koala because this map

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.350 
expansion for for koala because this map
i<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.860> does<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> relatively<00:02:08.849> easy<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
i think does have a relatively easy to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600 
i think does have a relatively easy to
hold<00:02:09.539> natural<00:02:09.989> expansion<00:02:10.259> which<00:02:10.920> does<00:02:11.400> favor

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
hold natural expansion which does favor

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.100 
hold natural expansion which does favor
turn<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.940> little<00:02:12.150> bit<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.840> we're<00:02:12.959> probably

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
turn a little bit so we're probably

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.880 
turn a little bit so we're probably
going<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.500> see<00:02:13.680> that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
going to see that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
going to see that
FD<00:02:14.460> billed<00:02:14.700> by<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> way<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.210> those<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.420> who

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
FD billed by the way for those you who

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.970 
FD billed by the way for those you who
don't<00:02:15.750> know<00:02:15.780> what<00:02:15.990> an<00:02:16.050> FD<00:02:16.380> build<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.740> once

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
don't know what an FD build is once

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.070 
don't know what an FD build is once
again<00:02:17.069> I'll<00:02:17.340> say<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.940> called<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.270> fake<00:02:18.660> double

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
again I'll say it's called a fake double

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.070 
again I'll say it's called a fake double
it<00:02:19.890> comes<00:02:20.220> from<00:02:20.430> well<00:02:21.030> back<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.660> day<00:02:21.810> and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
it comes from well back in the day and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.320 
it comes from well back in the day and
still<00:02:22.530> often<00:02:23.010> nowadays<00:02:23.310> Terran<00:02:24.030> player<00:02:24.150> is

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
still often nowadays Terran player is

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.930 
still often nowadays Terran player is
open<00:02:24.569> with<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.780> double<00:02:25.080> factory<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.680> fake<00:02:26.550> double

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
open with a double factory a fake double

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.690 
open with a double factory a fake double
is<00:02:27.150> when<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.630> build<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.110> couple<00:02:28.620> Marines<00:02:28.980> you

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is when you build a couple Marines you

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.900 
is when you build a couple Marines you
build<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.570> one<00:02:31.050> factory<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.130> put<00:02:32.880> a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
build a one factory and you put a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.460 
build a one factory and you put a
machine<00:02:33.209> shop<00:02:33.360> out<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.690> get<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> tank<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.380> then

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
machine shop out you get a tank and then

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.290 
machine shop out you get a tank and then
you<00:02:34.590> push<00:02:34.800> out<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.220> group<00:02:35.459> it's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
you push out with that group it's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.670 
you push out with that group it's
supposed<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.720> make<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> Protoss<00:02:37.350> player<00:02:37.590> i

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
supposed to make a Protoss player i

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800 
supposed to make a Protoss player i
think<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.400> two<00:02:38.670> factories<00:02:39.209> when<00:02:39.600> your

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
think you have two factories when your

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.510 
think you have two factories when your
own<00:02:39.959> reality<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.709> reason<00:02:41.010> why<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.160> push<00:02:41.340> out

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
own reality the reason why you push out

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.729 
own reality the reason why you push out
is<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.880> give<00:02:42.840> yourself<00:02:42.989> some<00:02:43.319> breathing<00:02:43.560> room

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
is to give yourself some breathing room

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.100 
is to give yourself some breathing room
so<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.069> plant<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:44.400> natural<00:02:44.790> expansion

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
so you can plant your natural expansion

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.479 
so you can plant your natural expansion
pretty<00:02:46.110> much<00:02:46.230> no<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.800> faked<00:02:47.100> out<00:02:47.280> by<00:02:47.459> a

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
pretty much no one is faked out by a

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.460 
pretty much no one is faked out by a
fake<00:02:47.730> double<00:02:48.030> anymore<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.810> name<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.440> a

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
fake double anymore so the name is a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.290 
fake double anymore so the name is a
little<00:02:49.739> bit<00:02:49.830> obsolete<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:51.000> what<00:02:51.270> i

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
little bit obsolete but that is what i

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.330 
little bit obsolete but that is what i
say<00:02:51.930> when<00:02:52.080> i<00:02:52.110> call<00:02:52.380> something<00:02:52.590> an<00:02:52.739> FD<00:02:53.100> build

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
say when i call something an FD build

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.370 
say when i call something an FD build
and<00:02:53.550> we<00:02:54.330> are<00:02:54.450> going<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> be<00:02:54.840> seeing<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.110> ft

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
and the probe is going to try to get in

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.360 
and the probe is going to try to get in
but<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.660> don't<00:03:12.989> think<00:03:13.200> well<00:03:13.800> actually<00:03:13.980> maybe

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
but I don't think well actually maybe

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.420 
but I don't think well actually maybe
he'll<00:03:14.610> get<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.090> don't<00:03:15.540> think<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:15.840> though

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
he'll get it I don't think so though

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.090 
he'll get it I don't think so though
factory<00:03:17.430> almost<00:03:17.730> done<00:03:17.880> now<00:03:18.380> 44<00:03:19.380> koala<00:03:19.739> and

decide to go for a bit of a her ass and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.009

fast expand at this point I think it's

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.280 
fast expand at this point I think it's
just<00:03:35.940> uh<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.329> would<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.570> be<00:03:36.750> silly<00:03:36.959> for<00:03:37.110> him

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
just uh it would just be silly for him

very rare and we could be seeing a

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.280 
very rare and we could be seeing a
couple<00:03:59.880> of<00:03:59.940> tech<00:04:00.120> choices<00:04:00.510> here<00:04:00.690> most<00:04:00.930> likely

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
couple of tech choices here most likely

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.229 
couple of tech choices here most likely
a<00:04:01.320> voltage<00:04:02.010> drop<00:04:02.130> I'm<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.910> guess<00:04:03.030> but

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
a voltage drop I'm going to guess but

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.060 
a voltage drop I'm going to guess but
possibly<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.690> tank<00:04:03.930> drop<00:04:04.200> I'm<00:04:04.500> not<00:04:04.739> sure<00:04:04.799> if

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
possibly a tank drop I'm not sure if

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.280 
possibly a tank drop I'm not sure if
there's<00:04:05.250> any<00:04:05.430> legend<00:04:06.420> positions<00:04:06.900> i<00:04:07.049> actually

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
there's any legend positions i actually

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.380 
there's any legend positions i actually
don't<00:04:07.440> think<00:04:07.500> there's<00:04:07.799> any<00:04:08.010> easy<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:09.060> access

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
don't think there's any easy to access

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.060 
don't think there's any easy to access
legend<00:04:09.780> positions<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.410> i'm<00:04:10.500> going<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.920> guess

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
legend positions so i'm going to guess

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.310 
legend positions so i'm going to guess
this<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.400> vultures<00:04:12.060> here<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.450> mines<00:04:13.079> being

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
this is a vultures here and mines being

this is a vultures here and mines being

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
couple marines out in the front and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.630 
couple marines out in the front and
actually<00:04:21.630> oh<00:04:21.660> this<00:04:22.410> is<00:04:22.560> very<00:04:22.590> nice<00:04:23.039> a<00:04:23.220> fake

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
actually oh this is very nice a fake

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.180 
actually oh this is very nice a fake
fake<00:04:24.000> double<00:04:24.390> here<00:04:24.690> from<00:04:25.289> koala<00:04:25.740> by<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.039> way

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
fake double here from koala by the way

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.740 
fake double here from koala by the way
just<00:04:26.460> as<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.669> give<00:04:26.880> out<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.150> etymology

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
just as I give out the etymology

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.200 
just as I give out the etymology
of<00:04:28.050> fake<00:04:28.620> double<00:04:29.100> we're<00:04:29.550> going<00:04:29.670> to<00:04:29.730> see<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.880> fake

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
of fake double we're going to see a fake

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.450 
of fake double we're going to see a fake
fake<00:04:30.420> double<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:31.200> now<00:04:31.500> since<00:04:31.560> other<00:04:32.070> Marines

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
fake double so now since other Marines

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.820 
fake double so now since other Marines
and<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.730> tanker<00:04:33.090> out<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.600> think<00:04:34.050> MBS<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.620> going

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
and the tanker out I think MBS is going

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.980 
and the tanker out I think MBS is going
to<00:04:34.920> suspect<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.610> there<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.240> fake<00:04:36.660> double

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
to suspect that there is a fake double

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.660 
to suspect that there is a fake double
on<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.110> um<00:04:37.440> there's<00:04:38.040> going<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.400> be<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.520> natural

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
on that um there's going to be a natural

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.280 
on that um there's going to be a natural
expansion<00:04:39.120> however<00:04:39.630> what<00:04:39.750> he<00:04:39.810> doesn't<00:04:40.110> know

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
expansion however what he doesn't know

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.290 
expansion however what he doesn't know
could<00:04:40.920> end<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.280> game<00:04:41.490> for<00:04:41.760> him<00:04:41.880> he<00:04:42.000> doesn't

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
could end the game for him he doesn't

the<00:06:05.220> one<00:06:05.430> thing<00:06:05.550> I<00:06:05.640> could<00:06:05.790> save<00:06:05.970> him<00:06:06.120> is<00:06:06.330> though

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
the one thing I could save him is though

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.240 
the one thing I could save him is though
are<00:06:06.750> those<00:06:06.930> DTS<00:06:07.350> but<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.620> don't<00:06:07.979> think<00:06:08.100> they're

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
are those DTS but I don't think they're

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.560 
are those DTS but I don't think they're
going<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.490> work<00:06:08.700> because<00:06:08.880> we<00:06:09.180> do<00:06:09.330> have<00:06:09.450> the

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
going to work because we do have the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.390 
going to work because we do have the
spider<00:06:09.810> mines<00:06:10.020> already<00:06:10.260> out<00:06:10.620> much<00:06:11.250> earlier

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
spider mines already out much earlier

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.460 
spider mines already out much earlier
that<00:06:11.729> he<00:06:11.820> could<00:06:12.030> expect<00:06:12.390> and<00:06:12.630> yeah<00:06:13.020> now<00:06:13.320> we're

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
that he could expect and yeah now we're

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.510 
that he could expect and yeah now we're
seeing<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.770> spider<00:06:13.979> mines<00:06:14.160> around<00:06:14.310> the

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
seeing the spider mines around the

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.830 
seeing the spider mines around the
gateways<00:06:14.850> of<00:06:15.210> course<00:06:15.419> those<00:06:15.630> will<00:06:15.810> help
