little disc brake here thing so I've got

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.620 
little disc brake here thing so I've got
it<00:00:15.590> off<00:00:16.590> now<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.100> don't<00:00:17.970> know<00:00:18.119> if<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.300> need<00:00:18.359> new

pads or what the hell is going on it's a
big<00:00:31.590> fat<00:00:31.859> media<00:00:32.369> brake<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.920> bet<00:00:34.920> it's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
big fat media brake then I bet it's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.350 
big fat media brake then I bet it's
frozen<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.390> arm<00:00:36.600> doesn't

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
frozen see this little arm doesn't

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.020 
frozen see this little arm doesn't
doesn't<00:00:39.360> move<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.460> seized<00:00:41.730> here

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
doesn't move so it's kind of seized here

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.220 
doesn't move so it's kind of seized here
in<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.450> housing<00:00:42.809> which<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:42.960> why<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
in this little housing which is why I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.590 
in this little housing which is why I
didn't<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.500> brakes<00:00:43.879> I'm<00:00:44.879> scooting<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.360> down

so I'm gonna pull this Drum Off take a
look<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> backside<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> rotor

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
look at the backside of the rotor

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.279 
look at the backside of the rotor
did<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.210> call<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.600> drum<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:51.960> gonna<00:00:52.079> pull

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
did I just call it a drum I'm gonna pull

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
did I just call it a drum I'm gonna pull
this<00:00:52.410> rotor<00:00:53.399> off

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
this rotor off

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.500 
this rotor off
I<00:00:54.079> brought<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> puller<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.300> take<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.360> look

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
I brought a puller out and take a look

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.610 
I brought a puller out and take a look
at<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> backside<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
at the backside of it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.979 
at the backside of it
clean<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.399> rest<00:00:59.670> get<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> caliper<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
clean up this rest get this caliper to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.439 
clean up this rest get this caliper to
keep<00:01:01.289> moving<00:01:01.590> properly<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.149> maybe<00:01:03.270> we'll

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
keep moving properly and maybe we'll

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:19.170 
keep moving properly and maybe we'll
have<00:01:03.570> some<00:01:03.750> stopping<00:01:04.170> power

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.880 

big<00:01:20.180> fat<00:01:20.509> breaks<00:01:22.210> Coolio

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
big fat breaks Coolio

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.620 
big fat breaks Coolio
looks<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.250> disk<00:01:25.580> just<00:01:25.850> floats<00:01:26.150> on<00:01:26.390> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
looks like this disk just floats on the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.530 
looks like this disk just floats on the
output<00:01:27.259> shaft<00:01:27.290> there<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.460> it<00:01:29.420> only

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
output shaft there and it only

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.120 
output shaft there and it only
compresses<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.380> one<00:01:30.530> side<00:01:30.830> of<00:01:31.040> the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
compresses on the one side of the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.380 
compresses on the one side of the
caliper<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.549> suppose<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:31.970> could<00:01:32.149> look<00:01:32.240> up

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
caliper I suppose I could look up

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.760 
caliper I suppose I could look up
instructions<00:01:32.930> on<00:01:33.080> this<00:01:33.200> but<00:01:33.409> what<00:01:33.500> fun<00:01:33.710> would

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
instructions on this but what fun would

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.420 
instructions on this but what fun would
that<00:01:33.979> be

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
that be

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.820 
that be
trying<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.240> find<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.479> manual<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:36.110> like<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.470> fly<00:01:36.649> by

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
trying to find a manual I like to fly by

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.180 
trying to find a manual I like to fly by
the<00:01:36.890> seat<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:37.130> my<00:01:37.250> pants<00:01:38.770> what<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.860> looks<00:01:40.009> like

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
the seat of my pants what it looks like

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.460 
the seat of my pants what it looks like
when<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.180> thing<00:01:41.360> is<00:01:41.390> properly<00:01:41.840> compressing

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
when this thing is properly compressing

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.990 
when this thing is properly compressing
it<00:01:42.590> pushes<00:01:42.979> on<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.310> side<00:01:43.549> of<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.789> rotor

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
it pushes on this side of the rotor

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.029 
it pushes on this side of the rotor
which<00:01:44.240> pushes<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.810> against<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.619> fixed

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
which pushes it against this is a fixed

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.399 
which pushes it against this is a fixed
back<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.149> this<00:01:47.330> thing<00:01:47.569> needs<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.840> slide<00:01:48.170> on

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
back so this thing needs to slide on

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.190 
back so this thing needs to slide on
this<00:01:48.649> shaft<00:01:49.030> which<00:01:50.030> judging<00:01:50.600> by<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> ruffs<00:01:51.020> it

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
this shaft which judging by the ruffs it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.550 
this shaft which judging by the ruffs it
hasn't<00:01:51.500> done<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.800> in<00:01:51.920> ages<00:01:52.780> yeah<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:54.170> drove

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
hasn't done that in ages yeah I drove

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.910 
hasn't done that in ages yeah I drove
else<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:54.950> did<00:01:55.159> too<00:01:55.399> month<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.240> put<00:01:56.360> this<00:01:56.539> thing

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
else I did too month to put this thing

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.639 
else I did too month to put this thing
it<00:01:57.920> was<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.069> little<00:01:58.190> stuck<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.640> there<00:01:59.649> that's

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
it was a little stuck on there that's

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.059 
it was a little stuck on there that's
one<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.979> drawbacks<00:02:01.159> are<00:02:01.580> using<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:06.069> on

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
one of the drawbacks are using this on

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.300 
one of the drawbacks are using this on

what pushes the pad into the rotor but
these<00:02:23.329> are<00:02:23.480> stuck<00:02:25.450> can<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.540> move<00:02:26.750> it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
these are stuck can you move it

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.729 
these are stuck can you move it
these<00:02:28.940> are<00:02:29.090> steel<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.630> casing<00:02:30.109> is<00:02:30.260> aluminum

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
these are steel the casing is aluminum

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.680 
these are steel the casing is aluminum
so<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.370> only<00:02:31.730> imagine<00:02:32.120> they're<00:02:32.239> stuck<00:02:32.450> in<00:02:32.570> there

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
so I only imagine they're stuck in there

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.759 
so I only imagine they're stuck in there
pretty<00:02:32.720> good<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.170> may<00:02:33.230> take<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> little<00:02:33.560> heat

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
pretty good and may take a little heat

we'll<00:03:05.130> see<00:03:05.250> how<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.400> works<00:03:05.640> here<00:03:08.390> super

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
we'll see how that works here super

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.650 
we'll see how that works here super
sweet<00:03:10.250> about<00:03:11.250> ten<00:03:11.760> minutes<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.450> good

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
old-fashioned liquid wrench the pins

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.100 
old-fashioned liquid wrench the pins
have<00:03:16.920> come<00:03:17.100> out<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.630> they<00:03:18.750> look<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:18.900> they're

this all back together and I should have

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.040 
this all back together and I should have
brakes<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.030> don't<00:03:33.210> crash<00:03:33.420> into<00:03:33.600> parked<00:03:33.960> cars

that's<00:04:24.680> pretty<00:04:24.860> flat<00:04:25.160> actually<00:04:25.550> now<00:04:25.700> if<00:04:25.820> those

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
that's pretty flat actually now if those

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.570 
that's pretty flat actually now if those
alright<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:26.750> then<00:04:27.410> this<00:04:27.590> does<00:04:27.830> float<00:04:28.190> see<00:04:28.490> it

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
alright and then this does float see it

alright and then this does float see it
just<00:04:28.880> kind<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.120> floats<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.850> let's<00:04:32.570> put<00:04:32.720> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
just kind of floats so let's put the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.540 
just kind of floats so let's put the
caliper<00:04:33.170> back<00:04:33.320> together<00:04:33.470> no<00:04:33.950> grease<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.370> the

caliper back together no grease on the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.130 
caliper back together no grease on the
pins<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:35.120> know<00:04:35.240> that's<00:04:35.420> a<00:04:35.510> little<00:04:35.630> much<00:04:35.900> but

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
pins I know that's a little much but

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.320 
pins I know that's a little much but
I'll<00:04:36.260> wipe<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:36.620> after<00:04:36.980> make<00:04:37.760> sure<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.030> got<00:04:38.180> the
