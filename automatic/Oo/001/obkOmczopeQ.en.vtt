00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.190

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.570

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.060
 in the box 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 of serious 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.320

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.890
 like 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.149

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.430
 break the plastic 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.850
 we have here the back cover that is 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.850
 in Spanish 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.369

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 style because it has the name since 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.190
 On the side 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.770
 this is one of the sides is beautiful in 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.920
 the box would say it's prettier than 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.680
 collector and let's open it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.800

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.970

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.960

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.729
 he means the type and ciro ok 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.409
 that's why they're willing to let the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.510
 disc that we will last less taxes 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.540

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.230
 here 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.660

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.600

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.050
 square web 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.310
 and the famous final fantasy code 15 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.310
 they say it lasts more or less 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.860
 of which is worth lasting five hours but 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.019
 that is not a devotion but a 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.200
 mission apart from what is the 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.900
