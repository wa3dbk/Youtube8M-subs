really<00:02:12.430> holds<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.970> lot<00:02:13.210> but<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.110> can't<00:02:14.380> really

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
really holds a lot but you can't really

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.010 
really holds a lot but you can't really
embellish<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.160> lot<00:02:15.400> because<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.300> bags<00:02:16.600> are<00:02:16.840> so

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
embellish a lot because the bags are so

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.740 
embellish a lot because the bags are so
thick<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.500> here<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:18.820> more<00:02:19.180> embellishments

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
thick in here that more embellishments

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.330

you<00:02:19.840> add<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.410> thicker<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.800> was<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
you add the thicker it was and the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.100 
you add the thicker it was and the
harder<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.670> was<00:02:21.760> going<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> closed<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.050> I
