from Big Top manufacturing in front of a
70<00:00:04.710> foot<00:00:04.740> by<00:00:05.069> 70<00:00:05.430> foot<00:00:05.580> hanger<00:00:05.970> we're<00:00:06.720> gonna

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
70 foot by 70 foot hanger we're gonna

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.009 
70 foot by 70 foot hanger we're gonna
enter<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.319> open<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.919> 52<00:00:08.610> wide<00:00:08.940> 14<00:00:09.300> tall<00:00:09.719> door

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
enter and open this 52 wide 14 tall door

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.570 
enter and open this 52 wide 14 tall door
so<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.040> enter<00:00:12.920> we<00:00:13.920> need<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.969> unclip<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.580> clamps

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
so we enter we need to unclip the clamps

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.450 
so we enter we need to unclip the clamps
that<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.910> at<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> base<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.690> structure<00:00:19.460> so

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
that are at the base of the structure so

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 
that are at the base of the structure so
here<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.789> have<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.300> inside<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> hanger

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
here we have the inside of the hanger

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.370 
here we have the inside of the hanger
and<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.029> particular<00:00:24.240> case<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:24.930> four

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and in this particular case we have four

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.550 
and in this particular case we have four
vertical<00:00:25.920> cables<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:27.180> must<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.720> unclamped

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
vertical cables that must be unclamped

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.970 
vertical cables that must be unclamped
or<00:00:28.710> unsecure<00:00:29.310> from<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.119> pad<00:00:30.420> eyes<00:00:30.830> that<00:00:31.830> in

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
or unsecure from the pad eyes that in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.150 
or unsecure from the pad eyes that in
this<00:00:32.099> case<00:00:32.340> are<00:00:32.579> bolted<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.450> concrete

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
this case are bolted to the concrete

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.770 
this case are bolted to the concrete
foundation<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.200> first<00:00:38.629> reduce<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
foundation so you can first reduce the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
foundation so you can first reduce the
tension<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.260> these<00:00:40.379> cables<00:00:40.860> by<00:00:41.070> spooling<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
tension on these cables by spooling the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.310 
tension on these cables by spooling the
winch<00:00:42.059> down<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.719> case<00:00:42.930> they're

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
winch down or in this case they're

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.080 
winch down or in this case they're
fairly<00:00:44.070> loose<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:44.879> unclip<00:00:45.710> these<00:00:46.710> clamps

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.369 

actually<00:00:51.090> they're<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.270> clamps<00:00:51.809> they're<00:00:52.020> more

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
actually they're not clamps they're more

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.910 
actually they're not clamps they're more
of<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:53.210> snap<00:00:54.210> hook<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> once<00:00:56.760> we've<00:00:57.920> basically

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
of a snap hook so once we've basically

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.959 
of a snap hook so once we've basically
unclamped<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> snap<00:01:00.270> hooks<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:01.460> go<00:01:02.460> over<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
unclamped the snap hooks we go over to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.770 
unclamped the snap hooks we go over to
the<00:01:03.210> winch<00:01:04.909> in<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.030> case<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the winch in this case we have a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.469 
the winch in this case we have a
reversible<00:01:07.619> winch<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> high<00:01:09.150> speed

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
reversible winch this is a high speed

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.350 
reversible winch this is a high speed
version<00:01:10.100> okay<00:01:11.100> let's<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.520> forward<00:01:11.820> Scott

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:34.120 

so<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:15.440> have<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:16.220> door<00:01:16.460> raising

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.599 

all<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> door<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.819> in<00:01:35.969> the<00:01:35.999> up<00:01:36.179> position

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
all right the door is in the up position

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.419 
all right the door is in the up position
routine<00:01:38.609> foot<00:01:38.850> hi<00:01:39.090> mark

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
routine foot hi mark

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.359 
routine foot hi mark
and<00:01:41.429> I<00:01:41.520> think<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.799> we'll<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.890> an<00:01:43.979> exterior

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and I think we have we'll do an exterior

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.120 
and I think we have we'll do an exterior
shot<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> door<00:01:45.060> lowering<00:01:45.829> all<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:46.950> can

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
shot of the door lowering all right can

00:01:47.130 --> 00:02:12.010 
shot of the door lowering all right can
you<00:01:47.189> lower<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.399> Scott

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.480 

all<00:02:13.020> right<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> door<00:02:13.440> travel<00:02:13.890> itself<00:02:14.190> is

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
all right the door travel itself is

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.660 
all right the door travel itself is
about<00:02:14.610> 17<00:02:15.390> seconds<00:02:15.990> on<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.830> particular<00:02:17.250> end

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
about 17 seconds on this particular end

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.330 
about 17 seconds on this particular end
and<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.870> case<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.410> need<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.800> reek<00:02:20.070> lamp

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
and in this case we need to reek lamp

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.950 
and in this case we need to reek lamp
and<00:02:20.670> re<00:02:21.450> secure<00:02:21.930> those<00:02:22.400> snap<00:02:23.400> hooks<00:02:23.750> once<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
and re secure those snap hooks once the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.850 
and re secure those snap hooks once the
door<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.140> lowered<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.360> back<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.570> position

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.040 

these<00:02:31.860> snap<00:02:32.190> hooks<00:02:32.490> prevent<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> wind<00:02:33.690> from

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
these snap hooks prevent the wind from

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.080 
these snap hooks prevent the wind from
damaging<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.740> flap<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:38.280> secured<00:02:38.760> for

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
damaging the flap and it's secured for

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:59.539
