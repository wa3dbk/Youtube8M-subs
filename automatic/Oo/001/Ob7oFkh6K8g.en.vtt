00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.200 
morning and as you can see we started we
just<00:00:21.960> took<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.279> we<00:00:23.279> went<00:00:23.460> from<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.939> top<00:00:24.180> of

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
just took the we went from the top of

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.109 
just took the we went from the top of
the<00:00:24.539> hive<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.980> went<00:00:26.849> down

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the hive and I of one and went down

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.080 
the hive and I of one and went down
through<00:00:27.449> each<00:00:27.980> box<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.750> we<00:00:30.750> didn't<00:00:31.380> find

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
through each box and we didn't find

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.319 
through each box and we didn't find
there's<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.270> much<00:00:33.450> activity<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.050> top<00:00:35.329> very

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
there's not much activity the top very

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.130 
there's not much activity the top very
little<00:00:36.980> honeycomb<00:00:37.980> pulled<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:39.930> did<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
little honeycomb pulled so what I did is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.160 
little honeycomb pulled so what I did is
a<00:00:40.260> test<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.309> look<00:00:41.850> later<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.930> put

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
a test just so I can look later as I put

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.279 
a test just so I can look later as I put
a<00:00:43.200> couple<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.399> all<00:00:44.610> plastic<00:00:45.180> frames<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> i

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
a couple i use all plastic frames and i

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.420 
a couple i use all plastic frames and i
put<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.070> every<00:00:47.910> other<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.329> i<00:00:48.360> put<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
put in a every other one i put in a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
put in a every other one i put in a
natural<00:00:50.430> honeycomb<00:00:51.149> frame<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.469> what<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
natural honeycomb frame to see what the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.979 
natural honeycomb frame to see what the
comparison<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.270> far<00:00:54.510> as<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.379> bees<00:00:55.649> pulling

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
comparison is as far as the bees pulling

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.799 
comparison is as far as the bees pulling
comb<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.879> plastic<00:00:59.879> versus<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> honeycomb

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
comb on the plastic versus the honeycomb

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.270 
comb on the plastic versus the honeycomb
just<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> test<00:01:01.710> i'll<00:01:01.920> let<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> know<00:01:02.160> how

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
just as a test i'll let you know how

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.820 
just as a test i'll let you know how
that<00:01:02.399> goes<00:01:02.579> later<00:01:02.899> but<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.379> went<00:01:04.559> through<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that goes later but we went through the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.510 
that goes later but we went through the
top<00:01:05.180> super<00:01:06.180> didn't<00:01:06.659> find<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> Queen<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.590> few

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
top super didn't find the Queen a few

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.270 
top super didn't find the Queen a few
bees<00:01:08.700> were<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> activity

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
bees were there not a lot of activity

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.640 
bees were there not a lot of activity
went<00:01:11.280> down<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.180> next<00:01:12.510> super<00:01:12.869> below<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
went down to the next super below that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.850 
went down to the next super below that
and<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.610> where<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:15.509> started<00:01:15.960> storing

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and that's where they started storing

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.270 
and that's where they started storing
quite<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> bit<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.520> honey<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.170> probably

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
quite a bit of honey in there probably

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.580 
quite a bit of honey in there probably
three<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:20.310> four<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:20.700> five<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.590> probably

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
three or four or five of the probably

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
three or four or five of the probably
three<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.799> four<00:01:22.890> frames<00:01:23.310> were<00:01:24.229> pretty<00:01:25.229> much

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
three or four frames were pretty much

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740 
three or four frames were pretty much
full<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.860> capped<00:01:26.210> then<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.450> down<00:01:27.600> into

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
full and capped then we get down into

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
full and capped then we get down into
the<00:01:27.930> brood<00:01:28.140> box<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.030> started<00:01:30.030> looking<00:01:30.299> for

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the brood box and started looking for

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
the brood box and started looking for
the<00:01:30.600> Queen<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:33.290> found<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the Queen in there and we found the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.289 
the Queen in there and we found the
Queen<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.450> then<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.700> frame<00:01:39.000> back

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
Queen and then we put the the frame back

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.719 
Queen and then we put the the frame back
in<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> Queen<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:41.340> could<00:01:41.520> tell

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
in with the Queen in there we could tell

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
in with the Queen in there we could tell
it<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> queen<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> activity

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it was the queen because of the activity

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.399 
it was the queen because of the activity
and<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.460> flurry<00:01:44.790> around<00:01:45.299> her<00:01:45.540> from<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and the flurry around her from the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.429 
and the flurry around her from the
worker<00:01:47.250> bees<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> when<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.899> started<00:01:49.229> messing

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
worker bees so when we started messing

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.960 
worker bees so when we started messing
with<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> Queen<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.579> active

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
with the Queen they got really active

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.020 
with the Queen they got really active
know<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:52.380> took<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.740> advice<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.040> Wendy<00:01:53.850> read

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
know we we took the advice of Wendy read

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
know we we took the advice of Wendy read
and<00:01:54.240> didn't<00:01:54.450> use<00:01:54.570> any<00:01:54.750> smoke<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> Queen

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
and didn't use any smoke so the Queen

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.179 
and didn't use any smoke so the Queen
wouldn't<00:01:56.310> go<00:01:56.399> run<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.090> hide<00:01:57.799> she<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.950> large

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wouldn't go run and hide she was large

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.530 
wouldn't go run and hide she was large
and<00:01:59.369> easy<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.909> and<00:01:59.939> hopefully<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.360> can

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and easy to see and hopefully you can

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.730 
and easy to see and hopefully you can
see<00:02:00.810> her<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.380> frame<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.780> took<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
see her on this frame here I took the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.649 
see her on this frame here I took the
picture<00:02:05.130> real<00:02:05.280> quickly<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.939> not<00:02:06.390> quite<00:02:06.630> sure

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
picture real quickly and not quite sure

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.029 
picture real quickly and not quite sure
if<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.020> caught<00:02:07.259> her<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> frame<00:02:07.799> but

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
if I caught her in the frame but

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.930 
if I caught her in the frame but
hopefully<00:02:08.520> she's<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.330> picture

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
hopefully she's in this in this picture

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.570 
hopefully she's in this in this picture
so<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:12.050> we<00:02:12.170> put<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.890> frame<00:02:13.130> back<00:02:13.340> in

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
so then we put the this frame back in

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.330 
so then we put the this frame back in
the<00:02:13.670> box<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.500> went<00:02:15.500> through<00:02:15.590> all<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> other

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
the box and went through all the other

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.360 
the box and went through all the other
frames<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.000> box<00:02:17.210> looking<00:02:17.660> for<00:02:17.870> any<00:02:18.370> larvae

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
frames in the box looking for any larvae

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.990 
frames in the box looking for any larvae
or<00:02:19.580> any<00:02:19.940> brood<00:02:21.010> any<00:02:22.010> eggs<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:22.850> there<00:02:22.940> were

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
or any brood any eggs and there were

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.680 
or any brood any eggs and there were
none<00:02:23.390> now<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:24.530> queen<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.520> we<00:02:25.670> found<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.420> not

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
none now this queen that we found is not

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.890 
none now this queen that we found is not
marked<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:28.550> Queens<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.240> got<00:02:29.720> from

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
marked and the Queens that I got from

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.190 
marked and the Queens that I got from
the<00:02:30.080> reeds<00:02:30.350> were<00:02:30.650> marked<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:31.600> I'm<00:02:32.600> thinking

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
the reeds were marked so I'm thinking

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.920 
the reeds were marked so I'm thinking
either<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.770> Queen<00:02:34.100> came<00:02:34.460> in<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.030> killed<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
either this Queen came in and killed the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.950 
either this Queen came in and killed the
original<00:02:36.800> Queen<00:02:37.100> or<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:38.300> some<00:02:38.540> reason<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
original Queen or for some reason the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.600 
original Queen or for some reason the
original<00:02:39.350> Queen<00:02:39.700> died<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.370> bees

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
original Queen died and the the bees

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.930 
original Queen died and the the bees
raised<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.300> new<00:02:44.480> queen<00:02:44.810> at<00:02:45.080> any<00:02:45.980> rate<00:02:46.130> this

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
raised a new queen at any rate this

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.980 
raised a new queen at any rate this
queen<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.840> not<00:02:47.950> laying<00:02:48.950> any<00:02:49.400> eggs<00:02:49.960> so<00:02:50.980> what<00:02:51.980> we

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
queen is not laying any eggs so what we

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.870 
queen is not laying any eggs so what we
unanimously<00:02:53.990> decided<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.920> do<00:02:55.070> was<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.580> pinch

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880
