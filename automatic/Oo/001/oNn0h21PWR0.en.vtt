00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
island because i noticed very quickly

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
island because i noticed very quickly
that<00:00:41.070> once<00:00:41.250> again<00:00:41.460> even<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> whole<00:00:42.180> ear

attracted it's almost too big for my

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.810 
attracted it's almost too big for my
island<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.590> amazingly<00:00:46.590> big<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.399> i<00:00:47.430> took<00:00:47.550> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
island it's amazingly big so i took this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.510 
island it's amazingly big so i took this
back<00:00:48.059> section<00:00:48.270> an<00:00:48.570> island<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.489> threw<00:00:50.489> on

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
back section an island and I threw on

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.689 
back section an island and I threw on
some<00:00:50.989> landscaping<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.320> textures<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> trees

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
some landscaping in textures and trees

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.040 
some landscaping in textures and trees
and<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.120> speed<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:54.989> can

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and I'm going to speed this up so we can

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.660 
and I'm going to speed this up so we can
get<00:00:55.170> back<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.530> pretty<00:00:55.710> quickly<00:00:56.399> because

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
get back there pretty quickly because

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.400 
get back there pretty quickly because
it's<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.480> pretty<00:00:57.660> far<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it's actually pretty far back on the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's actually pretty far back on the
island<00:00:59.270> but<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.379> really<00:01:01.379> wanted<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.800> some

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
island but I really wanted to get some

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.950 
island but I really wanted to get some
practice<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.579> more<00:01:02.969> natural<00:01:03.420> landscapes

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
practice on more natural landscapes

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.260 
practice on more natural landscapes
because<00:01:04.830> I'm<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.309> hoping<00:01:05.700> once<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> game

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
because I'm really hoping once the game

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.350 
because I'm really hoping once the game
is<00:01:06.299> released<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.610> we<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.790> our<00:01:08.909> private

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is released and we get our private

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
is released and we get our private
servers<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.619> develop<00:01:11.040> some<00:01:11.520> outdoor

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
servers that I can develop some outdoor

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.640

a huge ship the Orion comes in at 170 so
they're<00:01:55.740> very<00:01:55.770> close<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.460> size<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.790> that

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
they're very close in size and that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.639 
they're very close in size and that
little<00:01:57.060> 60<00:01:57.509> meter<00:01:57.689> constellation<00:01:58.320> down<00:01:58.469> there

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
little 60 meter constellation down there

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.200 
little 60 meter constellation down there
is<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.189> some<00:01:59.369> size<00:01:59.579> reference<00:01:59.939> because

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
is just for some size reference because

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
is just for some size reference because
it's<00:02:00.420> hard<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:00.780> an<00:02:00.869> idea<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.170> how<00:02:01.350> big<00:02:01.380> this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it's hard to get an idea of how big this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.859 
it's hard to get an idea of how big this
ship<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.490> even<00:02:03.000> put<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.270> Aurora<00:02:03.689> up

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
ship is I even put a little Aurora up

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.410 
ship is I even put a little Aurora up
top<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.439> give<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> an<00:02:04.829> idea<00:02:05.210> now<00:02:06.210> with

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
top just to give you an idea now with

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.850 
top just to give you an idea now with
the<00:02:06.509> whole<00:02:06.719> eee<00:02:06.930> I've<00:02:07.170> been<00:02:07.350> doing<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.799> of

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the whole eee I've been doing a lot of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.669 
the whole eee I've been doing a lot of
thinking<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.520> I'm<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.360> hoping<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.840> this

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
thinking and I'm really hoping that this

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.150 
thinking and I'm really hoping that this
ship<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.129> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> logistical<00:02:12.330> night

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
ship is going to be a logistical night

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.300 
ship is going to be a logistical night
to<00:02:13.520> fly<00:02:14.020> because<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.290> know<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.950> ships

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
to fly because you know we have ships

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.130 
to fly because you know we have ships
that<00:02:16.400> are<00:02:16.460> easier<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.940> fly<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.540> need<00:02:17.780> some

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
that are easier to fly and we need some

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.830 
that are easier to fly and we need some
very<00:02:18.470> challenging<00:02:19.160> ships<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.730> i<00:02:20.330> believe<00:02:20.630> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
very challenging ships and i believe the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.040 
very challenging ships and i believe the
d<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.200> e<00:02:21.440> could<00:02:21.740> be<00:02:21.890> those<00:02:22.130> ships<00:02:22.490> for<00:02:22.760> us<00:02:23.050> you

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
d and e could be those ships for us you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.600 
d and e could be those ships for us you
know<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.290> would<00:02:24.410> be<00:02:24.590> really<00:02:24.890> horrible<00:02:25.280> if<00:02:25.490> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
know it would be really horrible if a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.010 
know it would be really horrible if a
couple<00:02:25.910> guys<00:02:26.030> could<00:02:26.330> just<00:02:26.480> grab<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.690> couple

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
couple guys could just grab a couple

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.010 
couple guys could just grab a couple
MPC's<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.000> fly<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.060> thing<00:02:29.240> back<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.630> forth

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
MPC's and fly this thing back and forth

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.350 
MPC's and fly this thing back and forth
from<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.380> couple<00:02:30.620> planets<00:02:31.070> in<00:02:31.190> safe<00:02:31.460> space<00:02:31.820> you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
from a couple planets in safe space you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.850 
from a couple planets in safe space you
know<00:02:32.480> you're<00:02:32.630> talking<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.800> know

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
know you're talking you know

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.770 
know you're talking you know
billionaires<00:02:34.490> within<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.150> first<00:02:35.390> week<00:02:35.570> of

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
billionaires within the first week of

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.980 
billionaires within the first week of
the<00:02:35.930> verse<00:02:36.770> releasing<00:02:37.400> as<00:02:37.630> far<00:02:38.630> as<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.900> know

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
the verse releasing as far as you know

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.120 
the verse releasing as far as you know
that<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> mean<00:02:39.410> of<00:02:39.590> course<00:02:39.710> I'm<00:02:39.890> speculating

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
that I mean of course I'm speculating

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.880 
that I mean of course I'm speculating
but<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.910> seems<00:02:41.390> very<00:02:41.510> possible<00:02:42.320> with<00:02:42.740> as

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
but that seems very possible with as

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.830 
but that seems very possible with as
much<00:02:43.130> as<00:02:43.310> this<00:02:43.430> will<00:02:43.610> hold<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.420> could<00:02:44.570> find

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
much as this will hold if you could find

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.140 
much as this will hold if you could find
a<00:02:45.020> planet<00:02:45.530> that'll<00:02:45.890> buy<00:02:46.070> your<00:02:46.370> goods<00:02:46.610> for<00:02:46.970> just

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
a planet that'll buy your goods for just

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.280 
a planet that'll buy your goods for just
a<00:02:47.240> little<00:02:47.360> bit<00:02:47.450> more<00:02:47.690> than<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.990> bought<00:02:48.200> them

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
a little bit more than you bought them

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.500 
a little bit more than you bought them
for<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.740> they're<00:02:49.250> very<00:02:49.520> close<00:02:49.790> you're<00:02:50.360> not

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
for and they're very close you're not

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.430 
for and they're very close you're not
paying<00:02:50.750> much<00:02:50.960> for<00:02:51.490> fuel<00:02:52.490> costs<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:54.260> don't

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
paying much for fuel costs and you don't

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.840 
paying much for fuel costs and you don't
really<00:02:54.560> need<00:02:54.710> to<00:02:54.830> hire<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.040> bunch<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.370> escorts

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
really need to hire a bunch of escorts

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.580 
really need to hire a bunch of escorts
because<00:02:56.000> you'll<00:02:56.150> be<00:02:56.180> in<00:02:56.270> safe<00:02:56.720> space<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.530> know

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
because you'll be in safe space you know

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.050 
because you'll be in safe space you know
it'd<00:02:57.740> be<00:02:57.770> really<00:02:58.100> easy<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.580> make<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.760> lot<00:02:59.030> of

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
it'd be really easy to make a lot of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.610 
it'd be really easy to make a lot of
money<00:02:59.210> really<00:02:59.630> fast<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.140> we<00:03:00.230> don't<00:03:00.350> want<00:03:00.470> that

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
money really fast and we don't want that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.170

it's<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.710> monstrous<00:03:10.550> ship<00:03:11.420> now<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.260> course<00:03:12.470> it's

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
it's a monstrous ship now of course it's

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.430 
it's a monstrous ship now of course it's
not<00:03:12.800> idris<00:03:13.370> sized<00:03:13.610> but<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.240> monstrous<00:03:14.870> and

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
not idris sized but it is monstrous and

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.830 
not idris sized but it is monstrous and
if<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.220> look<00:03:16.370> at<00:03:16.460> that<00:03:16.580> aurora<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.060> top<00:03:17.360> it's

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
if you look at that aurora on top it's

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.470 
if you look at that aurora on top it's
almost<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.470> size<00:03:18.650> as<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.670> turret<00:03:20.060> up<00:03:20.180> front

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
almost the size as the turret up front

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.240 
almost the size as the turret up front
and<00:03:20.720> if<00:03:21.350> we<00:03:21.470> swing<00:03:21.709> around<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.130> main

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
and if we swing around to the main

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.920 
and if we swing around to the main
thrusters<00:03:22.670> back<00:03:22.850> here<00:03:23.030> i<00:03:23.060> also<00:03:23.270> put<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.630> aurora

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
thrusters back here i also put in aurora

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.240 
thrusters back here i also put in aurora
back<00:03:24.140> here<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.440> give<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.650> an<00:03:24.740> idea<00:03:24.830> because

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
back here to give you an idea because

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.210 
back here to give you an idea because
those<00:03:25.400> main<00:03:25.580> thrusters<00:03:26.120> are<00:03:26.330> also<00:03:26.840> just<00:03:27.500> huge

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
those main thrusters are also just huge

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.170 
those main thrusters are also just huge
so<00:03:29.140> with<00:03:30.140> this<00:03:30.260> thing<00:03:30.560> once<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.400> retracted

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
so with this thing once it is retracted

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.840 
so with this thing once it is retracted
in<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.510> actual<00:03:32.900> pu<00:03:33.500> those<00:03:34.130> rear<00:03:34.430> thrusters

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
in the actual pu those rear thrusters

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.850 
in the actual pu those rear thrusters
are<00:03:35.090> going<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.600> collapse<00:03:35.930> onto<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.590> ship<00:03:36.830> a

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
are going to collapse onto the ship a

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.140 
are going to collapse onto the ship a
little<00:03:37.160> tighter<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:37.640> it's<00:03:37.760> not<00:03:37.880> going<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.090> be

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
little tighter so it's not going to be

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.540 
little tighter so it's not going to be
as<00:03:38.330> fat<00:03:38.750> in<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.080> back<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.130> still<00:03:40.340> gives

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
as fat in the back but this still gives

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.360 
as fat in the back but this still gives
us<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.760> really<00:03:40.910> good<00:03:41.150> idea<00:03:41.270> of<00:03:41.600> lengthwise<00:03:42.370> I'm

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
us a really good idea of lengthwise I'm

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.520 
us a really good idea of lengthwise I'm
thinking<00:03:43.880> it'll<00:03:44.330> have<00:03:44.720> more<00:03:44.750> streamlined

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
thinking it'll have more streamlined

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.460 
thinking it'll have more streamlined
look<00:03:45.620> kind<00:03:46.100> of<00:03:46.190> like<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.720> orion<00:03:48.140> over

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
look kind of like the the orion over

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.240 
look kind of like the the orion over
there<00:03:48.790> but<00:03:49.790> nonetheless<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.830> whole<00:03:52.040> ear

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
there but nonetheless the whole ear

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.670 
there but nonetheless the whole ear
attracted<00:03:52.760> is<00:03:52.910> still<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> big<00:03:53.510> tank<00:03:54.110> of<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.380> ship

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
attracted is still a big tank of a ship

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.100 
attracted is still a big tank of a ship
I<00:03:54.890> can<00:03:55.700> really<00:03:55.940> see<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.300> thing<00:03:56.540> being<00:03:56.810> a

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
I can really see this thing being a

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.290 
I can really see this thing being a
force<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.650> reckon<00:03:57.680> with<00:03:58.010> when<00:03:58.850> it's<00:03:59.000> in<00:03:59.150> its

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
force to reckon with when it's in its

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.180
