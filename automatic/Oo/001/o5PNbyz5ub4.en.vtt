00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.469 
the bowstring length I'm going to need
is<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.479> I<00:01:08.109> add<00:01:08.259> about<00:01:08.590> six<00:01:08.649> inches<00:01:09.189> of<00:01:09.369> that<00:01:09.520> to

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
is and I add about six inches of that to

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:11.700 
is and I add about six inches of that to
that<00:01:10.509> number<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:10.960> that's<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.350> length<00:01:11.500> of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
that number and that's the length of

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.830 
that number and that's the length of
paracord<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.310> I<00:01:12.369> cut<00:01:12.579> and<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:13.359> I<00:01:13.420> melt<00:01:13.659> one

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
paracord that I cut and then I melt one

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.800 
paracord that I cut and then I melt one
end<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.100> then<00:01:15.369> flatten<00:01:15.759> it<00:01:15.789> down<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.570> try<00:01:16.780> and

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
end and then flatten it down to try and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.870 
end and then flatten it down to try and
use<00:01:17.500> some<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.829> those<00:01:17.920> fibers<00:01:18.369> together<00:01:18.549> so

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
use some of those fibers together so

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.179 
use some of those fibers together so
that<00:01:19.030> will<00:01:19.119> come<00:01:19.240> back<00:01:19.450> through<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.749> string

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that will come back through the string

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.270 
that will come back through the string
once<00:01:21.189> you've<00:01:21.520> made<00:01:21.820> your<00:01:21.880> knot<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.920> what<00:01:24.039> we<00:01:24.130> do

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
once you've made your knot so what we do

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.029 
once you've made your knot so what we do
is<00:01:24.429> we<00:01:24.549> get<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.759> go<00:01:24.999> to<00:01:25.030> one<00:01:25.270> end<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:26.649> make<00:01:27.009> a

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
is we get to go to one end and make a

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.700 
is we get to go to one end and make a
loop<00:01:29.759> we've<00:01:30.759> got<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.909> loop<00:01:31.149> here<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:32.350> take<00:01:32.530> your

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
loop we've got a loop here you take your

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.940 
loop we've got a loop here you take your
leading<00:01:32.920> edge<00:01:33.219> and<00:01:33.609> add<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.179> loop<00:01:34.359> goes<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
leading edge and add the loop goes in

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.090 
leading edge and add the loop goes in
front<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.609> the<00:01:36.909> body<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.420> string<00:01:37.749> I<00:01:38.100> take

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
front of the body of the string I take

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.580 
front of the body of the string I take
my<00:01:39.310> leading<00:01:39.549> edge<00:01:39.819> and<00:01:40.149> go<00:01:40.749> through<00:01:41.079> that<00:01:41.319> loop

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
my leading edge and go through that loop

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.289 
my leading edge and go through that loop
and<00:01:41.859> then<00:01:42.600> back<00:01:43.600> over<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:45.159> body<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.880> through

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
and then back over the body and through

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.010 
and then back over the body and through
the<00:01:46.389> loop<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:47.049> other<00:01:47.170> direction<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:49.020> from

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
the loop the other direction and from

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.679 
the loop the other direction and from
here<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.740> take<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.579> bottom<00:01:51.939> of<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.149> loop<00:01:52.329> and

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
here you take the bottom of the loop and

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.599 
here you take the bottom of the loop and
the<00:01:53.639> leading<00:01:54.639> edge<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:56.130> pull<00:01:57.130> them<00:01:57.280> until

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
the leading edge and pull them until

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.739 
the leading edge and pull them until
you're<00:01:57.759> about<00:01:58.060> tight<00:01:59.069> and<00:02:00.450> then<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.569> can

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
you're about tight and then you can

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.660 
you're about tight and then you can
tighten<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.229> string<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.920> takes<00:02:03.189> your<00:02:03.399> slack

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
like I said it's a great knot it's not

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.309 
like I said it's a great knot it's not
going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> collapse<00:02:09.869> on

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
going to it's not going to collapse on

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.119 
going to it's not going to collapse on
you<00:02:10.760> one<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.060> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> want<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.480> do

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
you one thing you're going to want to do

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.979 
you one thing you're going to want to do
but<00:02:14.129> every<00:02:14.400> time<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:17.480> every<00:02:18.480> time<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.780> use

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
but every time you every time you use

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.509 
but every time you every time you use
the<00:02:19.019> knot<00:02:19.349> you're<00:02:19.950> going<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.129> want<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> check

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
the knot you're going to want to check

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.900 
the knot you're going to want to check
it<00:02:20.670> for<00:02:20.700> defects<00:02:21.890> while<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.129> knot<00:02:23.340> holds<00:02:23.790> up

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
it for defects while this knot holds up

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.180 
it for defects while this knot holds up
remarkably<00:02:24.060> well<00:02:24.599> under<00:02:25.260> strain<00:02:25.709> which<00:02:26.160> is

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
remarkably well under strain which is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.839 
remarkably well under strain which is
what<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.489> was<00:02:26.580> designed<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:27.030> do<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.540> does<00:02:28.200> not

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
what it was designed to do it does not

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.369 
what it was designed to do it does not
fare<00:02:29.849> as<00:02:30.060> well<00:02:30.090> when<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.629> not<00:02:30.840> under<00:02:31.140> tension

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
fare as well when it's not under tension

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.680 
fare as well when it's not under tension
so<00:02:31.709> before<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.129> put<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:32.519> your<00:02:32.640> bow<00:02:32.790> you're

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
so before you put it on your bow you're

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.089 
so before you put it on your bow you're
just<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:33.989> check<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.680> know<00:02:34.769> pull<00:02:35.010> it

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
just going to check it you know pull it

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.250 
just going to check it you know pull it
hand<00:02:35.310> tight<00:02:35.400> make<00:02:35.790> sure<00:02:35.819> it's<00:02:36.180> still<00:02:36.420> there

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
hand tight make sure it's still there

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.220 
hand tight make sure it's still there
because<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.130> be<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:39.750> can<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:39.900> taken<00:02:40.140> apart

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
because it can be it can be taken apart

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.430 
because it can be it can be taken apart
relatively<00:02:40.650> easily<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.840> know<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.019> just<00:02:43.170> grab

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
relatively easily you know you just grab

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.130 
relatively easily you know you just grab
the<00:02:43.620> bottom<00:02:43.920> here<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.690> pull<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.019> whole

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
the whole body of the knot comes loose

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.740

plastic sticks that I've painted to look

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.580 
plastic sticks that I've painted to look
like<00:03:23.940> boughs<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.989> he's<00:03:25.079> pretty<00:03:25.230> used<00:03:25.440> to
