planted in 95 you can see see the vines
here<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:08.810> what<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.929> called<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.379> liar<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.730> it's

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
here there what is called a liar so it's

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.720 
here there what is called a liar so it's
a<00:02:11.970> divided<00:02:12.390> canopy<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:13.019> split<00:02:13.319> them<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.530> two<00:02:13.730> in

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
a divided canopy we split them in two in

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.729 
a divided canopy we split them in two in

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
order to get the Sun kind of coming

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.009 
order to get the Sun kind of coming
through<00:02:16.769> on<00:02:17.069> both<00:02:17.099> sides<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.269> we've<00:02:18.780> also

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
through on both sides and we've also

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.710 
through on both sides and we've also
gone<00:02:19.319> through<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.040> send<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.150> lot<00:02:21.299> of<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> fruit

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
gone through and send a lot of the fruit

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.900 
gone through and send a lot of the fruit
out<00:02:21.959> Grenache<00:02:22.769> likes<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.220> set<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> pretty<00:02:23.730> heavy

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
out Grenache likes to set a pretty heavy

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.819 
out Grenache likes to set a pretty heavy
crop<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.480> what<00:02:24.629> we<00:02:24.720> usually<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.379> go<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.680> and

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
crop so what we usually do is go in and

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.270 
crop so what we usually do is go in and
drop<00:02:25.980> about<00:02:26.250> half<00:02:26.519> of<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:27.260> reduce<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:29.040> amount

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
drop about half of it reduce the amount

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.089 
drop about half of it reduce the amount
of<00:02:29.340> fruit<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.900> turn<00:02:31.620> when<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.890> don't<00:02:32.040> have

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
of fruit and in turn when you don't have

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.699 
of fruit and in turn when you don't have
as<00:02:32.250> much<00:02:32.370> fruit<00:02:32.670> hanging<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:34.079> you<00:02:34.470> tend

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
as much fruit hanging you you you tend

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.319 
as much fruit hanging you you you tend
to<00:02:34.739> get<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.950> wine<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.459> has<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:36.180> more

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
to get a wine that has a little more

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.960 
to get a wine that has a little more
depth<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.400> also<00:02:38.489> see<00:02:38.760> though

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
depth to it you can also see though

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.729 
depth to it you can also see though
because<00:02:39.329> of<00:02:39.450> these<00:02:39.569> these<00:02:39.900> soils<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.500> our

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
because of these these soils that our

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.830 
because of these these soils that our
berries<00:02:41.069> are<00:02:41.250> still<00:02:41.790> quite<00:02:42.030> small<00:02:42.209> even<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.810> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
berries are still quite small even for a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.420 
berries are still quite small even for a
variety<00:02:43.079> like<00:02:43.230> Grenache<00:02:43.739> which<00:02:44.040> tends<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
variety like Grenache which tends to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
variety like Grenache which tends to
have<00:02:44.579> a<00:02:44.609> very<00:02:44.879> very<00:02:45.569> large<00:02:45.750> berry<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.840> we<00:02:49.019> have

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
have a very very large berry so we have

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.559 
have a very very large berry so we have
on<00:02:49.410> our<00:02:49.590> right<00:02:49.799> here<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.099> block<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.760> Syrah<00:02:53.569> you

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
on our right here a block of Syrah you

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.440 
on our right here a block of Syrah you
can<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:56.190> hasn't<00:02:56.609> been<00:02:56.639> thinned<00:02:57.000> out<00:02:57.180> yet

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
can see this hasn't been thinned out yet

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.300 
can see this hasn't been thinned out yet
the<00:02:57.690> crop<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.380> crop<00:02:58.500> still<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.980> little<00:02:59.130> bit

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the crop the crop still a little bit

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.870 
the crop the crop still a little bit
heavy<00:03:00.200> will<00:03:01.200> go<00:03:01.349> in<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.769> few<00:03:01.799> days<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.459> drop

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
heavy will go in in a few days and drop

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.900 
heavy will go in in a few days and drop
about<00:03:03.180> half<00:03:03.389> of<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.599> load<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.430> reduce<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.669> so

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
about half of that load and reduce it so

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.089 
about half of that load and reduce it so
so<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.660> gets<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.930> little<00:03:07.049> more<00:03:07.260> concentration

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
so it gets a little more concentration

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.640 
so it gets a little more concentration
when<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:08.549> when<00:03:08.849> it's<00:03:08.970> ripe<00:03:09.470> but<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.530> can

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
when it's when it's ripe but you can

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.629 
when it's when it's ripe but you can
also<00:03:10.769> see<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.069> kind<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.370> difference

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
also see the kind of the difference

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.970 
also see the kind of the difference
between<00:03:11.730> Syrah<00:03:12.389> and<00:03:12.419> Grenache<00:03:12.900> here<00:03:13.230> Syrah<00:03:13.919> is

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
between Syrah and Grenache here Syrah is

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.120 
between Syrah and Grenache here Syrah is
much<00:03:14.250> more<00:03:14.459> lanky<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.120> open<00:03:15.510> growing<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.230> a

little more kind of vigorous in its

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.559 
little more kind of vigorous in its
growth<00:03:19.709> where<00:03:20.639> Grenache<00:03:20.940> was<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.299> little<00:03:21.480> more

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
growth where Grenache was a little more

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.640 
growth where Grenache was a little more
compact<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:23.389> bigger<00:03:24.389> clusters<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.440> these

compact and bigger clusters and these

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.229 
compact and bigger clusters and these
Syrah<00:03:25.950> clusters<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.609> can<00:03:26.700> see<00:03:26.880> here<00:03:27.769> fairly

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
Syrah clusters you can see here fairly

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.120 
Syrah clusters you can see here fairly
fairly<00:03:30.239> small<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.810> loose<00:03:30.989> compared<00:03:31.889> to<00:03:31.980> those

fairly small and loose compared to those
larger<00:03:32.940> Grenache<00:03:33.239> clusters<00:03:33.859> so<00:03:34.859> because<00:03:35.250> this

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
larger Grenache clusters so because this

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.909 
larger Grenache clusters so because this
accent<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.630> small<00:03:36.900> limiting<00:03:37.829> our
