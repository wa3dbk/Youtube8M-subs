it says is down for maintenance if that

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.289 
it says is down for maintenance if that
were<00:03:48.010> true<00:03:48.220> if<00:03:48.549> they<00:03:48.730> were<00:03:48.820> actually<00:03:49.000> going

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
were true if they were actually going

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.970 
were true if they were actually going
down<00:03:49.570> for<00:03:49.720> maintenance<00:03:49.870> let's<00:03:50.470> compare<00:03:50.829> this

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
down for maintenance let's compare this

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.349 
down for maintenance let's compare this
to<00:03:51.130> what<00:03:51.160> they<00:03:51.340> do<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:51.700> Xbox<00:03:52.090> which<00:03:52.239> will

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
to what they do on the Xbox which will

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.000 
to what they do on the Xbox which will
be<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> first<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.930> only<00:03:52.989> comparison<00:03:53.620> I'll<00:03:53.859> do

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
be the first and only comparison I'll do

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.789 
be the first and only comparison I'll do
between<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.400> two<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.060> video<00:03:55.769> where<00:03:56.769> it

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
between the two in this video where it

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.380 
between the two in this video where it
really<00:03:57.250> does<00:03:57.609> go<00:03:57.819> down<00:03:57.850> for<00:03:58.269> maintenance

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
really does go down for maintenance

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.750 
really does go down for maintenance
which<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.109> think<00:03:59.440> happens<00:03:59.829> maybe<00:04:00.160> once<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.730> year

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
which I think happens maybe once a year

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.380 
which I think happens maybe once a year
they<00:04:01.630> actually<00:04:02.049> send<00:04:02.350> you<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> message<00:04:03.390> Xbox

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
they actually send you a message Xbox

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.300 
they actually send you a message Xbox
sends<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.810> message<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.410> an<00:04:05.470> email<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:06.040> think

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
sends you a message and an email I think

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.309

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
saying we will be down for maintenance
