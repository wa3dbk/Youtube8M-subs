00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.110
 a week after the korfball final in the remote, the korfball players continue with 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.779
 the competition on the field 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.299
 nec is in second place in the honorary class b the team is after five 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.449
 matches still undefeated 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.909
 Easter Monday playing the Groningen players against Fortuna 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.399
 his first goal of the match thanks to rianne van real one 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.140
 in the form of an orange forest stadium, the game does not start well, but Joop 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.569
 sweet milk and has no luck 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.419
 both teams have a hard time scoring the sailing route seems to be the sights of it 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.780
 to influence the korfball players 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.940
 the audience enjoy the sun while the teams keep score 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 shortly thereafter with a nice attack now 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.329
 the ball goes round quickly and arjan tijl shoots in the equalizer 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.840
 belga 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.520
 now i'm trying to set up an attack yourself you can find us going for the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.560
 goalkeeper 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.600
 nijhof incorrectly stopped 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.470
 the penalty for being shot in by dolphin even and nodding leads with 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.760
 two against one 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.630
 fortuna now has the better of the game and the team from delft equalized again 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.280
 the groningers scored only four goals in the first half 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 only top scorer rianne, however, does not occasionally score yet 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.660
 fortuna also misses a lot of hair did a few at the end of the first half 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.680
 grind the ball through the basket 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 and at rest that aims with the 7 4 behind 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.250
 after the break I was able to score a goal closer thanks to villa gray hair 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.940
 braid 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.130
 the audience gets to see very poor scores for fifteen minutes 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.950
 defensively with matters well in order the attacker goes on dramatically 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.030
 not a single shot 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.580
 and fortuna also participates in the malaise 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 the guests also better not to redeem their chances 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.890
 many frustrated by the corridor are also the many misses and remains 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.540
 fight 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.420
 and friso finally offered the ball well 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.420
 nice score and the difference is only ten points 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.180
 the home team dominated but these additional actions of the referee 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.189
 not good 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.080
 friso offered does not agree 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 but the referee rightly gives one of his reactions yellow 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.169
 the competition is fiercer and jeroen dolfing made it right for malaga 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.529
 all 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:22.749
 h 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.629
 but that does not cost too much power to get right 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.939
 and after the equalizer fortuna a simple out 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.019
 this can no longer make a fist and fortuna is on its way to profit 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.719
 nick only scored nine times on Monday 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.229
 and fortuna had thirteen hits enough to win in Groningen 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.549
 despite the loss, aiming remains in second place in the honorary class b 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.180
 with seven points from six games
