that design right on now some of the

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.930 
that design right on now some of the
tools<00:02:32.590> today<00:02:32.830> come<00:02:33.459> with<00:02:33.610> these<00:02:33.760> little

now<00:02:53.049> here's<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.319> great<00:02:53.650> tip<00:02:53.920> I'm<00:02:54.819> kind<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.299> at

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
now here's a great tip I'm kind of at

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.750 
now here's a great tip I'm kind of at
this<00:02:55.600> point<00:02:55.720> following<00:02:56.440> right<00:02:57.160> along<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
this point following right along the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.080 
this point following right along the
line<00:02:57.970> but<00:02:58.470> usually<00:02:59.470> if<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.489> take<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> little<00:03:00.940> bit

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
line but usually if I take a little bit

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.229 
line but usually if I take a little bit
more<00:03:01.360> time<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.870> try<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.739> do<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.130> just<00:03:03.489> inside

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
more time I try to do it just inside

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.289 
more time I try to do it just inside
that<00:03:04.269> line<00:03:05.019> right<00:03:05.680> inside<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.280> area<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:06.910> want

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
that line right inside that area I want

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.509 
that line right inside that area I want
to<00:03:07.360> carve<00:03:07.569> out<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.080> way<00:03:08.620> when<00:03:08.830> it's<00:03:08.980> time<00:03:09.310> to

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
to carve out that way when it's time to

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.400 
to carve out that way when it's time to
carve<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:10.030> carve<00:03:10.330> just<00:03:10.599> on<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.870> outside<00:03:11.260> of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410

that and those little holes never appear
in<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:15.040> final<00:03:15.250> carving<00:03:15.790> now<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.330> get<00:03:16.510> around

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
in the final carving now to get around

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.420

great<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.739> do<00:03:29.950> if<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.160> have<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.310> more<00:03:30.519> intricate

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
great to do if you have a more intricate

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
pattern if you have something as simple

pattern if you have something as simple
as<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.250> you've<00:03:33.340> done<00:03:33.519> it<00:03:33.670> before<00:03:33.790> you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
as this and you've done it before you

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.000 
as this and you've done it before you
can<00:03:34.690> start<00:03:34.930> spacing<00:03:35.440> them<00:03:35.560> maybe<00:03:35.680> every

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
can start spacing them maybe every

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.770 
can start spacing them maybe every
quarter<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.519> half<00:03:36.700> inch<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:37.329> to<00:03:37.480> make<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.660> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
quarter to half inch just to make it a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.900 
quarter to half inch just to make it a
little<00:03:37.900> easier<00:03:38.140> on<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.709> now<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.760> can<00:03:39.880> see

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
little easier on you now so you can see

little easier on you now so you can see
that<00:03:40.420> was<00:03:40.600> very<00:03:40.989> quick<00:03:41.319> for<00:03:41.530> me<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.829> do<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.970> I

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
that was very quick for me to do so I

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.819 
that was very quick for me to do so I
can<00:03:43.480> take<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.410> right<00:03:44.560> off<00:03:44.890> now<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:47.109> can

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
can take this right off now and I can

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.890 
can take this right off now and I can
see<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.130> pattern<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.549> here<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.389> might<00:03:49.600> not<00:03:49.750> be
