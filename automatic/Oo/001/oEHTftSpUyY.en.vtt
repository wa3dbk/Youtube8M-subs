00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.190
 hi everyone I'm h of 09 and this is another 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.629
 video in hd and it makes me have them 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.719
 abandoned and believe it or not 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.309
 ashley is still sick let's say it's 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.559
 the female version xxi to don cooper 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.090
 when it comes to diseases and good 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.279
 I bring you another short video and 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.130
 informative about the universe of ge and 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.929
 what could be useful with maybe no longer 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.910
 I know I have them fucked up with these 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.710
 videos but so far I think 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.109
 save one or another gameplay for 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.240
 comment after and for the moment this 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.190
 will do the job if you really like it 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.829
 this kind of video something different in my 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.960
 channel and something informative please leave 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.170
 you like it and say you think about it 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.149
 if you want more videos of this or not but 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.370
 for now let's start talking about the 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.739
 monitors monitors are 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.989
 very advanced artificial intelligences 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.050
 created by the four runners more than 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.760
 100 thousand years to occupy positions 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.129
 specials in the society of the unit or 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.100
 ronald one of the main purposes 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.940
 of a monitor was to be the caregivers of 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.309
 the halo matrix 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.619
 matrix 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.869
 but not only from silos, also from other 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.729
 facilities such as maintenance 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.890
 installations of lines and for 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.500
 guarantee the containment of the fleet 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.229
 imprisoned the monitors are 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.020
 extremely intelligent however 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.479
 They are completely dedicated to their function 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.360
 original and are jealous about the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.820
 containment of the fleet monitors have 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.189
 been known to betray allies and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.610
 those same allies think to violate the 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.250
 containment code the covenant also 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.659
 known as the pact in Spanish 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.390
 refer to the monitors as the 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.189
 oracles on the other hand beings 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.009
 humans simply in use in any 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.080
 name as for example sergeant johnson 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.270
 he has referred to the transport monitor 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.270
 youth sports or translated into Spanish 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.299
 guilty spark 343 as a light bulb 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.640
 bell and robot as much as the boss 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.310
 teacher and johnson simply the chord 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.659
 its name to spark occasionally 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.820
 monitors with action in history in 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.070
 halo have been very few 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.970
 I will tell you no since the translation 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.030
 in Spanish 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.130
 honestly they have a little weird too 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.500
 when he mentioned some installation 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.820
 I really mean a heyl the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.720
 monitors are called the high the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.870
 facilities 049 handy testament was 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.730
 assigned to the installation 03 for drugs 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.090
 this park was assigned to the installation 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.670
 04 pony force cirone paint try jr 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.860
 was assigned to installation 05 the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.160
 cold contingency monitor was also 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.140
 assigned to the installation 0 5 686 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.010
 evolution sprint was assigned the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.440
 installation of line 1 to 4 of girlfriend and a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.950
 data collector in the planet area or 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.260
 role of rector and benin cambias was created 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.510
 to defeat it alfot rahman also 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.320
 temporarily assigned to the installation 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.680
 07 later happened rampant inserted to the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.709
 offensive flower was created to defeat 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.690
 to the then rampant in medical ia 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.110
 tracks 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.070
 and finally an artificial intelligence 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.020
 unknown was assigned to cel 045 9 the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.300
 most of the monitors and intelligences 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.790
 were created thanks to the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.010
 composer we can see a clear example 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.050
 of artificial intelligences created 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.360
 with this technology when facing us 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.850
 against the promising gentlemen in it 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.930
 four of the monitors were created 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.000
 thanks to the composer 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.840
 that means they come from beings 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.810
 humans like the Promethean knights do not 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.720
 do not believe me guilty guy 343 was created 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.830
 on the basis of the DNA of the human being called 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.930
 chaca chaca if unfortunately you chacas in 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:52.260
 the year 100 1300 pc 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.540
 means before the common era a little 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.219
 interesting monitors and intelligences 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.750
 artificial facts thank you the 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.390
 genetic information of beings 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.030
 humans in a certain way the composer 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.159
 does wonders and makes disaster 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.920
 depending on how it can be used or 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.569
 except that the good ferrons think 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.670
