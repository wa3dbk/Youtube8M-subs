but but also there's there's a lot of
real<00:02:57.750> sadness<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.379> I<00:02:58.439> think<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> lot<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:58.829> us

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
real sadness and I think a lot of us

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.920 
real sadness and I think a lot of us
that<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.579> anger<00:02:59.849> comes<00:03:00.150> from<00:03:00.299> not

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
that the anger comes from not

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.250 
that the anger comes from not
understanding<00:03:01.680> why<00:03:02.670> he's<00:03:03.000> sad<00:03:03.239> or<00:03:03.569> lonely<00:03:04.049> or

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
understanding why he's sad or lonely or

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.960 
understanding why he's sad or lonely or
in<00:03:04.530> pain<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.639> where<00:03:05.819> all<00:03:05.879> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
in pain I think that's where all the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.399 
in pain I think that's where all the
anger<00:03:06.180> comes<00:03:06.389> from<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.599> thought<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.290> know

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409

on the sort of the reflective side of
the<00:03:14.849> anger<00:03:15.180> rather<00:03:15.450> than<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:15.780> out-and-out

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
the anger rather than the out-and-out
