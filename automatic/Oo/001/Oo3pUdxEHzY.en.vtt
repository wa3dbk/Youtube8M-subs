00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380

of call of duty ish but one of the first

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.069 
of call of duty ish but one of the first
impressions<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> definitely

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
impressions was that it definitely

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.440

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
doesn't feel that way there was also a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.899 
doesn't feel that way there was also a
big<00:01:45.689> concern<00:01:46.110> regarding<00:01:46.350> six<00:01:47.040> versus<00:01:47.399> six<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
how that might be a very tiny thing and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
how that might be a very tiny thing and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
very hard to kill but they do get in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.139

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that's an interesting dynamic between

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.140 
that's an interesting dynamic between
all<00:02:11.039> these<00:02:11.160> impressions<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.849> stuff<00:02:12.030> like

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
all these impressions and stuff like

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.910 
all these impressions and stuff like
that<00:02:12.209> i<00:02:12.360> think<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.720> they

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
that i think that they

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.440 
that i think that they
that<00:02:13.069> we<00:02:13.160> definitely<00:02:13.670> want<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.940> figure<00:02:14.270> out

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
that we definitely want to figure out

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.020 
that we definitely want to figure out
based<00:02:14.780> off<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.230> alpha<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.490> is<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.790> too

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
based off this alpha is that is it too

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.670 
based off this alpha is that is it too
much<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.450> something<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.110> too<00:02:18.290> much<00:02:18.319> like

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
much like something is it too much like

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.440 
much like something is it too much like
Call<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.950> Duty<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.580> too<00:02:19.819> much<00:02:19.849> like<00:02:20.270> other

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
Call of Duty is it too much like other

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.690 
Call of Duty is it too much like other
games<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.560> think<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.890> big<00:02:22.069> impression<00:02:22.459> is

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
games and I think the big impression is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
games and I think the big impression is
that<00:02:22.730> just<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.209> my<00:02:23.540> friend<00:02:23.840> Matt<00:02:24.050> who<00:02:24.260> played

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
that just like my friend Matt who played

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.010 
that just like my friend Matt who played
it<00:02:24.739> at<00:02:24.890> PAX<00:02:25.190> last<00:02:25.520> year<00:02:25.880> he<00:02:26.360> was<00:02:26.480> explaining<00:02:26.780> to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
it at PAX last year he was explaining to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.780 
it at PAX last year he was explaining to
me<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.560> game<00:02:27.739> feels<00:02:28.040> ballistic<00:02:28.640> that

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
me that the game feels ballistic that

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.340 
me that the game feels ballistic that
there's<00:02:29.000> always<00:02:29.300> something<00:02:29.690> going<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.230> it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
there's always something going on and it

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.440 
there's always something going on and it
gets<00:02:30.470> really<00:02:30.770> hectic<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.340> really<00:02:31.580> crazy<00:02:31.880> that

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
gets really hectic and really crazy that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.180 
gets really hectic and really crazy that
isn't<00:02:32.690> exactly<00:02:32.840> mean<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.319> bad<00:02:33.590> thing<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:34.010> have

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
isn't exactly mean a bad thing you have

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.860 
isn't exactly mean a bad thing you have
like<00:02:34.430> different<00:02:34.610> utilities<00:02:35.239> available<00:02:35.720> to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
like different utilities available to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.449 
like different utilities available to
