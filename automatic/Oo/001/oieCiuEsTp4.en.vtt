the<00:00:10.290> first<00:00:10.530> part<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> project<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.730> to

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the first part of the project is to

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.580 
the first part of the project is to
assess<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.420> condition<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> water<00:00:13.290> heater

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
assess the condition of the water heater

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.250 
assess the condition of the water heater
is<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.309> clean<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.269> rust<00:00:15.540> free<00:00:15.990> or

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
is it clean is it rust free or

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.370 
is it clean is it rust free or
relatively<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.970> there<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> place<00:00:18.779> nearby<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
relatively so is there a place nearby to

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.730 
relatively so is there a place nearby to
drain<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.039> water<00:00:20.220> from<00:00:20.430> from<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> tank<00:00:21.740> we

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
drain the water from from the tank we

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.590 
drain the water from from the tank we
can<00:00:22.890> find<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.279> something<00:00:23.580> about<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.210> age<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
can find out something about the age of

can find out something about the age of
the<00:00:24.689> water<00:00:24.930> heater<00:00:25.199> by<00:00:25.439> looking<00:00:25.859> at<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.279> label

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760

the twist valve or lever valve above the
heat<00:00:38.510> next<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.660> drain<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:39.989> water<00:00:40.320> heater

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
heat next we drain the water heater

heat next we drain the water heater
either<00:00:41.390> directly<00:00:42.390> onto<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.899> floor<00:00:43.170> or

either directly onto the floor or
sometimes<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.730> use<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.969> hose<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.300> order<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.989> keep

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
sometimes we use a hose in order to keep

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.700 
sometimes we use a hose in order to keep
from<00:00:46.860> making<00:00:47.010> plays<00:00:47.399> match<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:47.969> us<00:00:48.710> if

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
from making plays match it with us if

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
from making plays match it with us if
the<00:00:49.890> water<00:00:50.160> drains<00:00:50.579> freely<00:00:51.180> through<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> hose

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the water drains freely through the hose

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.169 
the water drains freely through the hose
then<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
then you know the

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.389 
then you know the
not<00:00:55.179> plugged<00:00:55.749> with<00:00:55.960> settlement<00:00:56.499> and<00:00:57.010> we'll

not plugged with settlement and we'll

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.860 
not plugged with settlement and we'll

continue with this process while we're

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.569 
continue with this process while we're
waiting<00:01:02.170> for<00:01:02.350> it<00:01:02.409> to<00:01:02.500> drain<00:01:02.769> let's<00:01:03.100> turn<00:01:03.399> off

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
waiting for it to drain let's turn off

convenient the next thing we need to do

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.080 
convenient the next thing we need to do
is<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.600> remove<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.200> exhaust<00:01:17.590> pipe<00:01:18.130> from<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
is to remove the exhaust pipe from the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.749 
is to remove the exhaust pipe from the
top<00:01:19.360> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.630> water<00:01:19.840> later<00:01:20.140> by<00:01:20.799> disconnecting

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
top of the water later by disconnecting

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.210 
top of the water later by disconnecting
three<00:01:22.360> sheet<00:01:22.689> metal<00:01:23.020> screws<00:01:23.320> using<00:01:23.679> our<00:01:23.979> nut

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.850 
driver and removing the exhaust upon it
we<00:01:27.850> need<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.179> save<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.659> part<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.200> keep<00:01:29.710> it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
we need to save that part and keep it

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.510 
we need to save that part and keep it
with<00:01:30.069> the<00:01:30.100> water<00:01:30.429> heater<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:32.649> final<00:01:33.039> step<00:01:33.190> is

with the water heater the final step is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.580 
with the water heater the final step is
to<00:01:33.670> disconnect<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.299> input<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:34.810> output<00:01:35.020> lines

to disconnect the input and output lines

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.740 
to disconnect the input and output lines
many<00:01:36.220> people<00:01:36.459> would<00:01:36.759> be<00:01:36.880> tempted<00:01:37.299> to<00:01:37.330> just

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
many people would be tempted to just

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.050 
many people would be tempted to just
turn<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.590> nuts<00:01:38.799> at<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.459> top<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.909> heater

turn the nuts at the top of the heater

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.630 
turn the nuts at the top of the heater
but<00:01:40.810> we<00:01:40.929> recommend<00:01:41.319> not<00:01:41.799> doing<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.250> and

but we recommend not doing that and
instead<00:01:43.060> taking<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.630> hacksaw<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.080> cutting<00:01:44.619> the
