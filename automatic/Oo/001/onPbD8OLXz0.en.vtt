really have a we have a high regard for

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.830 
really have a we have a high regard for
the<00:00:48.059> main<00:00:48.270> benefit<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> these<00:00:49.770> are

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
the main benefit here is that these are

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.420 
the main benefit here is that these are
good<00:00:51.840> enough<00:00:52.079> pretty<00:00:52.469> much<00:00:52.770> until<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.160> day

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
good enough pretty much until the day

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.670 
good enough pretty much until the day
you<00:00:53.460> die<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:54.180> children<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:54.960> fight<00:00:55.289> over

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you die your children will fight over

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040 
you die your children will fight over
them<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.640> good<00:00:56.879> they<00:00:57.059> are<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
them that's how good they are and so

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.750 
them that's how good they are and so
that<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> benefit<00:00:58.859> against<00:00:59.190> products<00:00:59.640> like

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
that has a benefit against products like

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
that has a benefit against products like
this<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.770> nonstick<00:01:01.770> coating

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250

coming off I mean this puppy is on its

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.380 
coming off I mean this puppy is on its
way<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:32.549> probably<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
way out that's probably not good that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.980 
way out that's probably not good that
you're<00:01:33.509> ingesting<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> stuff<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.990> we

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
you're ingesting all that stuff so we

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.390 
you're ingesting all that stuff so we
really<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> high<00:01:37.560> regard<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.950> cast-iron

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
really have a high regard for cast-iron

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.850 
really have a high regard for cast-iron
cookware<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.390> high<00:01:39.540> quality

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
cookware we think it's of high quality

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.020 
cookware we think it's of high quality
we<00:01:40.860> obviously<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.670> has<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> green

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
we obviously think it has a green

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.420 
we obviously think it has a green
benefit<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:43.200> last<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:44.220> ever

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
benefit because it will last for ever

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.120 
benefit because it will last for ever
that's<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> joke<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.040> my

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that's not a joke I have one of my

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
that's not a joke I have one of my
family<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.270> great-grandmother's<00:01:48.899> and

cornbread<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.920> sugar<00:01:53.280> corners<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.470> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
cornbread not sugar corners so the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
cornbread not sugar corners so the
prices<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.040> pretty<00:01:56.130> reasonable<00:01:56.759> they're

about<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.329> line<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.840> you'd<00:01:57.960> expect<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
so they aren't shipped overseas so

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.289
