00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.300 

a<00:01:19.149> lot<00:01:19.719> of<00:01:19.750> people<00:01:20.049> trim<00:01:20.289> that<00:01:20.469> fat<00:01:20.710> off<00:01:20.740> we

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
a lot of people trim that fat off we

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.859 
a lot of people trim that fat off we
decide<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.789> leave<00:01:21.909> it<00:01:22.060> on<00:01:22.210> because<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.539> pork

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
decide to leave it on because the pork

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.709 
decide to leave it on because the pork
tenderloin<00:01:23.079> or<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.799> pork<00:01:24.009> loin<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:25.450> such<00:01:25.689> a

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
tenderloin or the pork loin is such a

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.630 
tenderloin or the pork loin is such a
lean<00:01:26.109> cut<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.799> we're<00:01:26.920> going<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.100> smoke<00:01:27.369> this

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
lean cut and we're going to smoke this

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.090 
lean cut and we're going to smoke this
so<00:01:28.539> a<00:01:28.569> lot<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:28.990> fat<00:01:29.289> will<00:01:29.469> render<00:01:29.500> away

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
so a lot of that fat will render away

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.550 
so a lot of that fat will render away
but<00:01:30.399> what<00:01:30.549> doesn't<00:01:30.789> render<00:01:31.179> will<00:01:32.140> actually

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
but what doesn't render will actually

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:41.990 
but what doesn't render will actually
help<00:01:33.280> keep<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.729> loin<00:01:34.659> moist

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
