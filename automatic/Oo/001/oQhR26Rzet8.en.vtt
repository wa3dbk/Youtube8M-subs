00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.710
 hello how about very well written how about 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.870
 well here we are once again true 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.030
 here we are once again in digital are 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.810
 Welcome to the new season that 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.700
 we have today 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.230
 Well look today we have a serious problem 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.970
 because my cell phone has been broken and good 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.849
 that's not the biggest problem now it's 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.759
 know what mobile I take and others but I've 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.170
 got me to sell myself a pretty 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.689
 well of price the problem is that I 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.980
 they say it has no proximity sensor 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.600
 that I said I do not know if this is 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.910
 important in him because I did not use either 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:43.300
 the mobile to do great things 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.590
 well you've thought like any 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.180
 site 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.140
 has been asking the question in the forum 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.560
 suitable 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.930
 because the proximity sensor is 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.720
 basically what regulates what the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.850
 phone when you bring your ear to the 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.650
 screen because it's ever happened to you 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.260
 sure you call to call 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.460
 phone and suddenly it turns off the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.790
 person who is on the other side suddenly 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.470
 you do not hear it for many times 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.880
 it happens then that it does not have a sensor 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.410
 proximity passed formerly with 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.240
 old devices and clear the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.860
 touch screen did not turn off 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.049
 is the screen that occurs the keys 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.579
 all if it does not work then see what 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.590
 I'll give you an example, let's do 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.060
 here a call from this mobile and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.399
 because the proximity sensor what 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.350
 does is calculate the distance and when 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.600
 we are calling we are contributing here 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.890
 a call to this phone and see what 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 what happens when we are calling if 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.729
 we passed the hand in front 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.390
 I mean that's what nullifies the touch 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.970
 yes 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.759
 worth it, so it is important 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.960
 yes yes it is important curiously not 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.939
 it only has utility in 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.799
 mobile devices but also in 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.569
 devices like photo cameras 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.420
 We have here this camera that 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.220
 he has his little screen has his 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.750
 pantallita and its electronic viewfinder and 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.940
 look what happens when I grab and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.799
 I bring the hand here so it is by vision 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.170
 clear and so know that the average basis for 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.610
 here not so clear here it serves to 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.470
 save energy and at the same time 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.330
 sibilia and if you want to put the camera 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.890
 around here but you want to see it now and not 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.110
 you see it good you can make some adjustments 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.420
 you can change it, of course, you can 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.460
 change 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.610
 and not because the functionality that has 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.020
 obviously be here is very useful because 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.910
 that of turning off the phone with 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.400
 the keys or give it the volume of the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.020
 violence to sail you remember 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.220
 the proximity is what makes 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.780
 when you approach the phone to the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.640
 ear when you are without blocking you 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.070
 hold the phone close to your ear and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.130
 keys with which it is important to follow 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.810
 looking so thank you for your 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.400
 questions good thanks to you for your 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.250
 answers I hope you liked it 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.050
 this new digital advice show 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.310
 We hope you subscribe to our 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.010
 channel yes because that is very short a 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.520
 Tiny and I will come back with many more doubts 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.520
 very well
