00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.849
 Good evening, good evening to all of you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.610
 from the cost from your enrico papa there is one 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.560
 very beautiful and very important sentence 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.810
 I would dare to say fundamental must 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.900
 learn to be alone this way 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.390
 learn to be with others 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 otherwise you are there because you need it 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.620
 you have to do an hour of school 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:42.149
 teaching solitude learn a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.850
 from starz and learn to bastard if this 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.829
 the key point of reasoning 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:53.129
 learn to be enough to learn to stay 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.890
 alone in this way you learn to stay also 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.539
 with others because if you're okay with 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.410
 yourself if you also accept being 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.309
 in solitude 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.830
 then live healthy relationships in 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.400
 balanced manner of true relationships 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.740
 aware and balanced immature 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.210
 because if you can't make it alone 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.119
 never if you can't get enough for you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.670
 same if you suffer if you are alone 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.159
 then you make everyone feel good because 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.750
 just to not stand alone accept 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.560
 any compromised relationship 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.840
 downward 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.909
 therefore it is not a true choice therefore 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.110
 it is not a true relationship, it is an attachment 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.759
 desperately to those who are needed 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.119
 do an hour of teaching at school 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.899
 to loneliness but if you do an hour of 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.210
 physical education and or many bullshit 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:52.189
 an hour of teaching in solitude 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.810
 I can't tell you how to do it though 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.060
 realize something if you don't 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.649
 you never make it alone and more than one 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.409
 poorly recite any relationship e 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.630
 is true both if we talk about the months stacy val 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.460
 d love if you can't do this 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.170
 mistake I remind you that if something that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.009
 don't go maybe you can't do 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.379
 otherwise 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.819
 however, awareness is important 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.650
 something absolutely wrong 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.420
 then there are so many shades of levels 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.510
 very serious levels of minds more 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.400
 small and does not mean we avoid the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.709
 relationships we are alone no could not there 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.569
 it would be the sentence to learn to stay at 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.969
 sun so you learn I am the others 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.099
 it means that it is essential to find a 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.599
 balance with themselves and fundamental 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.579
 also accept solitude numbers 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.549
 be able to star groping well as 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.040
 alone if you are well alone then 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.659
 you will live a relationship that you don't need 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.180
 fill that emptiness in solitude 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.489
 but you will live a relationship because you choose 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.980
 that person as your mind takes you 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.790
 kidnaps because his mind is 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.549
 compatible with your a non report 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.859
 it must never be born for a need if not 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.889
 learn to feel good loneliness you know with 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.569
 the others because you need to learn 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.969
 to stay with others otherwise if you are 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.310
 because you need it is a relationship not 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:09.819
 it must be there because you need it 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.519
 friendship but even more so 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.639
 love must have because you love 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.470
 his mind because you fall in love with his 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.689
 brain of all his people 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.489
 general because you are for ends because 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.489
 you are complicit because they feel good together 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.840
 then clearly it was already there together 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.919
 become attached a native bond is born 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.939
 affection year attachment and born on 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:39.310
 need to dialogue with him on 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.590
 need to feel it close but yes it is born 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.349
 later because of a mental harmony 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.049
 there is no morbid search before the bike 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.680
 of someone because they don't let you stay 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.340
 only the same thing is in a different degree 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.340
 regarding friendships 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.290
 if you live in human relationships 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.969
 simply to escape to 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.729
 loneliness are not friendships are 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:06.129
 comrades if you are looking for a boyfriend 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:07.479
 just to go alone and make yourself 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.719
 enough what is not really a 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:13.509
 ends in you is not love is a boyfriend 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:16.690
 dear boyfriends but love is something else 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:21.599
 friendship is another thing maturity 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:25.990
 balance are other things to learn to 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:26.360
 be enough and only then let yourself go to 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.520
 herat 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.479
 strong if we want to call them Moors 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.580
 we want to call them friendships and it is a lot 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.979
 important otherwise you dive into 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.259
 reports especially pseudo ones 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.659
 amorous because they are not such then 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.849
 they will only cause frustration because 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.310
 maybe you are for one person you have me 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.139
 You need because if you put yourself sweating 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.300
 for a need and not for a real one 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.120
 affinity discover that area is the wound 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.400
 there is no feeling that lack of 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.139
 affinity, you are frustrated by this 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.689
 bad you're not really good with him and 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:03.500
 with her but do not report detached or 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.860
 because you don't know how to make yourself alone a lot 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.270
 It is important to learn how to learn 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.629
 to set the solitude of parare a 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.039
 manage it and only after experiencing relationships 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:17.169
 then why those relationships will be more 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.169
 beautiful, more satisfying and more real
