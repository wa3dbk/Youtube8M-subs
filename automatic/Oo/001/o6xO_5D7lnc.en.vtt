00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.949
 welcome to all to this new episode of yesterday very boring film that concerns 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.229
 the electric bicycle fraia which was born in Switzerland beppe imported in Italy 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:33.010
 lady guido stonemason with whom we spoke we see services 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.540
 guido stone cutter responsible alina and mobility okay importer in italy 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.729
 decide flayers that are one 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.390
 one of the absolute best places on the market are products that they use 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.390
 of lithium ion batteries 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.550
 and in arenzano 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.590
 to have a car very weight and very small dimensions the bicycle is born with 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.610
 to the idea of ​​remaining a bicycle therefore the help that must keep the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.130
 naturalness is an innovative system that uses stress sensors that are 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.940
 in the bottom cage of the treads able to help situations 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.260
 criticism therefore I leave it uphill use 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.720
 and are designed to have high cruising speeds become 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.630
 interesting month also for moving work or maybe even 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.650
 require not to get to work on data and not take much time to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.110
 to travel the necessary distances allow you to make an effort of type 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.259
 aerobic 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.209
 mq are very appreciated also given the heart patients who have to do activities 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.540
 physical but should not overdo it 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.960
 the plot is expanding the bike mounts in tandem 28-inch wheels for the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.720
 TV series 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.320
 with the 26-inch wheels which is the c series which we will then see and then 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.060
 there is a folding model the most functional because it can be 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.609
 easily transported by car 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.729
 and there is a very important detail is that the construction in potrusione fairy in 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.270
 switzerland switzerland technology is a mixed technology because some parts 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.500
 they are of Japanese origin, as I said before, the fear gathered or true 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.210
 battery motor tripod luggage rack are Swiss there is a little bit all one 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.960
 selection of the best materials available on the market to give 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.079
 re firm to this product that 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.609
 the curious thing is taken care of in detail, for example, to see this 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.310
 side bill that is placed outside the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.969
 the movement of the pedals clearly 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.649
 there are small tricks to use the accessories here we have system of 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:45.799
 quick release which is characteristic of the pletscher system where there are three points 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.920
 Attack is a lever below which allows you to 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.920
 think without registration for this accessory 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.019
 a nice thing 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.019
 and the equipment for example of the pump placed in this rack 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.399
 with this cover 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.429
 very simple drilling event makes use of all quick releases 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:10.989
 for disassembly of the wheels that do not give brake problems in years 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.939
 structured precisely for mountain use and therefore to tackle downhill runs 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.729
 are bikes designed for business use in the c series is adopted 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.189
 for example by the police of Saint Moritz 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.179
 they have a little amoruccio change 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:28.569
 h8 reports so you can change from a standstill is a comfortable thing because a lot 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.499
 often people forget to climb the gears then they struggle 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.749
 restart when they stop in this way instead you can select the 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:36.969
 gear you want 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.759
 at any time 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:44.319
 prices are prices ranging from 2000 to 3000 euros depending on the ele 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.890
 batteries are the part that constitutes 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.249
 and the good part of the price 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:52.919
 before we saw the one for the series 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.489
 of what we said that weighs two kilos and 100 grams this one of the series c 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.969
 which weighs a kilo 900 grams in less than two kilos 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:03.969
 they are lithium ion battery so besides having features of 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.989
 compactness and lightness 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.709
 give the possibility to have high autonomy 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.029
 and have no known memory problems needing to be downloaded are guaranteed 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.169
 entirely for two years 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.029
 and normally their life is 3 years is a curious thing to consider is in 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.449
 this sector is that when you make references you should not think 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.050
 much to the purchase price which is certainly an important factor but i 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.279
 operating costs actually if you go hahaha consider 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:40.309
 exercise of the bicycle and philosophy. is that of stylized for 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.319
 home-work travel basically not so much for a 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.380
 playful aspect becomes an extremely efficient and economical means 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.720
 and extremely simple bike maintenance
