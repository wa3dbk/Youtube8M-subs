with<00:04:56.200> bands<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:56.590> played<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:56.920> bands<00:04:57.100> but<00:04:57.340> I

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
with bands I played in bands but I

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.090 
with bands I played in bands but I
wasn't<00:04:57.670> good<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.060> just<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:59.380> was<00:04:59.500> acceptable<00:04:59.980> to
