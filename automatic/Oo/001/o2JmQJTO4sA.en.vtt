00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.040
 and tv hello friends how are the day of 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.439
 today I would be explaining something that is 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.869
 very common that it happens many times to rain 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.189
 and we go through where there is a lot 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.429
 water and then tends to it sometimes in 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.380
 our board lights our lights 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.770
 car was fine and then activated 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.440
 some lights on the board then to 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.710
 this is because they are going water and creates 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.460
 a false contact in the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.059
 on the connectors that carry the signals 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.760
 to the computer then what 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.180
 let's basically do to be able 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.600
 remove those lights is to buy us a 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.780
 scanner like this mind this scanner is 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.130
 a scanner that you can buy it 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.869
 online or at your auto parts store 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.450
 this scanner is very cheap and it's going to 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.380
 serve for many things to erase 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.719
 codes and to see 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.850
 some other problem that may be 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.070
 presenting to your car 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.380
 so I'm going to show you for example 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.189
 here right now there is a light on that 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.829
 indicates that the doors are open 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.460
 but there are other lights on this car not 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:36.810
 I had nothing and what happened 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.810
 they went through water 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.399
 and so 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.399
 and we will feel it 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.900
 there is the door to the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.210
 belt belt is removed when 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.780
 when I put on the obvious belt the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.540
 safety belt but there is light and 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.410
 that of the airbag and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.210
 the check engine that is the engine 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.910
 then these two lights do not go off and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.340
 this started because the car passed by 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.210
 for water it was raining and they had it 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.830
 by water then the best way 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.180
 to remove those lights is using your 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.670
 scanner as I tell you this scanner 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.120
 I'm going to teach you right now 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.700
 and also this is used for when in the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.260
 board indicates for example a 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.209
 maintenance is the car needs 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.790
 maintenance and you have already done the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.460
 work and follow the lights there then 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.060
 they must erase those 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.800
 those codes with this scanner and these 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.510
 ID cards it is a scanner of the most 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.750
 cheap but that serves us and we 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.900
 it works now if you think 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.750
 dedicate to the mechanics as obvious buy 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.850
 a more expensive scanner that is going to 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.610
 serve but if you only want it for your 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.069
 car do not need to spend big money 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.499
 for 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.790
 to use a scanner if they can not be bought 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:06.219
 a cheap one 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.730
 that's my good advice right now 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:12.189
 I teach we are going to connect the scanner here 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.920
 they have the entrance in all the cars the 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.040
 they have two here on one side but you 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.450
 they only look where you have the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.450
 input we connect here 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.010
 and here goes the legend 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.980
 we throw in there is communicating with 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.980
 the car reading 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.020
 and they tell us to wait 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.190
 believing 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.310
 We can keep the car on 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.380
 we give again we give it again here 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.850
 it tells us that it has four codes 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.010
 pending 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.790
 as I tell them the car had nothing or 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.830
 be the computer is being up 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.120
 certain point deceived by the drops of 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.490
 water or what you have then you are 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.950
 saying this then he tells us that there 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.680
 four codes 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:29.310
 And here we can see here that tells us p 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:32.580
 04 2004 44 41 yp 4 04 46 now what 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.160
 only thing that we are going to do here is erase 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.160
 these codes we are going to erase 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.370
 and then here where raise bore says 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.370
 we erase 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.020
 and we erase everything here at once for 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.070
 that there are fewer questions and if we put 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.960
 again that if we erase everything that 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.120
 friends we already deleted the codes and how 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.389
 can realize and only the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.670
 of the door and the belt were left 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.490
 deleted 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.409
 they should not learn again if this 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.559
 he went through some mistake 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:15.200
 since I pass the car by water then 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:18.020
 it should not happen 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.060
 I hope it helps 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.009
