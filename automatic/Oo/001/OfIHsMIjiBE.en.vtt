00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
lot of deaths so to not have to worry

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.899

it's called feathering so once you hit
like<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:57.390> main<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.899> middle<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.860> mean

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
like your main in the middle you mean

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.620 
like your main in the middle you mean
swipe<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.729> you've<00:01:59.850> gotten<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> nice<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
swipe and you've gotten it nice and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.240 
swipe and you've gotten it nice and
smooth<00:02:00.930> you'll<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.649> extra<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
smooth you'll have a little extra on the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
smooth you'll have a little extra on the
edges<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.149> push<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.579> side<00:02:06.240> farthest

away<00:02:07.170> from<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.619> mud<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.450> kind

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
away from the mud and so you have kind

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.839 
away from the mud and so you have kind
of<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.899> little<00:02:10.140> tweak<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.770> way<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.640> is

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
of a little tweak the way the this is

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.750 
of a little tweak the way the this is
hitting<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.720> drywall<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.500> poor

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
hitting the drywall and this poor

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.630 
hitting the drywall and this poor
does<00:02:13.909> not<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.299> kind<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.569> feathers<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.640> then

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
does not it kind of feathers it and then

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.030 
does not it kind of feathers it and then
you<00:02:16.760> rub<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.269> over<00:02:17.629> your<00:02:17.780> edge<00:02:18.019> like<00:02:19.010> that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
you rub that over your edge like that

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.869 
you rub that over your edge like that
and<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:21.230> will<00:02:21.560> smooth<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.189> smooth<00:02:22.640> out<00:02:22.849> all

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
and that will smooth out smooth out all

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.600 
and that will smooth out smooth out all
this<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:23.870> bring<00:02:24.379> it<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.560> nothing<00:02:25.099> so<00:02:25.370> when<00:02:25.519> you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
this and bring it to nothing so when you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.420 
this and bring it to nothing so when you
go<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.790> sand<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.239> makes
