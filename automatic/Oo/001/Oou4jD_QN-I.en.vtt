00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.030 
last game we only allowed 22 rushing
yards<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.359> is<00:03:34.629> ranked<00:03:35.079> number<00:03:35.409> one<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:35.739> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
yards that is ranked number one in the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.159 
yards that is ranked number one in the
nation<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:36.879> the<00:03:37.000> rust<00:03:37.209> defense<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:37.930> there

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
nation so the rust defense is there

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.800

again<00:03:38.560> it<00:03:39.370> was<00:03:39.519> pretty<00:03:39.729> good<00:03:39.909> last<00:03:39.970> year<00:03:40.329> again

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
again it was pretty good last year again

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.080 
again it was pretty good last year again
I<00:03:40.840> think<00:03:41.169> it's<00:03:41.319> because<00:03:41.790> everything<00:03:42.790> else<00:03:42.879> is

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
I think it's because everything else is

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.119 
I think it's because everything else is
simulated<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:43.989> play<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.590> games<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.069> my

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
simulated and I do play the games and my

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.920 
simulated and I do play the games and my
opponents<00:03:45.609> don't<00:03:45.849> well<00:03:46.209> not<00:03:46.359> my<00:03:46.509> opponents

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930
