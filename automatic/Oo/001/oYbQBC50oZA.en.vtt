00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
this time so as the interim oh nice drop

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.700 
this time so as the interim oh nice drop
off<00:01:00.540> might<00:01:00.690> tell<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> failed<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.409> mission

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
off might tell you I failed this mission

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.649 
off might tell you I failed this mission
but<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> know<00:01:02.610> a<00:01:02.790> few<00:01:03.059> tricks<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.390> how<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> do

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
but now I know a few tricks on how to do

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.509 
but now I know a few tricks on how to do
it<00:01:03.720> much<00:01:03.930> faster<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> first<00:01:05.309> thing<00:01:05.399> you<00:01:05.460> need

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it much faster so first thing you need

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.249 
it much faster so first thing you need
to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.700> redundant<00:01:06.390> Lee<00:01:06.450> carried<00:01:06.869> shallow

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
to do is redundant Lee carried shallow

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.550 
to do is redundant Lee carried shallow
out<00:01:07.440> of<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.649> chest<00:01:08.009> and<00:01:08.190> then<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:10.110> do

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
out of this chest and then and now do

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.249 
out of this chest and then and now do
that<00:01:10.590> are<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.800> guess<00:01:11.899> so<00:01:14.960> then<00:01:15.960> won't<00:01:16.140> play

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that are I guess so then won't play

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.460 
that are I guess so then won't play
chase<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:19.580> we<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.670> no<00:01:20.850> choice<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
chase and we have no choice but to

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.620 
chase and we have no choice but to
comply<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.399> your<00:01:23.759> pointer<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
comply the your pointer can make the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.990 
comply the your pointer can make the
snow<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.800> away<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.310> reveal<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> path<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:29.000> also

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
snow go away and reveal a path so also

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.279 
snow go away and reveal a path so also
reveals<00:01:30.300> where<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.570> flip<00:01:30.810> switches<00:01:31.050> are

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
reveals where these flip switches are

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.090 
reveals where these flip switches are
you<00:01:31.800> need<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> flip<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.940> five<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> them<00:01:34.100> in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you need to flip all five of them in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.320 
you need to flip all five of them in
order<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.399> 0

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.000 

get<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.450> get<00:01:43.540> out<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:44.770> up<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:47.590> makes<00:01:47.770> that
