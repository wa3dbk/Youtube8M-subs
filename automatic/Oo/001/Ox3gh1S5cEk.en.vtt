so I will not be covering things like

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.200 
so I will not be covering things like
checking<00:00:16.410> your<00:00:16.590> mirrors<00:00:17.010> looking<00:00:17.730> around

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210

are ready to reverse you are going to
press<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.560> gas<00:01:13.950> very<00:01:14.670> very<00:01:14.939> slightly<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
bring the tachometer up to about 1,500

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.660 
bring the tachometer up to about 1,500
to<00:01:21.150> 2,000<00:01:21.869> rpms<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> press<00:01:23.520> the

to 2,000 rpms so I'm going to press the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
to 2,000 rpms so I'm going to press the
gas<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> bring<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> tachometer<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.170> about

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
gas and bring the tachometer to about

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.760 
gas and bring the tachometer to about
1,500<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> 2,000<00:01:26.820> rpms<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
1,500 to 2,000 rpms just like this and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.490 
1,500 to 2,000 rpms just like this and
then<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.820> are<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.299> release<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> clutch

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
then you are going to release the clutch

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.160 
then you are going to release the clutch
ever<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.610> slightly<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> would<00:01:33.750> say<00:01:33.869> release

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
ever so slightly so I would say release

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.469 
ever so slightly so I would say release
the<00:01:34.350> clutch<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:35.009> until<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.729> reaches<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the clutch up until it reaches the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.380 
the clutch up until it reaches the
biting<00:01:36.780> point<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.549> when<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
biting point now you will know when the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.260 
biting point now you will know when the
clutch<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:39.869> reached<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.560> biting<00:01:40.920> point<00:01:41.270> um

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
clutch has reached the biting point um

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
clutch has reached the biting point um
because<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.619> car<00:01:44.009> will<00:01:44.189> start<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.640> move<00:01:44.759> back

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
because the car will start to move back

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.719 
because the car will start to move back
so<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.680> car<00:01:46.950> revving<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.520> about

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
so now I have the car revving at about

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.270 
so now I have the car revving at about
1500<00:01:48.509> rpms<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.140> I'm<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> release<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
1500 rpms and I'm going to release the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.060 
1500 rpms and I'm going to release the
clutch<00:01:50.520> until<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.210> car<00:01:51.450> moves<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.829> now

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
clutch until the car moves back so now

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.280 
clutch until the car moves back so now
I'm<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> hold<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.360> clutch<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.869> that

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
I'm going to hold the clutch at that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.490 
I'm going to hold the clutch at that
biting<00:01:55.710> point<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.670> car<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.210> moving<00:01:58.020> back

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
biting point and the car is moving back

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.889 
biting point and the car is moving back
just<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.280> hold<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> gas<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.360> that

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
just like that and hold the gas at that

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.550 
just like that and hold the gas at that
1500<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.189> 2,000<00:02:02.820> rpm<00:02:03.329> point<00:02:03.689> when<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> am<00:02:04.350> ready

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
1500 to 2,000 rpm point when I am ready

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
1500 to 2,000 rpm point when I am ready
to<00:02:04.770> stop<00:02:05.040> reversing<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.790> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> push<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
to stop reversing I'm going to push the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.660 
to stop reversing I'm going to push the
clutch<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.689> put<00:02:07.619> my<00:02:07.649> right<00:02:07.979> foot<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.369> brake

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
clutch in put my right foot on the brake

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.390 
clutch in put my right foot on the brake
and<00:02:08.849> that's<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:10.050> stopped<00:02:10.410> reversing

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and that's it I have stopped reversing

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.590 
and that's it I have stopped reversing
I'm<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> move<00:02:12.360> forward<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:12.989> so

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
I'm going to move forward now so

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.160 
I'm going to move forward now so
can<00:02:13.810> just<00:02:14.290> demonstrate<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.890> one<00:02:15.070> more<00:02:15.280> time<00:02:16.170> so

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
can just demonstrate it one more time so

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.290 
can just demonstrate it one more time so
I'm<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.100> do<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.340> again<00:02:18.430> but<00:02:18.970> instead<00:02:19.240> of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
I'm going to do it again but instead of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.570 
I'm going to do it again but instead of
showing<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.960> petals<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:21.070> secondary

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
showing the petals with this secondary

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.060 
showing the petals with this secondary
camera<00:02:21.850> I'm<00:02:22.180> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.810> show<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.530> tachometer

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
camera I'm going to show the tachometer

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.710 
camera I'm going to show the tachometer
so<00:02:24.730> I'm<00:02:24.820> going<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.000> hold<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.210> secondary

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
so I'm going to hold the secondary

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.840 
so I'm going to hold the secondary
camera<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.530> show<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.400> tachometer

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
camera up here and show the tachometer

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.350 
camera up here and show the tachometer
so<00:02:28.690> once<00:02:28.870> again<00:02:29.100> clutch<00:02:30.100> has<00:02:30.520> been<00:02:30.760> depressed

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
so once again clutch has been depressed

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.930 
so once again clutch has been depressed
foot<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.350> on<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.530> brake<00:02:32.710> right<00:02:33.520> foot<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.820> on

now<00:02:37.120> I'm<00:02:37.360> pushing<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.900> gas<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.500> bring<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.800> car

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
now I'm pushing the gas to bring the car

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.850 
now I'm pushing the gas to bring the car
to<00:02:39.040> about<00:02:39.400> 1,500<00:02:40.090> rpms<00:02:40.540> I'm<00:02:40.810> releasing<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
to about 1,500 rpms I'm releasing the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.970 
to about 1,500 rpms I'm releasing the
clutch<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.490> bite<00:02:42.700> point<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.530> now<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.560> feel

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
clutch to the bite point and now I feel

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.130 
clutch to the bite point and now I feel
that<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.670> car<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:46.030> moving<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.020> I'm

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
that the car is moving back so I'm

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.050 
that the car is moving back so I'm
holding<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.770> clutch<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.460> position<00:02:48.640> and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
holding the clutch in that position and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.090 
holding the clutch in that position and
the<00:02:49.480> gas<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.990> that<00:02:50.200> position<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.830> like<00:02:50.890> this

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
the gas in that position just like this

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.970 
the gas in that position just like this
and<00:02:51.310> I'm<00:02:51.760> moving<00:02:52.030> back<00:02:52.300> slowly<00:02:52.990> now<00:02:53.770> I'm<00:02:53.860> going

controlled manner I'm just going to move
back<00:03:03.820> forward<00:03:04.390> here<00:03:04.660> once<00:03:05.170> again<00:03:05.820> you're

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
back forward here once again you're

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.030 
back forward here once again you're
trying<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.270> move<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.810> car<00:03:08.080> backwards<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.890> a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
thing that you want to do is put the car

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.440 
thing that you want to do is put the car
in<00:03:14.440> reverse<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.980> do<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.760> same<00:03:16.030> thing<00:03:16.300> that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
in reverse and do the same thing that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.630 
in reverse and do the same thing that
you<00:03:16.570> would<00:03:16.690> do<00:03:16.870> if<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.200> are<00:03:17.230> driving<00:03:17.640> forward

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
you would do if you are driving forward

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.880 
you would do if you are driving forward
which<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.270> push<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.690> gas<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.170> fully<00:03:20.500> release

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
which is push the gas and fully release

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.680 
which is push the gas and fully release
the<00:03:21.040> clutch<00:03:21.280> because<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:22.060> will<00:03:22.240> cause<00:03:22.480> you

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
the clutch because that will cause you

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.440 
the clutch because that will cause you
to<00:03:22.930> move<00:03:23.080> back<00:03:23.710> really<00:03:24.430> really<00:03:24.580> quickly<00:03:25.090> and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
to move back really really quickly and

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.810 
to move back really really quickly and
it<00:03:25.990> will<00:03:26.110> be<00:03:26.290> very<00:03:26.740> very<00:03:26.980> hard<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.670> to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
it will be very very hard for you to

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.090 
it will be very very hard for you to
control<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.420> car<00:03:28.720> when<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:29.560> have<00:03:29.740> fully

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
control the car when you have fully

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.640 
control the car when you have fully
released<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.970> clutch<00:03:31.300> so<00:03:32.110> basically<00:03:32.530> just

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
released the clutch so basically just

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.340 
released the clutch so basically just
push<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.700> gate<00:03:33.880> put<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.240> gear<00:03:34.750> selector<00:03:35.170> in

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
push the gate put the gear selector in

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.980 
push the gate put the gear selector in
reverse<00:03:35.710> push<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.760> gas<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.360> bring<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.690> car<00:03:37.960> to

about 1,500 to 2,000 rpms release the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.250 
about 1,500 to 2,000 rpms release the
clutch<00:03:42.340> up<00:03:42.640> until<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.450> reaches<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.900> biting
