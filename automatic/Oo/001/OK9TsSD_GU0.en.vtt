coast which means it still actually has

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.040 
coast which means it still actually has

central United States Coast at least it
it<00:00:12.480> isn't<00:00:12.719> right<00:00:12.960> now<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.259> may<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.590> crossed

it isn't right now it may have crossed
and<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.130> come<00:00:14.340> back<00:00:14.370> what<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.509> means<00:00:15.750> is

and then come back what that means is

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.540 
and then come back what that means is
it's<00:00:16.080> bad<00:00:16.289> news<00:00:16.560> because<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.160> not<00:00:17.310> moving

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550

it's bad news because it's not moving
very<00:00:17.670> fast<00:00:18.090> we're<00:00:18.869> still<00:00:19.109> expected<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.820> right

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
very fast we're still expected to right

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
very fast we're still expected to right
now<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.080> almost<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.890> the

now it's just to the right almost in the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.300 
now it's just to the right almost in the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
in the Bay of Biloxi Bay there and the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.490 
in the Bay of Biloxi Bay there and the
wind<00:00:26.430> right<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.119> easterly<00:00:27.599> indicating

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
wind right here is easterly indicating

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.519 
wind right here is easterly indicating
that<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.769> self<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.090> primary<00:00:30.869> coastline

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that it's self of the primary coastline

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.410 
that it's self of the primary coastline
it's<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.980> expect<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.520> though<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> continue<00:00:33.270> on

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it's we expect it though to continue on

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
it's we expect it though to continue on
a<00:00:33.450> northwest<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.739> eventually<00:00:34.860> in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
a northwest and then eventually in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
a northwest and then eventually in
northeastward<00:00:36.110> direction<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.440> going

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
northeastward direction but it's going

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.080 
northeastward direction but it's going
to<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.739> very<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.070> slow<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to be very very slow and that's going to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.940 
to be very very slow and that's going to
produce<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.420> huge<00:00:39.660> amount<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> rain<00:00:40.200> how<00:00:40.739> much

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
produce a huge amount of rain how much

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.250 
produce a huge amount of rain how much
readin<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.730> expect<00:00:42.000> well<00:00:42.899> we've<00:00:43.079> already

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
readin can we expect well we've already

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.139 
readin can we expect well we've already
had<00:00:43.559> upwards<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> foot<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.579> half<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.940> some

accumulate over two three four six hours
you're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.220> another<00:01:17.430> foot<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> rain

you're going to get another foot of rain
there<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.350> doesn't<00:01:19.680> seem<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> be

George door in the next 48 hours let's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.450 
George door in the next 48 hours let's
say<00:01:41.840> over<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> Pensacola<00:01:44.040> area<00:01:44.220> we

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.340 
say over here in the Pensacola area we
really<00:01:44.729> expect<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> significant

action<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.869> ways<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.259> stay<00:01:49.500> up

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
action there the ways will stay up

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.490 
action there the ways will stay up
another<00:01:49.890> 12<00:01:50.310> or<00:01:50.460> 16<00:01:50.939> hours<00:01:51.509> well<00:01:51.780> about<00:01:52.020> 15

hour outside the vance and as you
mentioned<00:02:58.590> earlier<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.220> more<00:02:59.340> important<00:02:59.670> to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
mentioned earlier it's more important to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.520 
mentioned earlier it's more important to
consider<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.269> rate<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.840> rainfall<00:03:01.260> rather

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
consider the rate of the rainfall rather

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.039 
consider the rate of the rainfall rather
than<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.890> total<00:03:02.069> info<00:03:02.610> that's<00:03:03.030> right<00:03:03.299> for

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
than the total info that's right for

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.319

immediate flash flooding the rain rate

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.759 
immediate flash flooding the rain rate
is<00:03:06.540> extremely<00:03:06.780> important<00:03:07.560> where<00:03:07.680> you

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
is extremely important where you

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.620 
is extremely important where you
accumulate<00:03:08.100> water<00:03:08.579> faster<00:03:09.090> than<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.329> can<00:03:09.450> get

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
accumulate water faster than you can get

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
rid of it of course now that everything

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.160 
rid of it of course now that everything
is<00:03:11.670> flooded<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.239> total<00:03:12.630> rain<00:03:12.750> amount<00:03:13.049> is

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
is flooded the total rain amount is

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.960 
is flooded the total rain amount is
becoming<00:03:13.500> important<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:14.579> for<00:03:14.760> flash

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
becoming important but for flash

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.759 
becoming important but for flash
flooding<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.840> rain<00:03:16.079> rate<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.530> still

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
flooding it's the rain rate is still

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.140 
flooding it's the rain rate is still
going<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.040> be<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.400> most<00:03:17.519> important<00:03:18.030> thing

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
going to be the most important thing

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.000 
going to be the most important thing
especially<00:03:18.389> for<00:03:18.690> overtopping<00:03:19.290> rivers<00:03:19.829> and

very slow motion here you're looking at
a<00:03:30.180> couple<00:03:30.389> feet<00:03:30.780> 23<00:03:31.109> feet<00:03:31.440> potential
