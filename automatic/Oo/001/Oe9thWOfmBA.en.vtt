the rebel tech joints placed in a

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.119 
the rebel tech joints placed in a
certain<00:00:55.449> way<00:00:55.600> that<00:00:55.629> allows<00:00:56.079> for<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.739> lot<00:00:57.070> of

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
certain way that allows for a lot of

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.279 
certain way that allows for a lot of
good<00:00:57.309> swiveling<00:00:57.940> his<00:00:58.420> arms<00:00:58.780> have<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.989> really

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
good swiveling his arms have a really

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.049 
good swiveling his arms have a really
weird<00:00:59.469> cut<00:00:59.829> joint<00:01:00.100> here<00:01:00.280> on<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.460> bicep<00:01:00.879> I

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
weird cut joint here on the bicep I

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.400 
weird cut joint here on the bicep I
think<00:01:01.239> it's<00:01:01.329> because<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.809> size<00:01:02.079> of<00:01:02.289> his

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
think it's because of the size of his

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.290 
think it's because of the size of his
shoulder<00:01:02.739> pads<00:01:02.969> unfortunately<00:01:03.969> this<00:01:04.089> makes

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
posing him in the arms a little bit odd

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.010 
posing him in the arms a little bit odd
once<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:07.060> start<00:01:07.300> trying<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.540> do<00:01:07.690> double

handed sword poses and whatnot it's a
little<00:01:10.510> bit<00:01:10.600> strange<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.990> reminds<00:01:11.200> me<00:01:11.350> of

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
little bit strange it reminds me of

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.840 
little bit strange it reminds me of
earlier<00:01:11.770> rebel<00:01:12.130> Tech's<00:01:12.370> when<00:01:12.520> they<00:01:12.610> used<00:01:12.760> a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
earlier rebel Tech's when they used a

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.670 
earlier rebel Tech's when they used a
lot<00:01:13.000> more<00:01:13.030> mono<00:01:13.420> shaft<00:01:13.720> stuff<00:01:14.110> it's<00:01:14.320> not<00:01:14.410> a<00:01:14.440> bad

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
lot more mono shaft stuff it's not a bad

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.410 
lot more mono shaft stuff it's not a bad
thing<00:01:14.980> but<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.730> something<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:16.000> be<00:01:16.120> aware<00:01:16.210> of

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
thing but it is something to be aware of

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.180 
thing but it is something to be aware of
it's<00:01:16.720> it's<00:01:16.870> outside<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.560> norm<00:01:17.860> of<00:01:18.070> what

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
it's it's outside of the norm of what

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.410 
it's it's outside of the norm of what
you<00:01:18.280> might<00:01:18.400> be<00:01:18.550> expecting<00:01:19.090> just<00:01:19.240> mostly

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
you might be expecting just mostly

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.510 
you might be expecting just mostly
because<00:01:19.660> of<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.840> angle<00:01:20.230> here<00:01:20.500> also<00:01:21.190> this

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
in before you attach the hand because

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.490 
in before you attach the hand because
it's<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.550> bit<00:04:22.700> of<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:22.880> tight<00:04:23.240> connection<00:04:23.600> it's

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
it's a bit of a tight connection it's

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.600 
it's a bit of a tight connection it's
pretty<00:04:24.680> solid<00:04:24.860> though<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.310> doesn't<00:04:25.520> feel

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
pretty solid though and it doesn't feel

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.130 
pretty solid though and it doesn't feel
like<00:04:25.729> it's<00:04:25.850> gonna<00:04:25.940> strip<00:04:26.300> any<00:04:26.510> yellow<00:04:26.780> off<00:04:26.990> of

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
like it's gonna strip any yellow off of

like it's gonna strip any yellow off of
the<00:04:27.229> sword<00:04:27.470> unless<00:04:27.710> that's<00:04:27.979> actually<00:04:28.250> just

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
the sword unless that's actually just
