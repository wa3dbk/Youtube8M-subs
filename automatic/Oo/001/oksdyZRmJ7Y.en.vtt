00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
ocean as shown in other studies but it's

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.030 
ocean as shown in other studies but it's
thought<00:01:06.880> Titan<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:08.080> was<00:01:08.290> too<00:01:08.470> cold<00:01:08.770> for

thought Titan is and was too cold for

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.310 
thought Titan is and was too cold for
life<00:01:09.220> as<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.670> yet<00:01:09.940> perhaps<00:01:10.660> in<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.870> few<00:01:11.050> billion

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
life as of yet perhaps in a few billion

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.990 
life as of yet perhaps in a few billion
years<00:01:11.380> time<00:01:11.860> when<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.220> Sun<00:01:12.460> becomes<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.970> red

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
years time when the Sun becomes a red

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.700 
years time when the Sun becomes a red
giant<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.630> heats<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.140> outer<00:01:14.290> solar<00:01:14.560> system

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
giant and heats the outer solar system

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.650 
giant and heats the outer solar system
so<00:01:15.430> for<00:01:15.610> now<00:01:15.730> what<00:01:15.910> he's<00:01:16.000> saying<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.330> it's<00:01:16.480> too

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
so for now what he's saying is it's too

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.660 
so for now what he's saying is it's too
cold<00:01:16.870> Titan<00:01:17.380> receives<00:01:17.620> one<00:01:17.860> percent<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.580> the

sunlight that we get here on earth so

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.800 
sunlight that we get here on earth so
you<00:01:20.290> can<00:01:20.410> imagine<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.830> gets<00:01:20.950> freezing<00:01:21.220> it's<00:01:21.610> at

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
you can imagine it gets freezing it's at

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.050 
you can imagine it gets freezing it's at

minus one 79.2 Celsius I mean those are

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.060 
minus one 79.2 Celsius I mean those are
a<00:01:25.090> lot<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.300> ifs<00:01:25.630> neck<00:01:25.990> if<00:01:26.200> this<00:01:26.440> happens<00:01:26.890> if

a lot of ifs neck if this happens if

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.250 
a lot of ifs neck if this happens if
this<00:01:27.280> happens<00:01:27.700> then<00:01:28.150> possibly<00:01:28.780> life<00:01:29.080> could

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
this happens then possibly life could

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.140 
this happens then possibly life could
exist<00:01:29.290> it's<00:01:29.890> fascinating<00:01:30.580> though<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.030> these

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
exist it's fascinating though that these

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.880 
exist it's fascinating though that these
astrobiologists<00:01:32.110> they're<00:01:32.380> saying<00:01:32.650> that<00:01:32.680> this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
astrobiologists they're saying that this

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.920 
astrobiologists they're saying that this
is<00:01:33.010> liquid<00:01:33.220> methane<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:34.090> mean<00:01:34.540> that's<00:01:34.660> that's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
is liquid methane I mean that's that's

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.050 
is liquid methane I mean that's that's
cool<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.710> of<00:01:35.800> itself<00:01:35.920> not<00:01:36.550> lakes<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:37.030> the

river exactly um but I don't see why I

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.030 
river exactly um but I don't see why I
mean<00:01:40.000> come<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.240> really<00:01:40.780> that's<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.800> great

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
mean come on really that's a great

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.380 
mean come on really that's a great
thought<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.340> these<00:01:42.730> are<00:01:42.880> brilliant<00:01:43.240> people

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
that organisms could exist in liquid

that organisms could exist in liquid

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
methane they would just inhale h2

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.670 
methane they would just inhale h2
instead<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.670> o2<00:02:09.820> they<00:02:10.690> would<00:02:10.840> exhale<00:02:11.290> methane

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
instead of o2 they would exhale methane

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.870 
instead of o2 they would exhale methane
instead<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.040> carbon<00:02:12.340> or<00:02:12.460> not<00:02:12.580> by

instead of carbon or not by
carbon<00:02:13.540> dioxide<00:02:14.110> sorry<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.640> basically<00:02:15.640> they

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
carbon dioxide sorry so basically they

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.030 
carbon dioxide sorry so basically they

know<00:02:26.680> what's<00:02:26.890> over<00:02:27.160> there<00:02:27.310> but<00:02:27.520> look<00:02:28.030> what's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
know what's over there but look what's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.240 
know what's over there but look what's
important<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.870> me<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.350> fact<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.710> we're

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
important to me is the fact that we're

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.680 
important to me is the fact that we're
constantly<00:02:30.520> finding<00:02:30.850> out<00:02:31.150> things<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.600> we

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
constantly finding out things that we

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.590 
constantly finding out things that we
don't<00:02:31.870> know<00:02:32.200> right<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.890> for<00:02:33.070> now<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:34.000> haven't

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
don't know right so for now we haven't

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.970 
don't know right so for now we haven't
taken<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.930> thermometer<00:02:35.230> over<00:02:35.680> there<00:02:35.800> and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
taken a thermometer over there and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.260 
taken a thermometer over there and
placed<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.490> ground<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.880> said<00:02:37.090> hey

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
placed it in the ground and said hey

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.320 
placed it in the ground and said hey
it's<00:02:37.630> exactly<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.440> know<00:02:38.560> 172<00:02:39.430> whatever<00:02:39.820> but

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
it's exactly you know 172 whatever but

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.900 
it's exactly you know 172 whatever but
you<00:02:41.290> know<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.740> can<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.160> can<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.490> can<00:02:42.700> guess

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
you know you can you can you can guess

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.100 
you know you can you can you can guess
these<00:02:43.120> things<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.540> we're<00:02:43.840> constantly

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
these things and we're constantly

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.660 
these things and we're constantly
finding<00:02:44.440> more<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:44.860> more<00:02:45.070> things<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.580> we

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
finding more and more things that we

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.160 
finding more and more things that we
don't<00:02:45.820> know<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.210> who<00:02:46.330> knows<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.750> more<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.050> we

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
don't know so who knows the more that we

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.530 
don't know so who knows the more that we
learn<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:48.070> could<00:02:48.250> potentially<00:02:48.880> find<00:02:49.120> out<00:02:49.360> that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
learn we could potentially find out that

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.150 
learn we could potentially find out that
there<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.780> more<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.200> possibility<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.890> life

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
there is more of a possibility of life

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.340 
there is more of a possibility of life
existing<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.850> another<00:02:52.120> planet<00:02:52.360> but<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:53.200> now

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
existing on another planet but for now

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.930 
existing on another planet but for now
this<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.830> really<00:02:54.130> cool<00:02:54.280> step<00:02:54.550> forward

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
this is a really cool step forward

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.240 
this is a really cool step forward
because<00:02:55.270> these<00:02:55.750> solar<00:02:56.080> winds<00:02:56.380> polar<00:02:56.950> winds

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
because these solar winds polar winds

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.370 
because these solar winds polar winds
are<00:02:57.400> basically<00:02:57.880> making<00:02:58.150> sure<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:59.020> all<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
are basically making sure that all the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.680 
are basically making sure that all the
gases<00:02:59.590> escape<00:03:00.220> because<00:03:00.430> we<00:03:00.670> have<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.910> planet

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
gases escape because we have a planet

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.630 
gases escape because we have a planet
like<00:03:01.720> Venus<00:03:01.840> for<00:03:02.380> example<00:03:02.740> which<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.010> similar

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
like Venus for example which is similar

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.610 
like Venus for example which is similar
size<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.000> earth<00:03:04.240> similar<00:03:05.020> distance<00:03:05.320> from<00:03:05.530> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
size to earth similar distance from the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.320 
size to earth similar distance from the
Sun<00:03:05.860> it's<00:03:06.280> often<00:03:06.580> called<00:03:06.700> our<00:03:06.880> sister<00:03:07.210> planet

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
Sun it's often called our sister planet

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.510 
Sun it's often called our sister planet
yet<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.440> surface<00:03:08.770> temperature<00:03:09.100> there<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.310> in

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
yet the surface temperature there is in

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.470 
yet the surface temperature there is in
the<00:03:09.610> 800<00:03:10.150> plus<00:03:10.390> it's<00:03:11.170> much<00:03:11.560> hotter<00:03:12.480> why

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
the 800 plus it's much hotter why

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.030 
the 800 plus it's much hotter why
because<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.080> gases<00:03:14.290> they<00:03:14.560> don't<00:03:14.770> escape

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
because of the gases they don't escape

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.740 
because of the gases they don't escape
from<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.340> atmosphere<00:03:15.790> it's<00:03:16.060> extreme<00:03:16.480> green

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
from the atmosphere it's extreme green

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.590 
from the atmosphere it's extreme green
greenhouse<00:03:17.290> gas<00:03:17.530> effect<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.430> vina<00:03:18.940> on<00:03:19.150> Venus

greenhouse gas effect in vina on Venus
so<00:03:19.780> fascinating<00:03:20.470> stuff<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.670> cool<00:03:21.880> that

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
so fascinating stuff this is cool that

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.240 
so fascinating stuff this is cool that
they<00:03:22.120> found<00:03:22.300> these<00:03:23.080> lakes<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.770> mean<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.100> don't

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
they found these lakes I mean I don't
