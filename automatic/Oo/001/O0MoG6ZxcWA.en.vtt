00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
nice now the main feature of the set I

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.330 
nice now the main feature of the set I
wasn't<00:04:02.230> really<00:04:02.410> expecting<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.190> be<00:04:03.220> this

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340

designing suspension for this vehicle

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.180 
designing suspension for this vehicle
actually<00:04:07.630> fighting<00:04:07.810> my<00:04:07.989> iPad<00:04:08.560> Mini<00:04:08.890> right

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
actually fighting my iPad Mini right

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.860 
actually fighting my iPad Mini right
here<00:04:09.610> which<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.269> thought<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.450> was<00:04:10.600> kind<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.780> a

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
here which I thought I was kind of a

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.180 
here which I thought I was kind of a
funny<00:04:11.080> thing<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:11.500> actually<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.800> really<00:04:11.980> useful

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
funny thing is actually a really useful

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.800 
funny thing is actually a really useful
surface<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.970> demonstrate<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.360> suspension

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
surface to demonstrate a suspension

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.900 
surface to demonstrate a suspension
right<00:04:14.050> here<00:04:14.320> so<00:04:14.800> basically<00:04:15.160> just<00:04:15.430> watch<00:04:15.700> as<00:04:15.850> I

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
right here so basically just watch as I

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.289 
right here so basically just watch as I
rolled<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.180> single<00:04:16.359> on<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.600> ground<00:04:17.940> wow<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:18.970> mean

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
rolled a single on the ground wow I mean

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.849 
rolled a single on the ground wow I mean
that's<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.600> really<00:04:20.019> great<00:04:20.140> design<00:04:20.500> for<00:04:20.799> the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
that's a really great design for the

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.380 
that's a really great design for the
suspension<00:04:21.310> it's<00:04:21.520> really<00:04:21.880> simple<00:04:22.150> it's

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
suspension it's really simple it's

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.779 
suspension it's really simple it's
nothing<00:04:22.840> too<00:04:23.020> complicated<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.430> really

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
nothing too complicated but it really

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:25.879 
nothing too complicated but it really
just<00:04:25.030> works<00:04:25.300> perfect

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
just works perfect

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.200 
just works perfect
play<00:04:26.009> in<00:04:26.129> my<00:04:26.249> opinion<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:26.819> really<00:04:27.090> think

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
play in my opinion and I really think

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.119 
play in my opinion and I really think

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
lega did a great job designing the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.649
