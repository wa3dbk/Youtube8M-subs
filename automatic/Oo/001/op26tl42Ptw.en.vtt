zone one in the western garden book and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.290 
zone one in the western garden book and
so<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> landscape<00:00:27.539> plant<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.300> really

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so as a landscape plant this is a really

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.590 
so as a landscape plant this is a really
it's<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.869> yes<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.009> vine<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:33.030> used<00:00:33.360> as

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it's it yes it's a vine but it's used as

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.389 
it's it yes it's a vine but it's used as
a<00:00:33.630> bank<00:00:34.020> cover<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:36.800> see<00:00:37.800> people<00:00:38.190> use

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
a bank cover as well as I see people use

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.459 
a bank cover as well as I see people use
this<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.879> chain-link<00:00:39.390> fences<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.200> fills

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
this in chain-link fences where it fills

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.319 
this in chain-link fences where it fills
in<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> becomes<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> green

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
in and it becomes kind of a green

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.209 
in and it becomes kind of a green
barrier<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.140> don't<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> fences<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
barrier and you don't know the fences in

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.700 
barrier and you don't know the fences in
there<00:00:44.610> you're<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.110> moment<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
there you're going to see in a moment to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
there you're going to see in a moment to
where<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.100> been<00:00:47.309> trained<00:00:47.670> around<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.149> post

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
where it's been trained around a post

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
where it's been trained around a post
and<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.350> elegant<00:00:49.530> way<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> treat

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and that's a really elegant way to treat

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.939 
and that's a really elegant way to treat
it<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.309> it's<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.550> vine<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> also<00:00:54.899> develops<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
it so it's a vine but it also develops a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.209 
it so it's a vine but it also develops a
woody<00:00:56.250> core<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.170> woody<00:00:58.440> core<00:00:58.890> can

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
woody core to it and the woody core can

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
woody core to it and the woody core can
be<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.730> bit<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.420> maintenance<00:01:00.690> thing<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.440> also

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
be a bit of a maintenance thing but also

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.219 
be a bit of a maintenance thing but also
as<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.910> plant<00:01:03.239> well<00:01:03.989> here's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
as you see here this plant well here's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.429 
as you see here this plant well here's
the<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.710> trained<00:01:05.189> around<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.790> post<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the one trained around a post but as you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.080 
the one trained around a post but as you
look<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> others<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.939> you're

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
look back at the others what you're

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.789 
look back at the others what you're
going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> notice<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.680> about

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
going to notice is is that it's about

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.880 
going to notice is is that it's about
two<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.610> three<00:01:11.640> feet<00:01:11.909> tall<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:13.650> will

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
two to three feet tall and these will

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.770 
two to three feet tall and these will
continue<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.610> bunch<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.330> top<00:01:15.570> of

continue to bunch up on top of
themselves<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.650> use<00:01:16.890> them<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> bank

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
themselves if you use them as a bank

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.420 
themselves if you use them as a bank
cover<00:01:18.000> or<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> ground<00:01:18.630> cover<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:20.070> aware<00:01:20.189> of

of the plant becomes can become a haven
for<00:01:28.829> rodents<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.420> favorite<00:01:30.900> way<00:01:31.049> to

for rodents so not my favorite way to

for rodents so not my favorite way to
use<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.040> prefer<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> an

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
saw earlier they like full Sun although

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
saw earlier they like full Sun although
they'll<00:01:41.610> tolerate<00:01:41.880> part<00:01:42.479> shade<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.200> a
