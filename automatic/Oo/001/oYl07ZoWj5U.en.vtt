00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 he is or rather he was troy mcclure 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.810
 maybe you remember it in papers like the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.139
 presenter of the animated series los 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.179
 simpsons this charismatic character and 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.549
 great smile and that for many years 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.890
 He was present in several chapters in 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.990
 your presenter role in a way 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.939
 surprise came out of the roster and the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.539
 new and future seasons of the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.539
 simpsons 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 when inquiring about the subject of his 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.880
 desertion by the cheerleader 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.890
 I came across the event that was the factor 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.970
 determinant for Troy to be between 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.750
 quotes fired a tro and he was murdered 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.750
 here's the story 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.060
 like all documentary series or film 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.520
 done on computer or with other 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.950
 animation techniques the voice that you 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.050
 assigned to each character must comply with 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.270
 certain requirements that conform to the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.570
 physical and psychometric characteristics 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.890
 of the character achieving an excellent 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.870
 characterization and balance is a pillar 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.930
 fundamental for understanding and 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.910
 message of a plot in some cases the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.190
 dubbing or voice of certain characters 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.290
 They come to the point of being irreplaceable 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.570
 since it is recorded in the memory of the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.880
 receiver therefore a change of voice 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.740
 of a character that for a long time 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.990
 had a reference it becomes a 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.680
 dangerous and dangerous action for some 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 producers 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.950
 I have put the lake and the spring under the 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.390
 mountain 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.090
 they will be protected and I will tell you this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.560
 Say it to nothing when you leave this 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 Instead whom must leave your 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.020
 memories of me and everything you saw 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.310
 they believe that everything is their enemies 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.259
 tell me why they have come here here this 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.259
 it was my house home 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.080
 phil edwards hartman 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.170
 maybe they remember us for movies like 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.970
 Little warriors follow east gateway 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.680
 Canadian actor gave him life and voice to 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.690
 troy mcclure from the second season 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.120
 in the year 1991 until 1998 being his 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.590
 last appearance in the episode bar la 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.090
 mom 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.370
 phil gave voice to other characters 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.510
 secondary in the simpsons like the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.370
 fitz lawyer 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.110
 in the episode called the decision of 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.660
 selma film gave life to five 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.959
 different characters including a trojan 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.940
 fitz got married three times the last 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.850
 it was with toasting of which he had two 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.190
 children during their marriage brin and phil 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.200
 they had a lot of problems this because of 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.090
 the successes and achievements that phil got in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.280
 broadway this caused jealousy 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.200
 indifference on the part of bryn she 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.450
 had left aside his career as 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.070
 actress to act as a mother but this 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.070
 decision could have been the worst 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.010
 with the time honda he began to take 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.860
 antidepressants she was addicted to 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.870
 medicines and other drugs her husband 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.980
 phil was very affected and they discussed 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.980
 a lot on the subject 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.380
 on May 28, 1998 brin went out to dinner 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.740
 with a friend she left the restaurant 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.810
 about 9:30 at night he came home 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.000
 shortly before three in the morning 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.970
 phil fell asleep in the bedroom 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.760
 at some point of depression madness 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.710
 alcohol drugs and when the children of the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.170
 couple slept she pulled a gun 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.170
 pointing to phil and shot three times 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.690
 subsequently she drove to the 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.970
 home of his friend ron douglas and after 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.850
 to confess the murder fainted 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.410
 after regaining consciousness the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.140
 two drove back to the house 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.840
 hardman in separate cars where douglas 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.670
 saw the body of harman full of blood 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.710
 Douglas telephoned the services of 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.660
 emergency and the site to the operator that 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.430
 initially did not believe the version of the 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.250
 link until I had already seen the body of 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.230
 chin on arrival the police tried to 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.170
 withdraw the two sons and douglas from 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.670
 the property while this happened brin 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.620
 he entered the room and with 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.460
 remorse that pursued her throughout 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.170
 his life 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.930
 brin shot himself in the temple with the 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.729
 same duty her husband was killed 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.860
 a hardman end indicated in his will 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.020
 that his body was incinerated and his 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.440
 Ashes were scattered over the bay 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.449
 Emerald on the island of Santa Catalina 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.699
 after this event that shook the angels 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.889
 the writers of the simpsons along with 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.389
 Weening decided to withdraw all 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.509
 characters that gave them voice 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.759
 hardman this as an act of respect the 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.009
 episode bar the mother of season 10 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.720
 marked his final participation in the 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.720
 program and it was dedicated to him 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.790
 from that year forward to troy only 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.570
 You can see him in small cameos but 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.570
 never speaks 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.190
 and this is the main reason for the 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.400
 which character no longer appears in the series 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.080
 a sad and this is a fan event 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.960
 clear example that not everything that shines 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.720
 it's gold and well with this we finalize the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.600
