what we've discovered with this study is

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.470 
what we've discovered with this study is
that<00:00:01.920> in<00:00:02.129> seventy-seven<00:00:02.790> percent<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.270> cases

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
that in seventy-seven percent of cases

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.809 
that in seventy-seven percent of cases
people<00:00:04.020> that<00:00:04.529> we<00:00:04.620> interviewed<00:00:04.650> reached<00:00:05.520> for

people today are buying laptops and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180 
people today are buying laptops and
notice<00:02:18.570> mostly<00:02:19.050> because<00:02:19.200> they<00:02:19.560> need<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.950> get

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
notice mostly because they need to get

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.400 
notice mostly because they need to get
things<00:02:20.430> done<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:21.390> they<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.570> not<00:02:21.810> relate<00:02:22.140> to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
things done but they do not relate to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
those devices as something that is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.350 
those devices as something that is
emotional<00:02:25.190> very<00:02:26.190> different<00:02:26.640> from<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.970> wisdom

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
emotional very different from the wisdom

on a vertical screen is very bad idea
actually<00:02:37.230> what<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:37.680> discovered<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.400> users

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
actually what we discovered with users

actually what we discovered with users
in<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.940> study<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.720> user<00:02:40.080> got<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> very

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
in the study is that user got a very

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.710 
in the study is that user got a very
different<00:02:41.250> opinion<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.790> because

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
different opinion on that because

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.840 
different opinion on that because
they're<00:02:42.930> st.<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.950> we<00:02:44.130> know<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.640> them

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.260 
only people of touch they are very
gentle<00:03:19.140> even<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.070> people<00:03:20.310> then<00:03:20.459> do<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:20.970> own

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
gentle even the people then do not own

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.760 
gentle even the people then do not own
any<00:03:21.570> touch<00:03:21.780> device<00:03:22.140> they<00:03:22.350> were<00:03:22.440> really

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
any touch device they were really

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.949 
any touch device they were really
cursing<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> screen<00:03:23.760> nobody<00:03:24.300> was<00:03:24.420> poking<00:03:24.840> out

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
cursing the screen nobody was poking out

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.370 
cursing the screen nobody was poking out
in<00:03:25.440> 81<00:03:26.160> interviews<00:03:26.670> for<00:03:26.970> two<00:03:27.150> hours<00:03:27.270> each<00:03:27.660> none

in 81 interviews for two hours each none

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.360 
in 81 interviews for two hours each none
of<00:03:28.410> them<00:03:28.739> poked<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.550> hard<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.000> things<00:03:30.750> moved

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
of them poked so hard that things moved

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.979 
of them poked so hard that things moved
if<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.550> did<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:32.940> study<00:03:33.180> five<00:03:33.660> or<00:03:33.810> ten<00:03:33.959> years

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
if I did this study five or ten years

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.140 
if I did this study five or ten years
ago<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.709> don't<00:03:35.459> know<00:03:35.519> if<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.670> would<00:03:35.730> have<00:03:35.880> had<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
ago I don't know if I would have had the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.120 
ago I don't know if I would have had the
same<00:03:36.330> results<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> think<00:03:37.950> there<00:03:38.070> are

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
same results so I think there are

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.310 
same results so I think there are
different<00:03:38.550> parts<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.180> story<00:03:39.480> one<00:03:40.080> is

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
different parts to this story one is

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.150 
different parts to this story one is
really<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.650> sophistication<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.640> user

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
really the sophistication the user

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.120 
really the sophistication the user
you<00:03:42.730> know<00:03:42.850> they've<00:03:43.060> been<00:03:43.090> exposed<00:03:43.710> in<00:03:44.710> so<00:03:44.980> many

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
you know they've been exposed in so many

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.770 
you know they've been exposed in so many
different<00:03:45.340> ways<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.670> touch<00:03:46.090> capability

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
different ways to touch capability

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.870 
different ways to touch capability
through<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.590> know<00:03:47.710> touches<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.460> pockets

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
through you know touches in the pockets

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.300 
through you know touches in the pockets
with<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.150> phones<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.840> touches<00:03:50.710> you<00:03:50.860> know<00:03:51.040> and

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
with the phones and touches you know and

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.550 
with the phones and touches you know and
when<00:03:51.490> you<00:03:51.580> go<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.790> buy<00:03:52.300> something<00:03:52.990> or<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.440> all

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
when you go to buy something or in all

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.070 
when you go to buy something or in all
in<00:03:53.710> ATM<00:03:54.130> machines<00:03:54.520> so<00:03:55.030> they<00:03:55.060> are<00:03:55.390> surrounded

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
in ATM machines so they are surrounded

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.260 
in ATM machines so they are surrounded
by<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.350> capability<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:57.520> in<00:03:57.580> a<00:03:57.640> way<00:03:57.850> in

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
by this capability and so in a way in

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.640 
by this capability and so in a way in
the<00:03:58.480> last<00:03:58.510> five<00:03:58.870> years<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.290> has<00:03:59.380> been<00:03:59.560> an

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
the last five years that has been an

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.220 
the last five years that has been an
acceleration<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.760> sophistication<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.480> of

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
acceleration in the sophistication of of

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.230 
acceleration in the sophistication of of
users<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:03.070> other<00:04:03.160> side<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.460> the<00:04:03.670> story<00:04:03.970> is

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
users the other side of the story is

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.700 
users the other side of the story is
also<00:04:04.600> technological<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.470> know<00:04:05.560> the

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
also technological you know the

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.130 
also technological you know the
touchscreen<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.940> know<00:04:07.000> we<00:04:07.510> advance<00:04:07.870> the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
touchscreen and you know we advance the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.540 
touchscreen and you know we advance the
wii<00:04:08.230> technology<00:04:08.740> so<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.040> touchscreen

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
wii technology so the touchscreen

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.220 
wii technology so the touchscreen
capability<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.090> today<00:04:10.390> is<00:04:10.660> different<00:04:10.900> from

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
capability of today is different from

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.110 
capability of today is different from
the<00:04:11.380> 15<00:04:11.800> years<00:04:12.040> ago<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:12.820> from<00:04:13.030> the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
the 15 years ago and so from the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.500 
the 15 years ago and so from the
perspective<00:04:13.300> of<00:04:13.840> responsiveness<00:04:14.560> smoothness

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
perspective of responsiveness smoothness

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.640 
perspective of responsiveness smoothness
there<00:04:16.510> is<00:04:16.690> kind<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.959> substantially<00:04:17.530> different

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
there is kind of substantially different

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.140 
there is kind of substantially different
and<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.190> makes<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.459> difference<00:04:18.640> in<00:04:19.030> the

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
and that makes a difference in the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.300 
and that makes a difference in the
overall<00:04:19.180> experience<00:04:19.780> today<00:04:20.560> now<00:04:20.950> with<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
overall experience today now with the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.950 
overall experience today now with the
windows<00:04:21.670> 8<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.120> your<00:04:22.360> different<00:04:22.750> type<00:04:22.930> of

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
windows 8 and your different type of

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.780 
windows 8 and your different type of
operating<00:04:23.380> system<00:04:23.860> there<00:04:24.040> are<00:04:24.160> optimized<00:04:24.760> for

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
operating system there are optimized for

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.750 
operating system there are optimized for
touch<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:26.050> story<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.650> different<00:04:27.220> because<00:04:27.460> you

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
touch the story is different because you

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.310 
touch the story is different because you
know<00:04:27.850> newtonian<00:04:28.270> got<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.510> great<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.110> very

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
know newtonian got a great and very

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.900 
know newtonian got a great and very
compelling<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:29.950> now<00:04:30.100> technologically

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
compelling and now technologically

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.210 
compelling and now technologically
advanced<00:04:31.240> capability<00:04:32.050> but<00:04:32.560> also<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:32.920> matched

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
advanced capability but also is matched

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.250 
advanced capability but also is matched
with<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.490> user<00:04:33.670> interface<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.600> enables<00:04:34.750> the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
with the user interface that enables the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.230 
with the user interface that enables the
capability<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.800> Boston<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.550> know<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.880> so

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
capability to Boston you know and so

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.000 
capability to Boston you know and so
it's<00:04:37.360> very<00:04:37.510> different<00:04:37.990> today<00:04:38.140> from<00:04:38.500> like<00:04:38.740> five

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
it's very different today from like five

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.700 
it's very different today from like five
or<00:04:39.160> ten<00:04:39.280> years<00:04:39.310> ago
