 that you can enter directly 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.740
 for example if with your crew that would be 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 as your clan 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.030
 enter the clan 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.160
 create a private game with your clan and 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.760
 enter solitaire vale you can enter 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.359
 lonely

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.310
 to be able to create the character worth is a 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.869
 little complicated you can choose your 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.049

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.210

 today is the still not able to play at 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.400
 online, it's worth taking it out and 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.209
 still can not be worth carrying 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.510

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.010
 It can also be randomized to 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.069
 that those who are lazy do not give me 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.780
 laziness to do so the random thing that 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.769
 they put is put on the glasses here we can 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.769

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.939
 we accept by accepting what what 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.859
 happens 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.450
 at the beginning I had two slots for two 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.909
 Slots to create characters 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.700
 the drums can choose between one and another 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:15.819
 in total but they change 56 slots I do not know 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.680

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.210
 m 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.120
 to me the city was born as 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.100
 for this question 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.760

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.489
 Uruguay 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:34.220
 I am not 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.980

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.980
 puts us in a race worth we start 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.700
 with a career with which we can 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:24.930
 start already to earn the money but it comes out 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.960
 this is worth planet in wanting to join the 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:31.200

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.090
 the back gets you into the normal gta this 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.580
 is the error that was attached to all the 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:38.560
 world if it is not this is very similar 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.740
