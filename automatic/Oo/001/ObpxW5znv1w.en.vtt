00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
2013 and try to figure out what hoppa

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.070 
2013 and try to figure out what hoppa
has<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.080> store<00:00:07.319> for<00:00:07.350> us<00:00:11.269> so<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> mac<00:00:12.870> side

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
has in store for us so on the mac side

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.099 
has in store for us so on the mac side
of<00:00:13.259> things<00:00:13.349> 2013<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.849> probably<00:00:15.240> won't<00:00:15.599> get<00:00:15.839> any

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
of things 2013 we probably won't get any

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.650 
of things 2013 we probably won't get any
major<00:00:16.529> changes<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.670> macbook<00:00:18.000> pros<00:00:18.300> or<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
major changes to the macbook pros or the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.810 
major changes to the macbook pros or the
imac<00:00:18.960> since<00:00:19.140> they<00:00:19.260> were<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.619> refreshed<00:00:20.220> but

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
imac since they were just refreshed but

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.160 
imac since they were just refreshed but
hopefully<00:00:21.150> you'll<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.420> retina<00:00:21.750> displays

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
hopefully you'll see retina displays

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.019 
hopefully you'll see retina displays
spread<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.039> other<00:00:23.220> macs<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.730> say<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
spread to other macs like say the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.150 
spread to other macs like say the
macbook<00:00:24.359> air<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.810> hopefully<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> imac<00:00:26.039> as

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
macbook air and hopefully the imac as

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.550 
macbook air and hopefully the imac as
well<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.550> 27-inch<00:00:27.510> imac<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
well a 27-inch imac the right and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
well a 27-inch imac the right and
display<00:00:28.830> would<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.189> amazing<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:29.970> also<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
display would be amazing but also is

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840 
display would be amazing but also is
going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> huge<00:00:31.980> retina<00:00:32.489> display<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
going to be a huge retina display to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.220 
going to be a huge retina display to
produce<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.480> i'll<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.660> interesting<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.050> save

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
produce so i'll be interesting to save

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
produce so i'll be interesting to save
apple<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.739> pull<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:34.980> off<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.820> machine<00:00:36.090> that's

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
apple can pull it off one machine that's

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.340 
apple can pull it off one machine that's
been<00:00:36.360> neglected<00:00:36.840> over<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> last<00:00:37.170> several

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
been neglected over the last several

been neglected over the last several
years<00:00:37.530> has<00:00:37.649> been<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> Mac<00:00:38.129> Pro<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.760> haven't

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
years has been the Mac Pro we haven't

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.900 
years has been the Mac Pro we haven't
seen<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.239> design<00:00:39.420> update<00:00:40.290> since<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.040> g5<00:00:41.520> tower

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
seen a design update since the g5 tower

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.139 
seen a design update since the g5 tower
days<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.829> inside<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.489> really<00:00:44.910> needs

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
days and inside and out it really needs

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.760 
days and inside and out it really needs
some<00:00:45.329> new<00:00:45.450> features<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.809> say<00:00:46.260> Thunderbolt

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
some new features like say Thunderbolt

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.639 
some new features like say Thunderbolt
ports<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> such<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:48.300> Tim<00:00:48.660> Cook<00:00:48.899> promised<00:00:49.500> us

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
ports and such well Tim Cook promised us

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.400 
ports and such well Tim Cook promised us
that<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:50.010> 2013<00:00:50.640> we're<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.629> new

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that in 2013 we're going to get a new

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.189 
that in 2013 we're going to get a new
Mac<00:00:52.920> Pro<00:00:52.949> perhaps<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.730> new<00:00:53.940> design<00:00:54.629> completely

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
Mac Pro perhaps a new design completely

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
Mac Pro perhaps a new design completely
as<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.980> seems<00:00:56.160> with<00:00:56.280> Thunderbolt<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.820> don't

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
as it seems with Thunderbolt you don't

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
as it seems with Thunderbolt you don't
really<00:00:57.180> need<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.750> internal<00:00:57.989> card<00:00:58.230> slots

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
really need all the internal card slots

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.689 
really need all the internal card slots
anymore<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.039> it'll<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.190> interesting<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.609> see

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
anymore so it'll be interesting to see

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
anymore so it'll be interesting to see
what<00:00:59.850> Apple<00:01:00.300> comes<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.379> soon<00:01:01.680> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
what Apple comes up with and how soon in

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
what Apple comes up with and how soon in
the<00:01:02.010> year<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.520> come<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.870> on

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the year they come out with it and on

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.570 
the year they come out with it and on
the<00:01:04.049> mac<00:01:04.229> side<00:01:04.500> we're<00:01:04.769> also<00:01:04.920> used<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> getting

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the mac side we're also used to getting

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.980 
the mac side we're also used to getting
a<00:01:05.640> new<00:01:05.729> operating<00:01:06.119> system<00:01:06.210> every<00:01:06.600> year<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
a new operating system every year so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.390 
a new operating system every year so
it'll<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.140> interesting<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
it'll be interesting to see if there's a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
it'll be interesting to see if there's a
new<00:01:08.580> cat<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.210> our<00:01:09.390> future<00:01:09.689> Mac<00:01:10.409> OS<00:01:10.740> 10.9<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.790> if

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
new cat in our future Mac OS 10.9 and if

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
new cat in our future Mac OS 10.9 and if
there<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.689> what<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.200> called<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:14.490> will

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
there is what it's called and when will

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.510 
there is what it's called and when will
be<00:01:14.790> released<00:01:15.409> also<00:01:16.409> looking<00:01:16.680> at<00:01:16.740> max<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.490> was

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
be released also looking at max it was

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.690 
be released also looking at max it was
promised<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.570> 2013<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.920> Mac<00:01:20.189> line<00:01:20.460> will

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
promised that in 2013 one Mac line will

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.080 
promised that in 2013 one Mac line will
be<00:01:21.020> manufactured<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.259> United<00:01:22.680> States

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
be manufactured in the United States

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.070 
be manufactured in the United States
which<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.270> will<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.570> will<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
which one will it be will it be a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
which one will it be will it be a
certain<00:01:25.439> type<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.590> imac<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.130> perhaps<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.939> be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
certain type of imac or perhaps will be

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.700 
certain type of imac or perhaps will be
the<00:01:27.210> Mac<00:01:27.420> Pro<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.900> makes<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.320> most<00:01:28.530> sense

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the Mac Pro that makes the most sense

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
the Mac Pro that makes the most sense
since<00:01:29.189> most<00:01:29.729> mac<00:01:30.000> pros<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.540> some<00:01:30.840> sort

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
since most mac pros will have some sort

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.840 
since most mac pros will have some sort
of<00:01:31.110> customization<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.549> probably

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
of customization and it's probably

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.539 
of customization and it's probably
easier<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.689> customization<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.189> factory

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
easier to do customization in a factory

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.130 
easier to do customization in a factory
