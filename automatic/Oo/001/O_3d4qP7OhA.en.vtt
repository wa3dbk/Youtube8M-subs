00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
can see there and then this monkey will

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
chance and we're going to upgrade the

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.780 
chance and we're going to upgrade the
banana<00:01:44.680> farm<00:01:44.980> all<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.250> way<00:01:45.430> up<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
banana farm all the way up to the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.780 
banana farm all the way up to the
plantation<00:01:48.090> well<00:01:49.090> there<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.430> as<00:01:51.580> you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
plantation well there it is so as you

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.430 
plantation well there it is so as you
can<00:01:51.880> see<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.150> my<00:01:52.180> opponents<00:01:52.810> side<00:01:52.840> he's<00:01:53.200> kind

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
can see on my opponents side he's kind

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.990 
can see on my opponents side he's kind
of<00:01:53.470> doing<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.800> same<00:01:53.830> thing<00:01:54.250> with<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.520> bananas

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
of doing the same thing with the bananas

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.820 
of doing the same thing with the bananas
and<00:01:55.150> he<00:01:55.270> has<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.810> engineer<00:01:56.290> monkey<00:01:56.620> right

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
and he has the engineer monkey right

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.380 
and he has the engineer monkey right
there<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:57.670> I'm<00:01:57.729> assuming<00:01:57.970> he's<00:01:58.240> probably

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
there so I'm assuming he's probably

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.450 
there so I'm assuming he's probably
going<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.690> do<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.810> same<00:01:59.110> thing<00:01:59.440> so<00:01:59.740> I'm<00:01:59.890> we're

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
going to do the same thing so I'm we're

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.710 
going to do the same thing so I'm we're
gonna<00:02:00.580> have<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.880> do<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.120> a<00:02:01.180> little<00:02:01.390> quicker

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
gonna have to do this a little quicker

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.469 
gonna have to do this a little quicker
than<00:02:01.930> he<00:02:02.229> is<00:02:02.880> alright<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.090> once<00:02:04.270> we<00:02:04.360> got
