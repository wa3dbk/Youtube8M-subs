00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
that's where you need to end hey try to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.870 
that's where you need to end hey try to
show<00:03:04.919> you<00:03:06.019> again<00:03:07.019> people<00:03:07.799> do<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.160> tight<00:03:08.459> I'm

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
show you again people do it tight I'm

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.500 
show you again people do it tight I'm
against<00:03:09.389> tight<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:10.109> don't<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:11.180> anything<00:03:12.180> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
against tight I don't like anything to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.809 
against tight I don't like anything to
be<00:03:12.660> too<00:03:12.930> extremely<00:03:13.709> tight<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.069> think<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.549> puts

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
be too extremely tight I think it puts

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.569 
be too extremely tight I think it puts
stress<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.510> scalp<00:03:15.870> just<00:03:16.169> one<00:03:16.980> preference

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
stress on the scalp just one preference

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.940 
stress on the scalp just one preference
but<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> more<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.269> lock<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.079> title<00:03:19.620> you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
but the more you lock it the title you

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.000 
but the more you lock it the title you
get<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:22.069> about<00:03:23.069> what<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.459> want

yeah<00:03:26.010> I've<00:03:26.099> threaded<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.579> through

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
yeah I've threaded it through

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:37.580 
yeah I've threaded it through
pull<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:30.620> down<00:03:33.800> move<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:36.170> up

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
pull it down move that up

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.760 
pull it down move that up
you<00:03:37.920> see<00:03:39.080> that's<00:03:40.080> nice<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.520> tight<00:03:41.820> there

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
you see that's nice and and tight there

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:52.340 
you see that's nice and and tight there
and<00:03:43.770> I<00:03:43.890> get<00:03:44.070> another<00:03:44.310> one<00:03:44.550> in<00:03:44.670> there<00:03:51.140> okay<00:03:52.140> no

sure you don't snag one with the other
just<00:04:00.720> really<00:04:01.080> easy<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.590> do<00:04:01.830> Oh<00:04:04.700> cheap<00:04:06.080> you<00:04:07.080> can

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
just really easy to do Oh cheap you can

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.070 
just really easy to do Oh cheap you can
you<00:04:09.270> sure<00:04:09.510> you

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
you sure you

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.880 
you sure you
I<00:04:10.110> guess<00:04:10.680> one<00:04:11.040> that's<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.610> front<00:04:11.940> I

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
I guess one that's in the front I

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:33.970 
I guess one that's in the front I
haven't<00:04:13.890> locked<00:04:14.070> this<00:04:14.370> one<00:04:14.640> yet<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.709> we<00:04:16.709> go

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.420 

this<00:04:34.980> way

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.630 

the<00:04:38.430> advantages<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.600> locking<00:04:40.310> interlocking

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.330 

is<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.210> can<00:04:45.420> wash<00:04:45.870> my<00:04:46.140> hair<00:04:46.500> right<00:04:46.770> now<00:04:47.040> and

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
is that I can wash my hair right now and

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.000 
is that I can wash my hair right now and
it's<00:04:47.700> nothing<00:04:48.000> unravel<00:04:48.860> because<00:04:49.860> you

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
it's nothing unravel because you

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.860 
it's nothing unravel because you
essentially<00:04:50.550> when<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.090> do<00:04:51.270> this<00:04:51.600> method

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
essentially when you do this method

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:04.159 
essentially when you do this method
you're<00:04:52.490> tying<00:04:53.490> your<00:04:53.670> hair<00:04:54.030> knots

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.480 

mmm-hmm<00:05:05.599> got<00:05:06.599> a<00:05:06.629> lot<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:06.900> work<00:05:07.110> ahead<00:05:07.319> of<00:05:07.469> me<00:05:07.590> to

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
mmm-hmm got a lot of work ahead of me to

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.809 
mmm-hmm got a lot of work ahead of me to
do<00:05:08.669> all<00:05:08.879> these<00:05:09.090> is<00:05:10.490> more<00:05:11.490> time-consuming

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
do all these is more time-consuming

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.909 
do all these is more time-consuming
applying<00:05:12.749> and<00:05:12.930> think<00:05:13.139> about<00:05:13.409> I<00:05:13.529> don't<00:05:13.620> want<00:05:13.740> to

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
applying and think about I don't want to

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.140 
applying and think about I don't want to
pace<00:05:14.159> myself<00:05:14.460> through<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:16.699> probably<00:05:17.699> use<00:05:18.120> a

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
pace myself through it I probably use a

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.029 
pace myself through it I probably use a
the<00:05:18.659> whole<00:05:18.810> week<00:05:19.110> or<00:05:19.409> two<00:05:19.590> weeks<00:05:19.830> even

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
the whole week or two weeks even
