00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:01.969
 disturbed 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.470
 disappointed 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.960
 supported 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.419
 Well 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.419
 Japan and Turkey are not available from Felix We Regen 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.099
 can rebuild the beat of Lampard and not very simple 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.149
 Of course, to be educated by Kid Rock Studio Head of course so complained to the 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.640
 flood areas 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.689
 to push aside 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.160
 around 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.780
 just here 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.970
 on Inzell and then Friedbergs has selected Triangle Course 10 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.760
 Yes 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.770
 in time and space I'm going to hear you can also do with Klaas and wood 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.800
 Percent so now here we have the function of Free Frostweather 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.190
 to do this 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.500
 there we have selected rum cju and 5 and that's why it is also around Friedrichs 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 at 2 and 3 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.790
 Turn the volume completely down Wipro boys 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.750
 Percent at 1 g selected co2 and it pulls that wave 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.020
 but we need this 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.450
 this unfinished triangle 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.320
 and then in the heat only now stands at 12 o'clock we turn to 9 u 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.210
 that was already the sound 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.810
 around 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 how do we continue eating? 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.710
 that is first emphasized by now we go up here 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.039
 the eu ministers 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.220
 this fifth bell 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 then comes the beautiful Mixa Moscow 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.520
 if we have selected for the selected one now you can 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 because on sound right click and then links to web sites linked to type 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.920
 beats 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.340
 that means 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.320
 he thinks 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.780
 stop the selected ones soon 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 our jahn-elf, so to speak 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.159
 in these diseases 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.409
 Now that you are in there for the selected ones you can 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.299
 they are percent 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.299
 should i install as follows 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:26.479
 and now the percent right echo for those who get it we have to 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.449
 just stay open 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.449
 pull up to 7 20 percent 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.499
 and they are 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:36.809
 Sound for 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.439
 according to APA 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.900
 the Wars now he is like one here with percent Schulte clubs with effects 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.449
 can work 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.879
 for trams for percent and what pianos 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.399
 and in Vista obstacle runner is building so now we still make the sounds 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.729
 Fritz Schramma is guaranteed 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:02.209
 to the right tone 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.619
 rain 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:05.989
 or the right speed 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:06.870
 she's new here 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.509
 Preston Reichert 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.989
 once Dai's pace up 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.989
 74 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.480
 and why the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.380
 had to fit had to get here 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.199
 at food AP 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.829
 go by name 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.829
 that will halve the tone 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.139
 Prof half cash 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.009
 wherever that have done that again often go cell on your hair 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:34.959
 otherwise percent 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.199
 if you weaken the old trade route, there will always be a change in every cell 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.259
 to paint 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.259
 then here we have this band tool and now you can 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.019
 here behind other April its 70 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:49.819
 SU 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.819
 so 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.019
 yes, these are always four tones always one 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.599
 minute 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.119
 no half so does not know black as price black 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.659
 VAT corner have pressed can also choose different 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.349
 Ctrl t 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.899
 and then by ctrl v 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.169
 and then the different animals are pushing 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.259
 b 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.259
 Thibaut Monnet have doubled the money 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.820
 and a note 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.820
 Move Up 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.449
 The wax 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.449
 and I feel that the annual result 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:58.039
 Olaf Gericke that you have 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.330
 the two 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.370
 that would have 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.840
 above
