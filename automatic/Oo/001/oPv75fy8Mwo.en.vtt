00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.110
 I already have it because it closes me 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.140
 but here the next day next 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.320

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.570
 and list I'll have blast activated 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.570
 the following would restart the PC 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.860
 and give it to start is very important 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.440
 restart it on the pc 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.460
 and you give double here now the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.460
 bluestacks screen 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.920
 and it will load, there is a fault 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.080
 that another because this very old version 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.830
 and the newer I do not know why not 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.700
 do they work 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.700
 but good 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.420
 well you will not see it if something like that 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.680
 good has already left 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.970
 I have not put the camera to record 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.790
 down here but here there is no silva 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.090
 divergent online is wrong and here a 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.090
 Once it is here it comes out so we get it 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.299
 nothing else will come out more or less than 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.049
 now I do not know where it is but good 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.650
 you give to the brand you have and so that 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.239
 Look good 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.239
 with the launcher 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.310
 the nhtsa 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.160
 and I download boats that you like 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.380
 and in an agreement with him I have 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.800
 but good 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.040
 no less all are equal 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.130
 and already download it and it's worth once the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.660
 launcher installs it and by giving it here you 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.460
 will leave two options one for you are 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.170
 with the blog so normal and another with the 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.850
 other 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.100
 so then it's good 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.670
 to the option that puts a square 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.670
 always start with that and we're ready 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.630

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.410
 applications that in your other 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.510

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.180

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.010

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.510
 but 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.250

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.019

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.500
 windows 7 you give to showed the icon 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.289
 hidden clip where in fact I select and 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.580
 I would give it to restart so it takes a lot 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:32.470
 disc gives you already leave 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.060
