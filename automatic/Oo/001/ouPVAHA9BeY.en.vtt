00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
horizon V cable and it was designed in

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.409 
horizon V cable and it was designed in
conjunction<00:00:26.449> with<00:00:26.810> Taylor<00:00:27.349> guitars<00:00:27.770> right

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
conjunction with Taylor guitars right

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.959 
conjunction with Taylor guitars right
here<00:00:29.680> is<00:00:30.680> what<00:00:30.919> it<00:00:31.009> looks<00:00:31.160> like<00:00:31.250> up<00:00:31.430> close<00:00:31.489> this

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
here is what it looks like up close this

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.540 
here is what it looks like up close this
is<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.239> end<00:00:32.390> here<00:00:32.629> so<00:00:32.890> rap<00:00:33.890> Co<00:00:34.100> and<00:00:34.309> Taylor

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
is the end here so rap Co and Taylor

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.010 
is the end here so rap Co and Taylor
teamed<00:00:34.820> up<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.149> create<00:00:35.180> an<00:00:35.510> instrument<00:00:35.719> cable

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
teamed up to create an instrument cable

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.750 
teamed up to create an instrument cable
that<00:00:36.890> would<00:00:37.010> give<00:00:37.190> instruments<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
that would give instruments the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.690 
that would give instruments the
flexibility<00:00:38.539> of<00:00:38.660> having<00:00:39.020> a<00:00:39.440> master<00:00:39.920> control

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
flexibility of having a master control

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.479 
flexibility of having a master control
volume<00:00:41.440> for<00:00:42.440> any<00:00:42.649> type<00:00:42.860> of<00:00:42.890> particular

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
volume for any type of particular

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.940 
volume for any type of particular
instrument<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:44.360> may<00:00:44.600> not<00:00:44.720> have<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.410> master

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
instrument that may not have a master

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.380 
instrument that may not have a master
volume<00:00:46.100> I<00:00:46.460> don't<00:00:46.970> know<00:00:47.030> if<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:47.180> can<00:00:47.270> actually

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
volume I don't know if you can actually

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.090 
volume I don't know if you can actually
see<00:00:47.600> this<00:00:47.840> guitar<00:00:47.989> but<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:48.560> one<00:00:48.710> does<00:00:48.860> have<00:00:48.890> a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
see this guitar but this one does have a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.150 
see this guitar but this one does have a
master<00:00:49.460> volume<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:50.210> can<00:00:50.660> use<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.160> cable

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
master volume so I can use this cable

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.670 
master volume so I can use this cable
from<00:00:52.520> Repco<00:00:52.850> horizon<00:00:53.270> on<00:00:53.989> an<00:00:54.200> instrument<00:00:54.410> that

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
from Repco horizon on an instrument that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.650 
from Repco horizon on an instrument that
doesn't<00:00:55.430> have<00:00:55.520> a<00:00:55.550> master<00:00:55.790> volume<00:00:55.910> or<00:00:56.390> does

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
doesn't have a master volume or does

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.220 
doesn't have a master volume or does
alright<00:00:57.880> it<00:00:58.880> can<00:00:59.120> also<00:00:59.239> be<00:00:59.480> used<00:00:59.690> with<00:00:59.899> an

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
alright it can also be used with an

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.319 
alright it can also be used with an
electric<00:01:00.559> guitar<00:01:00.649> or<00:01:01.250> a<00:01:01.460> bass<00:01:01.730> or<00:01:02.000> frankly

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
electric guitar or a bass or frankly

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.090 
electric guitar or a bass or frankly
pretty<00:01:02.510> much<00:01:02.690> on<00:01:02.870> any<00:01:02.989> instrument<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:03.710> can

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
pretty much on any instrument that can

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.639 
pretty much on any instrument that can
be<00:01:04.159> plugged<00:01:04.430> into<00:01:04.579> an<00:01:04.759> amplifier<00:01:05.649> it's

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
be plugged into an amplifier it's

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.060 
be plugged into an amplifier it's
shipped<00:01:06.950> with<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.189> 250<00:01:08.090> K<00:01:08.350> volume<00:01:09.350> pot<00:01:09.560> on<00:01:09.799> the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
shipped with a 250 K volume pot on the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.670 
shipped with a 250 K volume pot on the
inside<00:01:10.430> within<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.270> housing<00:01:11.680> you'll

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
inside within the housing you'll

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.679 
inside within the housing you'll
actually<00:01:12.799> see<00:01:13.100> on<00:01:13.219> the<00:01:13.310> back<00:01:13.490> here<00:01:13.659> Repco

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
actually see on the back here Repco

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.139 
actually see on the back here Repco
imprints<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.649> word<00:01:15.770> Taylor<00:01:16.159> but<00:01:16.729> this<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
imprints the word Taylor but this is the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.459 
imprints the word Taylor but this is the
knurled<00:01:17.450> knob<00:01:17.630> here<00:01:17.840> this<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.109> actually

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
knurled knob here this is actually

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.480 
knurled knob here this is actually
interesting<00:01:19.069> I<00:01:19.100> don't<00:01:19.159> know<00:01:19.280> if<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.399> can

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
interesting I don't know if you can

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.120 
interesting I don't know if you can
actually<00:01:19.579> hear<00:01:19.819> that<00:01:19.999> or<00:01:20.119> not<00:01:20.920> but<00:01:21.920> there's<00:01:22.100> a

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
actually hear that or not but there's a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.929 
actually hear that or not but there's a
little<00:01:22.219> detent<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.819> there

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
little detent in there

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.809 
little detent in there
and<00:01:24.030> what<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.840> does<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.520> turn<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
and what that does is actually turn the

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.779 
and what that does is actually turn the
cable<00:01:27.060> off<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> turn<00:01:28.859> it<00:01:29.009> fully

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
cable off or if you turn it fully

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.550 
cable off or if you turn it fully
clockwise<00:01:30.060> it'll<00:01:30.749> actually<00:01:30.869> turn<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> volume

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
clockwise it'll actually turn the volume

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.529 
clockwise it'll actually turn the volume
up<00:01:31.799> through<00:01:32.039> the<00:01:32.130> amplifier<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.450> a

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
up through the amplifier so it's a

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.870 
up through the amplifier so it's a
passive<00:01:33.869> volume<00:01:34.200> knob<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.590> houses<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> single

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
passive volume knob that houses a single

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.469 
passive volume knob that houses a single
master<00:01:36.299> volume<00:01:36.479> pop<00:01:36.950> by<00:01:37.950> again<00:01:38.939> by<00:01:38.969> turning

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
master volume pop by again by turning

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.999 
master volume pop by again by turning
your<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.719> increase<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.319> decrease<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.890> volume

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
your an increase or decrease the volume

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
your an increase or decrease the volume
of<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:42.119> instrument<00:01:42.479> through<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.719> amplifier

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
of the instrument through the amplifier

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.349 
of the instrument through the amplifier
the<00:01:43.380> best<00:01:44.039> part<00:01:44.280> however<00:01:44.399> though<00:01:44.849> and<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.299> know

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
the best part however though and I know

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.309 
the best part however though and I know
if<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.569> actually<00:01:45.659> saw<00:01:45.929> this<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
if you actually saw this in the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.319 
if you actually saw this in the
beginning<00:01:46.709> is<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.399> actually<00:01:47.670> plug<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.119> into

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
beginning is I can actually plug it into

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.949 
beginning is I can actually plug it into
an<00:01:48.890> instrument<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.939> back<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
an instrument here right on the back and

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.279 
an instrument here right on the back and
you<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.069> hear<00:01:53.189> my<00:01:53.369> info<00:01:53.579> fire<00:01:53.759> pop<00:01:54.289> pretty

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
you don't hear my info fire pop pretty

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.199 
you don't hear my info fire pop pretty
much<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.709> quiet<00:01:56.039> but<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:56.700> soon<00:01:56.819> as<00:01:56.879> I<00:01:57.000> turn

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
much it's quiet but as soon as I turn

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:04.390 
much it's quiet but as soon as I turn
this<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:58.319> actually<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.709> the<00:01:58.860> volume

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400
