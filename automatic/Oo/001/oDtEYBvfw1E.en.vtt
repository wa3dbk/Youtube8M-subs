00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 I think it was a very morning 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:14.490
 productive where both both countries 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.000
 have had an exchange of a series 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.580
 of information regarding 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.510
 infrastructure in terms of logistics in 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.490
 regarding transportation in terms of housing 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.730
 we have presented the plan 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.160
 strategic plan that the equator has in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.570
 commodity of ports airports road 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.480
 et cetera and the minister bomb is the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.350
 second occasion that makes us the honor of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.090
 visit us here in Ecuador has been the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.149
 reciprocal enclosure this last visit 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.489
 back where we did together 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.870
 with President Rafael Correa to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.190
 germany in that 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.760
 that took place because of the possible 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.190
 trade agreement between the European Union 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.640
 and the equator so it has been very 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.410
 Welcome today just 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.850
 we are signing 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.900
 agreement between the parties to be able 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.350
 share experiences 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.040
 and be able to have information from both sides 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.870
 to see the possibility that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.390
 German companies that the government 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:34.700
 German can promote different types of 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.430
 works here in the equator 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.740
 one of them we were talking can 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.900
 be the theme of the super highways that 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.170
 as you know you are already a fact 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.020
 national government is driving it very 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.750
 firmly and there could be that interest 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.560
 on the part of the government 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.290
 German from us as they are receiving 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.550
 absolutely all the collaboration we 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.100
 it is very pleasant to hear from the words 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.670
 the minister because he has a 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.280
 very broad knowledge of everything from what 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.670
 which is the equator of the indicators 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.670
 macroeconomic 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.880
 of how we are doing pretty well today 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.520
 for today in the country of that stability 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.460
 policy that was required and that the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.410
 we have that is what is doing that today 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.690
 day the country is taking steps 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.090
 transcendental so it is that you 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.810
 here to our country to exchange this 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.290
 kind of experiences and we hope as what 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.880
 We said at the beginning of the workshop 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.150
 this does not stay on paper this does not 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.970
 remains in the power points this goes towards 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.640
 a generation of results have the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.739
 open doors all security 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.110

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.800
 again 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.760
 from this country forests huge valleys 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.680
 mountains and great rivers were 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.130
 impressed as we 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.650
 users the second time as I am 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:45.530
 very pleased to see everything that has been 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:47.959
 achieved macroeconomic figures the 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.870
 inflation is at a pretty level is 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.600
 quite well managed and they have people 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.310
 relatively young people 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.260
 young people all they want is to go towards 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.140
 up therefore you have some 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.209
 extraordinary conditions to have 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.269
 a very promising future not only within 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.490
 of Latin America but worldwide 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:14.030
 I'm here as a minister 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.370
 of urbanism transport and public works 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.110
 I want to tell you the federal government of 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.060
 Federal Republic of Germany is not 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.970
 different from these fields to import 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.290
 and support its development 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.910
 another point is camps see him doctor 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.170
 question in a very short time that we have 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.750
 agreed negotiated an agreement that in a 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.880
 principle is not well stimulated so much the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.040
 Dr. Angela Merkel as the resident 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.660
 during their meeting in April to which we 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.030
 we will fill with life that was not 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.180
 only one favor because it ends in 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.760
 two auditoriums or finish at the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.710
 desk drawers but what 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.780
 We fill with life and in a matter of very 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.240
 shortly we have reached this point 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.280
 we are here with the stress group in 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.830
 certain if they want to work so that 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.920
 flat of Germany as the 'great or can 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.330
 work together in the streets of 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.760
 future and the houses of the future in the 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.710
 human development of the future I'm not going to 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.750
 talk a lot about that but it's a subject 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.670
 jumping me 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.910
 when requests well and 4 fusing 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.910
