00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.260
 will beat the downtime that put 2 2 3 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.930
 15 days, finished downloading everything 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.980
 in the college folder that appears a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.160
 this thing

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.650

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.670
 English language that we also go to 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.210
 translating is very easy to lula ie no 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.210
 sensible 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.570
 I do it yourself now 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.410
 mattia to the installation 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.410

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.810
 disk from the agi 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.810
