point<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.550> quarterback<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.630> ball<00:04:35.840> is

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
point of the quarterback the ball is

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.990 
point of the quarterback the ball is
gone<00:04:36.140> in<00:04:36.530> most<00:04:36.740> cases<00:04:36.980> under<00:04:37.460> two<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:37.760> a<00:04:37.910> half

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
gone in most cases under two and a half

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.120 
gone in most cases under two and a half
seconds<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:39.290> get<00:04:39.440> there<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.830> get<00:04:39.920> to<00:04:40.040> the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
seconds to get there to get to the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.090 
seconds to get there to get to the
quarterback<00:04:41.380> within<00:04:42.380> you<00:04:42.590> know<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.830> two<00:04:42.950> and

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
quarterback within you know the two and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.310 
quarterback within you know the two and
a<00:04:43.130> half<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.460> three<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.940> two<00:04:44.150> it's<00:04:44.840> hard<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.170> get

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
a half to three to two it's hard to get

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.980 
a half to three to two it's hard to get
there<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:46.250> we'd<00:04:46.820> say<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.300> successful

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
there so it we'd say that a successful

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.050 
there so it we'd say that a successful
rush<00:04:48.350> would<00:04:48.560> be<00:04:48.680> forcing<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.340> quarterback<00:04:49.880> to

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
rush would be forcing the quarterback to

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.690 
rush would be forcing the quarterback to
throw<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.420> football<00:04:50.830> maybe<00:04:51.830> before<00:04:52.250> he<00:04:52.370> wants

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
throw the football maybe before he wants

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.610 
throw the football maybe before he wants
