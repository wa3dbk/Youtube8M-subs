kind of a odd the way there's a lot of
overspray<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:57.350> don't<00:00:57.559> know<00:00:57.649> if<00:00:57.739> that<00:00:57.890> was

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
overspray I don't know if that was

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.580 
overspray I don't know if that was
intentional<00:00:58.219> or<00:00:58.730> not<00:00:58.940> but<00:00:59.750> it<00:01:00.110> doesn't<00:01:00.500> look

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
intentional or not but it doesn't look

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.200 
intentional or not but it doesn't look
too<00:01:00.770> bad<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.219> heads<00:01:01.399> just<00:01:01.610> pop<00:01:01.789> on<00:01:02.030> and

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
too bad and the heads just pop on and

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.620 
too bad and the heads just pop on and
off<00:01:02.300> with<00:01:02.539> a<00:01:02.600> ball<00:01:02.809> peg<00:01:03.079> it's<00:01:03.739> on<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> hinge<00:01:04.390> or<00:01:05.390> a

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
off with a ball peg it's on a hinge or a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.210 
off with a ball peg it's on a hinge or a
swivel<00:01:06.289> disc<00:01:06.500> whatever<00:01:06.770> want<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:06.950> call<00:01:07.070> that

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
swivel disc whatever want to call that

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.920 
swivel disc whatever want to call that
so<00:01:07.460> pretty<00:01:07.759> good<00:01:07.850> range<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.330> motion<00:01:08.509> on<00:01:08.780> this

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
so pretty good range of motion on this

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.200 
so pretty good range of motion on this
guy<00:01:09.110> really<00:01:09.550> anything<00:01:10.550> you<00:01:10.700> want<00:01:10.910> to<00:01:10.970> do<00:01:11.060> you

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
can even the great parts they're all

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.120 
can even the great parts they're all
translucent<00:01:14.570> gray<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.080> doesn't<00:01:15.409> look<00:01:15.950> too

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
translucent gray so it doesn't look too

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.670 
translucent gray so it doesn't look too
bad<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.670> keeps<00:01:16.880> him<00:01:17.090> in<00:01:17.750> line<00:01:18.200> with<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.530> rest

translucent as well this one has a big

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.749 
translucent as well this one has a big
crack<00:01:27.830> going<00:01:28.130> through<00:01:28.340> I<00:01:28.369> don't<00:01:28.490> know<00:01:28.670> if

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
crack going through I don't know if

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.910 
crack going through I don't know if
that's<00:01:28.939> common<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:30.080> it's<00:01:30.500> kind<00:01:30.650> of<00:01:30.680> hard<00:01:30.740> to

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
that's common but it's kind of hard to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.070 
that's common but it's kind of hard to
see<00:01:31.100> probably<00:01:31.610> but<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.939> plastic<00:01:32.780> for<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
see probably but the plastic for the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.830 
see probably but the plastic for the
disc<00:01:33.409> right<00:01:33.950> there<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.670> part<00:01:34.880> that<00:01:34.970> goes<00:01:35.450> over

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
disc right there the part that goes over

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.260 
disc right there the part that goes over
the<00:01:35.960> disc<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.500> cracked<00:01:37.250> online<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.030> there's<00:01:38.210> a

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
the disc is cracked online so there's a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.429 
the disc is cracked online so there's a
big<00:01:38.450> seam<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.829> that's<00:01:39.979> not<00:01:40.130> cool<00:01:40.490> but<00:01:40.790> whatever

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
big seam so that's not cool but whatever

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.410 
big seam so that's not cool but whatever
it<00:01:42.439> does<00:01:42.590> have<00:01:42.770> an<00:01:42.860> ab<00:01:42.979> crunch<00:01:43.420> fairly

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
it does have an ab crunch fairly

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.819 
it does have an ab crunch fairly
effective<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:44.990> goes<00:01:45.140> all<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.320> way<00:01:45.409> forward

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
effective it goes all the way forward

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
is the hinge fairly effective not as

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.590 
is the hinge fairly effective not as
good<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.860> could<00:02:27.040> be<00:02:27.070> though<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.790> then<00:02:28.480> it

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
good as it could be though and then it

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.350 
good as it could be though and then it

they<00:02:31.600> made<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> boots<00:02:32.110> look<00:02:32.350> like<00:02:32.530> he's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
they made the boots look like he's

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.770 
they made the boots look like he's
wearing<00:02:32.950> Crocs<00:02:33.250> because<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.090> paintwork<00:02:34.480> is

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
wearing Crocs because the paintwork is

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.480 
wearing Crocs because the paintwork is
all<00:02:34.900> over<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.260> place<00:02:35.470> as<00:02:35.680> far<00:02:35.890> as<00:02:35.980> being<00:02:36.160> dark

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
all over the place as far as being dark

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.310 
all over the place as far as being dark
than<00:02:36.670> light<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:36.880> dark<00:02:37.300> again<00:02:37.390> maybe<00:02:38.140> that's

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
than light and dark again maybe that's

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.690 
than light and dark again maybe that's
how<00:02:38.470> he<00:02:38.530> looks<00:02:38.710> in<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.860> comics<00:02:39.280> if<00:02:39.400> that's<00:02:39.580> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
how he looks in the comics if that's the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.250 
how he looks in the comics if that's the
case<00:02:39.910> then<00:02:40.240> that's<00:02:40.450> perfectly<00:02:40.810> fine<00:02:41.050> of

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
case then that's perfectly fine of

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.620 
case then that's perfectly fine of
course<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.310> am<00:02:42.670> not<00:02:43.060> familiar<00:02:43.210> with<00:02:43.480> this

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
course but I am not familiar with this

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.220 
course but I am not familiar with this
guy<00:02:43.780> at<00:02:43.840> all

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
guy at all

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.440 
guy at all
and<00:02:44.320> I'm<00:02:44.590> gonna<00:02:44.680> guess<00:02:45.100> though<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:46.180> he's<00:02:46.300> not

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
and I'm gonna guess though that he's not

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.330 
and I'm gonna guess though that he's not
supposed<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:46.990> wearing<00:02:47.200> Crocs<00:02:47.500> that's<00:02:48.100> just

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
supposed to be wearing Crocs that's just

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.550 
supposed to be wearing Crocs that's just
my<00:02:48.460> guess<00:02:48.520> but<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.750> up<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.110> guys<00:02:50.260> if<00:02:50.470> you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
my guess but it's up to you guys if you

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.410 
my guess but it's up to you guys if you
like<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:50.860> or<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.070> he's<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.670> cool<00:02:51.910> enough<00:02:52.120> figure

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
like it or not he's a cool enough figure

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.730 
like it or not he's a cool enough figure
I<00:02:52.480> don't<00:02:52.540> mind<00:02:52.840> having<00:02:53.050> him<00:02:53.320> he's<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> nice

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
I don't mind having him he's a nice

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.410 
I don't mind having him he's a nice
display<00:02:54.040> piece<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.640> he's<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.820> unique<00:02:55.150> looking

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
display piece and he's a unique looking

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.270 
display piece and he's a unique looking
figure<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:55.900> I'm<00:02:56.020> happy<00:02:56.350> with<00:02:56.470> him<00:02:56.680> really

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
figure so I'm happy with him really

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.340 
figure so I'm happy with him really
nothing<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.910> be<00:02:57.940> disappointed<00:02:58.720> about<00:02:58.840> just

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
nothing to be disappointed about just

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.620 
nothing to be disappointed about just
nothing<00:02:59.830> nothing<00:03:00.070> really<00:03:00.910> out<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.570> world

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
nothing nothing really out of this world

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.650 
nothing nothing really out of this world
but<00:03:02.230> he's<00:03:02.410> definitely<00:03:03.060> probably<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.270> solid

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
but he's definitely probably a solid

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.480 
but he's definitely probably a solid
figure<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:05.140> guess<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.830> depends<00:03:06.160> on<00:03:06.250> what<00:03:06.370> he

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
figure I guess it depends on what he

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.700 
figure I guess it depends on what he
looks<00:03:06.640> like<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.970> comics<00:03:07.360> so<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:08.200> guys<00:03:08.470> be
