 not a bit like a maze and I 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:46.970
 I do not like here remember Andryukha does not like 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.870
 mazes and labyrinths also do not like 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.840
 Andrew is not 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.069

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.299
 will find out 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.489
 in fact, they are pretty funny 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.739
 because they are small here small 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.160
 the maze is cool damn on sculpt 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.989

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:27.040
 I Redstone and then I went 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:30.319
 e-my how to get through this is about 111 we went 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.620
 so now we go here hopefully we 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:48.799
 this is no command in the command block 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:51.500

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:00.470
 first time the amount is dishonest 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:03.709

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.100
 meets serious guys without cheats but 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.560

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.030

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.529
 garbage okay we will now on the very 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.539
 work carefully and try to go through this 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.050
 the most difficult part of the map is the most 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:33.479
 nice 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.479
 be careful on the turns and principle 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.680
 Well, now it's just an exciting lesson 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:47.469

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:51.610

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:29.050
 worth it most likely this is 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:31.149
 idea cards and x 3 stage and in fact 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.050
