00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.540
What is the best way to cook bratwurst?

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.790
Bratwurst is one of the best summertime foods
hands down!

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.720
In any neighborhood across the country, you
can smell that succulent aroma steaming out

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.750
of grills.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.780
It does not matter it you cook on charcoal,
propane or old fashioned wood, they will taste

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.030
delicious!

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.199
What happens though when you lose that summertime
sun and the grill needs to be covered up for

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.199
the season?

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.599
Some families just say good-bye to the bratwurst
as well.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.870
It does not have to end like that; you can
savor bratwurst all year long.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.140
We are going to show the best way to cook
bratwurst when stuck indoors.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.790
There are just a few things you will need;
bratwurst, water, olive oil, and your favorite

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.990
skillet.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.850
The first step is always the easiest, just
place your bratwurst into a cold skillet side

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.430
by side.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.320
Using your favorite bottle of olive oil, pour
one to two teaspoons over the cold bratwurst.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.000
The oil will help to keep them that crisp
appeal as they simmer.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.380
To maintain the brats from over cooking and
burning, you will need to cover about half

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.590
of the bratwurst with a liquid.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.200
I recommend water, but you can always try
beer as well.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.189
Turn the burner on our stove to a medium - medium
high and place the brats on.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.869
The water needs to come to a quick simmer,
just not a full on boil.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.509
If the water becomes too hot too quick, the
casings of the bratwurst will break losing

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.229
all the juice.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.039
Leaving behind a dry bratwurst, that is not
that tasty.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.599
When the liquid does begin to simmer, it is
time to turn down the heat and let those beautiful

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.259
brats cook.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.239
Leave the pan uncovered and cook until all
of the liquid but the oil has evaporated.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.450
Now we come to the part of the cooking process
everybody loves.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.179
The brats are cooked to perfection on the
outside, now it is time to get them that crisp

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.270
outer casing.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.639
Turn the heat backup and keep rotating til
you have the perfect color you are looking

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.200
to achieve.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.999
The darker and more well done you want them
will take an extended cooking time.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.630
You may need to add a teaspoon more oil if
cooking for a prolonged time.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.469
Cooking bratwurst on the stove is how you
can bring that summertime favorite right back

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.989
into the home any time of the year!

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.530
Not only is this the easiest method, it is
truly the best way to cook bratwurst.
