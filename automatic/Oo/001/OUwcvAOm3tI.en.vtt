00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
like a drill press or a router bit and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
like a drill press or a router bit and
you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.780> make<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.320> own

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you can just make your own

you can just make your own
ingot<00:01:29.009> moulds<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.939> requires<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.450> little

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
ingot moulds and it requires a little

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960

bit<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.020> work<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.409> practice<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.610> for

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
bit of work a little practice but for

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
bit of work a little practice but for
the<00:01:33.090> cost<00:01:33.390> you're<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> save<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.470> lot<00:01:34.710> of

of you know different things you can do

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
of you know different things you can do
with<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.909> thing<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> do<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.750> I'll<00:01:42.899> make

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
with it one thing that I do is I'll make

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.380 
with it one thing that I do is I'll make
two<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> same<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.909> use<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
two that are the same and use like a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.219 
two that are the same and use like a
c-clamp<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> hole<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.140> at

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
c-clamp and you can put a hole here at

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.249 
c-clamp and you can put a hole here at
the<00:01:49.350> top<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.850> another<00:01:51.119> mold<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the top so you have another mold you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.770 
the top so you have another mold you
know<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.710> pour<00:01:52.950> directly<00:01:53.130> into<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
know that you can pour directly into the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.999 
know that you can pour directly into the
stuff<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.140> seeing<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> background

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
stuff you're seeing in the background

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.410 
stuff you're seeing in the background
here<00:01:56.219> are<00:01:56.310> some<00:01:56.460> other<00:01:56.610> stuff<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.149> use
