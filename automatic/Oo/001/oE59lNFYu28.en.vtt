the movies and that's fiberglass to look
like<00:03:42.370> steel<00:03:43.409> there'd<00:03:44.409> be<00:03:44.560> interesting<00:03:45.040> just

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
like steel there'd be interesting just

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.860 
like steel there'd be interesting just
to<00:03:45.280> do<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.640> work<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:48.239> there's<00:03:49.239> nitrous

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
to do the work like that there's nitrous

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.670 
to do the work like that there's nitrous
system<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:51.989> can't<00:03:52.989> tell<00:03:53.200> for<00:03:53.409> sure<00:03:53.470> if

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
system and it can't tell for sure if

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.780 
system and it can't tell for sure if
that's<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:54.040> engine<00:03:54.400> back<00:03:54.579> here<00:03:59.609> because<00:04:00.609> it

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
that's the engine back here because it

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.729 
that's the engine back here because it
looks<00:04:00.939> more<00:04:01.090> like<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.269> mustang<00:04:02.940> with<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> window

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.020 
and a machine gun mounted on the front
and<00:04:10.299> then<00:04:10.450> we're<00:04:10.629> talking<00:04:11.159> quarter<00:04:12.159> inch<00:04:12.430> and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
and then we're talking quarter inch and

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.839 
and then we're talking quarter inch and
of<00:04:13.510> course<00:04:13.810> this<00:04:13.959> is<00:04:14.139> awesome<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.849> it's

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
of course this is awesome this is it's

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.670 
of course this is awesome this is it's
made<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.150> look<00:04:16.269> like<00:04:16.449> quarter-inch<00:04:17.109> steel<00:04:17.440> but

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
made to look like quarter-inch steel but

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.420 
made to look like quarter-inch steel but
it's<00:04:17.799> not<00:04:18.039> it's<00:04:18.370> been<00:04:18.789> played<00:04:19.440> look<00:04:20.440> at<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.799> I

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.710 

bet<00:04:24.430> we've<00:04:24.610> watched<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.090> movie<00:04:25.389> that<00:04:25.539> that

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
bet we've watched the movie that that

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.939 
bet we've watched the movie that that
car<00:04:25.930> was<00:04:26.110> probably<00:04:26.500> enemies<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:28.000> run

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
car was probably enemies do not run

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:38.850 
car was probably enemies do not run
public<00:04:29.949> enemies

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.230 

our<00:04:39.860> set<00:04:40.340> decided<00:04:42.069> you<00:04:43.069> know<00:04:43.159> this<00:04:43.370> Lisa

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
our set decided you know this Lisa

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.469 
our set decided you know this Lisa
obviously<00:04:44.690> could<00:04:44.930> be<00:04:45.759> originals<00:04:46.759> modified

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
obviously could be originals modified

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.170 
obviously could be originals modified
and<00:04:47.960> not<00:04:48.409> necessarily<00:04:48.620> kit<00:04:49.190> cars<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:50.030> would
