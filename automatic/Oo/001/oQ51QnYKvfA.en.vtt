00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 diop like me you are a young 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.860
 padawan this video will please you in 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.660
 waiting for better power grow up I 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.460
 proposes to begin by reproducing 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.020
 a lightsaber 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.279
 here is our model from which we 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.990
 let's do our molding I use 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.650
 patafix on a piece of cardboard 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.680
 feather to be able to fix and stabilize 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.140
 the lightsaber 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.780
 in this way the sword will not go up 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.800
 not bare will move during the casting of the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.800
 molding materials 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.789
 I spend a cardboard tube around 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.320
 the object so as to have a formwork 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.320
 and save casting material 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.440
 game positions it and I check that the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.059
 measures are good it must be around 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.210
 the object is still a diameter 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.850
 enough to have a good mold 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.320
 thickness 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.400
 I will then fix it to the support at 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.170
 using a liquid glue 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.930
 if you are a bit in a hurry you can 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.100
 use hot glue I center 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.360
 well the object compared to the cartons and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.229
 we will prepare alginate 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.030
 reusable in a saucepan 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.110
 I add water that I do 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.110
 gradually heat 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.430
 I add the alginate powder in the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:46.410
 following proportions 8 volumes of water 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.420
 for a powder volume of 100 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.420
 grams of powder for 800 grams of water 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.350
 after everything needs to be between us 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.940
 it's the biggest job 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.580
 we will gradually leave the mixture 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.350
 to be done and then we will go to the bottom of the 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.470
 cardboard tube 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.730
 that's to prevent them right away 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.710
 you never know it's better 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.580
 secure the formwork 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.410
 we will put a small earth seal 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.840
 this is clay provence you 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.310
 can find them in the east in the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.090
 hobby shops without 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.160
 problem you see I'm doing a little 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.930
 seal that reinforces the structure and 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.420
 the adhesion of the cardboard cardboard tube 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:37.860
 more then it'll be the highlight 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.720
 of casting see that the mixture is 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.570
 still hot he smokes but releases the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.640
 water vapor and a large part of 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.280
 lumps goes first we'll finish the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.360
 mix by giving them a little bit 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.970
 on fire so that they are 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.880
 a little bit more liquid see this is 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.220
 much better like that and we can have 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.570
 something much cleaner in 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.670
 the longer the cooling time is 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.140
 very fast so I can open the mold 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.480
 within half an hour of pouring 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.550
 I start with cardboard tear then I 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.070
 cleanly make a cut on 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.690
 the mold directly into the alginate in 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.209
 taking care measure 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.980
 depth not to damage 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:22.560
 the original here is the first cut and 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.310
 do next we'll do a second 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.390
 cut on the back but this time 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.340
 in zigzag this second cut 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:38.010
 will put the mood back into place 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.750
 correctly afterwards gently 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.420
 I will remove the lightsaber 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.240
 and then keep the mold preciously 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:52.870
 the draw will be done immediately in 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:55.360
 plaster for that so it'll have to 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.090
 put back the mold both 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.010
 parts fit into each other 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.480
 correctly I take a new tube 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.970
 cardboard in which I will slip 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.980
 so the mold reassemble and then we go 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.220
 to go to casting a test in 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.630
 plaster too that's pretty fast and we 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.440
 can get a good idea of 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.530
 ladji nat performance the tube in 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.419
 cardboard is removed and the alginate is going to be 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.850
 simply tear to be able to 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:32.500
 remove the plaster print on 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.120
 realizes that there have been some burrs 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.510
 at the joints 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.630
 but nothing very serious a little bit 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.250
 abrasives and it will be like new at 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.110
 color level we can of course 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.389
 paint the plaster after having prepared it 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.780
 to obtain an identical print 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.610
 model 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.100
 here is a first test in plaster 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.590
 realized if you want rather 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.150
 Resin prints then we will orient ourselves 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.340
 to silicone molds and there you 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.919
 can massively produce your swords 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.960
 laser my channel being dedicated to the 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.390
 sculpture and molding does not hesitate to 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.419
 consult other tutorials found 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.470
 month on twitter facebook internet and 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.780
 my website 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.910
 you can possibly support me in 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.380
 donating on tipi or any 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:20.430
 just by tapping at my tower chain 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.430
