00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.550 
unlocked and the reason why is because a
season<00:01:24.630> pass<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> essentially<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> pre-order

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
season pass is essentially a pre-order

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890 
season pass is essentially a pre-order
and<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.040> incentive<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> pre-order<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and a incentive to pre-order is it's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.890 
and a incentive to pre-order is it's
cheaper<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.070> pay<00:01:29.340> 25<00:01:30.180> bucks<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
cheaper so if you pay 25 bucks for the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300 
cheaper so if you pay 25 bucks for the
season<00:01:31.140> pass<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.040> means<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.250> don't

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
season pass then that means you don't

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
season pass then that means you don't
have<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> pay<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.759> DLC<00:01:33.090> packs<00:01:33.360> individually

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

and then they are math you can get added

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.660 
and then they are math you can get added
to<00:02:04.290> your<00:02:04.350> game<00:02:04.560> when<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> come<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.549> that's

to your game when it come out so that's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.029 
to your game when it come out so that's
the<00:02:05.820> reason<00:02:05.969> why<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.540> season<00:02:07.170> pass<00:02:07.200> even<00:02:07.590> exists

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the reason why a season pass even exists

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.880 
the reason why a season pass even exists
and<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> know<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> lot<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.910> people<00:02:09.890> were

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
wondering why the DLC pack was not added

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.410 
wondering why the DLC pack was not added
