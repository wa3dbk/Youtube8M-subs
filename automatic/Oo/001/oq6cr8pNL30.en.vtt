00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.330
 Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route where the snow wall is the highlight 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.460
 I will 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 Many tourists visit every day this year 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.320
 Is it the first time in the snow? 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.320
 Impressed 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.140
 Mountain climbing guide Kenichi Otsuka 30 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.280
 Yes 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 One person started a tour company set in Tateyama 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:44.100
 I have no stable income, but I always look forward 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:49.430
 It is 10 to say that we are moving to the mountain and doing a job to guide Tateyama like this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.430
 I also finished the pole again by the year ago 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:08.340
 I'm moved to Toyama from Tokyo 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:08.340
 A man who loves Tateyama is also a good dad of two daughters when he comes home 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.890
 The cat had to say I want to much that sort of even a yellow house in Congress Node 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.890
 I say will someday 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.400
 On the other hand 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.290
 Anxiety 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.830
 mo 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.220
 Maybe at the time said I do not say was that he also but it might be a lie do 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.530
 Because it looks like 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.530
 I want to cheer you up without asking 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:54.369
 My wife Sanae, who has been dating since I was a student, is fine at the age of 26 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.369
 At the same time , two people who traveled the world until they used up the 1 million yen they ate to work but quit the job 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.070
 I was attracted by Tateyama who climbed up as a student and I set up a tour company, but it wasn't that I had a prospect of income 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.470
 There is 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.470
 It seems like the more difficult one is fun 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.920
 Oh dear 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.660
 In such a situation 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.660
 Fish adjusted to a new thing 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:32.810
 Though it is not the best of life 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:39.070
 While there is a low level of awareness and there are few applications for experience tours , it is now a school climbing guide and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.070
 I get some income while supporting the mountain climbing research institute 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.260
 It has not to hurt 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.480
 Not disappointed 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.300
 Well 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.080
 The bug color is 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.490
 My mother can do that 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.100
 Even so-so see you incoming ones 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.100
 I think kana What if the whale 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.670
 Family support is a great force 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:20.349
 From April to June, the 17-metre-high snow wall makes for an attractive Tateyama hardship. 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.349
 There is a guidance route unique to Otsuka who aims for an inspiring original tour. 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:30.110
 It is a view that can be seen at all just by blowing up slightly from the blow terminal 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:34.250
 You'll have to do it is really but had looked up to walk in the same load from above the crawling 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.920
 If you look at the great people are small too 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.400
 Someone can see the scale 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.650
 It's different It is really along the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.720
 The same as my recommendation 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.650
 Point of view but from a completely different angle N But I walked around Nenchotto 's are you looking at that at all 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.439
 The 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.660
 While watching from such a different angles between the funny Do I think Las Tateyama in my 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.780
 Like this 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.510
 Oh dear 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.490
 I say that I think we have a more willing us people Once you introduce or guide 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.980
 I thought to 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.000
 I think I want to do it myself now 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.970
 Is doing 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.139
 It is called flow 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:20.789
 I want to transmit the attraction between Tateyama and Kamiyama 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:23.910
 Otsuka who returned from the mountain aims to develop a new tour 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.560
 Participate in project meetings 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.639
 I make an effort every day 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:35.010
 If you want to eat something delicious on the theme other than the mountain, or exactly where you are, you will also have a foot 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:42.490
 I think that there is a desire to extend the 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:45.780
 I believe the kana not it increases the probability that get to enter if you can guide also in Toyama 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.960
 What is always in my mind 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.610
 It is a challenge to 1 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.230
 Among the wand expectations are swaying in my mind 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.920
 The moment to go into 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.000
 That's best 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.610
 Because every time I come to feel alive 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.510
 It would be nice if I wanted to live that way 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.100
 Make reins 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.260
 I think 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.460
 When was you goal to then advance one step even if not visible are visible First there 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.129
 Go to 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.029
 If I put a little effort on my brother so much 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.029
 I think a flower
