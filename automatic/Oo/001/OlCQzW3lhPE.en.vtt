00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
better with the pinpointer looks like a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:13.280 
better with the pinpointer looks like a
silver<00:03:04.080> dime<00:03:11.480> can't<00:03:12.480> quite<00:03:12.720> tell<00:03:12.930> what<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.260> is

alright well past two hours now in this

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
park and just had a nice little signal

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:38.430 
park and just had a nice little signal
about<00:03:30.160> six<00:03:30.520> inches<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:37.020> think<00:03:38.020> that<00:03:38.050> says

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
about six inches I think that says

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.530 
about six inches I think that says
sterling<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.160> don't<00:03:39.550> have<00:03:39.640> my<00:03:39.790> glasses<00:03:39.940> but<00:03:40.540> I

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
sterling I don't have my glasses but I

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.730 
sterling I don't have my glasses but I
found<00:03:43.540> quite<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.750> few<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.050> these<00:03:44.170> before<00:03:44.440> and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
found quite a few of these before and

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.470 
found quite a few of these before and
they<00:03:44.980> usually<00:03:45.130> kind<00:03:45.460> of<00:03:45.580> corroded<00:03:45.970> but<00:03:46.270> this

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
they usually kind of corroded but this

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.780 
they usually kind of corroded but this
one's<00:03:46.690> doesn't<00:03:47.110> show<00:03:47.260> any<00:03:47.440> corrosion<00:03:47.790> so

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
one's doesn't show any corrosion so

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.470 
one's doesn't show any corrosion so
that's<00:03:48.940> what<00:03:49.090> makes<00:03:49.300> me<00:03:49.450> think<00:03:49.540> it's<00:03:49.930> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
that's what makes me think it's a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.050 
that's what makes me think it's a
perhaps<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.720> sterling<00:03:53.640> it's<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.730> nice<00:03:54.880> little

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
perhaps I sterling it's a nice little

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:07.620
