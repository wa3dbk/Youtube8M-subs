00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello how about friends all like me 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.060
 know their friends the tutor sisters and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.019
 Well, this time I come and in the 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.710
 response of a comment that I 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.960
 they made the Chinese rock video good 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.699
 of how to change the Spanish filling 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.550
 and have a request for how to change 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:34.319
 applications to the sd in the jee-lc 5x 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.859
 that's good since in this cell phone like 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:43.139
 good traitor brought from storage 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:47.820
 one is the sd card and the memory 

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:51.390
 internal and since in this cell phone the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.040
 applications to change to the s of no 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:01.200
 you can because that's why in 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:04.110
 this cell phone are brought by that brings the 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:09.509
 internal storage that counts for a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.850
 giga and a half approximately then what 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.190
 what we have to do is go to settings 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.440
 of the system 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.340
 in adjustment of the system we are going to go to 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.340
 Applications 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.760
 and boxes will show us the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 downloaded 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:34.860
 what if we want to see them then 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.910
 we just click where in the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 application and x before forcing attention 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.060
 and here below shows us in clear data 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.240
 or move to the micro sd good because this 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.410
 is without any more we put it in move 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.210
 and we wait for the sun and it's lonely 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.600
 show us that the application 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.659
 effectively moved on the sd 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.750
 here you can see that here 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.040
 as I in return put us in moving the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.590
 phone 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.590
 well, you see it's easy 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.150
 we follow and so we give with all we force 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.100
 the detention 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.990
 and move to the microsd 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.080
 in some never appear this and what 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.850
 some we can not move 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.850
 here we go 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.580
 and we give a move to the s 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.849
 we wait 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.430
 here there is no more to move to the phone and 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.480
 here is it does not want to tell us that 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.420
 we have moved in the application to the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.800
 I died 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.280
 good friends well well this one by one 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.090
 I know it's serious but that's the way 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.190
 way and good then in practically that 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.750
