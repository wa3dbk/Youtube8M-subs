00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.990
 that are no more than grand theft auto 5 of 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.300
 today we are going to make two challenges the truth 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.040
 they are very calm with the great thing 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.199
 so the truth is the first challenge 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.990
 is going to be to grab a jumbo jet from 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.820
 airport those gigantic commercial 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.350
 cost and do seven laps in the air 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.789
 that challenge someone left me the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.050
 comments but I did not find that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.730
 comment to put it here in the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.310
 screen then please if you were 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.750
 who challenged me to that urgent challenge leave it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.910
 know that down in the comments for 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.800
 put you subscribed part a description 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.319
 then the second challenge is going to be 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.839
 grab an airplane and go under 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:41.850
 of seven bridges if you prevented that a bit 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.350
 one after the other and before starting 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.670
 the challenges of today I love you 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.319
 remember that if that first day you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 are on my channel post subscribe to 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.739
 that no more challenges will be lost 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.359
 during auto 5 and if they have a project 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.710
 for me then from down here in the 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.409
 comments have is the next challenge 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.999
 may be yours and his works and then 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.150
 let's start because here I had already 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.900
 stolen he 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.840
 I had to grab a height yes yes yes 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.970
 yes yes yes no because the plane is 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.040
 is that the rudÃ­simo with the turns 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.540
 then check out the first 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 return 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.930
 the second 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.710
 the third 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.170
 the fourth 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.170
 the fifth and the sixth 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.030
 seventh state 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.560
 I think that if I took another lap and 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.510
 I would have crashed down there like that 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.000
 very safe and then in this next 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.190
 I'm obviously star 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.800
 in the every time on the bridges then 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.800
 First, check the groups of how it was 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.030
 this time I had put fil and river and 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.069
 that in fact was challenging me 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.900
 go through three bridges with the house without 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.540
 hurt him but then to do 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.890
 faster effects of the recording I had 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.750
 what to do with the airplane with the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.610
 trick to pass this to take out the 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.739
 airplane so I owe the tenth and instead of 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 that there were three bridges because they were seven 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.510
 bridges 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.049
 but good this until now if the good 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.850
 we grabbed a little bit of height out there 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.100
 and here we go 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.820
 but so strong 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.820
 a bridge 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.069
 two parts 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.040
 but before 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.040
 4 points 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.100
 five poles 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.010
 six bridges and 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.490
 seven sources 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.590
 but good this state for today 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.330
 do not forget to leave powerful like 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.010
 because that helps me bring you more 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.480
 challenges of grand theft auto 5 should check 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.340
 the last electric challenge down here 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.540
 to the video they also remember again if 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.950
 it's the first time they 're on my channel 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.200
 so subscribe so they did not know 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.540
 more reduces grand theft auto 5 and 27 others 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.680
 4 and with plates do not think about facebook and 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.960
 The link was worked on in the description 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.460
 thank you very much for this challenge I am 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.460
 very illusion of the next moment
