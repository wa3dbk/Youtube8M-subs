00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.210
 with Title 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:28.130
 and how much his title cost me my title 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.439
 It cost a lot of work to study it 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.790
 because now it's like that you get confused 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.200
 which says that we do not win the 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:39.949
 silver to cow since it costs a lot of work 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.449
 silver gain so it's like that is that 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.449
 Miss we have all studied 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.970

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.640
 I think I'll put a thank 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.720
 success because the only text thanks to a 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.080
 as a head 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.930
 It should be sold in this country on the way 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.930
 oral intramuscular and in suppository 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.119
 Thank you 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.470
 it is proven that it works 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.119
 always very good 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.530
 good definitely the words 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.530
 they come depending on who says them 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.600
 this is human then talk 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.380
 good but that shows your ignorance 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.229
 Farias are also the means 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.790
 so that she is crying I wet all the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.790
 heart 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.130
 d 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.250
 the air 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.260
 I know that you have expressed what 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.780
 I feel but listen to me 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.640
 and what they think maybe many 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.490
 Ecuadorians and you had the courage 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.070
 to come and tell us here but 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.530
 yes I think there are ways of saying 10 for 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.330
 example when saying about sweet girls 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:50.070
 to others that looks like who likes 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:50.070
 the low the low and the high 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.100
 it's strong that it's okay to express the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.120
 things that you feel because that's the way 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.500
 be but there are ways then but 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.500
 also one decides that affection 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.820
 with them 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:20.420

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.860

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.220
