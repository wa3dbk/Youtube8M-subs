this<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.589> unboxing<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.730> signal<00:00:03.149> tech

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
this is the unboxing of the signal tech

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.420 
this is the unboxing of the signal tech
xef<00:00:03.780> series<00:00:04.080> offense<00:00:04.440> this<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> hundred<00:00:05.279> for

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
xef series offense this is a hundred for

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.000 
xef series offense this is a hundred for
the<00:00:05.520> millimeter<00:00:05.970> fan<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.420> it's<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.259> relatively

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
the millimeter fan and it's a relatively

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.390 
the millimeter fan and it's a relatively
new<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:09.210> promotes<00:00:09.480> 80<00:00:09.809> new<00:00:10.110> blade<00:00:10.920> design

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
new and it promotes 80 new blade design

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.879 
new and it promotes 80 new blade design
which<00:00:12.179> features<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> wave-like<00:00:13.049> structure<00:00:13.769> as

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
which features a wave-like structure as

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.290 
which features a wave-like structure as
you<00:00:13.920> can<00:00:14.099> see<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:15.230> the<00:00:16.230> video<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.300> apparently

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
you can see in the video and apparently

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.660 
you can see in the video and apparently
this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.960> promoted<00:00:19.619> by<00:00:19.650> Sigma<00:00:20.220> tech<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
this is promoted by Sigma tech to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.200 
this is promoted by Sigma tech to
provide<00:00:21.539> higher<00:00:21.840> airflow<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:23.340> quieter<00:00:23.970> rate

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
provide higher airflow at a quieter rate

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.870 
provide higher airflow at a quieter rate
as<00:00:24.390> well<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.680> will<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> simple<00:00:26.250> boxing

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
as well so we will do a simple boxing

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.120 
as well so we will do a simple boxing
and<00:00:27.090> then<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.720> followed<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.560> simple

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and then it's followed by a simple

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.339 
and then it's followed by a simple
performance<00:00:29.640> benchmark<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.810> see<00:00:30.840> how<00:00:31.140> well

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
performance benchmark to see how well

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.880 
performance benchmark to see how well
the<00:00:31.560> fan<00:00:31.769> performs<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.600> here<00:00:33.890> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the fan performs so we can see here the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.290 
the fan performs so we can see here the
packaging<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.149> fan<00:00:36.540> itself<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:38.300> let's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
packaging of the fan itself and let's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.330 
packaging of the fan itself and let's
see<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.570> they<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:39.899> fan<00:00:40.200> himself

you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.420> post<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.930> read<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.260> yourself

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
you can post and read it for yourself

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.889 
you can post and read it for yourself
and<00:00:48.120> I'll<00:00:48.450> bet<00:00:48.750> some<00:00:50.300> specifications<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
and I'll bet some specifications of the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.740 
and I'll bet some specifications of the
fan<00:00:52.680> itself<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.629> an

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
fan itself and here we have an

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.660 
fan itself and here we have an
installation<00:00:55.289> guide<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> rather

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
installation guide this is rather

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.389 
installation guide this is rather
interesting<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.690> believe<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.829> allows

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
interesting because I believe it allows

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.850 
interesting because I believe it allows
you<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> install<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:02.000> 140<00:01:03.000> or<00:01:03.270> 120<00:01:04.049> mm<00:01:04.350> mounting

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
you to install in 140 or 120 mm mounting

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
you to install in 140 or 120 mm mounting
holes<00:01:05.129> right<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.330> let's<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.930> unbox<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:14.689> so

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
holes right so let's just unbox it so

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.230 
holes right so let's just unbox it so
you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.530> fan<00:01:17.100> itself<00:01:19.700> with<00:01:20.700> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
you can see the fan itself with this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.140 
you can see the fan itself with this
shiny<00:01:22.580> tip<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.450> blades<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:26.159> sleeve

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
shiny tip of the blades and sleeve

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.060 
shiny tip of the blades and sleeve
cables

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.690 

and<00:01:32.299> accessories<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:34.700> screws<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:38.070> very

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and accessories we have screws and very

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.059 
and accessories we have screws and very
interesting<00:01:41.360> mounting<00:01:42.360> mechanism<00:01:42.950> let<00:01:43.950> me

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
interesting mounting mechanism let me

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:54.139 
interesting mounting mechanism let me
open<00:01:44.219> this<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:52.140> yeah<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.679> have<00:01:53.149> normal

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
open this up so yeah you have normal

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.949 
open this up so yeah you have normal
screws<00:01:54.950> then<00:01:55.950> screw<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.750> creep<00:01:57.750> into

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
screws then screw is the creep into

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:05.120 
screws then screw is the creep into
molex<00:01:58.679> adapter<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:00.319> this<00:02:01.319> are<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:03.979> these<00:02:04.979> are

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
molex adapter and this are the these are

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.400 
molex adapter and this are the these are
the<00:02:06.709> 150<00:02:07.709> mm

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the 150 mm

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.089 
the 150 mm
mounting<00:02:11.450> brackets<00:02:12.450> I'll<00:02:12.810> say<00:02:13.200> for<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.890> to

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
mounting brackets I'll say for you to

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.589 
mounting brackets I'll say for you to
minder<00:02:14.579> for<00:02:14.790> 140<00:02:15.510> or<00:02:15.690> 120<00:02:17.150> young<00:02:18.150> man<00:02:18.329> so

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
minder for 140 or 120 young man so

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.460 
minder for 140 or 120 young man so
that's<00:02:18.870> about<00:02:19.019> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
that's about it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.630 
that's about it
so<00:02:20.370> we're<00:02:20.730> going<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.880> take<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> look<00:02:21.390> at<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:22.640> fan

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
so we're going to take a look at the fan

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.170 
so we're going to take a look at the fan
in<00:02:24.060> action

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.240 

so<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.110> fan<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.470> action<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:31.980> actually

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
so this the fan in action is actually

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.890 
so this the fan in action is actually
really<00:02:32.760> quiet<00:02:34.700> what<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.849> may<00:02:36.360> hear<00:02:36.629> now<00:02:36.870> is

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
really quiet what you may hear now is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.199 
really quiet what you may hear now is
probably<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.470> background<00:02:37.860> noise<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.010> my<00:02:38.640> of

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
probably the background noise of my of

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.649 
probably the background noise of my of
the<00:02:39.659> computer<00:02:40.049> itself<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:42.060> amount<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.450> air

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
the computer itself the amount of air

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.149 
the computer itself the amount of air
pushes<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.760> reasonable<00:02:44.760> well<00:02:45.769> not<00:02:46.769> too<00:02:46.950> much

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
pushes is reasonable well not too much

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.940 
pushes is reasonable well not too much
but<00:02:48.079> for<00:02:49.079> this<00:02:49.470> noise<00:02:50.599> it<00:02:51.599> produces<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.379> seems

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
but for this noise it produces it seems

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.580 
but for this noise it produces it seems
to<00:02:53.069> be<00:02:53.189> a<00:02:53.220> pretty<00:02:53.459> good<00:02:53.640> fan<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.989> yes<00:02:55.260> let's

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
to be a pretty good fan so yes let's

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.449 
to be a pretty good fan so yes let's
move<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:57.769> performance<00:02:58.769> benchmark

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
move on to the performance benchmark

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.890 
move on to the performance benchmark
itself<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:02.909> is<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> simple<00:03:03.450> performance

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
itself so this is a simple performance

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.199 
itself so this is a simple performance
test<00:03:04.139> I've<00:03:04.379> done<00:03:04.620> by<00:03:04.950> simply<00:03:05.489> putting<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.879> fan

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
test I've done by simply putting the fan

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.670 
test I've done by simply putting the fan
as<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.629> push<00:03:07.139> fan<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.859> my<00:03:08.430> CPU<00:03:08.970> cooler<00:03:09.329> and<00:03:09.680> then

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
as a push fan on my CPU cooler and then
