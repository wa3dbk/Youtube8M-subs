I think that makes it sound really

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.970 
I think that makes it sound really
serious<00:03:17.750> because<00:03:17.930> what<00:03:18.469> it's<00:03:18.650> really<00:03:18.859> about

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
serious because what it's really about

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.860 
serious because what it's really about
is<00:03:19.219> just<00:03:19.609> having<00:03:20.209> fun<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:21.680> I'd<00:03:22.250> like<00:03:22.549> to<00:03:22.870> put

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
is just having fun but I'd like to put
