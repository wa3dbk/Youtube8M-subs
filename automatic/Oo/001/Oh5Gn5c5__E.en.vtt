like<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.800> you're<00:00:29.640> about<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> see<00:00:30.179> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
like that but you're about to see a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.580 
like that but you're about to see a
really<00:00:31.410> dirty<00:00:31.920> spawn<00:00:32.460> trap<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:33.120> sea<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> be

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
really dirty spawn trap at sea and be

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
really dirty spawn trap at sea and be
this<00:00:35.399> spawn<00:00:35.790> trap<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.270> probably<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.989> worst

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this spawn trap is probably the worst

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
this spawn trap is probably the worst
spawn<00:00:37.559> trap<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> game<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.399> my<00:00:38.550> opinion<00:00:38.579> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
spawn trap in the game in my opinion and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
spawn trap in the game in my opinion and
it's<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:40.829> control<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
it's if you can get control of it you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.220 
it's if you can get control of it you
can<00:00:41.730> hold<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.420> teammate<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.870> won't

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
can hold it you have teammate that won't

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.959 
can hold it you have teammate that won't
if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.710> teammates<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.129> won't<00:00:44.430> push<00:00:44.730> up

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
if you have teammates that won't push up

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.990 
if you have teammates that won't push up
all<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> way<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:46.559> take<00:00:47.430> control<00:00:47.789> away

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
all the way to like take control away

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.389 
all the way to like take control away
from<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.930> you're<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> good

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399

from it then you're gonna have a good
time<00:00:51.350> we<00:00:52.350> start<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.340> having<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.850> spawn<00:00:54.030> trap

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
time we start out having the spawn trap

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
time we start out having the spawn trap
we<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:55.110> them<00:00:55.260> locked<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> spawn<00:00:55.949> trap

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
we have them locked in the spawn trap

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.410 
we have them locked in the spawn trap
for<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:56.489> while<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.059> me<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.239> the

that a our team gets Pancho have to see

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
that a our team gets Pancho have to see
and<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.189> literally<00:01:14.460> cannot<00:01:14.909> yet<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> way

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and we literally cannot yet see the way

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.170 
and we literally cannot yet see the way
it<00:01:16.439> works<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.860> there's<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.189> two<00:01:17.460> spots<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
it works is there's like two spots to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.710 
it works is there's like two spots to
get<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.570> either

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
get out of see right there so you either

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
get out of see right there so you either
but<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.140> way<00:01:22.290> or<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.470> other<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
but one way or the other and one of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
but one way or the other and one of
those<00:01:23.430> ways<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.670> through<00:01:24.090> B<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.659> other<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:25.049> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
those ways is through B the other way is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.730 
those ways is through B the other way is
through<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.060> through<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.570> shop<00:01:28.110> area<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
through is to go through a shop area and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.310 
through is to go through a shop area and
then<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:28.890> towards<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:30.659> cut<00:01:30.869> offs<00:01:31.079> are

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
then go towards a the cut offs are

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.830 
then go towards a the cut offs are
really<00:01:31.619> easy<00:01:31.829> though<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.570> stand<00:01:33.750> behind

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
really easy though you can stand behind

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.149 
really easy though you can stand behind
that<00:01:34.110> hotdog<00:01:34.320> stand<00:01:34.680> right<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:34.979> which<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
that hotdog stand right there which is

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.620 
that hotdog stand right there which is
when<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> started<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.390> bit

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
when I started to do for a little bit

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.480 
when I started to do for a little bit
but<00:01:37.290> then<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.500> call<00:01:37.650> my<00:01:37.680> dog<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> move

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
but then I call my dog in and I move

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.140 
but then I call my dog in and I move
somewhere<00:01:38.700> else<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.270> once<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.259> push<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:41.150> past

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
somewhere else and once you push up past

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.870 
somewhere else and once you push up past
that<00:01:42.689> right<00:01:42.990> there<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> starts<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that right there is when it starts to

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.780 
that right there is when it starts to
get<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.000> little<00:01:45.030> sketchy<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.770> spawn<00:01:47.369> trap<00:01:47.579> kind

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
get a little sketchy the spawn trap kind

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.429 
get a little sketchy the spawn trap kind
of<00:01:47.880> starts<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.390> away<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.960> start<00:01:49.170> spawning

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
of starts to go away they start spawning

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
of starts to go away they start spawning
out<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:50.220> bit<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.640> makes<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.970> easier<00:01:51.240> for

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
out a little bit it makes it easier for

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.240 
out a little bit it makes it easier for
them<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.720> past<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.259> kills<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.100> kind

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
them to get past get kills and that kind

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.520 
them to get past get kills and that kind
of<00:01:53.280> thing<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.689> mean<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> whole<00:01:54.990> point<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
of thing but I mean the whole point of a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
of thing but I mean the whole point of a
spawn<00:01:55.770> trap<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.670> trap<00:01:57.000> them<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.329> their

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
spawn trap is to trap them in their

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.760 
spawn trap is to trap them in their
spawn<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.380> kill<00:01:58.560> them<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
spawn so you can just kill them and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.370 
spawn so you can just kill them and
that's<00:01:59.060> what<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.270> spawn<00:02:00.570> trap<00:02:00.810> enables<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
that's what this spawn trap enables you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.580 
that's what this spawn trap enables you
to<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:02.090> if<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.360> scoreboard<00:02:03.840> ever<00:02:03.960> comes<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.439> at

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to do if the scoreboard ever comes up at

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.700 
to do if the scoreboard ever comes up at
one<00:02:04.710> point<00:02:04.890> during<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.399> game<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:06.560> going<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
one point during this game it's going to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.790 
one point during this game it's going to
be

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
be

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.650 
be
I<00:02:08.830> mean<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.130> can<00:02:09.280> see<00:02:09.460> I'm<00:02:09.820> I<00:02:10.120> was<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:10.510> this

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
I mean you can see I'm I was in this

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.970 
I mean you can see I'm I was in this
game<00:02:10.810> with<00:02:10.930> Tyler<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.380> he<00:02:11.440> has<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> ton<00:02:11.950> of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
game with Tyler and he has a ton of

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.880 
game with Tyler and he has a ton of
kills<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.850> we<00:02:13.600> both<00:02:13.750> ended<00:02:14.110> up<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.650> at

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
kills like we both ended up with like at

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.430 
kills like we both ended up with like at
least<00:02:15.160> 30<00:02:15.370> kills<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:16.000> end<00:02:16.600> up<00:02:16.660> with<00:02:16.750> 25<00:02:17.140> deaths

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
least 30 kills I end up with 25 deaths

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.040 
least 30 kills I end up with 25 deaths
oh<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.400> imagine<00:02:19.300> I'll<00:02:19.450> end<00:02:19.600> up<00:02:19.660> cutting<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
oh and I imagine I'll end up cutting the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.480 
oh and I imagine I'll end up cutting the
video<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.320> little<00:02:20.650> shorter<00:02:21.010> than<00:02:21.220> what<00:02:21.370> it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
video a little shorter than what it

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.460 
video a little shorter than what it
actually<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.850> how<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.630> edit<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.110> out<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.290> little

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
actually is how to edit it out a little

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.610 
actually is how to edit it out a little
bit<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:24.490> kind<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> thing<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.390> it's<00:02:26.020> pretty

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
bit that kind of thing but it's pretty

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.680 
bit that kind of thing but it's pretty
much<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:26.890> spawn<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.610> dirty<00:02:28.000> spawn<00:02:28.420> trap

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
much this spawn it's a dirty spawn trap

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.270 
much this spawn it's a dirty spawn trap
probably<00:02:29.230> one<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.770> most<00:02:30.130> prevalent<00:02:31.000> not

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
probably one of the most prevalent not

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.650 
probably one of the most prevalent not
noticed<00:02:33.280> spawn<00:02:33.730> traps<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.210> game

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
noticed spawn traps in the game

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.420 
noticed spawn traps in the game
I<00:02:34.770> mean<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:38.080> easy<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.470> accidentally<00:02:39.070> do<00:02:39.280> as

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
I mean it's easy to accidentally do as

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.680 
I mean it's easy to accidentally do as
well<00:02:39.610> like<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:39.880> can<00:02:40.030> see<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.300> done<00:02:40.480> right

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
well like you can see it's done right

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.900 
well like you can see it's done right
here<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.830> little<00:02:42.070> pro<00:02:42.370> shop<00:02:42.580> right<00:02:42.850> there

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
here to that little pro shop right there

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.760 
here to that little pro shop right there
they<00:02:43.390> cannot<00:02:43.870> come<00:02:44.200> through<00:02:44.440> there<00:02:44.590> if<00:02:44.680> you

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
they cannot come through there if you

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.260 
they cannot come through there if you
sit<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.160> head<00:02:45.340> glitch<00:02:45.580> unless<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.150> get

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
sit on that head glitch unless you get

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.700 
sit on that head glitch unless you get
the<00:02:46.360> teammate<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> trap<00:02:47.050> shoe<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.440> corner

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
the teammate the trap shoe in the corner

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.280 
the teammate the trap shoe in the corner
like<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:47.920> happened<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.430> me<00:02:48.580> there<00:02:48.900> but<00:02:49.900> yeah

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
it's it's bad I'll just go ahead and let

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.210 
it's it's bad I'll just go ahead and let

trap play out and then I will also put

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.610 
trap play out and then I will also put

enjoyed this quick tutorial on the spawn

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.540 
enjoyed this quick tutorial on the spawn
trap<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:05.530> can<00:03:05.740> see<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.130> rest<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.460> the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.090 
trap and you can see the rest of the
video<00:03:06.790> I'll<00:03:07.090> go<00:03:07.450> ahead<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.690> cut<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.140> shut

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
video I'll go ahead and cut it and shut

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.430 
video I'll go ahead and cut it and shut
up<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:09.550> before<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.120> do<00:03:10.240> that<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.690> want<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.380> go

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
up but before I do that I want to go

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.610 
up but before I do that I want to go
ahead<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.680> say<00:03:12.750> I'm<00:03:13.750> going<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.560> a

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
ahead and say I'm going to have like a

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.130 
ahead and say I'm going to have like a
not<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> montage<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.480> guess<00:03:16.720> some<00:03:16.870> pretty

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
not a montage but I guess some pretty
