pereznieto<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.259> today<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:14.460> will<00:00:14.759> draw<00:00:15.120> an

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
pereznieto and today we will draw an

pereznieto and today we will draw an
angel<00:00:16.400> we<00:00:17.400> start<00:00:17.699> by<00:00:17.880> measuring<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.750> height

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
angel we start by measuring the height

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.520 
angel we start by measuring the height
and<00:00:19.439> width<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.460> figure

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.880 

I<00:00:24.030> will<00:00:25.030> also<00:00:25.210> measure<00:00:25.630> and<00:00:25.960> mark<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.440> size<00:00:26.740> of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
I will also measure and mark the size of

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.490 
I will also measure and mark the size of
the<00:00:27.010> head<00:00:27.220> in<00:00:27.580> this<00:00:28.300> way<00:00:28.540> we<00:00:28.810> make<00:00:28.990> sure<00:00:29.020> our

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
the head in this way we make sure our

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.650 
the head in this way we make sure our
drawing<00:00:30.130> will<00:00:30.340> have<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.730> right<00:00:30.970> proportions

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
drawing will have the right proportions

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
drawing will have the right proportions
I'm<00:00:32.320> using<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.830> photo<00:00:33.100> as<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.310> reference<00:00:34.680> now

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
I'm using the photo as a reference now

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.890 
I'm using the photo as a reference now
we<00:00:35.740> draw<00:00:36.220> freely<00:00:36.550> trying<00:00:37.060> to<00:00:37.270> use<00:00:37.480> loose

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
we draw freely trying to use loose

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.870 
we draw freely trying to use loose
movements<00:00:38.710> all<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:39.100> way<00:00:39.280> from<00:00:39.550> your<00:00:39.730> shoulder

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
movements all the way from your shoulder

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.160 
movements all the way from your shoulder
you

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.689 

let<00:00:50.170> goes<00:00:50.530> more<00:00:50.829> or<00:00:50.890> less<00:00:51.039> like<00:00:51.219> this

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.180 

and<00:00:55.329> that<00:00:55.690> will<00:00:55.870> make<00:00:56.109> sure<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.530> size<00:00:56.800> of<00:00:57.039> the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
and that will make sure the size of the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.799 
and that will make sure the size of the
feet<00:00:57.989> good<00:00:58.989> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.179> nature<00:01:01.539> will<00:01:01.659> be

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
feet good I think that nature will be

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.219 
feet good I think that nature will be
higher<00:01:02.050> yes

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.319 

the<00:01:06.009> more<00:01:06.219> measurements<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:06.939> have<00:01:07.119> the

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
the more measurements you have the

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.310 
the more measurements you have the
easier<00:01:07.719> it<00:01:07.840> becomes

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.110 

now<00:01:13.320> let's<00:01:13.650> draw<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.950> face

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.180 

the<00:01:18.120> eyes<00:01:18.300> go<00:01:18.630> about<00:01:18.870> that<00:01:19.170> half<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.920> height

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
the eyes go about that half the height

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.870 
the eyes go about that half the height
of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> head<00:01:21.860> for<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.980> sketch<00:01:23.220> I'm<00:01:23.400> using<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
of the head for the sketch I'm using a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.900 
of the head for the sketch I'm using a
mechanical<00:01:24.510> pencil<00:01:24.980> alto<00:01:25.980> for<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> shading

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
mechanical pencil alto for the shading

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.750 
mechanical pencil alto for the shading
I'll<00:01:27.030> use<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> sepia<00:01:28.080> pencil<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.830> this<00:01:29.370> case<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
I'll use a sepia pencil in this case the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.680 
I'll use a sepia pencil in this case the
CPX<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.390> dark<00:01:30.660> brown<00:01:30.960> dry<00:01:31.530> pasta<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.240> full<00:01:33.479> list

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
CPX a dark brown dry pasta the full list

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.600 
CPX a dark brown dry pasta the full list
of<00:01:33.840> materials<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> information<00:01:34.860> below

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
of materials is in the information below

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.750 
of materials is in the information below
the<00:01:35.880> video<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:37.110> saw<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.710> measured<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.490> size

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
the video as you saw I measured the size

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.800 
the video as you saw I measured the size
of<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.060> hand<00:01:39.300> as<00:01:39.479> well

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.360 

the<00:01:46.810> reason<00:01:47.140> I'm<00:01:47.290> using<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.740> mechanical

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
the reason I'm using the mechanical

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.940 
the reason I'm using the mechanical
pencil<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.120> not<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.930> sepia<00:01:50.320> pen<00:01:50.560> see<00:01:50.770> for

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
pencil and not the sepia pen see for

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.860 
pencil and not the sepia pen see for
this<00:01:51.070> sketch<00:01:51.370> it's<00:01:51.940> because<00:01:52.390> it's<00:01:52.600> more

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
this sketch it's because it's more

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.500 
this sketch it's because it's more
precise<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.740> clean<00:01:56.100> okay<00:01:57.100> at<00:01:57.340> this<00:01:58.150> point

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
precise and clean okay at this point

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.870 
precise and clean okay at this point
let's<00:01:58.870> erase<00:01:59.290> all<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.860> lines<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.310> we<00:02:00.640> don't

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
let's erase all the lines that we don't

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
let's erase all the lines that we don't
need<00:02:01.000> anymore

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.100 

and<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.700> need<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.060> correct<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.539> other<00:02:10.720> legs

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
and I need to correct the other legs

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.360 
and I need to correct the other legs
like<00:02:12.510> good<00:02:15.959> okay<00:02:16.959> great<00:02:17.260> now<00:02:17.739> let's<00:02:18.069> shade
