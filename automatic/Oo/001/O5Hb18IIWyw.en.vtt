00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
knife there are definitely some areas

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
knife there are definitely some areas
that<00:00:21.060> they<00:00:21.240> could<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.720> improved<00:00:22.230> upon<00:00:22.410> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
that they could have improved upon to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.609 
that they could have improved upon to
make<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.160> an<00:00:23.460> even<00:00:23.730> better<00:00:23.880> knife<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.619> we'll

material<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:46.350> call<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> bay<00:00:47.399> locks<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
material they call it the bay locks and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.350 
material they call it the bay locks and
I<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.559> exactly<00:00:50.309> what<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.700> means<00:00:50.940> but

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
I don't know exactly what that means but

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
I don't know exactly what that means but
essentially<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> feels<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> shitty

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
essentially it feels like a shitty

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.260 
essentially it feels like a shitty
plastic<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:55.680> you'd<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.969> paid<00:00:57.149> over

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
plastic and it's you'd think I paid over

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.060 
plastic and it's you'd think I paid over
$100<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.079> knife<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.620> you'd<00:00:58.739> think

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
$100 for this knife and you'd think

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.380 
$100 for this knife and you'd think
you'd<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.489> something<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.969> feels<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> little

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you'd get something that feels a little

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.840 
you'd get something that feels a little
better<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.530> sounds<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.219> feels<00:01:02.489> sort

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
better but it just sounds and feels sort

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.840 
better but it just sounds and feels sort
of<00:01:02.969> cheap<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.949> handle<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.729> also

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
of cheap now on the handle and they also

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
of cheap now on the handle and they also
have<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.360> little<00:01:06.510> grooves<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.650> they

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
have these little grooves but they

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.070 
have these little grooves but they
really<00:01:08.280> don't<00:01:08.460> grip<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.900> no

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
really don't grip and there is no

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.980 
really don't grip and there is no
jimping<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.610> thumb<00:01:11.880> ramp<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:12.930> do

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
jimping on the thumb ramp but they do

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.660 
jimping on the thumb ramp but they do
ramp<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.799> bit<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> mean<00:01:14.430> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
ramp it up a little bit so I mean it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
ramp it up a little bit so I mean it
feels<00:01:14.850> good<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.540> it'd<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.689> nice<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:15.960> there's<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
feels good but it'd be nice if there's a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.149 
feels good but it'd be nice if there's a
bit<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> jimping<00:01:16.830> there

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
bit of jimping there

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
bit of jimping there
um<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.530> liners<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.009> drilled<00:01:20.580> out<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
um the liners are drilled out and so it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.140 
um the liners are drilled out and so it
helps<00:01:22.860> reduce<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.280> weight<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.759> really

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
helps reduce the weight it is a really

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.350 
helps reduce the weight it is a really
light<00:01:24.299> knife<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.580> pocket<00:01:26.939> clip<00:01:27.060> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
light knife the the pocket clip is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539 
light knife the the pocket clip is
reversible<00:01:27.990> tip<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.560> only<00:01:28.770> about<00:01:29.009> left<00:01:29.400> or

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
reversible tip up only about left or

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
reversible tip up only about left or
right<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> selling

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
right and now one of the selling

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.100 
right and now one of the selling
features<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.579> knife<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.869> makes<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
features of this knife that makes it so

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
features of this knife that makes it so
cool<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.650> assisted<00:01:35.100> opening<00:01:35.220> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
cool is the assisted opening so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.850 
cool is the assisted opening so
essentially<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.600> means<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.409> start

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
essentially what that means is you start

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
essentially what that means is you start
that<00:01:38.640> by<00:01:38.820> pushing<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> thumb<00:01:39.509> stud<00:01:39.750> after

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that by pushing on the thumb stud after

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
that by pushing on the thumb stud after
about<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.189> blade<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.490> come<00:01:41.640> out

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
about you know the blade will come out

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.550 
about you know the blade will come out
almost<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.210> inch<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.899> then<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.229> spring

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
almost an inch or so and then a spring

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770 
almost an inch or so and then a spring
the<00:01:43.950> sistex<00:01:44.369> over<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.909> opens<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> blade<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the sistex over and opens the blade the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
the sistex over and opens the blade the
rest<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> way<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.250> just

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
rest of the way so that's just

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.300 
rest of the way so that's just
inherently<00:01:48.450> cool<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.320> sounds<00:01:49.829> cool<00:01:50.009> feels

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
inherently cool it sounds cool feels

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.899 
inherently cool it sounds cool feels
cool<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.670> lightning<00:01:51.090> fast<00:01:51.329> um<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
cool it's lightning fast um it has this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
cool it's lightning fast um it has this
little<00:01:54.149> lock<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> spine<00:01:55.049> which<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.860> kind

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
little lock on the spine which is kind

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.620 
little lock on the spine which is kind
of<00:01:56.130> pointless<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.790> mean<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> blades<00:01:57.329> closed

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
of pointless I mean if the blades closed

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.929 
of pointless I mean if the blades closed
you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.899> lock<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> can't

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
you can lock it and you know you can't

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
you can lock it and you know you can't
open<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> blade<00:02:00.390> same<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.170> when<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> blades

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
open the blade same with when the blades

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.130 
open the blade same with when the blades
open<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.430> lock<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.030> now<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.930> lot

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
open you can lock it and now the lot

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.980 
open you can lock it and now the lot
that<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.649> can't<00:02:04.920> release<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.549> blade<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that you can't release the blade so you

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
that you can't release the blade so you
know<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:07.799> I've<00:02:08.250> never<00:02:08.610> used<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.060> but

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
know it's there I've never used it but

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660 
know it's there I've never used it but
it<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.080> there<00:02:10.289> now<00:02:10.890> also<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> handle

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it is there now also on the handle

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.580 
it is there now also on the handle
scales<00:02:11.940> they<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.480> these<00:02:12.629> little

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
scales they have these little

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.110 
scales they have these little
although<00:02:13.860> portions<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.489> your<00:02:14.610> fingers<00:02:14.940> which

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
although portions for your fingers which

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.240 
although portions for your fingers which
do<00:02:15.300> work<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.720> mean<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:15.989> your<00:02:16.110> one-handed<00:02:16.830> open

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
do work I mean if your one-handed open

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.009 
do work I mean if your one-handed open
your<00:02:17.370> fingers<00:02:17.519> do<00:02:17.879> fall<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.660> there<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:18.959> you

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
your fingers do fall in there and you

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.410 
your fingers do fall in there and you
open<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.349> one<00:02:19.470> hand<00:02:19.879> so<00:02:20.879> those<00:02:21.120> those<00:02:21.360> are

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
open it one hand so those those are

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.210 
open it one hand so those those are
those<00:02:21.810> kind<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.110> work<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.830> said<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
those kind of work but like I said the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.790 
those kind of work but like I said the
scales<00:02:23.519> just<00:02:23.819> feel<00:02:24.470> shitty<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.800> chintzy<00:02:26.220> so

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
scales just feel shitty and chintzy so

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.930 
scales just feel shitty and chintzy so
yeah<00:02:28.800> I've<00:02:29.129> had<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.610> said<00:02:29.790> I've<00:02:29.910> been

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
yeah I've had like I said I've been

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.970 
yeah I've had like I said I've been
using<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.599> almost<00:02:30.930> daily<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.379> over<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.739> year

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
using it almost daily for over a year

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.729 
using it almost daily for over a year
and<00:02:32.129> because<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.569> got<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.260> little

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
and because of that I have got a little

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.990 
and because of that I have got a little
bit<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.950> blade<00:02:35.160> plateau<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.760> hear

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
bit of blade plateau if you can hear

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.610 
bit of blade plateau if you can hear
that

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.650 
that
probably<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.769> but<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.000> down<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.450> left

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
probably not but up and down and left

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.600 
probably not but up and down and left
and<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:39.900> literally<00:02:40.560> probably<00:02:41.430> a

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and right literally probably a

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.400 
and right literally probably a
microscopic<00:02:42.480> measurement<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.989> blade<00:02:43.200> play

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
microscopic measurement of blade play

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
microscopic measurement of blade play
but<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.040> there<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.680> yeah<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.709> love<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.250> knife

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
but it is there so yeah I love the knife

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.970 
but it is there so yeah I love the knife
it's<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.849> great<00:02:47.880> knife<00:02:48.590> benchmade<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.769> just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
it's a great knife benchmade it just

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.630 
it's a great knife benchmade it just
makes<00:02:50.370> quality<00:02:50.640> knives<00:02:51.140> but<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.680> some

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
makes quality knives but you know some

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.860 
makes quality knives but you know some
jumping<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> thumb<00:02:54.390> ramp<00:02:54.599> would<00:02:54.780> have

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
jumping on the thumb ramp would have

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.410 
jumping on the thumb ramp would have
been<00:02:54.959> nice<00:02:55.140> handle<00:02:55.890> scales<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.760> know

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
been nice handle scales that you know

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.600 
been nice handle scales that you know
even<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.780> g10<00:02:58.200> would<00:02:58.379> have<00:02:58.500> been<00:02:58.620> great<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.160> you

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
even a g10 would have been great but you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.759 
even a g10 would have been great but you
know<00:02:59.700> this<00:02:59.910> vay<00:03:00.120> locks<00:03:00.450> material<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.379> super

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
know this vay locks material it is super

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.860 
know this vay locks material it is super
lightweight<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:03.060> just<00:03:03.269> doesn't<00:03:03.629> feel

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
lightweight but it just doesn't feel

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.949 
lightweight but it just doesn't feel
very<00:03:03.930> nice<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:05.090> yeah<00:03:06.090> thanks<00:03:06.810> for<00:03:06.870> watching
