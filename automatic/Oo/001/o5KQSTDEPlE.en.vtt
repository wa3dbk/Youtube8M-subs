okay hey guys in this video I'm gonna
teach<00:00:05.990> you<00:00:06.140> how<00:00:06.200> to<00:00:06.230> axle<00:00:06.649> stall<00:00:06.859> cycle<00:00:07.700> stalls

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
teach you how to axle stall cycle stalls

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.250 
teach you how to axle stall cycle stalls
usually<00:00:08.269> the<00:00:08.330> second<00:00:08.720> trick<00:00:08.840> that<00:00:09.019> you<00:00:09.080> learn

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
usually the second trick that you learn

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.750 
usually the second trick that you learn
after<00:00:09.559> you<00:00:09.769> learn<00:00:09.889> how<00:00:10.040> to<00:00:10.070> opt-in<00:00:10.460> if<00:00:10.670> you

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
after you learn how to opt-in if you

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.280 
after you learn how to opt-in if you
don't<00:00:10.940> know<00:00:11.030> how<00:00:11.120> to<00:00:11.240> drop<00:00:11.420> in<00:00:11.629> go<00:00:12.139> to<00:00:12.169> my

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
don't know how to drop in go to my

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.869 
don't know how to drop in go to my
channel<00:00:12.559> and<00:00:12.860> I<00:00:13.219> have<00:00:13.309> a<00:00:13.370> video<00:00:13.610> on<00:00:13.639> how<00:00:13.730> to

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
channel and I have a video on how to

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.459 
channel and I have a video on how to
show<00:00:14.419> you<00:00:14.480> how<00:00:14.629> to<00:00:14.660> drop<00:00:14.929> in

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
show you how to drop in

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.140 
show you how to drop in
so<00:00:16.160> after<00:00:16.370> you've<00:00:16.460> learning<00:00:16.640> to<00:00:16.760> drop<00:00:16.910> in

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
so after you've learning to drop in

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.510 
so after you've learning to drop in
you'll<00:00:17.720> probably<00:00:18.050> learn<00:00:18.350> axle<00:00:18.830> stall<00:00:19.039> or<00:00:19.310> rock

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
you'll probably learn axle stall or rock

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.880 
you'll probably learn axle stall or rock
to<00:00:19.670> fakie<00:00:19.870> axle<00:00:20.870> stall<00:00:21.020> is<00:00:21.110> probably<00:00:21.410> easier

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
to fakie axle stall is probably easier

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.010 
to fakie axle stall is probably easier
trick<00:00:22.190> to<00:00:22.340> learn<00:00:22.490> but<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.330> rock<00:00:23.510> to<00:00:23.630> fakie<00:00:23.810> is

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
trick to learn but the rock to fakie is

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.450 
trick to learn but the rock to fakie is
a<00:00:24.050> better<00:00:24.260> trick<00:00:24.530> to<00:00:24.620> learn<00:00:24.740> because<00:00:25.070> once<00:00:25.310> you

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
a better trick to learn because once you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
a better trick to learn because once you
have<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:25.670> rock<00:00:25.820> to<00:00:25.940> fakie

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
have the rock to fakie

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.020 
have the rock to fakie
you<00:00:26.780> can<00:00:26.930> almost<00:00:27.050> immediately<00:00:27.380> tail<00:00:27.890> stall<00:00:28.160> if

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
you can almost immediately tail stall if

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.880 
you can almost immediately tail stall if
you<00:00:29.150> have<00:00:29.240> no<00:00:29.900> clue<00:00:30.170> what<00:00:30.200> though<00:00:30.380> I<00:00:30.410> just<00:00:30.500> said

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
you have no clue what though I just said

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
you have no clue what though I just said
that's<00:00:31.430> okay<00:00:33.010> it'll<00:00:34.010> all<00:00:34.219> make<00:00:34.250> sense<00:00:34.430> later

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
that's okay it'll all make sense later

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.069 
that's okay it'll all make sense later
my<00:00:35.510> later<00:00:35.749> videos<00:00:36.910> so<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.629> that<00:00:38.719> an<00:00:38.809> axle

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
my later videos so this is that an axle

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.310 
my later videos so this is that an axle
saw<00:00:39.940> some<00:00:40.940> useful<00:00:41.600> things<00:00:41.629> on<00:00:42.019> how<00:00:42.109> to<00:00:42.170> access

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
saw some useful things on how to access

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.509 
saw some useful things on how to access
all<00:00:42.649> I<00:00:42.800> don't<00:00:42.949> know<00:00:43.010> if<00:00:43.100> you<00:00:43.159> guys<00:00:43.280> already

all I don't know if you guys already
know<00:00:43.670> what<00:00:43.789> an<00:00:43.879> access<00:00:44.089> all<00:00:44.269> yet<00:00:44.420> but<00:00:44.629> I'll

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
know what an access all yet but I'll

can<00:01:05.390> see<00:01:05.449> most<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.590> axle<00:01:06.950> stall<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.430> just

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
can see most of the axle stall is just

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.819 
can see most of the axle stall is just
getting<00:01:08.000> your<00:01:08.119> wheels<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.219> coping<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.770> to

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
getting your wheels on the coping so to

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.260 
getting your wheels on the coping so to
do<00:01:16.159> that<00:01:16.189> some<00:01:16.790> trick<00:01:17.240> some<00:01:17.659> tips<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.049> can<00:01:18.229> use

do that some trick some tips you can use

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.600 
do that some trick some tips you can use
to<00:01:20.270> help<00:01:20.689> you<00:01:20.840> learn<00:01:20.990> that<00:01:21.110> faster<00:01:21.619> is<00:01:22.430> by

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
to help you learn that faster is by

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.910 
to help you learn that faster is by
coming<00:01:22.850> up<00:01:22.969> into<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.270> ramp<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:24.350> practicing

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
coming up into the ramp and practicing

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.749 
coming up into the ramp and practicing
turn<00:01:25.189> like<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:27.969> what<00:01:28.969> you<00:01:29.030> can<00:01:29.149> also<00:01:29.329> do<00:01:30.759> you

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
turn like this what you can also do you

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:43.660 
turn like this what you can also do you
could<00:01:31.909> also<00:01:35.049> first<00:01:36.100> by<00:01:37.100> learning<00:01:42.670> so

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
could also first by learning so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.190 
could also first by learning so
basically<00:01:44.210> learn<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.450> kick<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:44.840> first<00:01:50.109> and<00:01:51.109> then

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
basically learn a kick to first and then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.830 
basically learn a kick to first and then
practicing<00:01:51.619> turning<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.130> 90<00:01:52.520> degrees<00:01:52.840> until

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
practicing turning in 90 degrees until

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.179 
practicing turning in 90 degrees until
your<00:01:53.990> boards<00:01:54.259> just<00:01:54.500> like<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.859> on<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
your boards just like that on the

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.029 
your boards just like that on the
halfpipe<00:01:55.990> stalling<00:01:56.990> for<00:01:57.289> as<00:01:57.380> long<00:01:57.530> as<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.799> can

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
halfpipe stalling for as long as you can

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.399 
halfpipe stalling for as long as you can
then<00:01:58.909> coming<00:01:59.240> back<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.570> again<00:01:59.749> it's<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.109> same

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
then coming back in again it's the same

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.630 
then coming back in again it's the same
motion<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:00.859> you<00:02:01.039> use<00:02:01.189> when<00:02:01.340> you're<00:02:01.460> actually

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
motion that you use when you're actually

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:18.990 
motion that you use when you're actually
removing<00:02:03.009> so<00:02:04.009> here<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.579> again<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:18.260> here's

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
removing so here it is again so here's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.729 
removing so here it is again so here's
so<00:02:20.000> here's<00:02:20.030> what<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.690> really<00:02:20.989> happening<00:02:21.170> when

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
so here's what is really happening when

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.830 
so here's what is really happening when
you<00:02:21.890> learn<00:02:22.010> how<00:02:22.159> to<00:02:22.190> axle<00:02:22.519> stall<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.540> come

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
you learn how to axle stall so you come

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.740 
you learn how to axle stall so you come
up<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.379> you<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.920> push<00:02:25.190> down<00:02:25.459> on<00:02:25.489> your<00:02:25.730> tail<00:02:26.000> to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
up and you you push down on your tail to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.210 
up and you you push down on your tail to
have<00:02:26.900> your<00:02:27.050> board<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.409> make<00:02:27.620> your<00:02:27.739> board<00:02:27.950> lift

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
have your board to make your board lift

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.220 
have your board to make your board lift
and<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.269> keep<00:02:29.480> pushing<00:02:29.659> on<00:02:29.870> your<00:02:29.959> tail<00:02:30.110> then

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and you keep pushing on your tail then

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.890 
and you keep pushing on your tail then
when<00:02:30.319> your<00:02:30.440> trucks<00:02:30.709> are<00:02:30.890> about<00:02:31.159> right<00:02:31.459> there

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
when your trucks are about right there

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.509 
when your trucks are about right there
when<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:32.930> start<00:02:33.319> or<00:02:33.560> maybe<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.040> right<00:02:34.220> there

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
when you start or maybe like right there

front<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.920> your<00:02:46.010> foot<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.760> lock<00:02:46.970> into

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
front of your foot so you lock into

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.080 
front of your foot so you lock into
position<00:02:47.920> once<00:02:48.920> you're<00:02:49.099> there<00:02:49.129> it's<00:02:49.819> pretty

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
position once you're there it's pretty

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.920 
position once you're there it's pretty
easy<00:02:50.409> you<00:02:51.409> just<00:02:51.440> lift<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:53.120> turn<00:02:53.450> back<00:02:53.480> in

easy you just lift and then turn back in

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.930 
easy you just lift and then turn back in
so<00:02:54.920> it's<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.099> same<00:02:55.340> thing<00:02:55.610> when<00:02:55.849> you're

so it's the same thing when you're
coming<00:02:56.209> back<00:02:56.299> in<00:02:56.360> it's<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.140> same<00:02:57.349> thing<00:02:57.560> as

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
coming back in it's the same thing as

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.770 
coming back in it's the same thing as
dropping<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:59.180> instead<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.510> going<00:02:59.750> like

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
dropping in but instead of going like

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.570 
dropping in but instead of going like
that<00:02:59.930> dropping<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:00.680> it's<00:03:00.920> wonderful<00:03:01.430> ooh<00:03:01.459> in

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.690 
that dropping in it's wonderful ooh in
motion<00:03:01.939> so<00:03:02.090> it's<00:03:02.269> like<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.310> that's<00:03:04.580> how

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
motion so it's like that so that's how

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.690 
motion so it's like that so that's how

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.580 
how long you have to wait before you can
turn<00:03:28.340> like<00:03:28.760> what<00:03:28.909> I<00:03:28.970> mean<00:03:29.180> by<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.689> if

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
turn like what I mean by that is if

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.830 
turn like what I mean by that is if
you're<00:03:30.799> turning<00:03:31.099> but<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:31.579> turn<00:03:31.819> too<00:03:32.000> late<00:03:32.209> and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
you're turning but you turn too late and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.929 
you're turning but you turn too late and
you<00:03:33.049> end<00:03:33.200> up<00:03:33.230> like<00:03:33.409> that<00:03:33.620> then<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.700> means

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
you end up like that then that means

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.250 
you end up like that then that means
that<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.269> want<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.569> turn<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.989> little<00:03:36.110> bit

earlier so that you get there if you're

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.119
