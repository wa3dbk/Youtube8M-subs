South<00:02:29.140> Korea<00:02:29.440> they'll<00:02:30.340> be<00:02:30.400> looking<00:02:30.730> at<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
South Korea they'll be looking at the

cockpit voice recording the black box
which<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.610> sometimes<00:02:37.150> as<00:02:38.019> it's<00:02:38.620> called<00:02:38.860> which

which is sometimes as it's called which

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.940 
which is sometimes as it's called which
is<00:02:39.820> actually<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.570> flight<00:02:40.840> data<00:02:41.170> recorder

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
is actually the flight data recorder

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.420 
is actually the flight data recorder
which<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:43.500> records<00:02:44.500> all<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.190> flight

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
which just records all the the flight

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.729 
which just records all the the flight
speed<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.150> other<00:02:46.269> conditions<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:47.050> flight<00:02:47.260> so

speed and other conditions of flight so

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.020 
speed and other conditions of flight so
all<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.010> those<00:02:48.220> things<00:02:48.280> will<00:02:48.670> have<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.880> be

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
all of those things will have to be

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.720 
all of those things will have to be
looked<00:02:49.390> at<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.440> face<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:51.070> there's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
looked at but on the face of it there's

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.660 
looked at but on the face of it there's
certainly<00:02:52.150> no<00:02:52.500> obvious<00:02:53.500> reason<00:02:54.900> weather-wise

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
certainly no obvious reason weather-wise

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.229 
certainly no obvious reason weather-wise
mechanically<00:02:57.670> or<00:02:58.150> otherwise<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.530> would

mechanically or otherwise that would

mechanically or otherwise that would
come<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.269> mind<00:03:01.630> immediately<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:04.200> give<00:03:05.200> you

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
come to mind immediately to to give you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.370 
come to mind immediately to to give you
a<00:03:05.350> cause<00:03:05.709> for<00:03:06.250> why<00:03:06.910> this<00:03:07.420> plane<00:03:07.870> apparently

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
a cause for why this plane apparently

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.729 
a cause for why this plane apparently
struck<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.579> runway<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.329> short<00:03:10.660> of<00:03:10.810> where<00:03:11.620> it

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
struck the runway just short of where it

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.509 
struck the runway just short of where it
should<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:11.980> been<00:03:12.450> hitting<00:03:13.450> tail<00:03:13.989> first

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
should have been hitting tail first

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.890 
should have been hitting tail first
knocking<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.640> tail<00:03:15.850> off<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.360> aircraft

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
knocking the tail off of the aircraft

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.020 
knocking the tail off of the aircraft
all<00:03:17.829> right<00:03:18.010> for<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.220> moment<00:03:18.250> Rob<00:03:18.610> thanks<00:03:18.910> for

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
all right for the moment Rob thanks for

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.759 
all right for the moment Rob thanks for
that<00:03:19.150> Rob<00:03:19.360> Reynolds<00:03:19.720> lifeless<00:03:20.140> in<00:03:20.380> San

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
that Rob Reynolds lifeless in San
