stuff<00:01:07.700> lots<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.909> power<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.299> control<00:01:09.770> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
stuff lots of power to control and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.649 
stuff lots of power to control and
obviously<00:01:11.130> without<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> understeer<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
obviously without with the understeer it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
obviously without with the understeer it
makes<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.170> difficult<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.829> slow

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
makes it really difficult in slow

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.510 
makes it really difficult in slow

the<00:01:32.110> road<00:01:32.260> American<00:01:32.650> course<00:01:32.860> always<00:01:33.040> a

the road American course always a

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.620 
the road American course always a
challenging<00:01:33.640> corner<00:01:33.940> you<00:01:34.060> will<00:01:34.090> maintain<00:01:34.390> a

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
challenging corner you will maintain a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.540 
challenging corner you will maintain a
lot<00:01:34.900> of<00:01:35.020> speak<00:01:35.260> to<00:01:35.470> them<00:01:35.650> it's<00:01:35.920> really<00:01:36.430> nice

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
lot of speak to them it's really nice

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.640 
lot of speak to them it's really nice
when<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.910> opens<00:01:37.150> up<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.510> exit<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:38.290> corner

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
when it opens up on the exit this corner

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.800 
when it opens up on the exit this corner
would<00:01:38.770> probably<00:01:39.130> normally<00:01:39.520> be<00:01:39.700> flat<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.360> was

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
would probably normally be flat I was

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.000 
would probably normally be flat I was
lifting<00:01:41.580> before<00:01:42.580> I<00:01:42.610> felt<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.590> grip<00:01:44.590> was<00:01:44.770> there

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
lifting before I felt the grip was there

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.560 
lifting before I felt the grip was there
and<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.250> felt<00:01:45.490> there<00:01:45.640> was<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.760> lot<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.000> understeer

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
and I felt there was a lot of understeer

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.510 
and I felt there was a lot of understeer
just<00:01:46.900> wouldn't<00:01:47.200> make<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.590> full<00:01:47.830> speed<00:01:47.979> nearly

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
just wouldn't make it full speed nearly

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.440 
just wouldn't make it full speed nearly

working with you under steer to get me

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.190 
working with you under steer to get me
around<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.600> corner<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.140> up<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.350> hill<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
around that corner and up the hill so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.680 
around that corner and up the hill so
the<00:02:14.790> battling<00:02:15.790> for<00:02:15.970> position<00:02:16.120> there<00:02:16.600> is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
the battling for position there is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.330 
the battling for position there is
awesome<00:02:16.930> e<00:02:16.989> track<00:02:17.170> position<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> leaders<00:02:18.160> are

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
awesome e track position the leaders are

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.100 
awesome e track position the leaders are
a<00:02:18.370> long<00:02:18.520> way<00:02:18.670> down<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.060> track<00:02:19.360> there<00:02:19.780> now<00:02:19.930> but

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
a long way down the track there now but

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.059 
a long way down the track there now but
we've<00:02:20.260> got<00:02:20.440> power

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
we've got power

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.649 
we've got power
so<00:02:22.430> using<00:02:22.939> all<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.180> power<00:02:23.390> down<00:02:23.599> the
