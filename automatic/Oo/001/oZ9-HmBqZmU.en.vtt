auto<00:00:37.860> four<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.309> talking<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:38.850> there

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
auto four we're talking about here there

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
auto four we're talking about here there
were<00:00:39.480> actually<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> ton<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> issues<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:40.860> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
were actually a ton of issues and it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.709 
were actually a ton of issues and it
didn't<00:00:41.370> run<00:00:41.489> well<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.850> all<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.239> actually

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
didn't run well at all and that actually

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
didn't run well at all and that actually
seems<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.530> trend<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.950> recent<00:00:44.010> years

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
seems to be the trend in recent years

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
seems to be the trend in recent years
that<00:00:44.760> when<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> game<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.390> ported<00:00:45.930> over<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.289> PC<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that when a game is ported over to PC it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.260 
that when a game is ported over to PC it
doesn't<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.489> well<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.700> first<00:00:47.789> well

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
doesn't do so well at first well

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.250 
doesn't do so well at first well
actually<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:48.750> want<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> say<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
actually I don't want to say it's a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.690 
actually I don't want to say it's a
trend<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.980> let's<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.250> look<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> few

cost upward of two thousand dollars and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.780 
cost upward of two thousand dollars and
they<00:01:19.439> still<00:01:19.680> were<00:01:19.830> not<00:01:19.860> able<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.340> run<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
they still were not able to run this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.999 
they still were not able to run this
game<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.390> 60<00:01:21.689> frames<00:01:21.720> per<00:01:22.049> second<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
game at 60 frames per second so the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
game at 60 frames per second so the
reason<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.430> used<00:01:23.610> those<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:24.000> examples<00:01:24.450> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
reason that I used those two examples is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
reason that I used those two examples is
because<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.530> grand<00:01:25.770> theft<00:01:25.860> auto<00:01:26.070> four

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
one thing that I have to address here is

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.389 
one thing that I have to address here is
the<00:01:46.079> fact<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:47.009> always<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the fact that this is not always the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.240 
the fact that this is not always the
case<00:01:47.549> rockstar<00:01:48.540> games<00:01:48.570> made<00:01:49.020> Max<00:01:49.290> Payne<00:01:49.590> 3<00:01:49.649> for

case rockstar games made Max Payne 3 for

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.950 
case rockstar games made Max Payne 3 for
the<00:01:50.310> PC<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.210> was<00:01:51.299> flawless<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the PC and that one was flawless you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.719 
the PC and that one was flawless you
know<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.350> were<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:52.710> no<00:01:52.890> issues<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
know there were really no issues and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.010 
know there were really no issues and
okay<00:01:54.090> maybe<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.390> shouldn't<00:01:54.720> use<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.869> word

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
okay maybe I shouldn't use the word

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.050 
okay maybe I shouldn't use the word
flawless<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.340> ran<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:56.909> well

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
flawless but it actually ran really well

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
flawless but it actually ran really well
and<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.570> were<00:01:57.689> no<00:01:57.719> extreme<00:01:58.259> issues<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.770> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and there were no extreme issues as I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.039 
and there were no extreme issues as I
said<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:00.240> isn't<00:02:00.630> always<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> case

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
said so this isn't always the case

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.899 
said so this isn't always the case
there's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.920> chance<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.520> know<00:02:02.610> grand
