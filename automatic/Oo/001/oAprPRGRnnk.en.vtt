there's<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> feels<00:00:51.690> makes<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
there's the way that it feels makes it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
there's the way that it feels makes it
feel<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.489> worth<00:00:53.670> absolutely<00:00:54.480> every

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
feel like it's worth absolutely every

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.680 
feel like it's worth absolutely every
cent<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.770> has<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> fairly<00:00:56.640> average<00:00:56.940> flex<00:00:57.480> rating

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
cent it has a fairly average flex rating

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.869 
cent it has a fairly average flex rating
about<00:00:57.930> five<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.829> seems<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.640> more

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
about five but it seems to be a lot more

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.420 
about five but it seems to be a lot more
agile<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.600> lot<00:01:00.840> quicker<00:01:01.230> than<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.920> board<00:01:02.250> with

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
agile a lot quicker than a board with

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.880 
agile a lot quicker than a board with
the<00:01:02.520> same<00:01:02.730> flex<00:01:03.120> patterns<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> Flying<00:01:04.799> V

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the same flex patterns now the Flying V

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
the same flex patterns now the Flying V
profile<00:01:05.549> shape<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> great<00:01:06.240> combination<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
profile shape is a great combination of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
profile shape is a great combination of
course<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.470> both<00:01:07.710> camber<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.760> reverse<00:01:09.180> camber

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
course of both camber and reverse camber

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.359 
course of both camber and reverse camber
there's<00:01:10.290> reverse<00:01:10.650> camber<00:01:10.920> between<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.280> feet

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
there's reverse camber between the feet

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.130 
there's reverse camber between the feet
and<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.880> camber<00:01:12.240> underneath<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> nose<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and then camber underneath the nose and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.050 
and then camber underneath the nose and
the<00:01:13.200> tail<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:14.880> about

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the tail but what I really like about

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.770 
the tail but what I really like about
the<00:01:15.390> board

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the board

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.690 
the board
besides<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.470> well<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.770> rides<00:01:16.950> every

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
besides how well it rides every

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.630 
besides how well it rides every
everywhere<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.369> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
everywhere is that it is really like you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.980 
everywhere is that it is really like you
know<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.880> pick<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.600> definitely

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
know you pick it up you can definitely

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
know you pick it up you can definitely
tell<00:01:22.200> no<00:01:22.799> there's<00:01:23.100> an<00:01:23.189> ultra<00:01:23.490> fly<00:01:23.700> core

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
tell no there's an ultra fly core

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
tell no there's an ultra fly core
there's<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> mystery<00:01:25.200> glass<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:26.009> even

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
there's a mystery glass I don't even

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.499 
there's a mystery glass I don't even
know<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.549> means<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.270> really

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
know what that means I know it's really

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.780 
know what that means I know it's really
light<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.979> responsive<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
light and it's really responsive and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
light and it's really responsive and
then<00:01:30.150> there's<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> carbon<00:01:30.630> eye<00:01:30.900> beam<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.650> runs

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
then there's a carbon eye beam that runs

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950 
then there's a carbon eye beam that runs
down<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> center<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> deck<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.390> course

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
down the center of the deck of course

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
down the center of the deck of course
there's<00:01:34.140> gonna<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.320> frostbite<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.280> I

there's gonna be frostbite I just I
really<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.729> frostbite<00:01:36.270> edges<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.810> well

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
really like frostbite edges because well
