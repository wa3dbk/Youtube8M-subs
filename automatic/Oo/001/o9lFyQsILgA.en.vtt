00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello friends with you and you are not 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.670
 channel just technology and decided here 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.790
 2 wanted to record a video blog a little 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.100
 talk about shooting and sound when 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.109
 video filming is what I wanted to talk about 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.600
 recently when I shot a couple 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.090
 corporate events 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 I connected my voice recorder here this one 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.369
 when which I now record the sound to 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.590
 mixer him the first video like 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.719
 recorded without problems on the second 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.690
 it turned out cant what were the costs 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.160
 level and nothing sensible from me and sound 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.020
 did not work had to take the sound out 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.610
 camera's built-in microphones and the second 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.980
 microphone and cameras are recorded as 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.489
 the saying is not so good 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 badly 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.739
 This hour, he will include for comparison 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.180
 now and records on the recorder yes 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.699
 I'm switching to the camera sound now 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.460
 listen to the sound of the camera recording 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.670
 from time two three 4 5 times two three 4 5 came out 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.299
 Bunny take a walk on the difference feel yes 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.970
 and I thought to make sure I 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.130
 decided to record the sound heard by the remote on 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 Horse be another device that I 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.270
 thought thought take a laptop 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.430
 the cocktail is cumbersome to carry everything 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.780
 I decided to think about connecting the phone 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.670
 the phone also thought no option because 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 I use my phone as the second 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.009
 the camera that he shoots 1080p suits 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.880
 for the second camera 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:36.119
 and sometimes replace anything Well 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.790
 why i say and because connect 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.259
 all the same phone instead of not 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.680
 that he recorded the sound did not think so 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.670
 that the sound path and the phone as if not 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.220
 very so cool 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.750
 giving for this is not intended here 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.600
 I got the idea to take you 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.969
 I have a sound card here sb creative 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.040
 1095 yusbishnogo sound card but lies 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.920
 I do n't think so and try 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.420
 connect to the phone and already at the mixer 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.570
 connect the remote to this sound card 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.380
 let's look for an application than change it 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.210
 write down 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.650
 I found yusb audio recorder about the program 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.060
 lina 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.700
 there was a test version I downloaded it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.390
 checked the sound writes perfect now i 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.800
 I'll show you all this in the process and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.840
 let me show you all the same 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.070
 this came out 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.720
 while preparing to write the following 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.860
 estimates we want to show how it's all 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.890
 passes shot at 650d 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.930
 on canon with chinese light on 160 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.600
 diodes redone from the usual finger 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.040
 18 batteries, which is 50 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.130
 two sets of them for parallel and 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.840
 the second set was not that I was here at home 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.990
 this color burns for about three hours 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.700
 which is perfectly acceptable for me 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:02.430
 magic lantern and wanted to show you how i am 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.430
 I focus on taking it like this 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.989
 lens cap focus hello on 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.870
 the phone does not want to focus 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:21.319
 here and start handles to twist the focus all 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.329
 Such a focus on eating is excellent and you can 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.120
 take off 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.870
 drove well Well drove us 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.549
 need a tablet like that cable 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.030
 yusb cable media is not everywhere for my 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:37.400
 zvukovuhi well, and a buttonhole for tests from 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.870
 windows zvukovuha itself is a creative from yet 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:48.010
 once spoke with b 1095 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.010
 so here it is connect to 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:13.860

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:15.830
 wake up working so connect to it 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.400

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.400
 zvukovuhi buttonhole 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:32.570
 so here she is now I will write on 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.630

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:42.210
 so launch our and usb audio recorder 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:44.400
 About here he determined it turns out that the sound 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:51.080

 I'll post in the description for the video you can 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.900
 listen to how they look in the original 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:35.940
 without any processing well, and that's actually 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:39.930
 and all very good option I would say 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.490
 not to buy 2 expensive voice recorder well 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.500

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.060
 recording the sound of a funny remote through 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.040
 sound card right on the tablet 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.900

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.690
 buttonhole through zvukovuhu on the tablet 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.150

 video how to connect a buttonhole to 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.720
 smartphone and decided to develop this topic here 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.580

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.030
