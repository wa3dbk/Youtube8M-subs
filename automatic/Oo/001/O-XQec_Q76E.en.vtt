00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
down very quickly compared to attacking

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.590 
down very quickly compared to attacking

top<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.129> Titan<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.850> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.120> look<00:01:03.239> at

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
top of your Titan you want to look at

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
top of your Titan you want to look at
the<00:01:03.449> mini-map<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> friendly

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the mini-map to see if it's a friendly

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
the mini-map to see if it's a friendly
player<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.850> there's<00:01:06.030> no<00:01:06.210> icon<00:01:06.659> there<00:01:06.869> then

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
player and if there's no icon there then

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.750 
player and if there's no icon there then
you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.560> reasonably<00:01:08.100> assume<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.490> it's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you can reasonably assume that it's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.670 
you can reasonably assume that it's
going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.180> an<00:01:09.360> enemy<00:01:09.780> player<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.380> reason<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
going to be an enemy player the reason I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.230 
going to be an enemy player the reason I
say<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> check<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.090> this

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
say to check for this is because this

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
say to check for this is because this
comes<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.659> much<00:01:12.900> quicker<00:01:12.930> than<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> actual

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
comes up much quicker than the actual

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.490 
comes up much quicker than the actual
in-game<00:01:14.360> notifications<00:01:15.360> do<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.200> you'll<00:01:16.350> be

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
in-game notifications do so you'll be

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
in-game notifications do so you'll be
able<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.890> catch<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.369> enemy<00:01:17.549> pilot<00:01:18.030> off-guard

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
able to catch the enemy pilot off-guard

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
able to catch the enemy pilot off-guard

the benefit to using this to your
advantage<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.060> player<00:01:36.299> jumps<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.720> top<00:01:36.869> of

you and you stay inside your shield you
will<00:01:38.700> most<00:01:38.880> likely<00:01:39.000> kill<00:01:39.390> them<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.750> force<00:01:40.049> them

will most likely kill them or force them

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.469 
will most likely kill them or force them
off<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> top<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> your<00:01:40.860> Titan<00:01:41.329> once<00:01:42.329> you've

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
with your primary weapon the next method

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.100 
with your primary weapon the next method
is<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> use<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.579> electrical<00:01:51.090> smoke<00:01:51.420> similar

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
has a much larger effective radius you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.380 
has a much larger effective radius you
can<00:01:58.829> crouch<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> smoke<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> will

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
can crouch in the smoke and this will

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.760 
can crouch in the smoke and this will
force<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> player<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.079> spend<00:02:01.200> more<00:02:01.469> time<00:02:01.530> in

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
force the player to spend more time in

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350 
force the player to spend more time in
it<00:02:01.979> while<00:02:02.130> they're<00:02:02.280> trying<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.610> jump<00:02:02.880> off<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it while they're trying to jump off and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.999 
it while they're trying to jump off and
it<00:02:04.020> will<00:02:04.140> increase<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> likelihood<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
it will increase the likelihood that

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.340 
it will increase the likelihood that
they'll<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.490> killed<00:02:05.790> while<00:02:06.119> doing<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
they'll get killed while doing so you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.139 
they'll get killed while doing so you
can<00:02:07.469> also<00:02:07.619> use<00:02:07.740> cluster<00:02:08.280> missiles<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.849> get<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
can also use cluster missiles to get the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.029 
can also use cluster missiles to get the
same<00:02:09.360> effect<00:02:09.539> however<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.349> will<00:02:10.530> deal<00:02:10.800> damage

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
same effect however it will deal damage

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.710 
same effect however it will deal damage
to<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.430> own<00:02:11.550> Titan<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.420> should<00:02:12.569> always

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
to your own Titan so you should always

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.700 
to your own Titan so you should always
bear<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.260> mind

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
bear this in mind

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.320 
bear this in mind
the<00:02:13.800> last<00:02:13.980> thing<00:02:14.130> you'd<00:02:14.280> want<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.490> do<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the last thing you'd want to do is to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.940 
the last thing you'd want to do is to
deal<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.690> cinema<00:02:16.050> damage<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.740> player

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
deal the cinema damage that that player

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.160 
deal the cinema damage that that player
would<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.550> anyway<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.140> next

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
would have to you anyway so the next

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.990 
would have to you anyway so the next
thing<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:19.710> do<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.550> rely<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:20.850> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
thing you can do is to rely on a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.970 
thing you can do is to rely on a
teammate<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.750> always<00:02:22.380> move<00:02:22.560> around<00:02:22.770> with

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
teammate I always move around with

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.710 
teammate I always move around with
another<00:02:23.100> friend<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.300> always<00:02:24.450> have

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
another friend so that we always have

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.030 
another friend so that we always have
each<00:02:24.840> other's<00:02:25.110> back<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.530> not<00:02:25.650> quite<00:02:25.830> often

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
each other's back so not quite often

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.250 
each other's back so not quite often
when<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> player<00:02:26.760> jumps<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.120> top<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.300> me<00:02:27.420> while<00:02:28.230> I

and<00:02:50.820> just<00:02:51.000> allow<00:02:51.210> him<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.510> shoot<00:02:51.690> them<00:02:51.840> off<00:02:51.960> and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
and just allow him to shoot them off and

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.840 
and just allow him to shoot them off and
it'll<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.680> gone<00:02:52.920> before<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.280> manage<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
it'll be gone before you manage to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.000 
it'll be gone before you manage to
damage<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.480> considerably<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.710> another

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
method that you can try but I wouldn't

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.360 
method that you can try but I wouldn't
suggest<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.500> pretend<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.010> you've<00:02:59.220> got

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
suggest is to pretend that you've got

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.220 
suggest is to pretend that you've got
out<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.610> your<00:02:59.760> Titan<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.780> where<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.020> look

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
out of your Titan this is where you look

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.900 
out of your Titan this is where you look
down<00:03:01.350> at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> ground<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.950> Crouch<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.550> if<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
down at the ground and Crouch and if the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.490 
down at the ground and Crouch and if the
player<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> beginner<00:03:03.780> often<00:03:04.260> they<00:03:04.350> will

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
player is a beginner often they will

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.900 
player is a beginner often they will
jump<00:03:04.680> straight<00:03:04.920> off<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.580> they<00:03:05.700> think

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
jump straight off you because they think

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.210 
jump straight off you because they think
you've<00:03:06.060> got<00:03:06.210> out<00:03:06.360> however<00:03:07.230> also<00:03:07.470> worth<00:03:07.980> noting

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you've got out however also worth noting

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.760 
you've got out however also worth noting
if<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.730> beginner<00:03:09.060> player<00:03:09.170> having<00:03:10.170> snow<00:03:10.410> she<00:03:10.530> go

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
if a beginner player having snow she go

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.320 
if a beginner player having snow she go
down<00:03:11.010> they<00:03:11.190> might<00:03:11.340> not<00:03:11.490> even<00:03:11.550> think<00:03:11.970> anything

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
down they might not even think anything

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.610 
down they might not even think anything
of<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.660> they'll<00:03:12.780> keep<00:03:12.960> shooting<00:03:13.350> at<00:03:13.470> you

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
of it and they'll keep shooting at you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.470 
of it and they'll keep shooting at you
so<00:03:14.070> for<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.310> reason<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.880> wouldn't<00:03:15.240> suggest

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
so for this reason I wouldn't suggest

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.420 
so for this reason I wouldn't suggest
this<00:03:15.810> method<00:03:16.140> because<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> lot<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.890> people<00:03:17.190> do

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
this method because a lot of people do

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.610 
this method because a lot of people do
know<00:03:17.610> about<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.120> only<00:03:18.900> jump<00:03:19.170> off<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.470> when

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
know about it and only jump off you when

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.380 
know about it and only jump off you when
they<00:03:19.740> actually<00:03:19.890> hear<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.340> audio<00:03:20.640> trigger<00:03:20.880> for

they actually hear the audio trigger for

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.110 
they actually hear the audio trigger for

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
you in the fall I don't think it rewards

you in the fall I don't think it rewards
either<00:04:57.820> player<00:04:58.180> with<00:04:58.330> any<00:04:58.479> points<00:04:58.930> but<00:04:59.410> it's

either player with any points but it's

either player with any points but it's
also<00:04:59.680> quite<00:04:59.979> funny<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.580> see<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.880> enemy<00:05:00.970> pilots

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510

also quite funny to see the enemy pilots
reaction<00:05:01.990> because<00:05:02.680> this<00:05:02.889> is<00:05:03.039> probably<00:05:03.310> the

reaction because this is probably the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.150 
reaction because this is probably the
last<00:05:03.610> thing<00:05:03.760> that<00:05:03.880> they'd<00:05:04.120> expect<00:05:05.010> now<00:05:06.010> we'll

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
last thing that they'd expect now we'll

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.159 
last thing that they'd expect now we'll
move<00:05:06.310> on<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.820> what<00:05:07.030> you<00:05:07.120> can<00:05:07.300> do<00:05:07.419> as<00:05:07.539> a<00:05:07.570> pilot<00:05:08.020> to

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
move on to what you can do as a pilot to

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.900
