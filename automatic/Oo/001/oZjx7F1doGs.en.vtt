hello<00:00:06.690> everyone<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:07.790> movie<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.000> want<00:00:09.090> to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
hello everyone in this movie I want to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.540 
hello everyone in this movie I want to
show<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.870> prototype<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.860> tennis<00:00:11.340> ball

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
show you a prototype of a tennis ball

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.720 
show you a prototype of a tennis ball
machine<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.269> try<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.570> build<00:00:13.130> here<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.519> can

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
machine that I try to build here you can

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.000 
machine that I try to build here you can
see<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> model<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.630> mine<00:00:15.809> assembly<00:00:16.320> motors<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
see a model of mine assembly motors and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.689 
see a model of mine assembly motors and
wheels<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:18.500> didn't<00:00:19.500> want<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.980> continue<00:00:20.310> with

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
wheels I didn't want to continue with

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.359 
wheels I didn't want to continue with
modeling<00:00:21.210> until<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.779> was<00:00:21.960> sure<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
modeling until I was sure that the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.220 
modeling until I was sure that the
machine<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.730> capable<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.570> throwing<00:00:24.930> balls

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
machine is capable of throwing balls

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.120 
machine is capable of throwing balls
with<00:00:25.500> sufficient<00:00:26.070> speed<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.550> consistency

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
with sufficient speed and consistency

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.669 
with sufficient speed and consistency
this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.429> actual<00:00:29.970> device<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:31.560> have

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this is an actual device I don't have

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
this is an actual device I don't have
motor<00:00:31.920> controllers<00:00:32.669> yet<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> just

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
motor controllers yet so I just

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.380 
motor controllers yet so I just
connected<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.340> motor<00:00:35.520> directly<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
connected the motor directly to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.229 
connected the motor directly to
batteries<00:00:40.340> there<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.460> two<00:00:41.670> batteries

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
batteries there are two batteries

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.630 
batteries there are two batteries
because<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.930> wanted<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> control<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> speed<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
because I wanted to control the speed of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
because I wanted to control the speed of
each<00:00:45.059> wheel<00:00:45.539> separately<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.829> test<00:00:47.039> how<00:00:47.190> much

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
each wheel separately to test how much

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.790 
each wheel separately to test how much
spin<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> ball<00:00:48.210> may<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:51.300> today<00:00:51.780> finally<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
spin a ball may get and today finally I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.029 
spin a ball may get and today finally I
shoot<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> few<00:00:53.850> balls<00:00:54.059> from<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.260> first<00:00:55.530> test

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
shoot a few balls from it the first test

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.540 
shoot a few balls from it the first test
upper<00:00:56.910> motor<00:00:57.230> connected<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> 12<00:00:58.710> volt<00:00:59.010> battery

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
upper motor connected to 12 volt battery

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.630 
upper motor connected to 12 volt battery
bottom<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> 4<00:01:00.660> volt<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.190> rotate

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
bottom one to 4 volt and so they rotate

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880 
bottom one to 4 volt and so they rotate
with<00:01:02.850> different<00:01:03.420> speeds<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.019> balls<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
with different speeds and balls have a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:43.540 
with different speeds and balls have a
nice<00:01:05.189> top<00:01:05.519> speed

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.150 

and<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:45.090> second<00:01:45.420> test<00:01:45.690> both<00:01:46.350> motors<00:01:46.770> connect

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
and the second test both motors connect

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.870 
and the second test both motors connect
to<00:01:47.520> 12<00:01:48.120> volt<00:01:48.450> batteries<00:01:49.050> which<00:01:49.400> gives<00:01:50.400> less

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to 12 volt batteries which gives less

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.150 
to 12 volt batteries which gives less
topspin<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:51.690> much<00:01:52.080> greater<00:01:52.500> speed<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
topspin but much greater speed of the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.539 
topspin but much greater speed of the
ball

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:14.050 

Oh

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.240 

okay<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.120> thanks<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:15.870> watching<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> near

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
okay so thanks for watching in the near

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.160 
okay so thanks for watching in the near

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.800 
future I'm going to upload the next
video<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.890> show<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.400> progress<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.090> please

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
video to show the progress so please

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.670 
video to show the progress so please
check<00:02:21.990> my<00:02:22.140> channel<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.800> few<00:02:22.980> weeks<00:02:23.100> bye
