00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.069
 jo people hello and welcome 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.750
 for the second review or first 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.700
 right review on this channel here 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.760
 today it's all about the humane 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.260
 centipede of tom six wants to first 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.830
 I return a few words about the story 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.929
 to lose 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.359
 There are basically two young ladies 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.380
 which a trip through a holiday trip 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.890
 through europe 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.989
 and well two ladies a car what is there 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.699
 already go wrong 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.380
 hahahaha okay of course in donawitz 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.360
 sorry i try all women 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.989
 please in the course of the videos too 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.180
 spread 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.690
 Well, as it should be otherwise 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.010
 proceed on a forest path and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.840
 there have a maturity stupid 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.760
 because there are none of the two boys with it 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.410
 how to change in the morning 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.179
 instead they stay in the car and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.250
 hope that another car 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.469
 Passes by and they are lucky too 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.839
 in misfortune because exactly that happened 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.030
 I would like the hitchhiker, too 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.370
 instead of helping the ladies 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.390
 let the ladies help if you 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.190
 understand what I mean 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.859
 The ladies are of course at all 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.560
 not so pleased and then completely finished 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.420
 with the situation and leave because of it 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.659
 the car and run through the dark 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.250
 Forest and try next tuition gut 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.070
 you again luck in misfortune and 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.680
 This time really because they find 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.030
 namely a house and in this house 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.380
 lives the surgeon dr haider and hdr 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.840
 haider is not as cheerful as his 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.790
 name suggests dr drine 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.549
 is pursuing a specific habitat and 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.530
 Although he wants a human centipede so 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.719
 a centipede from humans 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.280
 create 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.110
 Well, that's where I am 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.630
 ask two times and that 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
 first question is what drives hell in 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.039
 Tomsic to in his free time he 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.719
 such ideas come and the second 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.460
 question is human centipede 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.250
 can one implement that somehow resp 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.299
 that was also implemented well 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.610
 I can not answer the first question 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.680
 answer what he defended himself in 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.420
 However, his free time drives 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.130
 I'm sending you information 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.240
 give 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.460
 first said that the film even 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.500
 not as brutal as you are now 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.740
 because if you could think so 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.539
 presents a 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.819
 also the human body to one 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.560
 Millipede together so there 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.739
 at least my head cinema is not exactly like that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.860
 the most beautiful but it really is not 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.330
 so big so there are a few brutal ones 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.040
 scenes in any case the brutal ones 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.130
 Scenes are also well implemented and see 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.530
 Real but the flock of the film goes 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.739
 in principle rather of the really of 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.870
 the sick basic idea and 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.860
 really sharp even start the story 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.540
 I have never heard of this 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.220
 human centipede in the movie 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.830
 heard and that's really something 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.420
 Great if in a horror movie once 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.350
 completely new story is rolled up 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.170
 from the films, in general, not so 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.970
 the story masterpieces are usually 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.239
 another big plus point on everyone 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.709
 case dr dr he is playing in front of me 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.819
 I do not know if I got this name right 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.400
 if I pronounce it correctly 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.470
 will pronounce dr heide of dieter 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.709
 laser played a cool name like that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.299
 By the way, and the laser would like 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.769
 I really do not like that after the show 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.660
 in the dark meet because he brings 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.459
 this sick and this idea 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.690
 I'm a surgeon 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.130
 over and gives the film it 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.820
 really a lot of atmosphere 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.100
 sometimes the film is right 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.870
 exciting so the movie does not come to anyone 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.030
 time in the tension of one 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.140
 pagan or even on and also the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.540
 Fingernails are not in 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.299
 but suffered and 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.739
 again you are excited with and yahoo 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.450
 but secretly at least the 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.989
 then master characters to create 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.850
 escaped from dr holder what also 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.130
 still a beneficial or what good one at that 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.959
 film is that he just does not idle 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.079
 offers as I said that is not 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.549
 every time to count exciting but you 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.079
 is so well maintained and so far 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.720
 boredom come and at least came 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.670
 I'm not really on it 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.109
 Of course not all gold glitters 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.630
 and so is also in the case 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.069
 and yes I must one definitely 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.290
 point because of the whole 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.630
 So clichés will not serve the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.480
 wrong in principle belong yes 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.240
 cliché somehow filming at home 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.530
 but 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.230
 you can do it a bit too 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.209
 Exaggerate and at the latest when you 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.550
 Take a pensive look with him 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.739
 hand over the forehead that drives yes me 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.360
 just looking back then it's always like this 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.310
 the moment reaches where the clichés 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.990
 just too thick were applied and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.320
 so it is unfortunately here despite the great 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.510
 story sometimes altogether in vain 8 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.880
 by 10 points definitely a cool one 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.530
 and a sick reason idea that way 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.160
 just like before in this form just yet 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.920
 did not occur 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.780
 there is no idleness in the movie and 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.180
 In any case, points on evaluations 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.060
 because of the great acting performance of 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.440
 dieter laser as noted 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.150
 just the sick psychopath here 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.460
 In general, the fsk is not the whole thing 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.320
 Seen as I was the film was 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.940
 too brutal that's why no 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.040
 uncut version in germany 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.590
 who is still interested in the film 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.330
 He can make the detour over Austria 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.910
 I choose faith in Austria comes 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.950
 soon the film in an uncut 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.270
 mediabook or is already outside I am 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.020
 I'm not sure either one of them 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.180
 check it out 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.620
 in the second part there is also the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.990
 second part I will someday 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.820
 let's go on this channel review 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.620
 a bit in the other direction of the 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.360
 Do not put so much emphasis on subtle 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.600
 scary but currently easy 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.850
 everything the first part one to the 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.890
 choral interventions just not shown 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.180
 has a third part is also in 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.770
 Planning about that is not that much yet 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.040
 I have to know that, however 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.930
 the number of people the 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.080
 involved them so this millipede 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.640
 will increase dramatically 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.810
 good that was it so far from me me 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.480
 I hope I have a little better 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.100
 made like the first review and in 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.510
 this sense again become pure 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.510
 and until the next video people
