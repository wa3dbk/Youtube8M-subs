can<00:00:15.830> you<00:00:15.950> put<00:00:16.130> two<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:16.390> resistance<00:00:17.390> in<00:00:17.600> we're

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
can you put two the resistance in we're

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.410 
can you put two the resistance in we're
going<00:00:18.080> to<00:00:18.140> now<00:00:18.320> gap<00:00:18.800> this<00:00:19.220> door<00:00:19.520> on<00:00:19.910> this<00:00:20.360> side

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
going to now gap this door on this side

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.880 
going to now gap this door on this side
and<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:20.840> light<00:00:20.990> resistance<00:00:21.320> we're<00:00:21.680> going<00:00:21.800> to

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
and the light resistance we're going to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.950 
and the light resistance we're going to
gap<00:00:22.279> it<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:22.700> clear<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:23.390> we're<00:00:23.810> going<00:00:23.930> to

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
gap it and clear it and we're going to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.230 
gap it and clear it and we're going to
put<00:00:24.080> a<00:00:24.110> heavier<00:00:24.439> one<00:00:24.619> in<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.009> have<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.880> find<00:00:26.119> a

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
put a heavier one in and have to find a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.770 
put a heavier one in and have to find a
little<00:00:26.540> bit<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:31.220> see<00:00:31.489> once<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:32.000> have<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:32.210> here<00:00:32.570> I

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
little bit and see once I have it here I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.780 
little bit and see once I have it here I
see<00:00:33.260> what<00:00:33.410> locks<00:00:33.620> in<00:00:33.800> real<00:00:33.980> life<00:00:34.220> I<00:00:34.430> see<00:00:34.670> what

see what locks in real life I see what

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.210 
see what locks in real life I see what
locks<00:00:35.000> a<00:00:35.180> hold<00:00:35.420> in<00:00:35.630> me<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:36.020> know<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:36.590> put<00:00:36.829> a<00:00:36.890> hurtin

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
locks a hold in me I know I put a hurtin

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.930 
locks a hold in me I know I put a hurtin
on<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.489> lock

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
on the lock

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.450 
on the lock
okay<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.930> lot<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.110> times<00:00:39.230> it's<00:00:39.649> just<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.950> clearing

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
okay a lot of times it's just a clearing

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.920 
okay a lot of times it's just a clearing
move<00:00:40.910> at<00:00:41.059> this<00:00:41.149> point<00:00:41.270> you're<00:00:41.570> going<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:41.750> want

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.960 

getting<00:01:02.960> set<00:01:03.109> up<00:01:03.230> a<00:01:03.379> heavy<00:01:04.220> resistance<00:01:04.460> I'm

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
getting set up a heavy resistance I'm

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.280 
getting set up a heavy resistance I'm
going<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.210> gap<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.840> I'm<00:01:05.990> going<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:06.140> show

crack it see what's holding okay trying

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.389 
crack it see what's holding okay trying
clear<00:01:28.930> yeah<00:01:29.930> that's<00:01:30.619> not<00:01:30.770> going<00:01:30.979> anywhere

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
clear yeah that's not going anywhere

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.039 
clear yeah that's not going anywhere
brings<00:01:32.060> back<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.630> here<00:01:32.869> hold<00:01:33.710> what<00:01:33.920> again<00:01:35.049> take

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
brings back in here hold what again take

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.260 
brings back in here hold what again take
my<00:01:36.170> regular<00:01:36.500> chalk<00:01:36.770> use<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.729> back<00:01:38.000> of<00:01:38.210> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
my regular chalk use the back of the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.950 
my regular chalk use the back of the
chalk<00:01:39.759> don't<00:01:40.759> will<00:01:40.909> collapse<00:01:41.210> onto<00:01:41.509> it

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
chalk don't will collapse onto it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.730 
chalk don't will collapse onto it
I<00:01:41.990> hold<00:01:42.740> what<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:42.950> gained<00:01:43.280> there<00:01:44.439> drop<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:45.680> a

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
I hold what I gained there drop this a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.740 
I hold what I gained there drop this a
piece<00:01:46.039> of<00:01:46.070> plastic<00:01:46.700> which<00:01:47.060> is<00:01:47.090> cutting<00:01:47.539> wood

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
piece of plastic which is cutting wood

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.539 
piece of plastic which is cutting wood
soon<00:01:48.110> as<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.289> apply<00:01:48.469> pressure<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.950> chalk<00:01:49.250> falls

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
soon as I apply pressure to chalk falls

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.170 
soon as I apply pressure to chalk falls
out<00:01:49.820> automatically<00:01:50.560> come<00:01:51.560> down<00:01:51.799> full<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.460> it

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
out automatically come down full and it

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.060 
out automatically come down full and it
gives<00:01:53.390> me<00:01:53.450> another<00:01:53.689> 3/4<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.409> an<00:01:54.560> inch<00:01:54.649> space

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
gives me another 3/4 of an inch space

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.209 
gives me another 3/4 of an inch space
then<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.119> take<00:01:56.299> my<00:01:56.450> shot<00:01:56.719> push<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:57.649> there<00:02:00.219> get

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
then I take my shot push it in there get

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:08.479 
then I take my shot push it in there get
behind<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.789> door<00:02:01.939> now

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.940 

okay<00:02:09.329> then<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> light<00:02:10.200> resistance<00:02:10.769> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
okay then for the light resistance and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100 
okay then for the light resistance and
on<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> other<00:02:11.220> side<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.269> get<00:02:12.480> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
on the other side I'm going to get this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.899 
on the other side I'm going to get this
left<00:02:13.409> hand<00:02:13.590> opening<00:02:14.069> door<00:02:15.709> my<00:02:16.709> ads<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.280> right

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
left hand opening door my ads in right

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.880 
left hand opening door my ads in right
tendency<00:02:18.659> of<00:02:18.689> the<00:02:18.840> brothers<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.470> come<00:02:19.680> down

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
tendency of the brothers is to come down

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.339 
tendency of the brothers is to come down
off<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.250> point<00:02:20.549> all<00:02:21.180> right<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:21.840> all<00:02:22.079> it's

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
off the point all right it's all it's

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.020 
off the point all right it's all it's
all<00:02:22.439> well<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.069> good<00:02:23.129> until<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.610> point<00:02:23.849> it's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
all well and good until the point it's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.789 
all well and good until the point it's
the<00:02:24.180> door<00:02:24.420> once<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.079> point<00:02:25.290> starts<00:02:25.620> hitting

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
the door once the point starts hitting

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.679 
the door once the point starts hitting
the<00:02:25.859> door<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.489> takes<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.939> out<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.239> jam<00:02:27.450> and

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
the door it takes you out of the jam and
