press<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.120> down<00:02:35.870> try<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.200> one<00:02:37.440> hand<00:02:37.680> so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
press it down try to do this one hand so

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.420 
press it down try to do this one hand so
it's<00:02:38.010> not<00:02:38.160> as<00:02:38.310> easy<00:02:38.459> as<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.790> would<00:02:39.000> be

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
it's not as easy as it would be

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.650 
it's not as easy as it would be
typically<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.209> snap<00:02:45.630> it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
typically so you can just snap it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.640 
typically so you can just snap it
together<00:02:47.810> make<00:02:48.810> sure<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.260> edges<00:02:49.530> are

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
together make sure all the edges are

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.180 
together make sure all the edges are
pushed<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:51.739> don't<00:02:52.739> know<00:02:52.860> how<00:02:52.920> well<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.100> can

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
pushed in I don't know how well you can

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.000 
pushed in I don't know how well you can
see<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:57.180> then<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.860> clamp<00:02:58.860> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
see that and then you just clamp the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.949 
see that and then you just clamp the
edges<00:02:59.310> down<00:02:59.540> the<00:03:00.540> two<00:03:00.780> ends<00:03:01.110> there<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.239> boom

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
edges down the two ends there and boom

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.970 
edges down the two ends there and boom
then<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.530> check<00:03:07.769> your<00:03:07.890> seal<00:03:09.709> make<00:03:10.709> sure<00:03:10.739> all

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
then you check your seal make sure all

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.820 
then you check your seal make sure all
the<00:03:11.069> edges<00:03:11.310> are<00:03:11.400> pressed<00:03:11.700> down<00:03:11.910> firmly<00:03:12.830> then

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
the edges are pressed down firmly then

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.930 
the edges are pressed down firmly then
you<00:03:14.010> get<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.190> nice<00:03:15.650> waterproof<00:03:16.650> seal<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.670> your

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
you get a nice waterproof seal on your

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.199 
you get a nice waterproof seal on your
phone<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.890> didn't<00:03:19.890> mean<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.010> order<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.640> white

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
phone I didn't mean to order the white

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.110 
phone I didn't mean to order the white
one<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.739> wanted<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.829> get<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.100> black<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.970> red

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
one I wanted to get the black and red

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.800 
one I wanted to get the black and red
one<00:03:24.410> but<00:03:25.410> uh<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:26.090> guess<00:03:27.090> I'd<00:03:27.269> leave<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.690> wrong

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
one but uh I guess I'd leave the wrong

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.270 
one but uh I guess I'd leave the wrong
one<00:03:28.049> out<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.320> my<00:03:28.380> cart<00:03:28.680> when<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:28.890> was<00:03:28.920> shopping

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
one out of my cart when I was shopping

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.479 
one out of my cart when I was shopping
for<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.500> white<00:03:31.709> one<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:32.100> what<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> got

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
for it so the white one is what I got

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.819 
for it so the white one is what I got
and<00:03:33.109> that's<00:03:34.109> what<00:03:34.230> I'm<00:03:34.320> gonna<00:03:34.440> stick<00:03:34.650> with<00:03:34.680> it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
and that's what I'm gonna stick with it

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.110 
and that's what I'm gonna stick with it
because<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.040> can't<00:03:35.130> really<00:03:35.400> see<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.850> rest<00:03:35.970> of

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
because you can't really see the rest of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.270 
because you can't really see the rest of
the<00:03:36.180> phone<00:03:36.359> anyway<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.230> phone<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.010> in

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
the phone anyway and that phone is in

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.130 
the phone anyway and that phone is in
the<00:03:38.370> case<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.450> doesn't<00:03:39.660> really<00:03:39.720> bother<00:03:39.959> me

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
the case so it doesn't really bother me

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.699 
the case so it doesn't really bother me
but<00:03:40.620> um<00:03:41.299> yeah<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.600> case<00:03:42.810> feels<00:03:43.079> way<00:03:43.290> nicer<00:03:43.650> in

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
but um yeah the case feels way nicer in

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.039 
but um yeah the case feels way nicer in
the<00:03:43.799> hand<00:03:44.040> doesn't<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.359> ridiculous

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
the hand doesn't have that ridiculous

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.990 
the hand doesn't have that ridiculous
raised<00:03:46.410> edge<00:03:47.120> like<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.720> seidio<00:03:49.140> does<00:03:50.000> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
raised edge like the seidio does the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.300 
raised edge like the seidio does the
whole<00:03:51.209> whole<00:03:51.870> portion<00:03:52.819> right<00:03:53.819> here<00:03:54.200> on<00:03:55.310> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
whole whole portion right here on the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.150 
whole whole portion right here on the
lifeproof<00:03:57.090> sticks<00:03:57.569> above<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.620> screen<00:03:58.859> and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
lifeproof sticks above the screen and

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.479 
lifeproof sticks above the screen and
this<00:04:00.000> one<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.480> practically<00:04:01.319> flush<00:04:01.680> right

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
this one is practically flush right

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.949 
this one is practically flush right
against<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.880> screen<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.930> screen

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
against the screen and the screen

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.530 
against the screen and the screen
protector<00:04:04.680> feels<00:04:05.459> just<00:04:05.819> like<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.209> screen

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
protector feels just like the screen

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.690 
protector feels just like the screen
itself<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.829> it's<00:04:07.980> not<00:04:08.069> like<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.370> have<00:04:08.549> this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
itself so it's not like you have this

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.970 
itself so it's not like you have this
awkward<00:04:09.389> piece<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.989> plastic<00:04:10.410> sitting<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.799> top

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
awkward piece of plastic sitting on top

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.099 
awkward piece of plastic sitting on top
of<00:04:11.010> your<00:04:11.160> phone<00:04:11.480> it<00:04:12.480> sits<00:04:12.720> right<00:04:12.840> against<00:04:13.410> it

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
of your phone it sits right against it

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.039 
of your phone it sits right against it
it<00:04:16.109> feels<00:04:16.410> just<00:04:16.530> like

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.710 

just<00:04:20.009> like<00:04:20.129> the<00:04:20.280> screen<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:20.849> I<00:04:21.090> was<00:04:21.509> really

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
just like the screen so I was really

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.230 
just like the screen so I was really
happy<00:04:22.019> with<00:04:22.199> that<00:04:22.379> again<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.759> can<00:04:23.789> actually

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
happy with that again you can actually

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.960 
happy with that again you can actually
feel<00:04:24.479> when<00:04:24.659> you<00:04:24.750> push<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.050> button<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.789> on<00:04:26.789> this

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
feel when you push the button in on this

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.830 
feel when you push the button in on this
case<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.979> was<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:29.970> big<00:04:30.210> improvement<00:04:30.599> as

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
case so that was a big improvement as

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.249 
case so that was a big improvement as
well<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:32.340> really<00:04:32.490> just<00:04:32.699> feels<00:04:32.789> more<00:04:33.120> natural

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
well it really just feels more natural

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.300 
well it really just feels more natural
as<00:04:34.259> it's<00:04:34.800> not<00:04:34.979> as<00:04:35.129> big<00:04:36.289> bulky<00:04:37.289> as<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:38.129> life

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
as it's not as big bulky as the life

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.249 
as it's not as big bulky as the life
truth<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.819> i<00:04:39.409> wish<00:04:40.409> i<00:04:40.530> had<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.889> gouge<00:04:41.159> he<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
truth is i wish i had to gouge he is the

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.619 
truth is i wish i had to gouge he is the
compare<00:04:43.259> but<00:04:43.500> this<00:04:43.680> one's<00:04:43.889> way<00:04:44.099> wider<00:04:44.629> or

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
compare but this one's way wider or

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.860 
compare but this one's way wider or
feels<00:04:45.930> wider<00:04:46.229> maybe<00:04:46.830> this<00:04:46.979> is<00:04:47.159> because<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.520> the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
feels wider maybe this is because of the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.580 
feels wider maybe this is because of the
harder<00:04:48.870> plastic<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:50.690> yep<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:52.139> sound<00:04:52.409> quality

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
harder plastic but yep the sound quality

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.589 
harder plastic but yep the sound quality
is<00:04:52.860> also<00:04:53.250> better<00:04:53.460> through<00:04:53.819> the<00:04:53.940> speaker<00:04:54.360> on

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
is also better through the speaker on

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.790 
is also better through the speaker on
the<00:04:55.229> back<00:04:55.319> the<00:04:55.979> ring<00:04:56.940> or<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.469> the<00:04:58.469> speaker

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
the back the ring or the the speaker

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.170 
the back the ring or the the speaker
quality<00:04:59.009> through<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.460> earpiece<00:04:59.639> is<00:05:00.030> way

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
quality through the earpiece is way
