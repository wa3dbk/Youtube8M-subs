00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
in a raid that you start making a little

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
rate is nothing like that at all but

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.330 
rate is nothing like that at all but
actually<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.800> basically<00:00:20.220> shows

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
an interesting raid where there was a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.520 
an interesting raid where there was a
time<00:00:47.250> during<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.330> raid<00:00:48.660> where<00:00:48.900> I<00:00:48.930> almost

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
time during this raid where I almost

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.120

panicked and then I took a step back and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.890 
panicked and then I took a step back and
decided<00:00:53.130> to<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.700> wait<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.450> little<00:00:54.720> bit

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
decided to just wait for a little bit

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.200 
decided to just wait for a little bit
longer<00:00:55.170> watch<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.160> raid<00:00:56.309> play<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.700> and<00:00:56.880> then

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
longer watch the raid play out and then

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.330 
longer watch the raid play out and then
start<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> deploy<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.530> troops<00:00:58.860> so<00:00:59.040> this<00:00:59.190> was

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
start to deploy more troops so this was

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.090 
start to deploy more troops so this was

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
because that actually does a lot of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
because that actually does a lot of
damage<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> balloons<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.979> well<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.550> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
really see the point of using any extra

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.410 
really see the point of using any extra
minions<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.799> basically<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.790> point<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.270> this

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
minions but basically the point of this

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.540 
minions but basically the point of this

she stops let's the raid play out a
little<00:04:01.740> bit<00:04:02.040> more<00:04:02.280> because<00:04:02.610> she<00:04:02.820> knows<00:04:03.030> the

pick up any extra percentage points now
this<00:04:46.950> is<00:04:47.130> actually<00:04:47.280> going<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.700> be<00:04:47.760> really

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
this is actually going to be really

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.850 
this is actually going to be really
close<00:04:48.360> but<00:04:48.750> keep<00:04:48.930> in<00:04:49.080> mind<00:04:49.110> this<00:04:49.380> is<00:04:49.440> coming

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
close but keep in mind this is coming

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.590 
close but keep in mind this is coming
from<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.100> perspective<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:50.850> this<00:04:51.390> rate

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
from the perspective of this rate

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.700 
from the perspective of this rate
actually<00:04:52.020> looked<00:04:52.230> like<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:52.440> was<00:04:52.530> going<00:04:52.620> to

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
actually looked like it was going to

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.530 
actually looked like it was going to
fail<00:04:53.010> now<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:53.640> looks<00:04:53.760> like<00:04:53.880> she<00:04:54.090> actually<00:04:54.210> has

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
fail now it looks like she actually has

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.450 
fail now it looks like she actually has
a<00:04:54.570> chance<00:04:54.960> she<00:04:55.200> has<00:04:55.560> that<00:04:55.710> barbarian<00:04:56.100> King

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
a chance she has that barbarian King

a chance she has that barbarian King
that's<00:04:56.910> breaking<00:04:57.330> into<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:57.720> base<00:04:58.170> as<00:04:58.410> well<00:04:58.710> as

that's breaking into the base as well as

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.650 
that's breaking into the base as well as
