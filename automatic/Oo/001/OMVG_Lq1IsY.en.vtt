00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 The Couture Show in Las Vegas is my favorite jewelry show. Where it revolves around creativity 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 And the design, the place where the Kuwaiti jeweler "Octium" was unveiled 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 His new collection is called Twist. Where Twist takes the idea of ​​an appraiser, which is the main idea 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 For the Octium form, to new heights. I met Mrs. Anoud and Mr. Fahd who came to me 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Everything about the new inspiration. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Anoud: The idea originated from the form of Octium, which is an octagon wrapped. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Maria: Now the Octagon has been literally abolished, simplified and redesigned 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 In a new geometrical form of long, extended lines that wrap around the finger and along the wrist. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The couple, Fahd and Al-Anoud, founded Octium and are now in existence since its founding 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 six years. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Fahd: It's not just jewelry design, it's the whole concept of lifestyle. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And factors such as comfort that are critical during production and design. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Anoud: I want to make sure that the piece is a piece I want to buy for myself. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 It is one of the most exciting moments in the history of Octium, offering its largest collections ever. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Octium design touches are still prominent here, such as multi-faceted corners and pure simple lines 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 With the addition of colored stones such as blue, white and black and white diamonds 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 And the famous turquoise stone. By wearing jewels I can say that these ornaments have 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Designed by a woman specially for women because they are easy to wear as their edges are completely smooth 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 All of them are delicately pointed but at the same time quite modern, however 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Not as much as it captures the appearance. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Anoud: I would like to give women the freedom to pick and choose their favorite jewelery pieces. Not limited 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 It is only about availability, but what it has to buy. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 We can say that Anoud studied architecture in pure engineering, exquisite sculpture quality 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 In this group. Al-Anoud designed each piece herself and then sent it to Milan 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 The pieces were made according to the exact OCTIUM standards. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Fahd: We have to be present at every stage and make sure that this is the right direction 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 How things go, and that's fun for us. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 We expect to see more of the Twist Group masterpieces, as Al-Anoud assured me that she always works on innovation 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 New designs, so our next stop is going to Italy to see how the pieces are manufactured. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
