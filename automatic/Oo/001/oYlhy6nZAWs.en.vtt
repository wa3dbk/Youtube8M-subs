00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 two 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.160
 very good we are already here with a 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.980
 section of questions to training today 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.539
 we ask with a question how good that 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.289
 the people if is one of which as 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.289
 all muscular 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.200
 to gain muscle mass there are several 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.320
 points that we have to take into account 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.970
 a first point would be the subject of time 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.460
 of training there are not many people who 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.020
 it's a long time and if it sticks a lot 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.620
 of series are many hours in the 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.079
 gym doing only weights and machines 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.550
 not when that's a mistake really a 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.160
 good a training time of 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.590
 would be no higher than 45 minutes is 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.269
 to say you can not be all your life in the 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.699
 gym that people that sticks two hours 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.530
 there we are here is marking and 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.300
 We are destroying muscle mass 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.579
 then we are seeing a little in 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.860
 against what should 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.619
 the important thing is to do intense training 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.840
 but I always cut half an hour and 45 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.549
 minutes would be the idea I do not have a car 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.009
 be so long uncle heavy that you're 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.710
 tiring people there a second point 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.229
 take into account would be the issue of what 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.360
 kind of exercises we have to do what 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.310
 work we have to do what we have to do 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.350
 keep in mind that as we have little 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.720
 we must mobilize the entire mass 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.730
 possible muscle then we should do 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.010
 global exercises 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.480
 that involves a lot of muscle mass would be 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.860
 then the main groups 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.550
 muscles that we must work on the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.010
 pectoral the dorsal and the deltoid and of 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.990
 the legs, especially the 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.870
 quadriceps and in the ischiums and then 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.610
 exercises for these muscles would be 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.760
 mainly I recommend you 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.050
 you work bench press for pectoral 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.360
 we can do squats for the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.310
 quadriceps deadlift for speeches 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.760
 these are very important and dominated 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.730
 for the number between the shorts 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.860
 but effective and hard as I said 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.540
 before there are people who are sure that 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.760
 you see the typical captchas there is that is 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.470
 so much the fucking day at the gym there's 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.150
 that being so long is saying delivery 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.640
 it must be short then we should not do 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.040
 more than 16 series between 12 and 16 series 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.080
 it's good to start and well if you and me 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.710
 if we are total novices, then even 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.540
 with 10 and the coarse ones between 12 and 16 a 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.700
 she where you who stay still 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.260
 standing the exercises have to be 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.510
 intense is to say we have to put 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.550
 a lot of cargo we have to lift a lot 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.780
 weight as much as we can according to 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.120
 repetitions that we are going to do 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.890
 we should go to fault plus one and the fault 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.570
 more just means that if we go to that 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.920
 do 15 repetitions because we could not 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.200
 do more than 16 7 to 16 and 17 already what 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.310
 we could do that would we fail 1 is 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.110
 say we have a lot of mobility 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.989
 and good and should always be controlled 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.620
 with the correct technique that's clear 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.140
 It is clear 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.870
 but with which ships are made to 0 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.840
 the next point would be to respect the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.580
 principle of progression and my thesis is the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.310
 principle but they say that cojones is that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.489
 Hold faca is that you do not know people 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.709
 who is all his life doing 10 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.030
 repetitions I will repeat true to your 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.280
 life and I'm in hypertrophy phase 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.930
 all life sure we know for sure 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.879
 that you have a neighbor that is so easy 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.349
 see finish all life that's the 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.780
 people who are always doing four 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.250
 series of 10 or 5 series of 10 and is 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.129
 all my life doing the same training 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.810
 these people will improve not going to take a 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.120
 point is going to stay stagnant then 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.250
 we have to progress how it progresses 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.099
 For example, adding more load if 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.190
 we are doing 10 repetitions so 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.989
 are you going to do 6 follow us series by 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.609
 basic progression principle would be like 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.440
 this one that happened to you here for example 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:52.310
 Well, we can start doing 15 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.120
 repetitions then we are three 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.640
 Weekdays and we change 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.650
 10 repetitions we are three weeks and 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.090
 we change we make six three weekdays 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.290
 we change 12 8 and 4 and that would be how it would be 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.590
 progressively 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.110
 It is important that every three weeks 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.370
 let's change we change routine that is 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.440
 that we go to a different routine or 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.010
 adding more weight and fewer repetitions 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.019
 or changing the training system 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.139
 in passing super series to make a 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.820
 pyramid as you want but it is important 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.770
 that we vary the stimulus because 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.900
 If we would not do the style, you will be like 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.520
 old that you will see as your neighbor 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.729
 that his whole fucking life is always 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.440
 doing series of 10 and it does not improve well 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.030
 and to finish what is super 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.250
 important is that we respect the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.020
 invisible training that is the 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.330
 invisible training that I know I do not know 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.449
 see that you do not know what is there but it is there 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.070
 the invisible training is the 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.900
 training we do when we do not 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.729
 we are training yes then what 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.940
 we do when we are training to sleep 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.650
 well rest eat 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.830
 that is the invisible training there is no 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.210
 more eat well and rest well yes 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.500
 So what do we have to do? 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.480
 For example, if we are in the phase of 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.020
 hypertrophy hypertrophy phase gain 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.700
 muscle mass 10 8 repetitions 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.490
 we will need between session and session 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.350
 training a 48-hour break 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.990
 so that our muscles recover 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.930
 if we do not respect that rest period 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.420
 you will not improve you will be like your neighbor if 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.440
 we are in phase of maximum force 64 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.410
 repetitions we will need about 72 hours 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.060
 so that the muscle recovers its 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.430
 ability to retrain another 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.190
 Once the coffee must respect the 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.810
 breaks sometimes less is more and for 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.940
 another part is the issue of 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.520
 super important feed carry a 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.400
 good varied food and in this 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.220
 case we should make about 5 meals at 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.140
 day finish very satiated at every meal and 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.330
 that is a most varied food 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.700
 possible if we want to gain muscle mass 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.400
 it is important that it be high in 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.260
 carbohydrates and if we want more 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.190
 definition then we should raise a little 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.080
 more achievement 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.200
 yes but the important thing in the end is to finish 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.500
 well sated and that is varied that is 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.630
 varied and even just that 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.720
 that's good invisible training 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.190
 and finally to finish as 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.780
 example as we have done few 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.790
 things so those of the de haan 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.400
 I give you an example of how we could 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.680
 start a good bodybuilding routine 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.060
 one that I propose to you I what you 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.270
 I propose is to work for super series 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.529
 the first two years followed as 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.389
 to start desserts 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:36.389
 makes three sets of 15 the press of 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:39.899
 banking and relentlessly do an oar with 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.519
 bar if the rowing with bar also 15 

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:44.999
 repetitions and then we rest would be 

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:47.309
 make a pull to the chest with pulleys and 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:49.559
 then a press with military press baron 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:51.959
 with a bar also 3 of 15 and finish it 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:54.929
 with squats two sets of 15 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:57.389
 in super series with a dead weight and with 

00:06:54.929 --> 00:07:00.119
 we already have about 16 series that we have 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:03.449
 done surely if I'm fast if you go 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:04.919
 well you will do it in less than 45 minutes and 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.109
 you have made of we have very good and 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.569
 well put the charges and respected is the 

00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:12.880
 invisible training and little by little and 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:15.190
 You see progressing, you will improve 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.230
 and that's the way we already have everything already 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.820
 you have everything you want to know the most 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.740
 as it explained a little above that 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.300
 is what we can do to win 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.210
 muscle mass I hope you have been able 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.660
 help you know that I try 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:30.250
 solve doubts as much as possible 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.170
 so on my part nothing else just me 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.510
 I have my Christmas sock here for 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.070
 that you fill them with subscriptions and 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.630
 can be the aic if this video and I 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.940
 I would be very excited and liked the 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.200
 video that I would be very excited about 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.790
 arose early am filled fun 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.610
 of subscriptions and likes so it's 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.770
 all chubby and everything so full 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.540
 It would be great instead of goodies me 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.580
 I prefer subscriptions because many

 good and people who see me sometimes 

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:03.940
 he recognizes by the street he says something to me
