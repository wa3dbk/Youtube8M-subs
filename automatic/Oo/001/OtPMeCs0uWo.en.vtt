00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
adding the wings at first I had her

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.200 
adding the wings at first I had her
wings<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.469> curled<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.430> behind<00:02:05.909> her

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like they're folded up but then I

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.889

decided they wanted them a little bit
bigger<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.829> you<00:02:09.920> could<00:02:10.069> see<00:02:10.310> them<00:02:10.459> when<00:02:10.519> like

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
bigger so you could see them when like

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.089 
bigger so you could see them when like

place so make sure you put that one on a
separate<00:02:55.430> layer<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.939> can<00:02:56.150> move<00:02:56.359> it<00:02:56.480> around

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
color and then I ended up going back to

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.870 
color and then I ended up going back to
a<00:04:48.990> darker<00:04:49.290> color<00:04:49.320> like<00:04:49.650> I<00:04:49.770> usually<00:04:49.890> used<00:04:50.310> then

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
a darker color like I usually used then

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.600 
a darker color like I usually used then
I<00:04:50.910> added<00:04:51.060> blush<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.570> her<00:04:51.660> skin<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:53.340> added<00:04:53.550> a

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
I added blush to her skin and I added a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.280 
I added blush to her skin and I added a
lot<00:04:53.730> of<00:04:53.790> shine<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.450> her<00:04:54.600> tentacles<00:04:55.140> because

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
lot of shine to her tentacles because

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.830 
lot of shine to her tentacles because
tentacles<00:04:55.860> are<00:04:55.919> usually<00:04:56.160> really<00:04:56.280> slimy<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.330> if

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
tentacles are usually really slimy so if

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.870 
tentacles are usually really slimy so if
something's<00:04:58.350> wet<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.890> slimy<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.520> should<00:04:59.700> be<00:04:59.850> a

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
something's wet and slimy it should be a

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.640 
something's wet and slimy it should be a
little<00:05:00.120> bit<00:05:00.210> more<00:05:00.330> glossy<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.140> added<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.500> lot

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
little bit more glossy so I added a lot

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.140 
little bit more glossy so I added a lot
of<00:05:01.740> shine<00:05:01.950> to<00:05:01.980> that<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.490> was<00:05:02.580> just<00:05:02.640> a<00:05:02.850> very<00:05:03.030> very

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.840 
of shine to that it was just a very very
light<00:05:03.510> blue<00:05:03.840> color<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.680> then<00:05:04.830> I'm<00:05:05.460> adding<00:05:05.610> the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
light blue color and then I'm adding the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.030 
light blue color and then I'm adding the
makeup<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.480> her<00:05:06.720> face<00:05:07.169> because<00:05:07.530> she<00:05:07.590> wears<00:05:07.980> a

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
makeup to her face because she wears a

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.950 
makeup to her face because she wears a
lot<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.250> makeup<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.700> Hermes<00:05:09.030> when<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.780> made

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
lot of makeup in Hermes when I made

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.330 
lot of makeup in Hermes when I made
Hermes<00:05:10.230> and<00:05:10.530> then

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
Hermes and then

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.700 
Hermes and then
originally<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.510> Me's<00:05:12.660> had<00:05:13.020> really<00:05:13.500> bright

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
originally the Me's had really bright

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.130 
originally the Me's had really bright
pink<00:05:14.250> long<00:05:14.730> eyelashes<00:05:15.480> but<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:16.020> really

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
pink long eyelashes but that really

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.570 
pink long eyelashes but that really
wasn't<00:05:16.350> sticking<00:05:16.740> out<00:05:16.860> from<00:05:16.980> her<00:05:17.160> hair<00:05:17.340> so<00:05:17.550> I

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
wasn't sticking out from her hair so I

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.980 
wasn't sticking out from her hair so I
changed<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.150> blue<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.450> took<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.720> little<00:05:18.840> bit

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
changed it to blue I took a little bit

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.870 
changed it to blue I took a little bit
of<00:05:19.050> Liberty<00:05:19.410> but<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.340> blue<00:05:20.490> worked

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
of Liberty but and the blue worked

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.150 
of Liberty but and the blue worked
I<00:05:20.910> think<00:05:21.180> they<00:05:21.330> stick<00:05:21.570> out<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.750> lot<00:05:21.990> better<00:05:22.160> for

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
I think they stick out a lot better for

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.120 
I think they stick out a lot better for
the<00:05:23.430> outfit<00:05:24.200> this<00:05:25.200> is<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.530> very<00:05:25.830> first<00:05:26.010> time

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
the outfit this is the very first time

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.200 
the outfit this is the very first time
I've<00:05:26.280> ever<00:05:26.400> tried<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.820> draw<00:05:26.970> something

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
I've ever tried to draw something

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.820 
I've ever tried to draw something
glittery<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.410> think<00:05:28.560> it<00:05:28.620> turned<00:05:28.770> out

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
glittery and I think it turned out

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.219 
glittery and I think it turned out
really<00:05:28.890> well<00:05:29.070> I<00:05:29.460> used<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:30.210> darker<00:05:30.600> color<00:05:30.930> than<00:05:31.110> I

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
really well I used a darker color than I

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.620 
really well I used a darker color than I
wanted<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.770> filled<00:05:32.250> in<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.669> area<00:05:33.030> of<00:05:33.090> her

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
wanted and filled in the area of her

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.050 
wanted and filled in the area of her
best<00:05:33.840> thing<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.410> then<00:05:35.100> I<00:05:35.130> made<00:05:35.490> another<00:05:35.520> layer

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
best thing and then I made another layer

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.820 
best thing and then I made another layer
and<00:05:36.330> made<00:05:36.540> it<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.780> lighter<00:05:36.990> color<00:05:37.290> and<00:05:37.680> then<00:05:37.800> I

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
and made it a lighter color and then I

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.740 
and made it a lighter color and then I
took<00:05:37.950> the<00:05:38.190> layer<00:05:38.400> that<00:05:38.640> was<00:05:38.760> darker<00:05:39.300> which<00:05:39.600> was

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
took the layer that was darker which was

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.310 
took the layer that was darker which was
on<00:05:39.870> top<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:41.070> hit<00:05:41.490> the<00:05:41.840> in<00:05:42.840> Photoshop

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
on top and I hit the in Photoshop

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.860 
on top and I hit the in Photoshop
there's<00:05:43.560> an<00:05:43.650> overlay<00:05:44.040> called<00:05:44.310> dissolve<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:45.840> I

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
there's an overlay called dissolve so I

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.580 
there's an overlay called dissolve so I
used<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.169> dissolve<00:05:47.360> overlay<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.660> set<00:05:49.290> it<00:05:49.500> to

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
used the dissolve overlay and set it to

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.340 
used the dissolve overlay and set it to
like<00:05:49.770> I'm<00:05:50.400> probably<00:05:50.669> about<00:05:50.910> 70%<00:05:51.510> maybe<00:05:52.050> and

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
like I'm probably about 70% maybe and

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.860 
like I'm probably about 70% maybe and
then<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:53.220> makes<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:53.790> just<00:05:53.970> very<00:05:54.150> pixely<00:05:54.630> and

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
then that makes it just very pixely and

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.480 
then that makes it just very pixely and
you<00:05:54.930> can<00:05:55.080> see<00:05:55.260> through<00:05:55.500> it<00:05:55.530> so<00:05:56.160> that<00:05:56.310> way<00:05:56.400> you

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
you can see through it so that way you

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.340 
you can see through it so that way you
can<00:05:56.610> see<00:05:56.729> through<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.060> dark<00:05:57.300> layer<00:05:57.479> to<00:05:57.990> the

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
can see through the dark layer to the

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.320 
can see through the dark layer to the
light<00:05:58.530> layer<00:05:58.740> underneath<00:05:59.729> so<00:06:00.060> it<00:06:00.150> makes<00:06:00.270> it

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
light layer underneath so it makes it

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.640 
light layer underneath so it makes it
look<00:06:00.390> glittery<00:06:00.720> and<00:06:01.200> then<00:06:01.290> it<00:06:01.380> make<00:06:01.470> a<00:06:01.500> little

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
look glittery and then it make a little

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.330 
look glittery and then it make a little
bit<00:06:01.800> more<00:06:01.919> Glary

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
bit more Glary

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.920 
bit more Glary
I<00:06:02.460> made<00:06:02.760> another<00:06:03.000> layer<00:06:03.240> on<00:06:03.360> top<00:06:03.450> of<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:03.660> of<00:06:03.840> a

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
I made another layer on top of that of a

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.540 
I made another layer on top of that of a
bright<00:06:04.200> white<00:06:04.380> and<00:06:04.650> add<00:06:04.979> a<00:06:05.010> little<00:06:05.250> shines

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
bright white and add a little shines

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.490 
bright white and add a little shines
that<00:06:05.850> were<00:06:05.970> just<00:06:06.150> like<00:06:06.330> random<00:06:07.080> all<00:06:07.229> around

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
that were just like random all around

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.960 
that were just like random all around
the<00:06:07.590> glitter<00:06:07.800> that<00:06:08.010> took<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.460> while<00:06:08.580> longer<00:06:08.790> to

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
the glitter that took a while longer to

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.850 
the glitter that took a while longer to
explain<00:06:09.150> that<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.419> was<00:06:09.510> expecting<00:06:09.990> everything

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
explain that I was expecting everything

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.880 
explain that I was expecting everything
and<00:06:11.220> just<00:06:12.090> finishing<00:06:12.930> up<00:06:13.020> with<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.169> wings<00:06:13.500> I

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
and just finishing up with the wings I

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.350 
and just finishing up with the wings I
think<00:06:14.100> just<00:06:14.460> about<00:06:14.550> done<00:06:14.790> with<00:06:14.820> this<00:06:15.000> picture

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
think just about done with this picture

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.730 
think just about done with this picture
that<00:06:15.660> overlay<00:06:15.930> thing<00:06:16.110> probably<00:06:16.410> didn't<00:06:16.650> make

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
that overlay thing probably didn't make

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.230 
that overlay thing probably didn't make
sense<00:06:16.919> if<00:06:17.280> you<00:06:17.430> don't<00:06:17.580> know<00:06:17.669> Photoshop<00:06:17.970> this

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
sense if you don't know Photoshop this

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.800 
sense if you don't know Photoshop this
but<00:06:18.570> I'm<00:06:19.500> sorry<00:06:19.740> trying<00:06:20.190> to<00:06:20.250> be<00:06:20.310> helpful<00:06:20.810> again

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
but I'm sorry trying to be helpful again

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.750 
but I'm sorry trying to be helpful again
the<00:06:21.930> pink<00:06:22.140> wings<00:06:22.350> didn't<00:06:22.800> stand<00:06:23.010> out<00:06:23.160> from<00:06:23.460> her

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
the pink wings didn't stand out from her

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.520 
the pink wings didn't stand out from her
large<00:06:24.210> amount<00:06:24.540> of<00:06:24.630> hair<00:06:24.810> so<00:06:24.990> I<00:06:25.050> had<00:06:25.200> to<00:06:25.290> change

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
large amount of hair so I had to change

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.860 
large amount of hair so I had to change
that<00:06:25.590> to<00:06:25.950> a<00:06:26.250> color<00:06:26.760> more<00:06:27.060> similar<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.510> her<00:06:27.630> skin

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
that to a color more similar to her skin

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.450 
that to a color more similar to her skin
and<00:06:27.990> saw<00:06:28.140> the<00:06:28.200> blue<00:06:28.410> color<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:28.860> now<00:06:29.310> they

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
and saw the blue color and now they

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.950 
and saw the blue color and now they
stick<00:06:29.640> out<00:06:29.700> a<00:06:29.760> little<00:06:29.850> bit<00:06:30.120> better<00:06:30.240> just<00:06:30.720> going

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
stick out a little bit better just going

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.870 
stick out a little bit better just going
through<00:06:30.990> over<00:06:31.560> like<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:32.130> entire<00:06:32.430> picture<00:06:32.700> and

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
through over like the entire picture and

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.580 
through over like the entire picture and
just<00:06:33.120> adding<00:06:33.390> a<00:06:33.419> little<00:06:33.450> bit<00:06:33.690> of<00:06:33.780> details<00:06:34.229> and
