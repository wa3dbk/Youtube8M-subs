particular material the same material
that<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.950> case<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> made<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> which<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that this case is made out of which is a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.670 
that this case is made out of which is a
thermoplastic<00:00:43.610> elastomer<00:00:44.660> material<00:00:45.680> which

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
thermoplastic elastomer material which

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130 
thermoplastic elastomer material which
differs<00:00:47.129> from<00:00:47.460> your<00:00:47.640> traditional<00:00:48.090> TPU<00:00:48.840> case

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
differs from your traditional TPU case

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.650 
differs from your traditional TPU case
and<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.559> TPU<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.399> thermoplastic<00:00:50.760> urethane

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and that TPU is thermoplastic urethane

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.279 
and that TPU is thermoplastic urethane
this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:53.039> elastomer<00:00:53.699> material<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
this is more of an elastomer material so

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.250 
this is more of an elastomer material so
um<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.860> wasn't<00:00:56.280> quite<00:00:56.520> expecting<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
um I wasn't quite expecting to like this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.170 
um I wasn't quite expecting to like this
case<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.770> much<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.430> I've<00:00:59.670> been<00:00:59.820> rocking

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.150 
so there you go
let's<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.410> ahead<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.680> pull<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.830> out<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
let's go ahead and pull it out of the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.970 
let's go ahead and pull it out of the
package<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.790> take<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> look<00:02:15.840> at<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.080> as<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.890> can

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
package and take a look at it as you can

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.810 
package and take a look at it as you can
see<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.940> fairly<00:02:18.570> rigid<00:02:18.990> case<00:02:19.920> more<00:02:20.310> rigid

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
see it is a fairly rigid case more rigid

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.810 
see it is a fairly rigid case more rigid
than<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:21.630> TPU<00:02:22.260> case<00:02:22.710> or<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> silicone<00:02:23.550> case

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
than a TPU case or a silicone case

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.760 
than a TPU case or a silicone case
silicone<00:02:24.270> cases<00:02:24.660> are<00:02:24.960> very<00:02:25.080> squishy<00:02:25.590> and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
silicone cases are very squishy and

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.950 
silicone cases are very squishy and
attract<00:02:26.640> lint<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.630> forth<00:02:27.720> I

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
attract lint and so on and so forth I

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.140 
attract lint and so on and so forth I
don't<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.260> silicone<00:02:28.890> cases<00:02:29.100> at<00:02:29.340> all<00:02:29.460> not<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
don't like silicone cases at all not a

don't like silicone cases at all not a
