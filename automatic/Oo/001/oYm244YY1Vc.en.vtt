so<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:16.570> those<00:01:16.659> of<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.049> is<00:01:17.110> out<00:01:17.320> there

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
so for those of you that is out there

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.399 
so for those of you that is out there
you<00:01:18.040> know<00:01:18.130> trying<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.460> accomplish<00:01:18.790> your<00:01:19.030> goals

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you know trying to accomplish your goals

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.280 
you know trying to accomplish your goals
and<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.880> think<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.420> can<00:01:22.600> just<00:01:22.630> do<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.140> by

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
and you think that you can just do it by

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.000 
and you think that you can just do it by
diet<00:01:23.530> alone<00:01:24.390> i<00:01:25.390> really<00:01:26.260> suggest<00:01:26.440> that<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.860> do

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
diet alone i really suggest that you do

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.370 
diet alone i really suggest that you do
some<00:01:27.190> research<00:01:27.400> because<00:01:28.000> i<00:01:28.270> think<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:29.170> you

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
some research because i think that you

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.550 
some research because i think that you
know<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.850> you<00:01:31.090> accomplish<00:01:31.720> your<00:01:31.930> goals<00:01:32.260> and

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
know if you accomplish your goals and

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.170 
know if you accomplish your goals and
get<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.890> weight<00:01:33.100> that<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.430> want<00:01:33.700> by<00:01:33.939> diet

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
get to the weight that you want by diet

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.469 
get to the weight that you want by diet
alone<00:01:35.400> you'll<00:01:36.400> probably<00:01:36.700> potentially<00:01:37.240> put<00:01:37.390> it

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
alone you'll probably potentially put it

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.300 
alone you'll probably potentially put it
back<00:01:37.630> on<00:01:37.659> because<00:01:38.470> once<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.920> get<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.220> your

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
back on because once you get to your

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.050 
back on because once you get to your
weight<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.689> will<00:01:41.220> start<00:01:42.220> eating<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:43.030> know

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
weight you will start eating you know

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.690 
weight you will start eating you know
the<00:01:43.330> way<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.510> used<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.110> eat<00:01:44.200> before<00:01:44.700> typically

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
the way you used to eat before typically

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.249 
the way you used to eat before typically
and<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.470> just<00:01:47.680> start<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.610> slowly<00:01:49.259> gain

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
and then you just start to slowly gain

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.609 
and then you just start to slowly gain
weight<00:01:50.470> again<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:51.900> you<00:01:52.900> know<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.290> only<00:01:53.409> way

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
weight again and you know the only way

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.100 
weight again and you know the only way
you<00:01:53.680> can<00:01:54.070> maintain<00:01:54.670> weight<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.750> know<00:01:55.900> is

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.780 
day I probably if I'm lucky half the
calorie<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:29.380> take<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.709> on<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> loud<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.580> I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
calorie and take that on the loud so I

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.020 
calorie and take that on the loud so I
think<00:02:31.180> it's<00:02:31.450> why<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:32.170> know<00:02:32.319> in<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:33.580> 30<00:02:33.819> days
