00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.370
 sat and guys unboxing videos today is 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.580
 arrived a USB 3.0 hard drive from 2 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.580
 terabyte 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.070
 you will wonder why I bought usp 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.119
 train thunderbolt because the disks 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.679
 thunderbolt cost an eye of the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.510
 head a disc from've seen with him 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.899
 like six times six seven times more 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.910
 I paid this at 117 euros the same 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.489
 santander boss would have been at least 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 according to me 700 if not 800 euros then 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:53.010
 in short it is not really the case that if a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.920
 equipped bought in the united states it 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:21.119
 see the ram comes out 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:21.689
 here it is convenient founder bot 2 terabyte yes 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:30.829
 it's done 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:32.579
 sorry usb3 here it is open 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.119
 of course these did only for 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.119
 right 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.560
 compatible also for me cellino for me 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.510
 he has become king since those others 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.330
 important and half then 7.200 laps 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:14.459
 if you want controversy don't buy discs 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:22.200
 so brought there because I'm at 5400 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:24.180
 turn usb 3 port as you see blue i do n't know 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.239
 because mac has trouble setting fire 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.750
 however it is blue and this is the entrance 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.520
 micro usb 3 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.150
 I would like to let you see it better but I don't have 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.610
 understood because here he has problems putting 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.480
 On fire 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:45.620
 here it is said because blue usb trains 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.830
 as the standard color then we see 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:03:02.500
 I don't care about free antivirus 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:03:07.770
 connection wants 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.810
 power button on the back usb3 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.230
 power supply kensington of agrate 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:25.320
 ventilation and nothing else 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:28.240
 we want the plastic ok then guys 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.360
 I connected the disk I can't get to 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.310
 install the program of the v 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.890
 western digital 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.170
 I don't know why there is also an option here 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.940
 it's called western digital plus tour 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.520
 this weapon doesn't work for me that 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.520
 this despite being all stuff for mac 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.840
 however I do a speed test 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.930
 this track I downloaded black 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.530
 magic speedtest downloaded from mark up 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.540
 store 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.560
 but now a speed test on a 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.560
 disk usb 2.0 lacie screams is 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.180
 in short it pronounces itself on little asia that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.150
 it is a brand and anyway also recommended 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.980
 from apple so this is a good record 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.190
 are two partitions given the programs 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:24.520
 unloaded but in short, I choose this one 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:26.950
 speed test 31 megabytes per second 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.060
 of course we talk about megabytes not 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.500
 megabit 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.760
 let's talk about real speed of 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:36.460
 data transfer 31 megabytes 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.520
 so we are more or less there on 33 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:46.150
 megabyte and writing and 31 in reading 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:52.150
 as you can see we now select the new one 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:55.140
 disc has a title anti telit is fine 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.140
 I ca n't pronounce it 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.650
 who comes around and about 100 megs is 100 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.440
 100 megabytes and passes as you see is 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.220
 theoretically this has enough 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.400
 of 5 gigabits, however, water never arrives 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.180
 from the aforementioned also other reasons first 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.730
 of all the disk is not ssd but it is a disk 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.070
 magnetic and therefore still fails to 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.400
 guarantee a maximum speed not 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.400
 we also know if it is connected in sata ii 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.750
 a sata3 inside the kers could 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.550
 this also affects more naturally 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.740
 the speed of the internal disk, however 111 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.960
 110 in short, under 100 megabytes per 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:48.140
 second year great success of this well 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.140
 that's all 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.710
 I chose this record as I said 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.650
 because thunderbolt really shows 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.640
 too much and I got tired of having records 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:02.100
 floppy disks this from the lacie is from 250gb 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.840
 and then or the old disco the macmini la 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.110
 80 gigabytes 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.730
 I didn't want to stay for 3,500 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.740
 peripherals I prefer to have only one 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.720
 2 terabyte disk 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.130
 in short, I can put everything in it 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.880
 what I want I can also do one 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:21.290
 partition for this time machine well 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.290
 that's all for the next video
