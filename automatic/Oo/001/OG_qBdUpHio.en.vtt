00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.109
 the berlin fragrance of shy are you get in 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.450
 the package is more dynamic and the lid is 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.220
 that's why for this tutorial we 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.929
 we inspire in their colors and in the 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.929
 personality that has behind 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.700
 I'm going to take a little bit of the base found 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.740
 in beige control of a little bit of this 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.900
 right base now it's going to serve me as 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.970
 prebase for my shadows after 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.920
 xavier colors and and lasts much longer 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.920
 but above all they look more intense 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.390
 apply everywhere where you go to 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.090
 apply men 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.790
 now let's use the shadow palette 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.560
 all o'clock in the nissan I'm going to use 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.410
 this yellow here that is a color 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.020
 quite alive and striking very similar 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.080
 to the color of the new container lid 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.229
 of the gerling fragrance so I'm going to 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.780
 tap the mobile eyelid 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.860
 as well as they are seeing it until it is 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.860
 very intense the color 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.320
 m 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.899
 tip tip tip a gerling girl sings with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.130
 your hearing aids down the street does not matter 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.130
 that people are watching 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.310
 next I'm going to take a mix 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.950
 between this gray color of here and this 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.560
 magenta color here a little touch 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.229
 here a little touch for her and this is going 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.320
 to give a unique color which we are going to 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.080
 use to do a good depth 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.290
 particular only in the corner of the eye 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.090
 so in this way that's going to open the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.570
 eyes in an impressive way is going to 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.800
 give you expression without looking too 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.800
 loaded makeup 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.920
 Blurs Blurs and Blurs Remember 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.490
 that sometimes the key to a 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.910
 makeup look beautiful and professional 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.010
 is in blur the colors very well 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.400
 now from the six club shadow palette 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.440
 in mystery ice I'm going to take this purple 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.670
 which is very similar to the color of 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.470
 little bottle of the berlin reservoir and I'm going to 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.950
 delineate under the lashes 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.680
 inferiors with this beautiful purple color 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.680
 that is very well intense so 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.430
 this color combination is not very 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.310
 normal and apparently strange 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.800
 but to see how cute this is 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.020
 let's continue dancing and enjoying the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.100
 music now I'm going to line up with the 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.580
 eyeliner twist in black attraction 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.070
 black abstraction and delineating well 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.200
 critical the upper lashes very very 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.520
 stick the eyelashes because no 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.220
 we want an outline too 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.830
 exaggerated but to help us highlight 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.820
 the eyelashes and that helps us look 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.980
 that we have more and that they are more grandiose 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.010
 so I'm going to line up also in the 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.840
 water line for more shadows 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.110
 Expressive 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.110
 i 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.959
 see how it is gradually taking shape 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.750
 this makeup now the volume mask 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.730
 and accord in brown mania is the one that's going 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.790
 to serve to comb my eyebrows I'm going to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.440
 bring some color of form and this 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.430
 will perfectly frame the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.430
 makeup of my eyes 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.549
 I gave him several layers of mask with the 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.580
 live power or in official black to my 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.790
 eyelashes and this is the final touch for 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.190
 the makeup of the eyes never ever 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.710
 never apply 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.590
 shadows on the eyes without a mask looks 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.720
 terrible girls do not do it now with 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.570
 the undercover powders that are about 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.660
 translucent powders let's take the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.240
 shine that we do not like about the face 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.280
 now with chic girl bug in blogs and 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.640
 I'm going to put a little color in the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.640
 cheeks 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:40.329
 but look how nice is this 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.459
 I really liked makeup 

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:45.249
 Now I'm going to put a good color 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:47.619
 neutral to the lips I'm using the 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.109
 extra time in extra pitch which is a 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:52.089
 nude color super cute but this color 

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:55.089
 so tranquilito let's add a 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:58.589
 spectacular shine with leeds ibi 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:05:01.179
 in serious and it is a color that has 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:03.549
 glimpses golden glimmers super 

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:06.219
 cute brings shine to the lips but 

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:08.469
 besides a very subtle color that when 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.689
 move your lips so it blinks a little 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:13.449
 of purple that goes super well with the 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:16.449
 makeup of the eyes and look look 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.179
