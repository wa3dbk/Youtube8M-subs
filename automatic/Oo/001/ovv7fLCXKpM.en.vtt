secondly<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:45.060> are<00:01:45.180> many<00:01:45.390> different

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
secondly there are many different

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
secondly there are many different
circuit<00:01:46.049> variations<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.740> Dan<00:01:47.040> pointed<00:01:47.250> out

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
circuit variations as Dan pointed out

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.300 
circuit variations as Dan pointed out

but also in 1971 they reduced the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.190 
but also in 1971 they reduced the
negative<00:01:50.670> feedback<00:01:50.909> which<00:01:51.390> gave<00:01:51.720> these<00:01:51.930> amps

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
negative feedback which gave these amps

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.929 
negative feedback which gave these amps
more<00:01:52.470> bite<00:01:52.710> they're<00:01:53.130> brighter<00:01:53.520> more

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
more bite they're brighter more

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.539
