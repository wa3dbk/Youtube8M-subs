00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
probably the best in their tier um I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
probably the best in their tier um I
mean<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.140> could<00:01:01.230> say<00:01:01.410> tack<00:01:01.680> mass<00:01:01.920> maybe<00:01:02.219> it's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
mean you could say tack mass maybe it's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.319 
mean you could say tack mass maybe it's
better<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:02.940> there's<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.270> many

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
better just because there's so many

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.609 
better just because there's so many
chalk<00:01:03.600> charges<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> stuff<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
chalk charges and stuff like that and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.679 
chalk charges and stuff like that and
stuns<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.220> um<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.119> Terry<00:01:06.390> out<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
stuns but um I think it's Terry out of

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.730 
stuns but um I think it's Terry out of
all<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.020> probably<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> best<00:01:07.530> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
all of them is probably the best so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.560 
all of them is probably the best so
these<00:01:08.280> perks<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:08.909> recommend<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.510> you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.070 
the skills you time using a pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.430> best<00:02:35.670> i<00:02:35.940> would<00:02:36.900> say

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
self-explanatory the best i would say

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.110 
self-explanatory the best i would say
the<00:02:37.230> best<00:02:37.410> kill<00:02:37.710> streaks<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.520> scorestreaks<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the best kill streaks or scorestreaks to

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.960 
the best kill streaks or scorestreaks to
use<00:02:39.440> if<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.770> if<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.190> get<00:02:41.340> them<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:41.940> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
use if you can if you can get them on a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.550 
use if you can if you can get them on a
consistent<00:02:42.300> basis<00:02:42.810> because<00:02:42.960> some<00:02:43.200> people<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
consistent basis because some people you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.750 
consistent basis because some people you
know<00:02:43.680> aren't<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> best<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.400> game<00:02:44.580> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
know aren't the best of this game and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.520 
know aren't the best of this game and
can't<00:02:44.970> really<00:02:45.030> get<00:02:45.240> these<00:02:45.810> tricks<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.470> you

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
can't really get these tricks but if you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.750 
can't really get these tricks but if you
know<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.920> you're<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.280> an<00:02:47.400> above<00:02:47.640> average

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
know if you're like an above average

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.310 
know if you're like an above average
player<00:02:48.120> i<00:02:48.240> bet<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.720> most<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.020> could<00:02:49.200> get

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
player i bet like most you could get

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.930 
player i bet like most you could get
these<00:02:49.440> kill<00:02:49.650> streak<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.010> pretty<00:02:50.760> much<00:02:50.820> what

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
these kill streak so pretty much what

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.270 
these kill streak so pretty much what
they<00:02:51.060> are<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.450> orbital<00:02:51.750> vsat<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.800> k-9

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
they are is the orbital vsat the k-9

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.020 
they are is the orbital vsat the k-9
unit<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.180> swarm<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.830> pretty<00:02:56.130> much<00:02:56.190> once

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
unit and the swarm and pretty much once

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.280 
unit and the swarm and pretty much once
you<00:02:57.120> get<00:02:57.270> your<00:02:57.330> orbital<00:02:57.690> vsat<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.110> pretty

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
you get your orbital vsat you pretty

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.420 
you get your orbital vsat you pretty
much<00:02:58.320> can<00:02:58.500> get<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.710> rest<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> killstreaks

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
much can get the rest of the killstreaks

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.340 
much can get the rest of the killstreaks
if<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.640> play<00:02:59.880> um<00:03:00.150> if<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.020> play<00:03:01.230> like

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
if you play um if you play like

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.710 
if you play um if you play like
conservatively<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:01.980> smart<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:03.360> can<00:03:03.510> pretty

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
conservatively and smart you can pretty

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.120 
conservatively and smart you can pretty
much<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.140> know<00:03:04.260> look<00:03:04.500> at<00:03:04.590> your<00:03:04.680> mini-map<00:03:04.950> and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
much you know look at your mini-map and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.560 
much you know look at your mini-map and
see<00:03:05.250> where<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:05.430> are<00:03:05.460> exactly<00:03:06.000> because<00:03:06.180> it's

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
see where they are exactly because it's

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.150 
see where they are exactly because it's
the<00:03:06.720> if<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.350> guys<00:03:07.500> don't<00:03:07.590> know<00:03:07.710> what<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
the if you guys don't know what the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.650 
the if you guys don't know what the
b-side<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.520> I've<00:03:08.790> been<00:03:08.820> mostly<00:03:09.270> deal<00:03:09.480> with

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
b-side is I've been mostly deal with

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.720 
b-side is I've been mostly deal with
those<00:03:10.500> are<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.740> for<00:03:11.220> those<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:11.550> that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730

those are you for those of you that
don't<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.690> blackboard<00:03:13.380> from<00:03:13.500> black<00:03:14.160> ops<00:03:14.370> 1

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
don't it's a blackboard from black ops 1

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.190 
don't it's a blackboard from black ops 1
so<00:03:14.850> that's<00:03:15.090> all<00:03:15.240> 71<00:03:15.600> or<00:03:15.780> whatever<00:03:16.020> II<00:03:16.080> won't

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
so that's all 71 or whatever II won't

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.920 
so that's all 71 or whatever II won't
call<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.710> if<00:03:17.460> you<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.880> know<00:03:17.910> use<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.360> to

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
call it so if you you know use it to

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.420 
call it so if you you know use it to
your<00:03:18.990> advantage<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.710> play<00:03:19.920> Somali<00:03:20.220> with

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
your advantage and you play Somali with

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.580 
your advantage and you play Somali with
it<00:03:20.550> um<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:21.150> will<00:03:21.300> get<00:03:21.450> your<00:03:21.600> swarm<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.230> once

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
it um you will get your swarm and once

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.050 
it um you will get your swarm and once
you<00:03:22.650> hear<00:03:22.800> swarm<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.190> pretty<00:03:23.700> much<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:23.850> go

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
ham so um yeah really good class load

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.430 
ham so um yeah really good class load
I'd<00:03:26.610> ever<00:03:26.790> recommend<00:03:27.510> using<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:27.960> what<00:03:28.410> I
