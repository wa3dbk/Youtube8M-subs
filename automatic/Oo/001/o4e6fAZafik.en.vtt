00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.240 
the recession so now he has to get back
into<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.840> game<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.560> think<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.920> story<00:02:53.190> is

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
into the game so I think the story is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.920 
into the game so I think the story is
going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.459> fall<00:02:53.700> under<00:02:54.030> maybe<00:02:54.450> one<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.750> those

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
going to fall under maybe one of those

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.660 
going to fall under maybe one of those
three<00:02:55.170> categories<00:02:55.349> but<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.040> actually<00:02:56.190> notice

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
three categories but I actually notice

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.430 
three categories but I actually notice
another<00:02:56.910> character<00:02:57.540> there's<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.079> guy<00:02:58.230> that's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
another character there's a guy that's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.930 
another character there's a guy that's
in<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.620> red<00:02:58.799> convertible<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.819> actually

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
in a red convertible and it actually

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.610 
in a red convertible and it actually
shows<00:03:00.299> them<00:03:00.480> twice<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.900> shows<00:03:01.079> them<00:03:01.260> sitting

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
shows them twice it shows them sitting

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.009 
shows them twice it shows them sitting
at<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.799> stoplight<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.329> shows<00:03:03.540> him<00:03:03.750> being

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
at a stoplight and it shows him being

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.319 
at a stoplight and it shows him being
chased<00:03:04.290> by<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.500> cops<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> mean<00:03:06.090> there's<00:03:06.269> a

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
chased by the cops so I mean there's a

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.940 
chased by the cops so I mean there's a
lot<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.510> rumors<00:03:06.900> going<00:03:06.930> around<00:03:07.290> about<00:03:07.560> there

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
lot of rumors going around about there

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.949
