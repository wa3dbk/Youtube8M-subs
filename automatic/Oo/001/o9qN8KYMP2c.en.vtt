I was showing you this new steel trestle
and<00:00:16.449> I<00:00:16.779> was<00:00:16.960> excited<00:00:17.260> about<00:00:17.500> starting<00:00:17.650> scenery

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
and I was excited about starting scenery

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.670 
and I was excited about starting scenery
work<00:00:18.789> around<00:00:19.180> the<00:00:19.300> trestle<00:00:19.720> but<00:00:20.380> I<00:00:20.410> haven't

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
work around the trestle but I haven't

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.320

done much work in the last couple weeks
for<00:00:22.779> two<00:00:22.840> main<00:00:23.169> reasons<00:00:23.220> first<00:00:24.220> of<00:00:24.369> all<00:00:24.460> I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
for two main reasons first of all I

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.339 
for two main reasons first of all I
still<00:00:24.820> have<00:00:25.029> some<00:00:25.270> scenery<00:00:25.570> supplies<00:00:26.080> that<00:00:26.320> I

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
still have some scenery supplies that I

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.080 
still have some scenery supplies that I
have<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:26.710> order<00:00:27.009> before<00:00:27.220> I<00:00:27.400> can<00:00:27.610> start<00:00:27.849> work

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090

and<00:00:28.869> secondly<00:00:29.380> and<00:00:29.590> most<00:00:29.740> importantly<00:00:29.919> I've

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
and secondly and most importantly I've

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.030 
and secondly and most importantly I've
deliberately<00:00:31.630> taken<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.140> time<00:00:32.439> out<00:00:32.649> from<00:00:32.920> this

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040

section of the way out for a couple
weeks<00:00:34.510> just<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:35.590> collect<00:00:35.920> my<00:00:36.070> thoughts<00:00:36.309> and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
weeks just to collect my thoughts and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.250 
weeks just to collect my thoughts and
make<00:00:36.850> sure<00:00:37.030> that<00:00:37.180> I'm<00:00:37.300> not<00:00:37.510> doing<00:00:37.870> anything

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
make sure that I'm not doing anything

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.740 
make sure that I'm not doing anything
impulsively<00:00:39.070> that<00:00:39.820> might<00:00:40.180> result<00:00:40.540> in

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
impulsively that might result in

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.270 
impulsively that might result in
mistakes<00:00:41.200> that<00:00:41.410> would<00:00:41.500> come<00:00:41.710> back<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:41.950> haunt

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
mistakes that would come back to haunt

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.340 
mistakes that would come back to haunt
me<00:00:42.520> later<00:00:42.730> because<00:00:43.480> over<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:43.840> years<00:00:43.870> I've

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
me later because over the years I've

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.560 
me later because over the years I've
sort<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.710> learned<00:00:44.920> that<00:00:45.100> if<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.550> approach<00:00:46.329> a

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
sort of learned that if you approach a

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.819 
sort of learned that if you approach a
section<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.140> layout<00:00:47.440> with<00:00:47.589> a<00:00:47.620> lot<00:00:47.800> of

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
section of the layout with a lot of

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.069 
section of the layout with a lot of
excitement<00:00:48.339> and<00:00:48.640> emotion<00:00:49.089> you<00:00:49.780> are<00:00:49.870> more

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
excitement and emotion you are more

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.750 
excitement and emotion you are more
prone<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.589> make<00:00:50.739> mistakes<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.429> will<00:00:51.550> come

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
prone to make mistakes that will come

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.669 
prone to make mistakes that will come
back<00:00:51.910> to<00:00:51.969> haunt<00:00:52.269> you<00:00:52.539> an<00:00:52.719> example<00:00:53.350> might<00:00:53.649> be

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
back to haunt you an example might be

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.009 
back to haunt you an example might be
wiring<00:00:54.219> you<00:00:54.999> know<00:00:55.120> I<00:00:55.149> could<00:00:55.449> throw<00:00:55.629> up<00:00:55.749> a<00:00:55.839> bunch

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
wiring you know I could throw up a bunch

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.290 
wiring you know I could throw up a bunch
of<00:00:56.109> scenery<00:00:56.499> here<00:00:56.739> really<00:00:57.010> quickly<00:00:57.339> but<00:00:58.149> then

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
of scenery here really quickly but then

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.989 
of scenery here really quickly but then
later<00:00:58.809> on<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:59.140> might<00:00:59.530> discover<00:00:59.769> that<00:01:00.219> I<00:01:00.429> want<00:01:00.879> to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
later on I might discover that I want to

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:02.639 
later on I might discover that I want to
have<00:01:01.269> some<00:01:01.510> wiring<00:01:01.780> in<00:01:02.230> there

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
have some wiring in there

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.740 
have some wiring in there
to<00:01:02.949> power<00:01:03.159> some<00:01:03.429> accessories<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.330> then<00:01:04.629> I'd

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
to power some accessories and then I'd

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.780 
to power some accessories and then I'd
have<00:01:04.870> to<00:01:05.019> go<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.409> tear<00:01:05.620> up<00:01:05.770> what<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:05.950> did<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.580> put

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
have to go and tear up what I did to put

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.390 
have to go and tear up what I did to put
the<00:01:06.880> wiring<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:08.350> by<00:01:08.590> taking<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:09.100> time

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
the wiring in and so by taking a time

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.430 
the wiring in and so by taking a time
out<00:01:09.430> from<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:10.000> section<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.870> allows<00:01:11.200> me<00:01:11.409> to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
out from this section it allows me to

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.960 
out from this section it allows me to
just<00:01:11.770> think<00:01:12.100> about<00:01:12.220> it<00:01:12.490> for<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.640> couple<00:01:12.940> weeks

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
just think about it for a couple weeks

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.300 
just think about it for a couple weeks
and<00:01:13.360> hopefully<00:01:14.320> avoid<00:01:14.710> some<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.130> those

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
and hopefully avoid some of those

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.370 
and hopefully avoid some of those
mistakes<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:16.060> might<00:01:16.270> come<00:01:16.840> back<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.050> bite<00:01:17.200> me

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
mistakes that might come back to bite me

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.380 
mistakes that might come back to bite me
in<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.620> butt<00:01:17.860> later<00:01:17.920> on<00:01:18.370> down<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.579> road<00:01:18.880> and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
in the butt later on down the road and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.880 
in the butt later on down the road and
keep<00:01:19.570> in<00:01:19.750> mind<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.259> just<00:01:20.469> because<00:01:20.560> I'm

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
keep in mind that just because I'm

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.590 
keep in mind that just because I'm
taking<00:01:21.219> two<00:01:21.430> weeks<00:01:21.460> off<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:22.210> section

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
taking two weeks off of this section

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.179 
taking two weeks off of this section
doesn't<00:01:22.869> mean<00:01:23.110> I'm<00:01:23.229> taking<00:01:23.590> two<00:01:23.770> weeks<00:01:23.799> off

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
doesn't mean I'm taking two weeks off

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.520 
doesn't mean I'm taking two weeks off

the layout all the way across the table

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.389 
the layout all the way across the table
and<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:40.329> is<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.960> ridge<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.409> supports<00:01:42.219> the

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
and that is the ridge that supports the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.370 
and that is the ridge that supports the
second<00:01:42.820> level<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.149> track<00:01:43.450> for<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.899> upper<00:01:44.140> loop

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
second level of track for the upper loop

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.310 
second level of track for the upper loop
and<00:01:44.649> that's<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.789> same<00:01:46.000> track<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.869> runs<00:01:47.109> over

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
and that's the same track that runs over

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.760 
and that's the same track that runs over
here<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:47.950> across<00:01:48.700> this<00:01:48.939> trestle<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:50.530> comes

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
here and across this trestle it comes

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
here and across this trestle it comes
over<00:01:51.070> here<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.609> then<00:01:51.850> crosses<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.630> Ridge

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
over here and then crosses that Ridge

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.510 
over here and then crosses that Ridge
and<00:01:55.780> then<00:01:56.549> comes<00:01:57.549> around<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:59.469> right<00:01:59.619> there<00:01:59.890> and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
and then comes around to right there and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.539 
and then comes around to right there and
then<00:02:01.210> it'll<00:02:01.539> cross<00:02:01.899> across<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.920> table<00:02:03.100> here

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
then it'll cross across the table here

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.770 
then it'll cross across the table here
in<00:02:03.729> front<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.840> then<00:02:05.710> connect<00:02:06.100> with<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> loop

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
in front and then connect with the loop

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.779 
in front and then connect with the loop
back<00:02:07.780> over<00:02:08.080> here<00:02:08.410> now<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.009> may<00:02:09.220> be<00:02:09.280> wondering

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
back over here now you may be wondering

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.810 
back over here now you may be wondering
how<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.750> track<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.230> get<00:02:11.410> from<00:02:11.620> here<00:02:11.920> all

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
how is the track and get from here all

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.060 
how is the track and get from here all
the<00:02:13.180> way<00:02:13.270> over<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.630> there<00:02:13.840> well<00:02:14.830> there's<00:02:14.980> going

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
the way over to there well there's going

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.860 
the way over to there well there's going
to<00:02:15.130> be<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.280> series<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.730> steel<00:02:16.090> trestles<00:02:16.630> not

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
to be a series of steel trestles not

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.160 
to be a series of steel trestles not
unlike<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.820> steel<00:02:18.820> trestle<00:02:19.240> there<00:02:19.450> I'm

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
unlike that steel trestle there I'm

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.260 
unlike that steel trestle there I'm
going<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> do<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.710> in<00:02:20.860> five<00:02:21.190> foot<00:02:21.490> sections<00:02:22.000> and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
going to do it in five foot sections and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.320 
going to do it in five foot sections and
it'll<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.540> about<00:02:22.720> 20<00:02:23.170> feet<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.560> trestles<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
it'll be about 20 feet of trestles and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.820 
it'll be about 20 feet of trestles and
it'll<00:02:25.330> go<00:02:25.450> all<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.930> way<00:02:25.989> across<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.500> table

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
it'll go all the way across the table

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.410 
it'll go all the way across the table
now<00:02:26.980> I'm<00:02:27.550> not<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:27.909> have<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> go

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
now I'm not going to have a go

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.490 
now I'm not going to have a go
straight<00:02:28.599> across<00:02:28.810> because<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.319> would<00:02:29.410> be

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
straight across because that would be

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.260 
straight across because that would be
kind<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.709> boring<00:02:29.890> I'm<00:02:30.550> gonna<00:02:30.760> kind<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.000> have<00:02:31.150> it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
kind of boring I'm gonna kind of have it

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.320 
kind of boring I'm gonna kind of have it
snake<00:02:31.690> its<00:02:31.900> way<00:02:32.580> through<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:33.880> whole<00:02:34.090> yard

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
snake its way through this whole yard

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.380 
snake its way through this whole yard
area<00:02:34.630> across<00:02:35.170> these<00:02:35.500> tracks<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.390> finally

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
area across these tracks and finally

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.000 
area across these tracks and finally
meet<00:02:37.599> up<00:02:37.750> over<00:02:38.050> here<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.590> should<00:02:38.770> be<00:02:38.800> pretty

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
meet up over here so it should be pretty

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.830 
meet up over here so it should be pretty
cool<00:02:39.250> when<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.550> done<00:02:39.730> it's<00:02:40.420> going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.660> take<00:02:40.810> a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
cool when it's done it's going to take a

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.300 
cool when it's done it's going to take a
while<00:02:41.110> because<00:02:41.410> those<00:02:41.590> trestles<00:02:42.040> are<00:02:42.160> not

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
while because those trestles are not

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.330 
while because those trestles are not
cheap<00:02:42.550> probably<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.840> take<00:02:43.989> another

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
cheap probably going to take another

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.860 
cheap probably going to take another
year<00:02:45.340> or<00:02:45.400> two<00:02:45.580> maybe<00:02:46.000> three<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.510> get<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.720> all

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
year or two maybe three to get it all

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.960 
year or two maybe three to get it all
complete<00:02:47.319> but<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:48.069> should<00:02:48.280> be<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:48.580> neat

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
complete but it should be pretty neat

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.880 
complete but it should be pretty neat
when<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.330> all<00:02:49.480> complete<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.020> this<00:02:50.530> upper

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
when it's all complete and this upper

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.640 
when it's all complete and this upper
loop<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.340> working<00:02:51.760> now<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:53.110> back<00:02:53.350> Ridge

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
loop is working now on this back Ridge

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.729 
loop is working now on this back Ridge
here<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.730> main<00:02:55.000> concern<00:02:55.510> was<00:02:55.750> getting<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
here the main concern was getting the

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.250 
here the main concern was getting the
track<00:02:57.040> level<00:02:57.670> getting<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.360> wood<00:02:58.569> nice<00:02:59.050> and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
track level getting the wood nice and

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.320 
track level getting the wood nice and
level<00:02:59.560> for<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.830> track<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.090> look

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
level for the track and if you look

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.180 
level for the track and if you look
underneath<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.380> don't<00:03:02.530> know<00:03:02.590> if<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.769> can<00:03:02.920> see

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
underneath I don't know if you can see

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.660 
underneath I don't know if you can see
but<00:03:04.060> there<00:03:04.239> are<00:03:04.450> little<00:03:05.050> plastic<00:03:05.590> shims<00:03:05.980> every

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
but there are little plastic shims every

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.789 
but there are little plastic shims every
now<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.030> then<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.840> used<00:03:08.140> those<00:03:08.380> they're

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
now and then and I used those they're

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.030 
now and then and I used those they're
just<00:03:08.980> pieces<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.519> styrene<00:03:10.030> plastic<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:11.769> use

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
just pieces of styrene plastic and I use

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.759 
just pieces of styrene plastic and I use
those<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.670> shim<00:03:13.000> up<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.510> wood<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:14.500> get<00:03:14.650> up

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
those to shim up the wood to get up

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.500 
those to shim up the wood to get up
level<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.640> when<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.970> track<00:03:16.209> rides

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
level so that when the track rides

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.199 
level so that when the track rides
across<00:03:16.830> it'll<00:03:17.830> be<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> nice<00:03:18.160> level<00:03:18.700> ride<00:03:18.910> and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
across it'll be a nice level ride and

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.270 
across it'll be a nice level ride and
won't<00:03:19.390> be<00:03:19.480> rocking<00:03:19.900> back<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.170> forth<00:03:20.560> and

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
won't be rocking back and forth and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.949 
won't be rocking back and forth and
that's<00:03:21.910> something<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.420> really<00:03:22.450> have<00:03:22.720> to

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
that's something that you really have to

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.140 
that's something that you really have to
take<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.140> lot<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.410> time<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:24.010> get<00:03:24.400> right<00:03:24.640> because

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
take a lot of time to get right because

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.750 
take a lot of time to get right because
if<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.780> try<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.019> rush<00:03:26.319> it<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.190> put<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
if you try to rush it and you put the

ship<00:04:59.239> it<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.779> since<00:05:00.259> it's<00:05:00.439> across<00:05:00.709> town<00:05:00.769> and

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:01.309 
ship it and since it's across town and

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:02.379 
ship it and since it's across town and
would<00:05:01.399> get<00:05:01.519> me<00:05:01.639> there<00:05:01.729> overnight

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
would get me there overnight

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.749 
would get me there overnight
but<00:05:03.019> the<00:05:03.289> vision<00:05:03.619> Challenger<00:05:04.159> is<00:05:04.279> pretty

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
but the vision Challenger is pretty

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.459 
but the vision Challenger is pretty
large<00:05:05.029> and<00:05:05.509> I'm<00:05:05.599> sure<00:05:05.809> they<00:05:05.989> should<00:05:06.049> be<00:05:06.319> gone

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
large and I'm sure they should be gone

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.249 
large and I'm sure they should be gone
it<00:05:06.589> will<00:05:06.709> probably<00:05:06.889> be<00:05:07.159> $30<00:05:07.849> or<00:05:08.029> more<00:05:08.259> so

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
it will probably be $30 or more so

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.769 
it will probably be $30 or more so
instead<00:05:10.009> of<00:05:10.069> spending<00:05:10.519> $30<00:05:11.119> on<00:05:11.269> shipping<00:05:11.509> I'll

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
instead of spending $30 on shipping I'll

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.279 
instead of spending $30 on shipping I'll
just<00:05:11.989> spend<00:05:12.229> 10<00:05:12.889> or<00:05:13.009> $15<00:05:13.729> on<00:05:13.849> gas<00:05:14.179> and<00:05:14.899> go<00:05:15.079> over

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
just spend 10 or $15 on gas and go over

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.959 
just spend 10 or $15 on gas and go over
there<00:05:15.409> and<00:05:15.529> pick<00:05:15.649> it<00:05:15.799> up<00:05:15.860> myself<00:05:16.009> okay<00:05:16.639> here<00:05:16.879> we
