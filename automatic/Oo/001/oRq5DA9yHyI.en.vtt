and then a shot of 100% agave tequila
you<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:22.030> use<00:01:22.240> pretty<00:01:22.510> much<00:01:22.600> any<00:01:22.900> brand<00:01:23.170> as

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
you can use pretty much any brand as

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.560

long<00:01:23.500> as<00:01:23.620> it's<00:01:23.710> 100%<00:01:24.040> agave<00:01:24.460> if<00:01:25.210> you're<00:01:25.450> doing

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
long as it's 100% agave if you're doing

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.730 
long as it's 100% agave if you're doing
shots<00:01:25.840> you'll<00:01:26.110> probably<00:01:26.260> want<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> better

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
shots you'll probably want a better

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.130 
shots you'll probably want a better
tequila<00:01:27.220> but<00:01:27.430> mixing<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.360> as<00:01:28.720> long<00:01:28.900> as<00:01:28.990> it's<00:01:29.110> a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
tequila but mixing it as long as it's a

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.570 
tequila but mixing it as long as it's a
hundred<00:01:29.320> percent<00:01:29.410> of<00:01:29.740> ghave<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.220> shouldn't<00:01:30.520> be

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
hundred percent of ghave it shouldn't be

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:39.350 
hundred percent of ghave it shouldn't be
fine<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> we<00:01:33.640> put<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.850> shot<00:01:34.120> of<00:01:34.270> that<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:34.570> here

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.800 

and<00:01:40.360> then<00:01:41.050> finally<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.800> last<00:01:42.010> ingredient

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.510 
and then finally the last ingredient
I've<00:01:43.810> tried<00:01:44.140> almost<00:01:44.350> every<00:01:44.770> margarita<00:01:45.220> mix

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520

believe<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:49.870> not<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.170> one<00:01:50.290> that<00:01:50.440> you<00:01:50.500> get

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
believe it or not the one that you get

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.970

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
sugar instead of corn syrup so it makes

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.380 
sugar instead of corn syrup so it makes
it<00:01:56.290> sweet<00:01:56.470> instead<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.340> weird<00:01:57.700> bitter<00:01:58.000> corn

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390

it sweet instead of a weird bitter corn
syrup<00:01:58.690> taste<00:01:59.080> so<00:01:59.830> this<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.280> one<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.900> just

top<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.110> off<00:02:02.380> it's<00:02:02.620> probably<00:02:03.070> three<00:02:03.910> or<00:02:03.940> four

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150
