00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
and I think it's pretty safe to say that

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.540 
and I think it's pretty safe to say that
HTC<00:00:09.300> somehow<00:00:10.080> changed<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> way<00:00:10.769> we've<00:00:11.519> been

gonna built or connect over Bluetooth by

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.830 
gonna built or connect over Bluetooth by
using<00:01:48.509> NFC<00:01:48.920> let<00:01:49.920> me<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.250> switch<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.840> here

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
using NFC let me just switch it on here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.399 
using NFC let me just switch it on here
we<00:01:51.930> go

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
we go

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.170 
we go
I<00:01:52.439> think<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.369> should<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.820> prepared<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.479> away

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.350 

and<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:59.080> can<00:01:59.290> kinda<00:01:59.920> get<00:02:00.430> this<00:02:00.610> little<00:02:00.880> stand

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
and you can kinda get this little stand

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.820 
and you can kinda get this little stand
out<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.840> here<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:04.240> place<00:02:04.900> your<00:02:05.230> one<00:02:05.470> over

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
out of here and place your one over

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.240 
out of here and place your one over
there<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:08.080> let<00:02:08.259> me<00:02:08.380> also<00:02:08.530> get<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.920> little<00:02:09.160> bit

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
there so let me also get a little bit

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.050 
there so let me also get a little bit
closer<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.790> microphone<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> think<00:02:15.550> you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
closer to the microphone so I think you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.760 
closer to the microphone so I think you
can<00:02:16.270> definitely<00:02:16.450> hear<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.210> adding<00:02:19.770> you

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
can definitely hear that it's adding you

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.100 
can definitely hear that it's adding you
know<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.920> little<00:02:21.130> bit<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.340> lower<00:02:22.180> frequencies

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
know a little bit of lower frequencies

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.440 
know a little bit of lower frequencies
means<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:24.190> base<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:25.240> your<00:02:25.920> HTC<00:02:26.920> One<00:02:27.450> music
