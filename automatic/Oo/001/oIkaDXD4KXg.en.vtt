00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.250
 good two to one lived good not 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.830
 trailer of mortal kombat jr is a game 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.480
 that I think I do not know is that I have a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.280
 heap of hype something like that but 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.680
 is a game of with every having improvement or 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.470
 be I do not know I do not know what happens to this 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.780
 game is the only game that I say that with 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 each trailer is not know if maybe something 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.680
 the opposite is the way I have 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 passed with 4 talks that abide by election 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.100
 already a little worse and worse and the game 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.359
 painted here I hope that here not here every 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.070
 Once the game is about to launch 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.830
 it paints better and better is it 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.550
 presents the cage jon and kate family 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.910
 come back come back a little more 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 old 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.219
 basically obviously there have been many 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.070
 years and then to sonia and almost good already 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.160
 you know is his daughter the daughter of between 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.989
 sonia and jon and kate, well, it will be almost 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.309
 and good, it will supposedly have a 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.090
 little attacks of both is not more or less 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.379
 and obviously its their own good 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.090
 the game comes out from April 14 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.289
 possibly you understand me 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.329
 thriller collector I have many 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.739
 you win this game is brutal you will have 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.909
 to go with boxing collector action 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.380
 by the way 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.679
 all platforms pc ps3 pc 465 in 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.780
 all the platforms will not come out and it's 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.450
 usual that this is happening 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.170
 unfortunately but good things are going 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.420
 for now like that and well basically 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.789
 that all we have the issue description 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.799
 It's cool a lot the truth is that for what 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.409
 let's cheat each time the game comes 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.240
 more renewed is better and I do not know if it was 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.799
 definitive fight game because that's it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.200
 Each person has a world 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.509
 different taste than street fighter and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.399
 but I think it's going to be a game 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.689
 very complete very complete for all 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.549
 lovers of fighting games that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.799
 it is very clear 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.179
 I see it every time I see it so I 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.069
 playing fighting games a long time and 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.619
 this game I have that well is very 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.030
 complete and that I think the one that goes 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.700
 start fighting games this is the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.789
 perfect game seems to be because there 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.459
 many things to make many styles 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.989
 of combat and many game styles as well 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.640
 that the guys and a perfect story 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.950
 because the story mode also has a 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.299
 It looks great so, well let's see 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.730
 what is it that ends up happening in the game 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.129
 let's hope you do not fuck 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.930
 it did not happen in my opinion with mortal kombat 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.970
 9 and I think it's not going to happen with mortal 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.810
 kombat x so let's go in the next 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.810
