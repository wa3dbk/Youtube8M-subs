with<00:02:05.049> a<00:02:05.079> small<00:02:05.649> screen<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.890> is

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
with a small screen on it and this is

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.740 
with a small screen on it and this is
for<00:02:09.099> mostly<00:02:09.789> for<00:02:10.090> outdoor<00:02:10.660> shootings<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:13.420> this

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
for mostly for outdoor shootings on this

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.589 
for mostly for outdoor shootings on this
side<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.910> has<00:02:16.150> some<00:02:17.610> as<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.849> can<00:02:19.060> see<00:02:19.299> some

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
side it has some as you can see some

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.000 
side it has some as you can see some
inputs<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.440> outputs<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.079> a<00:02:23.110> microphone

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
inputs and outputs so it is a microphone

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.430 
inputs and outputs so it is a microphone
input<00:02:24.310> here<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:26.370> once<00:02:27.370> more<00:02:27.760> here<00:02:28.440> earphone

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
input here and once more here earphone

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.170 
input here and once more here earphone
and<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:30.549> has<00:02:30.700> also<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.060> test<00:02:31.390> output<00:02:33.180> output

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and it has also a test output output

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.430 
and it has also a test output output
here<00:02:35.970> one<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.209> disadvantage<00:02:38.049> of<00:02:38.260> this

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
here one of the disadvantage of this

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.869 
here one of the disadvantage of this
camera<00:02:38.739> today<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.940> has<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:41.879> so-called

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
camera today is it has the so-called

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.229 
camera today is it has the so-called
historical<00:02:43.480> outputs<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.879> find

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
historical outputs that you can find

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.509 
historical outputs that you can find
today<00:02:46.989> quite<00:02:47.920> easily

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
today quite easily

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.030 
today quite easily
but<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.840> found<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.500> solution<00:02:50.859> for<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.519> also<00:02:53.040> it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
but I found a solution for it also it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.470 
but I found a solution for it also it
can<00:02:54.280> be<00:02:54.310> also<00:02:54.579> used<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.590> bad<00:02:56.799> way<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
can be also used in a bad way so the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.940 
can be also used in a bad way so the
battery<00:02:59.549> and<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.700> can<00:03:00.880> be<00:03:01.060> installed<00:03:01.299> here<00:03:01.959> now

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
battery and it can be installed here now

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.470 
battery and it can be installed here now
I<00:03:03.010> want<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> show<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.900> how<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.959> install<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.769> so

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.309 

this<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:11.069> standard<00:03:12.069> battery<00:03:12.519> tech<00:03:13.319> for

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
this is the standard battery tech for

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.750 
this is the standard battery tech for
this<00:03:14.920> camera

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
this camera

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.520 
this camera
it's<00:03:16.510> called<00:03:16.870> DC<00:03:17.940> sea<00:03:18.940> level<00:03:20.519> it's<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:21.790> 12<00:03:22.530> volt

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
it's called DC sea level it's a 12 volt

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:31.140 
it's called DC sea level it's a 12 volt
battery<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:26.760> yeah<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.930> like<00:03:29.139> that<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.400> you

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.770 
okay mm-hmm
what<00:04:03.099> else<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.670> can<00:04:03.730> say<00:04:04.349> it<00:04:05.349> is<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.970> also<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.239> macro

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
what else I can say it is a also a macro

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.940 
what else I can say it is a also a macro
lens<00:04:07.959> here

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
lens here

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.690 
lens here
the<00:04:09.400> lens<00:04:09.610> also<00:04:09.879> functions<00:04:10.569> as<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.810> macro<00:04:11.700> so

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
the lens also functions as a macro so

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.259 
the lens also functions as a macro so
you<00:04:12.760> can<00:04:13.090> focus<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:14.549> some<00:04:15.570> clothes<00:04:16.570> objects

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
you can focus on some clothes objects

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.750 
you can focus on some clothes objects
here<00:04:19.269> there's<00:04:19.900> possibility<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:21.010> adjust<00:04:21.160> the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
here there's possibility to adjust the

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.110 
here there's possibility to adjust the
contrast<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.100> brightness<00:04:24.100> of<00:04:24.610> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
contrast and the brightness of the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.100 
contrast and the brightness of the
viewfinder<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:27.430> viewfinder<00:04:27.729> is<00:04:30.900> black<00:04:31.900> and

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
viewfinder the viewfinder is black and

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.200 
viewfinder the viewfinder is black and
white<00:04:32.289> so<00:04:32.770> it's<00:04:32.949> not<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.190> color<00:04:33.550> where<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:33.910> find

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
white so it's not a color where you find

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.430 
white so it's not a color where you find
her<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:36.250> calls<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.820> times<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.960> camera<00:04:38.260> was

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
her it calls that times the camera was

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.409 
her it calls that times the camera was
built<00:04:38.770> in<00:04:39.510> 1985<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:41.100> that<00:04:42.100> time<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.729> color<00:04:43.180> we

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
built in 1985 and that time the color we

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:51.050 
built in 1985 and that time the color we
find<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.930> was<00:04:44.110> not<00:04:44.919> so<00:04:45.190> common<00:04:46.979> it<00:04:47.979> is<00:04:48.039> a

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.900 

compared<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:53.680> time<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.370> camera<00:04:54.729> was

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
compared to that time the camera was

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.490 
compared to that time the camera was
built<00:04:55.240> its<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.870> had<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.970> very<00:04:57.970> high<00:05:00.330> technology

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
built its it had a very high technology

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.980 
built its it had a very high technology
sensor<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.770> has<00:05:03.010> three<00:05:04.000> color<00:05:04.360> tubes<00:05:05.520> to

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
sensor it has three color tubes to

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.240 
sensor it has three color tubes to
recognize<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.460> colors<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.760> that<00:05:10.260> was<00:05:11.260> a<00:05:11.289> that

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
recognize the colors and that was a that

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.939 
recognize the colors and that was a that
time<00:05:12.580> that<00:05:12.880> was<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.380> sensational<00:05:14.380> nearly

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
time that was a sensational nearly

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:21.089 
time that was a sensational nearly
sensational<00:05:15.699> technology<00:05:17.490> so<00:05:19.110> here<00:05:20.110> correct

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
sensational technology so here correct

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.600 
sensational technology so here correct
under<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.150> lens<00:05:22.360> there<00:05:23.349> are<00:05:23.500> two<00:05:23.800> settings

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
under the lens there are two settings

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.529 
under the lens there are two settings
also<00:05:25.349> the<00:05:26.880> first<00:05:27.880> one<00:05:28.150> is<00:05:28.300> for<00:05:28.599> setting<00:05:29.560> up<00:05:29.889> the

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
also the first one is for setting up the

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.060 
also the first one is for setting up the
white<00:05:31.539> balance<00:05:32.050> and<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:34.300> second<00:05:35.050> one<00:05:35.260> is<00:05:35.500> to

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
white balance and the second one is to

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:45.810 
white balance and the second one is to
set<00:05:36.340> up<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:37.690> shift<00:05:38.470> that<00:05:39.340> means<00:05:39.610> if<00:05:44.820> things

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
set up the shift that means if things

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.710 
set up the shift that means if things
that<00:05:45.940> you<00:05:46.240> are<00:05:46.360> recording<00:05:47.340> somehow<00:05:48.510> tilted<00:05:49.510> or

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
that you are recording somehow tilted or

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.360 
that you are recording somehow tilted or
shifted<00:05:50.289> then<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:50.650> can<00:05:50.830> adjust<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:53.800> tab<00:05:54.159> of

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
shifted then you can adjust the tab of

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:03.450 
shifted then you can adjust the tab of
the<00:05:54.400> setting<00:05:55.030> to<00:05:55.659> the<00:05:55.780> center<00:05:59.130> okay<00:06:00.180> so<00:06:02.400> it<00:06:03.400> is

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
the setting to the center okay so it is

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.750 
the setting to the center okay so it is
not<00:06:03.729> too<00:06:04.000> much<00:06:04.180> to<00:06:04.389> tell<00:06:04.630> right<00:06:04.900> now<00:06:04.950> let's<00:06:05.950> see

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
not too much to tell right now let's see

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.250 
not too much to tell right now let's see
it<00:06:06.820> on<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:08.320> test
