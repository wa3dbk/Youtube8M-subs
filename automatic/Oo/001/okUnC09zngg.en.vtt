past or now as you know brother you can

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.830 
past or now as you know brother you can
assume<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:45.000> something<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.630> going

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
assume that something like this is going

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359 
assume that something like this is going
to<00:01:45.930> happen<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> series<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.979> instance

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to happen in the series for instance

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
to happen in the series for instance
maybe<00:01:47.579> our<00:01:47.850> MCU<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.110> captured

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
maybe our MCU is going to be captured

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.130 
maybe our MCU is going to be captured
and<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:50.159> experimented<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:52.049> get

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and then experimented on because we get

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
and then experimented on because we get
to<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.159> was<00:01:53.369> foreshadowed

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
to see how things work that it daddy is

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.090 
to see how things work that it daddy is
kind<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.360> human<00:03:16.720> nature<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.049> somewhat<00:03:17.650> in<00:03:17.889> a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
kind of human nature and somewhat in a

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.879 
kind of human nature and somewhat in a
sense<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.670> so<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.630> makes<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.900> lot<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.260> sense<00:03:20.680> when

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
sense and so it makes a lot a sense when

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.129 
sense and so it makes a lot a sense when
you<00:03:20.950> think<00:03:20.980> about<00:03:21.280> if<00:03:21.639> a<00:03:21.989> scientist<00:03:22.989> like

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
you think about if a scientist like

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.110 
you think about if a scientist like
someone<00:03:23.410> that's<00:03:23.560> very<00:03:23.620> like<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.639> lot<00:03:24.880> into

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
someone that's very like a lot into

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.759 
someone that's very like a lot into
science<00:03:25.480> like<00:03:25.600> he<00:03:25.720> studied<00:03:26.139> a<00:03:26.200> lot<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.650> he

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
science like he studied a lot and he

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.960 
science like he studied a lot and he
sold<00:03:27.010> his<00:03:27.130> random<00:03:27.459> person<00:03:27.760> with<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.940> power

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
sold his random person with the power

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.210 
sold his random person with the power
and<00:03:28.510> he<00:03:28.840> was<00:03:28.959> part<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.290> what<00:03:29.410> say<00:03:29.620> some<00:03:29.950> form<00:03:30.190> of

and he was part of what say some form of
corrupt<00:03:30.609> organization<00:03:31.389> of<00:03:31.810> course<00:03:32.109> he<00:03:32.380> would

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
corrupt organization of course he would

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.890 
corrupt organization of course he would
try<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.739> grab<00:03:33.040> this<00:03:33.250> person<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:33.940> drag<00:03:34.690> them<00:03:34.840> to

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
the organization experiment on this

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.400 
the organization experiment on this
person<00:03:36.730> that's<00:03:37.420> what<00:03:37.930> can<00:03:38.109> most<00:03:38.319> likely

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
person that's what can most likely

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.199 
person that's what can most likely
happen<00:03:39.099> just<00:03:39.280> because<00:03:39.430> these<00:03:39.760> students<00:03:40.150> are

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
happen just because these students are

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.120 
happen just because these students are
in<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.420> school<00:03:40.660> doesn't<00:03:41.380> mean<00:03:41.680> they're<00:03:41.889> safe

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
in the school doesn't mean they're safe

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.400 
in the school doesn't mean they're safe
they<00:03:42.549> can<00:03:42.730> still<00:03:42.970> most<00:03:43.630> likely<00:03:43.900> be<00:03:44.019> captured

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
they can still most likely be captured

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.129 
they can still most likely be captured
by<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.530> wrong<00:03:44.769> people<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:46.510> like<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.959> like

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
by the wrong people and I like that like

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.470 
by the wrong people and I like that like
I<00:03:47.230> said<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.410> like<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.739> dark<00:03:48.069> presence<00:03:48.700> in<00:03:49.150> this

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
I said I like the dark presence in this

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.240 
I said I like the dark presence in this
series<00:03:49.780> because<00:03:50.079> it's<00:03:50.349> not<00:03:50.440> just<00:03:50.500> happy

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
series because it's not just happy

series because it's not just happy
sunshine<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.359> rainbows<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.410> now<00:03:53.919> what

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
sunshine and rainbows to it now what

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.129 
sunshine and rainbows to it now what
does<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.400> episode<00:03:55.000> oof<00:03:55.180> or<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.510> most<00:03:55.750> part

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
does this episode oof or the most part

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.009 
does this episode oof or the most part
so<00:03:56.709> we<00:03:57.280> get<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.579> concept<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:58.329> what<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.660> series

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
so we get the concept of what the series

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.839 
so we get the concept of what the series
is<00:03:59.049> about<00:03:59.260> that's<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.769> main<00:04:00.040> thing<00:04:00.069> it's<00:04:00.790> not

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
is about that's the main thing it's not

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.270 
is about that's the main thing it's not
just<00:04:01.209> about<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.930> reforming<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:03.069> as<00:04:03.250> a

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
just about the reforming of you as a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.190 
just about the reforming of you as a
character<00:04:03.639> Princeton's<00:04:04.090> him<00:04:04.269> turning<00:04:04.569> into<00:04:04.989> a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
character Princeton's him turning into a

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.920 
character Princeton's him turning into a
good<00:04:05.919> guy<00:04:06.160> in<00:04:06.519> learning<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.150> use<00:04:07.329> his<00:04:07.569> powers

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
good guy in learning to use his powers

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.409 
good guy in learning to use his powers
not<00:04:08.139> in<00:04:08.349> a<00:04:08.440> bad<00:04:08.680> sense<00:04:09.099> but<00:04:09.549> a<00:04:09.609> responsible

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
not in a bad sense but a responsible

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.659 
not in a bad sense but a responsible
since<00:04:10.630> it's<00:04:10.810> not<00:04:10.930> just<00:04:11.380> about<00:04:11.560> that<00:04:11.769> which

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669

since it's not just about that which
shocked<00:04:13.030> me<00:04:13.299> because<00:04:13.329> I<00:04:13.599> expected<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.230> series

shocked me because I expected the series

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.949 
shocked me because I expected the series
to<00:04:15.010> be<00:04:15.130> focusing<00:04:15.609> around<00:04:15.819> our<00:04:15.970> MC<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.780> him

tormented you had it to where the

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.100 
tormented you had it to where the
scientists<00:05:56.460> set<00:05:56.669> up<00:05:56.790> friends<00:05:57.240> around<00:05:57.479> her<00:05:57.750> for
