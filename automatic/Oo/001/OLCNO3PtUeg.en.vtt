00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
eyes up and I didn't do the standing up

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.760 
eyes up and I didn't do the standing up
on<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.840> peg<00:05:42.020> sting<00:05:42.260> because<00:05:42.410> it<00:05:42.470> happened<00:05:42.740> so

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
on the peg sting because it happened so

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.830 
on the peg sting because it happened so
fast<00:05:42.980> I<00:05:43.160> didn't<00:05:43.370> even<00:05:43.400> get<00:05:44.120> a<00:05:44.180> chance<00:05:44.240> to<00:05:44.540> stand

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
fast I didn't even get a chance to stand

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.910 
fast I didn't even get a chance to stand
up<00:05:45.310> but<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.910> back<00:05:47.270> end<00:05:47.480> came<00:05:47.630> back<00:05:47.780> around<00:05:47.930> all

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
up but the back end came back around all

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.410 
up but the back end came back around all
on<00:05:49.160> its<00:05:49.310> own<00:05:49.930> which<00:05:50.930> was<00:05:51.080> pretty<00:05:51.230> cool<00:05:51.350> and

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
on its own which was pretty cool and

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.490 
on its own which was pretty cool and
they're<00:05:53.420> right<00:05:53.570> it<00:05:53.810> totally<00:05:54.230> counter

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
they're right it totally counter

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.740 
they're right it totally counter
steering<00:05:54.740> itself<00:05:54.890> actually<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:56.270> parted

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
steering itself actually it parted

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.650 
steering itself actually it parted
itself<00:05:56.900> so<00:05:57.500> well<00:05:57.890> that<00:05:58.730> when<00:05:58.880> it<00:05:59.000> jumped<00:05:59.540> back

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
itself so well that when it jumped back

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.250 
itself so well that when it jumped back
into<00:05:59.900> position<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:01.840> when<00:06:02.840> the<00:06:02.930> wouldn't<00:06:03.170> when

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
into position it when the wouldn't when

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.560 
into position it when the wouldn't when
the<00:06:03.350> back<00:06:03.500> end<00:06:03.740> straightened<00:06:04.580> back<00:06:04.670> out<00:06:04.880> it

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
the back end straightened back out it

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.910 
the back end straightened back out it
ended<00:06:05.870> up<00:06:07.150> kind<00:06:08.150> of<00:06:08.300> than<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:09.230> front<00:06:09.440> end<00:06:09.680> win

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
ended up kind of than the front end win

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.880 
ended up kind of than the front end win
and<00:06:10.670> then<00:06:10.820> I<00:06:10.850> had<00:06:11.030> a<00:06:11.060> front<00:06:11.330> end<00:06:11.450> slide<00:06:11.780> and<00:06:12.710> it

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
and then I had a front end slide and it

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.800 
and then I had a front end slide and it
was<00:06:13.040> like<00:06:13.280> the<00:06:13.520> wheel<00:06:13.730> was<00:06:14.000> violently<00:06:14.510> going

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
was like the wheel was violently going

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.600 
was like the wheel was violently going
back<00:06:14.990> and<00:06:15.140> forth<00:06:15.380> like<00:06:15.650> a<00:06:15.800> full<00:06:16.190> turn<00:06:16.370> to<00:06:16.520> the

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
back and forth like a full turn to the

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.520 
back and forth like a full turn to the
left<00:06:16.760> of<00:06:16.940> full<00:06:17.120> turn<00:06:17.330> to<00:06:17.450> the<00:06:17.540> right<00:06:17.570> back<00:06:18.350> and

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
left of full turn to the right back and

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.590 
left of full turn to the right back and
forth<00:06:18.770> and<00:06:19.100> but<00:06:20.060> the<00:06:20.150> bike<00:06:20.300> was<00:06:20.390> going

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
forth and but the bike was going

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.240 
forth and but the bike was going
straight<00:06:20.720> just<00:06:21.320> like<00:06:21.470> exactly<00:06:22.040> like<00:06:22.130> you

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
straight just like exactly like you

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.500 
straight just like exactly like you
described<00:06:22.520> in<00:06:22.640> the<00:06:22.730> book<00:06:22.880> I<00:06:23.090> just<00:06:23.420> never

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
described in the book I just never

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.790 
described in the book I just never
experienced<00:06:24.080> it<00:06:24.200> because<00:06:24.380> like<00:06:24.500> i<00:06:24.590> said<00:06:24.620> i

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
experienced it because like i said i

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.710 
experienced it because like i said i
have<00:06:24.980> no<00:06:25.130> dirt<00:06:25.340> bike<00:06:25.550> riding<00:06:25.760> experience<00:06:26.000> and

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
have no dirt bike riding experience and

have no dirt bike riding experience and
so<00:06:27.650> all<00:06:28.550> those<00:06:28.730> sorts<00:06:29.000> of<00:06:29.060> things<00:06:29.120> were<00:06:29.420> all

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:29.540 
so all those sorts of things were all

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.060 
so all those sorts of things were all
new<00:06:29.720> to<00:06:29.840> me<00:06:29.870> so<00:06:30.140> the<00:06:30.500> whole<00:06:30.650> front<00:06:30.800> end<00:06:30.920> of<00:06:31.040> the

you are there won't be able to stop the
bars<00:07:02.860> order<00:07:03.190> or<00:07:03.550> you'll<00:07:03.669> become<00:07:03.789> slow<00:07:04.090> to

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
bars order or you'll become slow to

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.010 
bars order or you'll become slow to
react<00:07:04.449> for<00:07:04.690> that<00:07:04.780> to<00:07:04.900> happen<00:07:05.050> and<00:07:05.550> for<00:07:06.930> me<00:07:07.930> it

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
react for that to happen and for me it

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.740 
react for that to happen and for me it
was<00:07:08.169> the<00:07:08.650> first<00:07:08.860> as<00:07:09.819> soon<00:07:09.970> as<00:07:10.090> the<00:07:10.240> front<00:07:10.629> wheel

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
was the first as soon as the front wheel

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.619 
was the first as soon as the front wheel
started<00:07:10.990> going<00:07:11.139> back<00:07:11.259> and<00:07:11.379> forth<00:07:11.620> I<00:07:11.909> i<00:07:12.909> was

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:13.629 
started going back and forth I i was

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:14.999 
started going back and forth I i was
still<00:07:13.780> staying<00:07:14.050> on<00:07:14.199> the<00:07:14.289> gas<00:07:14.440> so<00:07:14.680> at<00:07:14.770> least<00:07:14.830> i

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:15.009 
still staying on the gas so at least i

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:22.810 
still staying on the gas so at least i
was<00:07:15.159> doing<00:07:15.370> that<00:07:15.520> right

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:28.940
