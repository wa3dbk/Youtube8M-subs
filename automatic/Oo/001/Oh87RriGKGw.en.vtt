aggressive<00:00:07.350> gameplay<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.740> general<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.880> agree

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
aggressive gameplay in general I agree

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.360 
aggressive gameplay in general I agree
normally<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.230> kind<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.530> come<00:00:10.740> back<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> bit<00:00:11.160> and

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
normally I kind of come back a bit and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.820 
normally I kind of come back a bit and
this<00:00:11.730> bit<00:00:12.269> tedious<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.750> watch<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.110> know<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.620> I

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
this bit tedious to watch I know so I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.080 
this bit tedious to watch I know so I
thought<00:00:14.639> I'd<00:00:14.759> put<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> mp5k<00:00:15.599> akimbo<00:00:16.379> with

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
thought I'd put on the mp5k akimbo with

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.000 
thought I'd put on the mp5k akimbo with
slive<00:00:18.090> hand<00:00:18.330> hardline<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.080> steady<00:00:19.619> aim<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
slive hand hardline and steady aim and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.939 
slive hand hardline and steady aim and
do<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> bit<00:00:21.000> rushing<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.449> once<00:00:21.650> quit<00:00:22.650> minister

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
do a bit rushing for once quit minister

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.670 
do a bit rushing for once quit minister
semtex<00:00:23.460> ie<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.689> rushes<00:00:25.050> grenade<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.560> my

semtex ie the rushes grenade in my

opinion<00:00:27.320> mp5k<00:00:28.320> akimbo<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.099> think<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
opinion mp5k akimbo I think it's the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.530 
opinion mp5k akimbo I think it's the
best<00:00:29.939> SMG<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.570> use<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> Kimbo<00:00:31.619> because

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
best SMG to use with a Kimbo because

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.780 
best SMG to use with a Kimbo because
these<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.649> mp5k<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.219> general<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
these and the mp5k in general is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.530 
these and the mp5k in general is
probably<00:00:36.390> designed<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:37.760> killing<00:00:38.760> quickly<00:00:39.210> at

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
probably designed for killing quickly at

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.110 
probably designed for killing quickly at
closer<00:00:39.840> ranges<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.489> recoil<00:00:41.879> pretty

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
closer ranges because the recoil pretty

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.549 
closer ranges because the recoil pretty
much<00:00:42.270> eliminates<00:00:42.809> any<00:00:42.930> possibility<00:00:43.110> of

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
much eliminates any possibility of

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.500 
much eliminates any possibility of
sniping<00:00:44.399> across<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> map<00:00:44.969> late<00:00:45.180> goodbye<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
sniping across the map late goodbye the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.690 
sniping across the map late goodbye the
UMP<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:47.539> but<00:00:48.539> when<00:00:48.690> you're<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.809> close<00:00:49.020> range<00:00:49.700> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
UMP and but when you're in close range I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.389 
UMP and but when you're in close range I
mean<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> Kimbo<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.110> only<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.530> close<00:00:52.829> range<00:00:53.129> so

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
mean a Kimbo can only do close range so

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.160 
mean a Kimbo can only do close range so
if<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.360> I'm<00:00:54.420> saying<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> mp5k

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
if you get what I'm saying the mp5k

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.090 
if you get what I'm saying the mp5k
seems<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> logical<00:00:55.949> choice<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:58.620> couple

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
seems the logical choice so a couple

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
seems the logical choice so a couple
things<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> talk<00:00:59.460> about<00:00:59.520> let<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.629> let<00:01:00.840> me

things to talk about let me see let me

where<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:11.940> one<00:02:12.150> guy<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.330> going

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
where you have one guy just going

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
just the whole game onto one flag that

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.140 
just the whole game onto one flag that
you're<00:02:17.350> spawning<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.800> okay<00:02:18.610> my<00:02:18.790> best<00:02:19.000> advice

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
you're spawning it okay my best advice

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.710 
you're spawning it okay my best advice
is<00:02:19.330> don't<00:02:19.930> go<00:02:20.200> near<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.440> flag<00:02:20.830> but<00:02:21.820> failing

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
is don't go near the flag but failing

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.900 
is don't go near the flag but failing
that<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:25.210> pick<00:02:25.570> up<00:02:25.720> something<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.910> all

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
that you pick up something that is all

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.980 
that you pick up something that is all
we<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.180> do<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.300> like<00:02:28.510> think<00:02:28.690> about<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.930> for

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
we have to do is like think about it for

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.080 
we have to do is like think about it for
a<00:02:29.050> second<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.500> know<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:30.130> probably<00:02:30.250> does<00:02:30.850> need

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
a second I know it probably does need

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.020 
a second I know it probably does need
balancing<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.750> stuff<00:02:31.960> but<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.470> mean<00:02:33.370> until

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
balancing and stuff but I mean until

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.120 
balancing and stuff but I mean until
they<00:02:34.750> release<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.050> patch<00:02:35.320> or<00:02:35.530> something<00:02:35.860> if

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
they release a patch or something if

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.060 
they release a patch or something if
they<00:02:36.400> ever<00:02:36.520> do<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:37.600> best<00:02:37.780> way<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.960> do<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.410> first

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
they ever do the best way to do a first

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.800 
they ever do the best way to do a first
thing<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.459> do<00:02:39.580> sorry<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.510> think<00:02:40.690> of

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
thing to do sorry is to think of

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.690 
thing to do sorry is to think of
different<00:02:40.840> ways<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.230> counter<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.740> and<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.610> may

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
different ways to counter it and it may

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.280 
different ways to counter it and it may
not<00:02:42.820> be<00:02:42.880> ideal<00:02:42.970> but<00:02:43.630> it's<00:02:43.780> pretty<00:02:44.050> much<00:02:44.200> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
not be ideal but it's pretty much the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.160 
not be ideal but it's pretty much the
best<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.620> got<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:46.240> then<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.750> close<00:02:46.900> noob

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
best you got so then you close noob

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.600 
best you got so then you close noob
tubes<00:02:48.030> what<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.060> like<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.630> rush<00:02:50.489> cuz<00:02:51.489> if

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
tubes what I like to do is rush cuz if

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.680 
tubes what I like to do is rush cuz if
you're<00:02:51.730> moving<00:02:52.030> fast<00:02:52.209> enough<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.570> they're

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
you're moving fast enough and they're

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.780 
you're moving fast enough and they're
not<00:02:52.780> going<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.989> get<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.340> something<00:02:54.340> like<00:02:54.550> this

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
not going to get you something like this

not going to get you something like this
this<00:02:55.570> mp5k<00:02:56.020> akimbo<00:02:56.410> set<00:02:56.739> up<00:02:56.860> with<00:02:57.010> lightweight

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
this mp5k akimbo set up with lightweight

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.110 
this mp5k akimbo set up with lightweight
maybe<00:02:58.630> swap<00:02:59.140> out<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.500> hand<00:02:59.680> for<00:02:59.739> marathon<00:03:00.190> put

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
maybe swap out of hand for marathon put

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.990 
maybe swap out of hand for marathon put
on<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.270> blast<00:03:01.480> shield<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.739> know<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.670> last

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
on a blast shield and I know that last

on a blast shield and I know that last
yield<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.300> danger<00:03:04.510> close<00:03:04.690> cancel<00:03:05.110> out<00:03:05.230> so

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
yield in danger close cancel out so

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.780 
yield in danger close cancel out so
essentially<00:03:06.010> you're<00:03:06.100> against<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.459> normal

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
essentially you're against the normal

essentially you're against the normal
new<00:03:06.910> tube<00:03:07.209> but<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.630> think<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.320> stand<00:03:08.500> much

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
new tube but I think you stand much

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.010 
new tube but I think you stand much
better<00:03:08.920> chance<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.250> surviving<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.880> what<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:10.900> do

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
better chance of surviving and what I do

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.080 
better chance of surviving and what I do
is<00:03:11.230> if<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.100> notice<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.610> other<00:03:12.730> team<00:03:12.940> we're

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
is if I notice that the other team we're

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.660 
is if I notice that the other team we're
abusing<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.510> certain<00:03:13.810> technique<00:03:14.110> like<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.770> use
