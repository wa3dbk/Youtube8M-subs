00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.290
 is it and with christine slide yes 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello hello to everyone 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.030
 christine is what you have to ban 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.660
 christine to the athletes on the grounds 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.630
 of sport any distinctive sign any 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.890
 distinctive message no I find myself 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.650
 for otherwise makes a 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.240
 it's a place where you can 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.680
 to express a lot of things in front of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.099
 lots of people so I find that very very 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.420
 good of this without forbidding it is 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.400
 anyway always a bad thing 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.769
 because we see it with the story of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.420
 dieudonné we actually forbid it 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.230
 multiply because one sakho summarizes in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.460
 a real anguish on the part of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.280
 the population because if that's the case 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.809
 it's me I did not know ten years I 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.070
 did not know dieudonné I knew 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.840
 not all the people who support him ex 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 work with him as alain soral 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.110
 extra all these people I've been seeing 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.600
 months on the net since a few months I 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 I did not know so it takes 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.260
 so much proportions completely 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.210
 delusional that the government's reaction 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 is so huge that I have 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.330
 interested 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 necessarily so I was on the net I 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 to fission like you love margins and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.320
 I listened to and so on and I 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.689
 really received the message of God given 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.310
 that I hear you well and that I and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.530
 that I take for myself also 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.600
 because I too am tired of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.340
 system too pissed to see 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.290
 on television our policies do 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.610
 anything because not so mother 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 of family each against 3 years I 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 not working I will take care of children 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 that's what kids now I 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.049
 am alone this quiet to I have the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.689
 chance to be at my house not to be 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.759
 forced to go fight in the area 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.549
 targeted gay my life i know me i'm watching 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.610
 the world through that sending of 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.530
 intelligence what sort is that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.210
 I think it's anything 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.799
 policies do anything I see 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.240
 the doctors excuse me but it's a 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.240
 kiff also anything 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.600
 another world is having fun we are laughing we do not 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.799
 not sanction after all that's the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.470
 freedom of expression that's what you 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.570
 Of course, it liked to work 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.740
 nation she that people realize 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.340
 when he hears gravity such 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:21.880
 decision 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:22.720
 you do not have that all the scenarios of 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.580
 reply 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.990
 there are football players who are signing themselves 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.670
 because they are believers so after a 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.260
 goal finally football players or 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.650
 athletes who make a sign of 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.540
 cross 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.280
 what are their joys to you 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.830
 is that we agree it suits them 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.160
 part of things to accept from 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.160
 functions and dropping on nbc
