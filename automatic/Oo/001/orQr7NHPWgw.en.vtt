00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you enjoy so let's get started so I have

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.140 
you enjoy so let's get started so I have
spinach<00:00:27.450> as<00:00:27.900> well<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.380> spring<00:00:28.710> mix<00:00:28.950> and<00:00:29.880> these

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
spinach as well as spring mix and these

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.029 
spinach as well as spring mix and these
are<00:00:30.360> like<00:00:30.540> four<00:00:31.020> handfuls<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.680> don't<00:00:31.860> really

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
are like four handfuls I don't really

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.670 
are like four handfuls I don't really
measure<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.789> then<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.870> would<00:00:34.110> typically

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
measure it and then I would typically

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.830 
measure it and then I would typically
add<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:35.700> handfuls<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.300> kale<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
add like three handfuls of kale but I

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.299 
add like three handfuls of kale but I
ran<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.199> but<00:00:37.409> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.620> how<00:00:37.859> much<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.159> have

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
ran out but this is how much I have

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.020 
ran out but this is how much I have
right<00:00:38.489> now<00:00:38.519> and<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:40.140> also<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.920> include<00:00:41.190> one

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
right now and I also like to include one

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
right now and I also like to include one
large<00:00:42.629> apple<00:00:43.289> one<00:00:44.069> Asian<00:00:44.489> pear<00:00:45.089> and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:46.140> damp

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
large apple one Asian pear and then damp

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.590 
large apple one Asian pear and then damp
d'Anjou<00:00:47.670> pear<00:00:47.699> is<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.179> how<00:00:48.269> you<00:00:48.329> say<00:00:48.569> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
d'Anjou pear is that how you say it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.799 
d'Anjou pear is that how you say it
honey<00:00:49.280> just<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> green<00:00:50.550> pear<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:51.569> some

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
honey just the green pear and then some

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.919 
honey just the green pear and then some
carrots<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.609> blueberries<00:00:53.609> so<00:00:53.929> what

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
carrots and some blueberries so what

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.329 
carrots and some blueberries so what
you're<00:00:55.079> gonna<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.409> is<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.769> put<00:00:55.949> everything

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
you're gonna do is just put everything

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.450 
you're gonna do is just put everything
in<00:00:56.609> your<00:00:56.639> juicer<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.429> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
in your juicer and so this is like a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
in your juicer and so this is like a
weird<00:00:59.789> technique<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.839> learned<00:01:01.109> from

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
weird technique that I learned from

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.559 
weird technique that I learned from
juicing<00:01:01.829> many<00:01:02.280> times<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.269> I<00:01:03.299> do<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
juicing many times but what I do is

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.260 
juicing many times but what I do is
because<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.739> know<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> spring<00:01:05.309> mix<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
because you know the spring mix and the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.450 
because you know the spring mix and the
spinach<00:01:06.720> don't<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.799> juice<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
spinach don't have a lot of juice in it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
spinach don't have a lot of juice in it
what<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.150> first<00:01:09.810> I'll<00:01:10.080> put<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
what I do is first I'll put that in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.390 
what I do is first I'll put that in
right<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.750> I'll<00:01:13.410> fill<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.920> until<00:01:14.220> it's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
right and I'll fill it in until it's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.150 
right and I'll fill it in until it's
completely<00:01:14.760> full<00:01:15.150> or<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:16.110> feel<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:16.920> full

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
completely full or I feel that it's full

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.610 
completely full or I feel that it's full
so<00:01:17.370> it's<00:01:17.520> almost<00:01:17.670> full<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.500> I'm

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
so it's almost full right and then I'm

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.110 
so it's almost full right and then I'm
going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.800> add<00:01:19.950> something<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.460> has<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> lot<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
going to add something that has a lot of

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.070 
going to add something that has a lot of
juice<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.660> an<00:01:21.810> Asian<00:01:22.200> pear<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.870> this<00:01:24.870> will

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
juice like an Asian pear and this will

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320 
juice like an Asian pear and this will
get<00:01:25.260> more<00:01:25.470> juice<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:25.980> of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.700> spinach<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
get more juice out of the spinach and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
get more juice out of the spinach and
the<00:01:27.540> spring<00:01:27.780> mix<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.170> let's<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.530> how<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the spring mix so let's see how that
