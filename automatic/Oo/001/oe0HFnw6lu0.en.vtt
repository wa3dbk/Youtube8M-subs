 welcome to another episode of richard 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.420
 htt is in front do things in the past 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.860
 we did crazy things 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.990
 the escola are things we did things one 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.630
 little crazy today we will give ourselves some 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.060
 calm give then we are calm today 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.980
 we are home science plan noemi no 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.800
 maybe this is not how we sing 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.739
 become Leninism okay let's do a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.070
 another game another challenge, namely to do 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.140
 blindfolded designs take that if 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.380
 you did then launching the banks 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.640
 blindfold yourself with this hat 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.950
 ridiculously worn I will change 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.630
 little francesca then you improve things 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.760
 to draw I hope very simple it is 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.830
 was generally some of its own 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.990
 simplicity francesca band ac 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.180
 we need this year ago 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.920
 have no joke we have 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.520
 the sheet the pen lit from the shoe 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.520
 a pen don't make me waste time vice 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.720
 people who have to draw 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.850
 we too begin with simple things 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.820
 but the first thing you need to draw 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.010
 simone over sex in the position 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.330
 that suits you best does not seem one of 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.040
 those drawings that are on the cartoons 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.100
 satirical where one does not understand where the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.310
 face and hand a huge bone that is a 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.549
 that was the golf bag bag 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.170
 purple I did what it should be 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.520
 the one to keep the card intending 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.290
 been pierced by a list I'm here from 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.360
 far away I'll do it from afar yes 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.979
 see no for captain yes not 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.040
 too close between the proximity could 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.840
 you can stop playing it off are 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.340
 undecided whether it really is more than one 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.210
 those satirical cartoons where you don't 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.220
 understands the signature of a doctor or kids 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.080
 because I imagined myself much worse is 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.830
 now we put this together with 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.830
 fifth grade children 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.980
 very nice and to put this 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.520
 then mark on a large sheet but no 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.600
 I am small but what is this 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.390
 stamp 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.540
 well now you can find in you you will 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.240
 draw an australopithecus no no too much 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.210
 good possible to simone is indeed 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.340
 you will have to draw a blue whale 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.850
 which says you also understand that one 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:27.310
 whale and not a whale what it is 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:33.090
 was created in more direction than text e 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.090
 then I want to see camel artwork 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.140
 who or what to flowers luzzo Straight but me 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.390
 I wanted but we are much worse is shadow 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.360
 this hard to go wrong now must 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.310
 draw a member of the book isa 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.920
 your parents who called 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.840
 saying I wo n't talk to us anyway 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.360
 I don't design it satirically 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.120
 I try to draw it faithfully or 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.160
 because he is an ok faith has passed a 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.900
 all day will have changed because 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.349
 we have commitments, but we are from 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.239
 new here 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:17.459
 but I never have to take a hat and 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:20.310
 rebels to sciacca where I put it I know 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.480
 if i like it ok then treasure the drawing 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.400
 what you have to do this time I don't think 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.209
 the scene of notre dame where he presided 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.459
 the scene I always asleep 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.880
 while watching the cardboard then notre 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.489
 from me 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.180
 the scene where almost collapses 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.160
 an important structure is good 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.980
 feel that or not it broke on the sheet 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.630
 It has been run again climb the facility is 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:53.400
 in the shape of h maybe something that is not 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:56.220
 so and so has the face that falls 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.620
 here it is finished I think it came 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.709
 to a work of art first percent I do it 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.630
 I show eichele exhibitors and behold 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:10.500
 this masterpiece shows it 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:13.440
 let's face it gave me a lot to be 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.180
 repetitive however this is recognized 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.979
 Baragiano split has it 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.410
 generally I challenge that if a person 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.329
 see this design would understand that 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.130
 notre dame there is not a third we are 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.200
 joking then I will publish on 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.630
 instagram richard h all because i don't 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.940
 followed this picture here by referring to 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.660
 to identify the scene rather only the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.940
 Cathedral 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.710
 and put it well I don't let you know it goes 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.390
 so we are all in the end 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.100
 normally if you haven't seen the challenge 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.680
 of Francesca where she draws her three 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.970
 designs much better than those no no no 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.700
 no no these things one of the masterpieces 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.610
 as they are cacchiarelli nonsense 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.710
 instead I drew with my heart 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.330
 then I recommend the next searches 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.800
 ttf to worry him what will instead come 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.780
 loaded on the prÃ  frog channel 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.909
 you will find his answer where you need to 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.860
 his three things proposed by me instead if 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.330
 you want to see last and research that 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.240
 just they do things you can click 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.490
 on his left hair on his 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.229
 lock left and carla become me 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.900
 next hair, my mom, that 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.560
 I suck I am a slime and certain man 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.949
 crazy how I suck 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.460
 in the end the man slims that of spa 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.979
 francesca said we had an important one 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.360
 what to do then I'll finish the video and myself 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.159

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.810

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.699
 you enjoyed sharing the video 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.409
 this video wants others though 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.909
 there is no serious action in the sense if 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.949
 you want others to share is not it 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.300
 I say so much to say it eventually 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.580
