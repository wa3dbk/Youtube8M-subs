00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.629 
it once it's once you spun it a little
bit<00:03:07.549> then<00:03:08.549> slowly<00:03:09.090> start<00:03:10.280> applying<00:03:11.280> pressure

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
bit then slowly start applying pressure

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.160 
bit then slowly start applying pressure
and<00:03:13.430> pull<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.579> away<00:03:14.849> from<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.420> center<00:03:15.810> unit<00:03:15.930> so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
and pull it away from the center unit so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.440 
and pull it away from the center unit so
it<00:03:16.290> slides<00:03:16.560> down<00:03:16.859> this<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.939> the<00:03:18.000> microphone

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
it slides down this is the microphone

inside where the wire from your

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.370 
inside where the wire from your
microphone<00:05:13.240> goes<00:05:14.240> into<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.690> unit<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.140> what

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
microphone goes into the unit and what

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.440 
microphone goes into the unit and what
that<00:05:15.500> it<00:05:15.590> will<00:05:15.680> do<00:05:15.830> is<00:05:16.010> offer<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.180> little<00:05:17.360> bit

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
that it will do is offer a little bit

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.290 
that it will do is offer a little bit
more<00:05:17.740> pole<00:05:18.740> resistance<00:05:19.390> but<00:05:20.390> also<00:05:22.300> water

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
more pole resistance but also water

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.210 
more pole resistance but also water
resistance<00:05:23.870> so<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.110> water<00:05:24.320> won't<00:05:24.530> go<00:05:24.950> up<00:05:25.100> the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
resistance so the water won't go up the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.500 
resistance so the water won't go up the
microphone<00:05:25.670> line<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:28.180> get<00:05:29.180> into<00:05:29.420> the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
microphone line and get into the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.210 
microphone line and get into the
electronics<00:05:31.420> once<00:05:32.420> that's<00:05:32.690> there<00:05:33.190> put<00:05:34.190> a

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
electronics once that's there put a

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.520 
electronics once that's there put a
little<00:05:34.280> bit<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.700> silicone<00:05:37.990> stop<00:05:38.990> loosen<00:05:39.350> a

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
little bit of silicone stop loosen a

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.950 
little bit of silicone stop loosen a
little<00:05:39.980> bit<00:05:40.420> on<00:05:41.420> the<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:45.800> housing<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:46.430> slide

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
little bit on the the housing and slide

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.450 
little bit on the the housing and slide
that<00:05:47.960> couple<00:05:48.380> our<00:05:48.470> back<00:05:48.680> over<00:05:49.010> top<00:05:49.160> of<00:05:49.220> it

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
that couple our back over top of it

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.280 
that couple our back over top of it
it'll<00:05:50.060> act<00:05:50.300> as<00:05:50.450> a<00:05:50.630> bit<00:05:50.840> of<00:05:50.900> an<00:05:51.020> adhesive

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
it'll act as a bit of an adhesive

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.740 
it'll act as a bit of an adhesive
because<00:05:52.540> there's<00:05:53.540> not<00:05:53.720> as<00:05:53.840> much<00:05:54.700> the

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
because there's not as much the

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.080 
because there's not as much the
microphone<00:05:56.750> you<00:05:56.930> just<00:05:57.080> took<00:05:57.200> off<00:05:57.410> had<00:05:57.710> a

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
microphone you just took off had a

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.370 
microphone you just took off had a
heavier<00:05:59.090> sheath<00:05:59.390> around<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.870> provided<00:06:00.350> a

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
heavier sheath around it provided a

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.490 
heavier sheath around it provided a
little<00:06:00.500> bit<00:06:00.680> of<00:06:00.800> resistance<00:06:02.170> anyways<00:06:03.170> and

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
little bit of resistance anyways and

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.370 
little bit of resistance anyways and
there<00:06:03.710> you<00:06:03.800> go<00:06:03.920> that's<00:06:04.250> it<00:06:04.490> that<00:06:04.760> is<00:06:05.170> the<00:06:06.170> whole

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
there you go that's it that is the whole

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.770 
there you go that's it that is the whole
deal<00:06:07.000> easy<00:06:08.000> peasy<00:06:08.680> it<00:06:09.680> took<00:06:09.860> me<00:06:10.010> about<00:06:10.780> 20

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
deal easy peasy it took me about 20

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.210 
deal easy peasy it took me about 20
minutes<00:06:11.810> just<00:06:12.260> because<00:06:12.500> I<00:06:12.530> took<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.920> quite

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
minutes just because I took it quite

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.180 
minutes just because I took it quite
slow<00:06:13.960> you<00:06:14.960> don't<00:06:15.170> want<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.380> mess<00:06:15.710> something<00:06:15.980> up

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
slow you don't want to mess something up

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.180 
slow you don't want to mess something up
I<00:06:16.370> wasn't<00:06:16.490> sure<00:06:16.700> I'd<00:06:17.000> be<00:06:17.030> looking<00:06:17.360> at<00:06:17.590> so<00:06:18.590> yeah

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
I wasn't sure I'd be looking at so yeah

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.970 
I wasn't sure I'd be looking at so yeah
take<00:06:19.400> your<00:06:19.550> time

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.360 

let<00:06:22.580> me<00:06:22.730> know<00:06:23.380> how<00:06:24.380> it<00:06:24.530> works<00:06:24.710> for<00:06:24.860> you<00:06:25.130> and<00:06:25.310> I'm

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
let me know how it works for you and I'm

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.590 
let me know how it works for you and I'm
sure<00:06:25.610> I'll<00:06:25.790> hear<00:06:26.260> I'm<00:06:27.260> sure<00:06:27.620> I'll<00:06:27.800> hear<00:06:28.010> ya<00:06:28.600> if

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
sure I'll hear I'm sure I'll hear ya if

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.470 
sure I'll hear I'm sure I'll hear ya if
you<00:06:29.810> plan<00:06:30.080> on<00:06:30.430> changing<00:06:31.430> out<00:06:31.730> microphones<00:06:32.270> it

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
you plan on changing out microphones it

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.760 
you plan on changing out microphones it
does<00:06:32.630> make<00:06:32.840> a<00:06:32.870> difference<00:06:33.260> and<00:06:33.380> this<00:06:33.530> is<00:06:33.620> what

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
does make a difference and this is what

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.710 
does make a difference and this is what
you're<00:06:33.860> listening<00:06:33.980> to<00:06:34.310> right<00:06:34.490> now<00:06:34.570> if<00:06:35.570> you

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
you're listening to right now if you

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.650 
you're listening to right now if you
don't<00:06:36.020> remember<00:06:36.820> what<00:06:37.820> it<00:06:37.940> did<00:06:38.150> sound<00:06:38.570> like

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
don't remember what it did sound like

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.350 
don't remember what it did sound like
with<00:06:41.660> the<00:06:41.810> stock<00:06:42.110> s<00:06:42.380> mhm

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
with the stock s mhm

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.290 
with the stock s mhm
was<00:06:44.360> this<00:06:46.340> the<00:06:46.580> faster<00:06:46.940> you<00:06:47.060> can<00:06:47.150> go

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
was this the faster you can go

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.040 
was this the faster you can go
across<00:06:47.510> this<00:06:47.780> bridge<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.290> better<00:06:48.470> and

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
across this bridge the better and

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.200 
across this bridge the better and
there's<00:06:51.050> a<00:06:51.140> reason<00:06:51.530> and<00:06:51.740> that<00:06:51.790> is<00:06:52.790> the<00:06:52.970> bridge

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
there's a reason and that is the bridge

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.190 
there's a reason and that is the bridge
is<00:06:53.540> made<00:06:53.780> out<00:06:53.990> of<00:06:54.310> metal<00:06:55.310> great<00:06:56.060> and<00:06:56.750> when<00:06:57.080> you

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
is made out of metal great and when you
