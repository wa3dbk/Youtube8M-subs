hi<00:00:00.390> Brian<00:00:00.810> here<00:00:01.050> with<00:00:01.199> digital<00:00:01.530> touch<00:00:01.680> systems

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hi Brian here with digital touch systems

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.700 
hi Brian here with digital touch systems
we're<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.879> be<00:00:02.939> looking<00:00:03.090> at<00:00:03.240> our<00:00:03.360> t4<00:00:03.959> line

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
we're going to be looking at our t4 line

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.760 
we're going to be looking at our t4 line
of<00:00:04.920> touchscreens<00:00:05.990> the<00:00:06.990> size<00:00:07.230> right<00:00:07.410> here<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.740> a

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
of touchscreens the size right here is a

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.020 
of touchscreens the size right here is a
42<00:00:08.189> inch<00:00:08.490> diagonal<00:00:10.219> this<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.460> infrared

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
42 inch diagonal this is infrared

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.360 
42 inch diagonal this is infrared
technology<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> little<00:00:14.190> bit<00:00:14.280> of

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
technology so we do have a little bit of

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.450 
technology so we do have a little bit of
a<00:00:14.429> step<00:00:14.610> down<00:00:14.820> from<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.839> bezel<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:17.369> we

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
a step down from the bezel here but we

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.070 
a step down from the bezel here but we
can<00:00:17.760> make<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.449> t4<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.619> pcap<00:00:20.220> screen<00:00:21.080> touch

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
can make the t4 in a pcap screen touch

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.300 
can make the t4 in a pcap screen touch
points<00:00:22.470> will<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.680> up<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.890> 10<00:00:23.070> touch<00:00:23.279> points

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
points will be up to 10 touch points

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.870 
points will be up to 10 touch points

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.380 
gonna have an orientation flip like this
one<00:02:10.380> here<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.519> it<00:02:11.610> will<00:02:11.670> flip<00:02:11.880> around<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.239> my

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
one here so it will flip around to my

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.979 
one here so it will flip around to my
side<00:02:14.329> you<00:02:15.329> always<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.660> out<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.900> the

side you always go out of the
application<00:02:16.940> Windows<00:02:17.940> 7<00:02:18.329> is<00:02:18.510> what<00:02:18.690> most<00:02:18.900> of

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
application Windows 7 is what most of

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.380 
application Windows 7 is what most of
our<00:02:19.140> our<00:02:19.790> platforms<00:02:20.790> are<00:02:20.880> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> come<00:02:21.209> with

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
our our platforms are going to come with

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.509 
our our platforms are going to come with
and<00:02:21.690> Windows<00:02:22.290> 7<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.650> great<00:02:22.890> about<00:02:23.130> allowing

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
and Windows 7 is great about allowing

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.870 
and Windows 7 is great about allowing
multi-touch<00:02:24.120> functionality

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.670 

and<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.570> works<00:02:31.720> just<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.110> big<00:02:32.470> touchscreen

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and it works just like a big touchscreen

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.250 
and it works just like a big touchscreen
