00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
have a little bit of grease on it but

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.590 
have a little bit of grease on it but
not<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.269> much<00:04:19.430> now<00:04:20.430> remember<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.329> can

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
not that much now remember that this can

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.810 
not that much now remember that this can
damage<00:04:21.810> your<00:04:22.139> hubs<00:04:22.350> forever<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.100> possibly

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
damage your hubs forever and possibly

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.580 
damage your hubs forever and possibly
break<00:04:24.000> them<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.510> recommend<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.169> only<00:04:25.320> do<00:04:25.500> it

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
break them so I recommend to only do it

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.980 
break them so I recommend to only do it
once<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:27.570> take<00:04:28.350> all<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.680> decrease<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.990> and

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
once so take all that decrease it and

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.340 
once so take all that decrease it and
then<00:04:31.770> take<00:04:32.100> a<00:04:32.130> guys's<00:04:32.550> driver<00:04:33.020> do<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.139> same

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
then take a guys's driver do the same

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.750 
then take a guys's driver do the same
degrease<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.250> again

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
degrease it again
