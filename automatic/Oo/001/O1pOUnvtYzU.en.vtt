00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:16.490
 We're going to start by making a 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:18.590
 circle we fill in can increase 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.000
 a little if you think it was small and 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.070
 everything will depend on the size you 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.490
 wants to be a unicorn 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.890
 There you play a ball on the side with 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.300
 giving a certain space does not need to give 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.470
 power space may be a little bit 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.180
 more board 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.040
 he'll get a bigger snout 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.650
 looking like a unicorn 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.140
 already grown up just a little bit longer 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.580
 and provide thought was good 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.670
 it's here on the side you see the brush with it 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.560
 you draw your little ear 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.710
 I'll find a way out here that I found 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.000
 which was disproportionate and even 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.050
 a little bigger 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.660
 up there we make a big splash of him 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.270
 like a triangle, it's all here 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.600
 underneath you take the middle of the circle 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.270
 bigger and makes a turn as if it were a 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.549
 semicircle 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.730
 Then you get a brush with pink paint 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.040
 I used an artistic round brush and 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.710
 makes strokes with a very fine finish 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.680
 to stay with art that is flying 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.050
 said he is moving paint 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.310
 In fact, this part 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.210
 people do as we did the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.980
 drawing there with the pink brush with 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.290
 the brush with the pink paint 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.860
 You make traits doing 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.890
 arabesques drawing the flowing mane 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.680
 to give a movement even in the hair of the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.950
 unicorn earphone 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.940
 then you get a brush that has the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.970
 round back take a little ball 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.860
 with an ink of anything I did 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.850
 Nails and can make kiss can do 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.820
 Brown 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.580
 now you think you'd better have a 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.040
 fillet brush 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.920
 And then you start to do how much the year. 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.009
 make the details in case we go 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.950
 to take pride in it first for the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.540
 Produced expression does a lot 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.820
 delicacy because it is a good part 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.240
 little niggling close very thin you 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.370
 You can use a brush that you have 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.980
 important is to give lightness in your case 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.620
 does the eyelashes just press and pull 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.660
 pull with speed that is very thin 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.810
 on the bottom makes it lighter 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.810
 still because I want finely I 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.750
 fill in or draw clean stay with 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.940
 a more realistic air I forgot to paint 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.840
 the horny so I'll spend a 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.330
 yellow ink on top to give a 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.040
 different color for each white but can 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.980
 be white also you need to paint 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.060
 not us is finding skirting 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.190
 the new design of the part of the possible 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.740
 people take a turn to make the mouth 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.530
 and always goes with delicacy not always 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.160
 that is the trace with a certain pressure and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.209
 end the book with flying to stay with him 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.050
 Finer to give a more finish 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.840
 and you go around the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.450
 reality in the hair nor is it an outline 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.040
 people are going to make the dash so that 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.130
 highlight in his hair strands there 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.620
 with a continuous brush with fillet 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.800
 job to finish the contours by 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.519
 do a detail 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.459
 and then with the boy brush it can also be 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.900
 a little bigger needs to be a ticket 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:48.019
 You can give a few drops dock to give 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.670
 glow in the look to leave more cute 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.150
 with this same character makes several 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.380
 I have little balls and I have balls 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.260
 I draw my time and then finish the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.600
 people are going to make several blank traces 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.540
 also to give a few points of light 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.900
 leave us more cute drawing 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.010
 I'm going to make another model of hunger here 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.200
 the unicorn which is a little bit more 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.320
 I had him. It's more like having fun. 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.109
 makes a circle also in the same way 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.240
 in this case I'm using a brush 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.220
 round for you to see you can do with 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.410
 revolver with imported ink too 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.600
 do not let so much mark are you make one 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.720
 rectangle fills makes ear too 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.889
 has already gained shape in reality that changes 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.110
 or if he's more is low cut and you 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.130
 gives an air of the little pony 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.949
 and the rest is the same only 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.340
 In that case, I 'll do with that one. 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:55.100
 orange and I made a different shape the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.199
 hair I did a little more to play 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.940
 behind to get more on the move 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.620
 hence the linen make for you 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.919
 but see that the stay cute 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.419
 symbols for the details of the nose 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.110
 I made the mouthpiece for you to see how 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.810
 is his expression smiling I think 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.810
 He looks very cute and very expensive. 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.610
 of son is not of athina son has 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.270
 the ear can come out a little more 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.979
 inside the round part in the head and a 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.610
 chifrinho does not necessarily need 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.770
 paint as I said in the previous design 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.690
 Where are the same? 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.789
 registered fast 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.919
 is a very easy-to-draw design and gives a 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.539
 super legal effect and may face 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.419
 are also putting several 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:44.860
 you see how it is done and 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.910
 This is it, it's going to give a few taps. 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.039
 adding that it will get very much 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.199
 with staff is this I hope you guys 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.300
 have enjoyed you want other 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.810
