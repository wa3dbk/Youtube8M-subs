 4 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.659
 Hello in this video would like to show you how to monitor the users 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.209
 from Windows XP 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.949
 During user monitoring, Windows writes with which programs and which ones 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.380
 Documents 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.830
 How often does Windows then determine which programs are important 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.640
 and Do offers them the result among others 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.770
 in which so-called custom menus knows about them 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.600
 that may be in their programs oil there then after some time in the 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.990
 Programs that do not use them so often are simply hidden 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.550
 There are two different ways to turn off user monitoring 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 Possibilities seems to be several but I'll show you 2 first the Hot 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.250
 Come to daddy will work everywhere and then run the run 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.250
 Call Registry Editor 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.300
 Answer okay click 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 why as a bomb Karen has users 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.560
 Dan surf 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 Names we are looking for Microsoft 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
 we are looking for Windows 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.950
 then have done so sizes 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 then we are still looking for policies and then we ended up staying explorer here 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.690
 and the whole ride is then 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.590
 Hark the Current User Soft becomes Microsoft Â«Windows Karen Duve 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.600
 Roman Kolles she becomes exploration Inc 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.080
 why click here is with the right mouse button 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.710
 Quickly set a new value and one the fall 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.680
 Piccard hopes up in India 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.780
 STO 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.110
 Menden traction 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.050
 By default, of course, he is after zeroing so you click 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.440
 just come in 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.440
 the my 1 as they value 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.680
 by Dietmar Fuchs 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.000
 so the second alternative I want that we take out again to show 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.759
 that it 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.209
 The second option is also very easy 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.650
 the second option is for the users the so-called 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.929
 the Group Policy Editor will have available 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:27.029
 So all users with Windows XP pro or the retrofitted the piety 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.200
 So we're going to run state this time in Hoffmann Dialog though 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.889
 entering the ALV ETR and MSC 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.989
 click OK de 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.989
 we go back to the user configuration 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.529
 on the administrative templates 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.979
 There we select Start menu and Tosca bar 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.949
 and so called here after the corresponding entry 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.669
 User monitoring 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.279
 deactivate 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.519
 the press stepped 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.329
 Double 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.689
 activate the activation must activate 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.519
 at least the lock and that was already a 2 2 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.519
 otherwise that worked perfectly has now over again as a controller 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.379
 call the registry because then there is the entry made the earthquake by hand 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.969
 to have 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.439
 so far, who is in it 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.649
 only instruments Irish 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.689
 with the value 1 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.639
 so has the group policy goal for us 1 1
