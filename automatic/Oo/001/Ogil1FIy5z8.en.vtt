00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.040
 hello and welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.790
 we will see how to recover 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.250
 colors completely faded with 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.460
 lightroom 5 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:27.990
 is this possible yes we will see 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:31.300
 how as usual shadows 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.730
 I will move in the direction 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.190
 reverse because the shadows nothing has 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.600
 not practically so the photo of 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:46.300
 very light jails the roads light the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.640
 white point but me not too much because 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.680
 that there are a lot of egg whites in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.840
 blackhead Coy therefore put far 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.260
 are not really big differences 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.600
 although we have already been able to recover but this 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:10.210
 is not enough so now we 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:14.110
 let's work on clarity on 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:18.270
 the vip the vib rance no troubles 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.560
 like this yes and the saturation the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.010
 moderation 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.040
 we can already see the yellow houses here 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:32.220
 has appeared well here so we 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:37.229
 begins to see detours the exhibition 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:42.880
 than to increase the contrasts 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:46.420
 this is like this ok so now what 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.159
 what remains to be done is to embellish the 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.240
 his I'll say so so we're going to 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.080
 do with a gradient filter I'm going to 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.400
 put with old and darker or 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.799
 to go settle by after there is to 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.960
 a little too loud probably too much 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.979
 pronounced but that's up to you both 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.690
 judged what you there it's too much wade has to 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:19.900
 become blue here is a beautiful blue sky 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:24.319
 with a little magenta below here 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.830
 I like it like that my request 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.270
 we will do 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.300
 there are still some small 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.209
 iron repairs is here and there so we 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.560
 will do these touch-ups to remove the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.150
 fur 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:41.230
 here we must be careful who is not 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:45.380
 not so yes we can actually done 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.720
 at the end of comparison is well as we 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.840
 said there's no picture here it's a picture 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.610
 who plays Monday at the lab to develop but 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.040
 you will not have much of a rare thing 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.709
 because the automatic terminal 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.840
 are probably going to fix but never 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.440
 like like these what is done 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.239
 manually 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.000
 so this is an operation to do before 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.280
 to carry your photos to plowing otherwise 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.120
 you will be disappointed he will laugh the box you 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.920
 nothing 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.640
 no it's your photo that is not 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.209
 soft and that's all quran if you give 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.299
 sand you will have with a beautiful moe 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.370
 you will have the same thing in the photo so 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.170
 here what am I going to do so I'm going 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.810
 return what we can do is this 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.570
 which still annoys me is here below 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.410
 the part his oval uncle removed 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:39.470
 like this just above is what we 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.750
 can do that can diminish the sky ah 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:49.010
 like I see there is still a task 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:54.370
 there I 'm done I do not see 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.370
 as it encourages sailing leaf has 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.549
 done but what can we do 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.200
 now that I'm fighting and that's it 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.090
 a photo that was good to see for 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.609
 their trash 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.170
 now it's a nice photo to 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.430
 watch 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.380
 you always have to say one thing is 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 what I would put in my living room 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.540
 this certainly not this one 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.530
 she could go there you tell me like 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.669
 that we are not sure and what the world 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.930
 so you shovel it with respect to 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.070
 the other so I would like of course this 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.430
 what can we still do 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.570
 well I think it's over 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.669
 intersected it or and here I thank you 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.460
 to have followed me to the end 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.460
 usually we see that him
