about<00:00:11.580> flying<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.330> with<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.870> paraglider<00:00:13.349> going

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
about flying and with a paraglider going

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.110 
about flying and with a paraglider going
up<00:00:13.920> turning<00:00:14.250> off<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> power<00:00:14.550> and<00:00:14.969> just

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
up turning off the power and just

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.179 
up turning off the power and just
floating<00:00:15.509> around<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.230> there's<00:00:16.710> no<00:00:16.949> way<00:00:17.130> to
