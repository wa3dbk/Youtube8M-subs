our<00:00:08.450> folks<00:00:08.929> in<00:00:09.139> this<00:00:09.289> video<00:00:09.969> I'm<00:00:10.969> going<00:00:11.240> to

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
our folks in this video I'm going to

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.759 
our folks in this video I'm going to
show<00:00:11.929> you<00:00:11.990> how<00:00:12.440> to<00:00:13.330> take<00:00:14.379> acids<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:15.559> bases

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
show you how to take acids and bases

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.859 
show you how to take acids and bases
react<00:00:16.759> them<00:00:16.939> together<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:17.599> get<00:00:17.720> your

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
react them together and get your

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.870 
react them together and get your
products<00:00:18.349> and<00:00:18.770> I've<00:00:18.890> got<00:00:19.160> some<00:00:19.340> simple<00:00:19.730> rules

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
products and I've got some simple rules

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.080 
products and I've got some simple rules
up<00:00:20.210> here<00:00:20.509> if<00:00:21.349> you<00:00:21.439> have<00:00:21.650> a<00:00:21.680> strong<00:00:22.099> acid<00:00:22.520> with<00:00:23.060> a

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
up here if you have a strong acid with a

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.179 
up here if you have a strong acid with a
strong<00:00:23.180> base<00:00:23.449> you're<00:00:24.379> always<00:00:24.559> going<00:00:24.950> to<00:00:24.980> make

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
strong base you're always going to make

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.479 
strong base you're always going to make
water<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:26.119> some<00:00:26.480> type<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.960> salt<00:00:27.259> it's<00:00:28.099> going

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
water and some type of salt it's going

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.380 
water and some type of salt it's going
to<00:00:28.610> be<00:00:28.790> a<00:00:28.820> soluble<00:00:29.689> ionic<00:00:29.809> compound<00:00:30.680> now<00:00:31.610> what

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
to be a soluble ionic compound now what

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.590 
to be a soluble ionic compound now what
I<00:00:32.419> like<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.750> do<00:00:33.079> is<00:00:33.649> I<00:00:33.890> like<00:00:34.250> to<00:00:34.600> label

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
I like to do is I like to label

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.290 
I like to do is I like to label
everything<00:00:36.110> as<00:00:36.739> far<00:00:36.950> as<00:00:37.010> being<00:00:37.370> strong<00:00:37.879> or

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
everything as far as being strong or

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.600 
everything as far as being strong or
weak<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:38.960> if<00:00:39.469> it's<00:00:39.649> an<00:00:39.770> acid<00:00:40.160> or<00:00:40.219> if<00:00:40.340> it's<00:00:40.520> a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
weak and if it's an acid or if it's a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.540 
weak and if it's an acid or if it's a
base<00:00:41.050> this<00:00:42.050> is<00:00:42.110> one<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.739> strong<00:00:43.010> acids

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
base this is one of the strong acids

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.750 
base this is one of the strong acids
that<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:43.940> had<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.180> memorize<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:45.399> I'm<00:00:46.399> going

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
that you had to memorize and I'm going

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.590 
that you had to memorize and I'm going
to<00:00:46.820> write<00:00:47.090> SAF<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:48.079> it<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:49.790> let<00:00:50.120> me<00:00:50.300> remember

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
to write SAF of it to let me remember

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.930 
to write SAF of it to let me remember
that<00:00:50.870> it's<00:00:51.020> a<00:00:51.110> strong<00:00:51.350> acid<00:00:51.560> this<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:52.730> one<00:00:52.910> of

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
that it's a strong acid this is one of

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.500 
that it's a strong acid this is one of
the<00:00:53.890> strong<00:00:54.890> bases<00:00:55.399> that<00:00:55.520> you<00:00:55.670> memorized<00:00:56.149> I'm

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
the strong bases that you memorized I'm

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.500 
the strong bases that you memorized I'm
on<00:00:56.630> right<00:00:56.809> s<00:00:57.309> D<00:00:58.309> F<00:00:58.670> of<00:00:58.910> it<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.239> way<00:00:59.360> I<00:00:59.390> know

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
on right s D F of it that way I know

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.889 
on right s D F of it that way I know
it's<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.930> strong<00:01:00.320> base<00:01:00.790> so<00:01:01.790> I<00:01:02.180> know<00:01:02.510> how<00:01:02.719> this

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
it's a strong base so I know how this

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.869 
it's a strong base so I know how this
level<00:01:03.290> is<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.410> strong<00:01:03.680> acid<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.369> a<00:01:04.640> strong<00:01:04.699> base

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
level is a strong acid and a strong base

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.359 
level is a strong acid and a strong base
now<00:01:05.750> if<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:05.990> didn't<00:01:06.259> have<00:01:06.290> these<00:01:06.530> memorized<00:01:06.950> you

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
now if I didn't have these memorized you

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.069 
now if I didn't have these memorized you
might<00:01:07.549> be<00:01:07.700> wondering<00:01:07.909> how<00:01:08.689> you<00:01:08.750> know<00:01:08.930> which

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
might be wondering how you know which

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.319 
might be wondering how you know which
ones<00:01:09.290> they<00:01:09.439> asked<00:01:09.680> us<00:01:09.770> how<00:01:09.979> he<00:01:10.060> asked<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:11.149> how

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
ones they asked us how he asked is how

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.599 
ones they asked us how he asked is how
do<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.509> know<00:01:11.600> which<00:01:11.750> ones<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.259> base<00:01:12.609> well

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
do you know which ones the base well

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:15.879 
do you know which ones the base well
it's<00:01:13.850> kind<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.539> easy

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:15.889 
it's kind of easy

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:17.499 
it's kind of easy
the<00:01:16.130> one<00:01:16.310> that's<00:01:16.399> got<00:01:16.579> hydrogen<00:01:16.909> in<00:01:17.179> the<00:01:17.240> front

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
the one that's got hydrogen in the front

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.669 
the one that's got hydrogen in the front
is<00:01:18.069> normally<00:01:19.069> and<00:01:19.249> more<00:01:19.459> likely<00:01:19.939> your<00:01:20.119> acid

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
is normally and more likely your acid

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.919 
is normally and more likely your acid
the<00:01:21.679> one<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.130> has<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.369> o<00:01:22.670> H<00:01:23.060> trailing<00:01:23.689> on<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
the one that has the o H trailing on the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.629 
the one that has the o H trailing on the
back<00:01:24.139> is<00:01:24.499> your<00:01:25.279> face<00:01:26.209> so<00:01:26.889> H<00:01:27.889> is<00:01:28.130> in<00:01:28.249> the<00:01:28.369> front

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
back is your face so H is in the front

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.440 
back is your face so H is in the front
that's<00:01:29.600> going<00:01:29.749> to<00:01:29.990> be<00:01:30.289> your<00:01:30.469> acid<00:01:30.979> o<00:01:31.189> H<00:01:32.119> on<00:01:32.359> the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
that's going to be your acid o H on the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
that's going to be your acid o H on the
back<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.959> going<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.259> be<00:01:33.319> your<00:01:33.499> race<00:01:33.700> now

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
back is going to be your race now

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.850 
back is going to be your race now
you<00:01:36.479> need<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> try<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> figure<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.649> your

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you need to try to figure out what your

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.420 
you need to try to figure out what your
products<00:01:38.340> are<00:01:38.640> okay<00:01:39.539> now<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.890> only<00:01:41.100> rule

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
products are okay now if the only rule

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.639 
products are okay now if the only rule
that<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.700> remember<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.780> strong<00:01:43.110> acids

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that you remember is that strong acids

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
that you remember is that strong acids
and<00:01:43.770> strong<00:01:43.860> bases<00:01:44.210> meaning<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.360> drums<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and strong bases meaning just drums in

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.539 
and strong bases meaning just drums in
general<00:01:46.350> dissociate<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.250> two<00:01:47.430> percent

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
general dissociate one two percent

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.179 
general dissociate one two percent
meaning<00:01:48.090> break<00:01:48.750> down<00:01:48.960> into<00:01:49.229> ions<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
meaning break down into ions and that

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.370 
meaning break down into ions and that
will<00:01:50.610> help<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> lot<00:01:51.210> with<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.899> plus

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
will help you a lot with just this plus

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.319 
will help you a lot with just this plus
you<00:01:52.560> got<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> retain<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.820> remember<00:01:54.210> your

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
you got to retain and remember your

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.499 
you got to retain and remember your
solubility<00:01:54.840> rules<00:01:55.049> which<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.679> important<00:01:56.509> now

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
solubility rules which is important now

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.139 
solubility rules which is important now
since<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.920> dissociate<00:01:59.310> because<00:01:59.970> it's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
since this will dissociate because it's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.770 
since this will dissociate because it's
strong<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:01.560> basically<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.569> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
strong you basically you know this is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.469 
strong you basically you know this is
for<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.110> scratch<00:02:04.409> work<00:02:04.939> your<00:02:05.939> scratch<00:02:06.240> work

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
for your scratch work your scratch work

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.740 
for your scratch work your scratch work
would<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.929> basically<00:02:07.170> you'd<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.740> h<00:02:08.420> plus<00:02:09.420> 1

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
would be basically you'd have h plus 1

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.410 
would be basically you'd have h plus 1
and<00:02:10.160> this<00:02:11.160> no.3<00:02:11.760> would<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.120> negative<00:02:12.840> 1<00:02:13.049> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and this no.3 would be negative 1 and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.830 
and this no.3 would be negative 1 and
this<00:02:15.420> K<00:02:15.930> would<00:02:16.290> be<00:02:16.349> k<00:02:16.769> plus<00:02:17.160> 1<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.880> H<00:02:18.390> be

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this K would be k plus 1 and this H be

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.250 
this K would be k plus 1 and this H be
negative<00:02:19.290> 1<00:02:19.500> because<00:02:20.280> those<00:02:20.459> are<00:02:20.610> your<00:02:20.730> ions

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
negative 1 because those are your ions

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.570 
negative 1 because those are your ions
now<00:02:22.260> all<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.709> do<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.280> put<00:02:23.549> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
now all that you do is you put a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.550 
now all that you do is you put a
different<00:02:23.849> positive<00:02:24.239> with<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> different

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
different positive with a different

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.130 
different positive with a different
negative<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:27.380> when<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.500> write<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:29.780> later

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
negative now when you write that later

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.080 
negative now when you write that later
this<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.950> one<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.459> will<00:02:32.640> combine

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
this is the one that will combine

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.680 
this is the one that will combine
together<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.780> make<00:02:34.260> water<00:02:35.239> okay<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.569> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
together and make water okay but for the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.300 
together and make water okay but for the
time<00:02:36.900> being<00:02:37.200> let's<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:37.590> do<00:02:37.890> some<00:02:38.069> scratch

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
time being let's just do some scratch

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.160 
time being let's just do some scratch
work<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.730> we<00:02:38.849> can<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.269> this

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
work so we can see this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.120 
work so we can see this
okay<00:02:40.800> put<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.520> plus<00:02:41.970> with<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.690> naked<00:02:43.230> it's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
okay put this plus with this naked it's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.120 
okay put this plus with this naked it's
that<00:02:44.310> way<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.490> get<00:02:44.790> k<00:02:45.060> plus<00:02:45.450> 1<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.170> then<00:02:46.620> oh<00:02:46.770> 3

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
that way you get k plus 1 and then oh 3

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.090 
that way you get k plus 1 and then oh 3
negative<00:02:47.459> 1<00:02:47.930> after<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.709> could<00:02:49.860> bind

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
negative 1 after that you could bind

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.830 
negative 1 after that you could bind
these<00:02:50.400> since<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> know<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> strong

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
these since you know this is a strong

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.390 
these since you know this is a strong
acid<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.319> strong<00:02:52.530> base<00:02:52.650> they're<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.340> to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
acid and strong base they're going to

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.370 
acid and strong base they're going to
make<00:02:53.490> water<00:02:53.730> here's<00:02:54.420> your<00:02:54.660> water<00:02:54.870> right<00:02:55.140> here

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
make water here's your water right here

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.980 
make water here's your water right here
now<00:02:58.380> after<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:59.070> on<00:02:59.760> your<00:03:00.000> water<00:03:00.240> go<00:03:00.690> ahead

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
now after that on your water go ahead

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.110 
now after that on your water go ahead
and<00:03:01.110> let<00:03:02.010> everyone<00:03:02.310> know<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.580> that's<00:03:02.940> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and let everyone know that that's a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.740 
and let everyone know that that's a
liquid

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
liquid

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.030 
liquid
I'll<00:03:04.020> put<00:03:04.200> an<00:03:04.320> L<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:07.110> South<00:03:07.800> that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
I'll put an L on it and the South that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.490 
I'll put an L on it and the South that
we<00:03:08.190> make<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.760> potassium<00:03:09.390> nitrate<00:03:10.640> now<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:13.290> this

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
we make is potassium nitrate now so this

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.600 
we make is potassium nitrate now so this
is<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.830> quiz<00:03:14.160> because<00:03:14.640> it's<00:03:14.940> soluble<00:03:15.239> in<00:03:15.600> water

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
is a quiz because it's soluble in water

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.310 
is a quiz because it's soluble in water
meaning<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.730> makes<00:03:17.940> ions<00:03:18.420> plus<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:19.050> a

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
meaning it makes ions plus it's a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.979 
meaning it makes ions plus it's a
strong-ass<00:03:20.150> Associates<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.360> breaks<00:03:21.570> down<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
strong-ass Associates it breaks down the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.259 
strong-ass Associates it breaks down the
aisle<00:03:22.320> same<00:03:23.190> thing<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:23.700> strong<00:03:24.030> base

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
aisle same thing here strong base

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.180 
aisle same thing here strong base
dissociates<00:03:24.959> down<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.320> ions<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:25.830> that's<00:03:25.980> also

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
dissociates down to ions so that's also

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.610 
dissociates down to ions so that's also
like<00:03:26.430> with<00:03:26.700> water<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.660> liquid<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.440> gets

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
like with water is a liquid so it gets

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.300 
like with water is a liquid so it gets
the<00:03:28.769> L<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.880> K<00:03:30.120> no.3<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.290> our<00:03:31.620> salt<00:03:31.980> and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the L and this K no.3 is our salt and

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.100 
the L and this K no.3 is our salt and
remember<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.850> rule<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.239> all<00:03:33.480> not<00:03:33.840> all

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
remember the rule is all not all

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.280 
remember the rule is all not all
nitrates<00:03:34.920> are<00:03:35.070> soluble<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.360> that's<00:03:36.630> also<00:03:36.930> an

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
nitrates are soluble so that's also an

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.440 
nitrates are soluble so that's also an
aq<00:03:37.830> now<00:03:39.830> after<00:03:40.830> I've<00:03:40.950> done<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:42.209> know<00:03:42.269> I'd

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
aq now after I've done this you know I'd

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.930 
aq now after I've done this you know I'd
like<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.660> make<00:03:42.930> sure<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.380> it's<00:03:43.560> balanced<00:03:44.130> so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
like to make sure that it's balanced so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.940 
like to make sure that it's balanced so
basically<00:03:45.630> what<00:03:45.930> we<00:03:46.079> have<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
basically what we have here is a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.970 
basically what we have here is a
balanced<00:03:47.489> equation<00:03:47.610> with<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.750> two<00:03:48.989> products

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
balanced equation with the two products

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.729 
balanced equation with the two products
shown<00:03:50.370> water<00:03:51.239> being<00:03:51.510> one<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.840> them<00:03:52.200> with<00:03:52.590> an

now<00:04:25.980> if<00:04:26.100> you're<00:04:26.280> going<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.700> wrap<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.150> ionic

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
now if you're going to wrap the ionic

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.640 
now if you're going to wrap the ionic
equation<00:04:29.030> or<00:04:30.030> what<00:04:30.420> some<00:04:30.630> people<00:04:30.750> refer<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.410> as

basically<00:04:37.260> it's<00:04:37.680> going<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.920> look<00:04:38.070> very

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
basically it's going to look very

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.130 
basically it's going to look very

we're<00:04:41.010> going<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.580> have<00:04:41.960> since<00:04:42.960> they're<00:04:43.140> all

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
we're going to have since they're all

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.940 
we're going to have since they're all

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
strong and except for liquid it'll stay

h2o<00:04:47.490> since<00:04:48.270> all<00:04:48.420> these<00:04:48.570> are<00:04:48.750> aqueous<00:04:49.140> is<00:04:49.560> will

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
h2o since all these are aqueous is will

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.100 
h2o since all these are aqueous is will
break<00:04:49.980> them<00:04:50.190> down<00:04:50.220> on<00:04:50.550> ions<00:04:50.880> but<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.360> liquid

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
break them down on ions but the liquid

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.500 
break them down on ions but the liquid
we<00:04:52.530> don't<00:04:52.710> break<00:04:52.860> apart<00:04:53.010> liquid<00:04:53.670> solids<00:04:54.240> and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
we don't break apart liquid solids and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.130 
we don't break apart liquid solids and
gases

gases

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.230

okay<00:04:55.650> so<00:04:55.710> slow<00:04:56.160> liquid<00:04:56.580> gas<00:04:56.760> don't<00:04:57.030> break

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
okay so slow liquid gas don't break

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.370 
okay so slow liquid gas don't break

just<00:06:14.490> remember<00:06:15.000> these<00:06:15.240> are<00:06:15.480> not<00:06:15.510> horrible

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
just remember these are not horrible

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.960 
just remember these are not horrible
they're<00:06:16.440> actually<00:06:16.770> very<00:06:17.340> similar<00:06:17.640> to<00:06:17.730> the
