a little helpful hint

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.109 
a little helpful hint
depending<00:00:18.310> on<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.490> difficulty<00:00:18.820> that<00:00:19.029> you're

less prominent in the game obviously the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.000 
less prominent in the game obviously the

heart of the difficulty the less melee

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.769 
heart of the difficulty the less melee
weapons<00:00:27.310> you'll<00:00:27.430> come<00:00:27.580> across<00:00:27.699> these<00:00:28.539> are<00:00:28.689> the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
weapons you'll come across these are the

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.929 
weapons you'll come across these are the
stats<00:00:29.080> on<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.350> melee<00:00:29.529> weapons<00:00:29.920> um<00:00:30.189> obviously

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
stats on the melee weapons um obviously

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.669 
stats on the melee weapons um obviously
the<00:00:31.210> first<00:00:31.359> three<00:00:31.599> here<00:00:31.750> go<00:00:31.990> by<00:00:32.140> number<00:00:32.649> of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:32.679 
the first three here go by number of

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:35.430 
the first three here go by number of
hits<00:00:33.010> I<00:00:33.249> don't<00:00:33.850> I<00:00:34.269> would<00:00:34.839> think<00:00:34.989> that<00:00:35.139> means

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
hits I don't I would think that means

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.889 
hits I don't I would think that means
that<00:00:35.559> they're<00:00:35.739> not<00:00:35.769> one-shot<00:00:36.370> kills<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.719> um

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
that they're not one-shot kills but um

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.709 
that they're not one-shot kills but um
as<00:00:38.319> you<00:00:38.469> can<00:00:38.499> see<00:00:38.679> here<00:00:39.359> machete<00:00:40.359> in<00:00:40.479> the<00:00:40.569> hash

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
as you can see here machete in the hash

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.479 
as you can see here machete in the hash
should<00:00:40.929> go<00:00:41.049> by<00:00:41.199> kills<00:00:41.530> not<00:00:41.799> hits<00:00:42.100> so<00:00:42.399> I'm

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
should go by kills not hits so I'm

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.889 
should go by kills not hits so I'm
assuming<00:00:42.670> that<00:00:42.819> those<00:00:42.999> are<00:00:43.149> one-shot<00:00:43.420> kill

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
assuming that those are one-shot kill

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.410 
assuming that those are one-shot kill
weapons<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:45.579> obvious<00:00:45.850> reasons<00:00:46.149> those<00:00:46.269> are

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
weapons for obvious reasons those are

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.279 
weapons for obvious reasons those are
blunt<00:00:46.659> and<00:00:46.870> those<00:00:47.019> are<00:00:47.549> edged<00:00:48.549> blades<00:00:49.289> here's

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
blunt and those are edged blades here's

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.869 
blunt and those are edged blades here's
the<00:00:50.440> firearms<00:00:50.859> here's<00:00:51.579> something

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
the firearms here's something

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.209 
the firearms here's something
interesting<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.629> holsters<00:00:53.049> holsters<00:00:53.679> um<00:00:53.920> it

interesting the holsters holsters um it

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.259 
interesting the holsters holsters um it
what<00:00:55.059> how<00:00:55.569> this<00:00:55.780> works<00:00:56.019> is<00:00:56.229> um<00:00:56.549> it's<00:00:57.549> difficult

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
what how this works is um it's difficult

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.180 
what how this works is um it's difficult
to<00:00:58.629> switch<00:00:58.869> from<00:00:59.049> weapon<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.649> weapon<00:00:59.769> because

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
than the standard nine and then these

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.490 
than the standard nine and then these
are<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.240> different<00:01:58.509> levels
