00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
product may not actually be in the game

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.230 
product may not actually be in the game
yet<00:02:04.720> deej<00:02:05.470> from<00:02:05.800> Bungie<00:02:06.190> has<00:02:06.460> said<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.880> was<00:02:07.030> in

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
yet deej from Bungie has said it was in

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.270 
yet deej from Bungie has said it was in
the<00:02:07.600> loot<00:02:07.840> table<00:02:08.229> but<00:02:08.560> there<00:02:08.679> have<00:02:08.830> been<00:02:09.009> no

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the loot table but there have been no

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.630 
the loot table but there have been no
reports<00:02:09.310> about<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.660> do<00:02:10.720> believe<00:02:11.260> over

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
reports about it and I do believe over

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.440 
reports about it and I do believe over
50,000<00:02:12.640> Guardians<00:02:13.030> have

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
50,000 Guardians have

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.479 
50,000 Guardians have
pleated<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.870> raid<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.770> been<00:02:15.010> many

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
pleated this raid there have been many

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.300 
pleated this raid there have been many
attempts<00:02:16.030> at<00:02:16.180> crota<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.620> do<00:02:17.680> believe<00:02:18.160> that

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
attempts at crota and I do believe that

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.009 
attempts at crota and I do believe that
someone<00:02:18.610> should<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:18.970> came<00:02:19.180> upon<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.599> if<00:02:19.870> it

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
someone should have came upon it if it

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.559 
someone should have came upon it if it
was<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.530> game<00:02:20.650> are<00:02:20.890> ready<00:02:21.190> now<00:02:21.970> my<00:02:22.209> third

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
was in the game are ready now my third

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.229 
was in the game are ready now my third
and<00:02:22.780> final<00:02:22.900> thought<00:02:23.590> was<00:02:24.069> maybe<00:02:24.400> killing<00:02:24.970> the

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
and final thought was maybe killing the

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.660 
and final thought was maybe killing the
gatekeepers<00:02:25.930> repeatedly<00:02:26.530> instead<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.400> crota

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
gatekeepers repeatedly instead of crota

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.880 
gatekeepers repeatedly instead of crota
will<00:02:27.910> increase<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.510> chance<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:29.110> getting<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
will increase the chance of getting the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.640 
will increase the chance of getting the
crux<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.310> crota<00:02:30.670> now<00:02:31.269> maybe<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.440> kill

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
crux of crota now maybe you have to kill

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.949 
crux of crota now maybe you have to kill
to<00:02:32.680> gatekeepers<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.819> then<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.599> to<00:02:34.750> run

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
to gatekeepers and then you have to run

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.500 
to gatekeepers and then you have to run
through<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.260> ogres<00:02:35.709> on<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:36.340> phase<00:02:36.670> take

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
through the ogres on one phase take

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.360 
through the ogres on one phase take
croda<00:02:37.810> down<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.380> then<00:02:38.769> you<00:02:38.860> have<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.160> run

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
croda down and then you have to run

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.039 
croda down and then you have to run
through<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.640> ogres<00:02:39.940> again<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.660> then<00:02:40.780> kill

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
through the ogres again and then kill

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.080 
through the ogres again and then kill
crota<00:02:41.319> on<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.950> same<00:02:42.220> run<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.940> would<00:02:43.030> be

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
crota on that same run so that would be

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.030 
crota on that same run so that would be
pretty<00:02:43.420> hard<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.959> getting<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.500> get<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.769> crux

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
pretty hard and getting to get the crux

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.710 
pretty hard and getting to get the crux
of<00:02:45.160> crota<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.700> I'm<00:02:45.970> not<00:02:46.120> even<00:02:46.299> sure<00:02:46.330> if<00:02:46.599> it

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
of crota and I'm not even sure if it

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.870 
of crota and I'm not even sure if it
would<00:02:46.780> be<00:02:46.959> guaranteed<00:02:47.200> for<00:02:47.680> everyone<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:48.790> if

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
would be guaranteed for everyone but if

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.670 
would be guaranteed for everyone but if
you<00:02:48.970> guys<00:02:49.120> do<00:02:49.450> end<00:02:49.720> up<00:02:49.840> getting<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.170> crux<00:02:50.530> of

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
you guys do end up getting the crux of

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.380 
you guys do end up getting the crux of
crota<00:02:50.890> by<00:02:51.099> trying<00:02:51.459> these<00:02:51.610> methods<00:02:52.060> then

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390
