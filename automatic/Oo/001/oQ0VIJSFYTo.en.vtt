 Although Well did you say what you want to say to or say if You're Notebook by Yes To Another 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:56.720
 Towards right-handed people The page is relatively relatively 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.050
 It's straight easy to write along the by-line I'm straight multiplying 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.860
 Just say I soil left Nee 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.280
 This is why I feel to a soaring 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.870
 I feel like I can not buy it straight 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:16.090
 It is relatively this way when writing Neji with the right 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:21.820
 Though I'm straight easy to write stretched out absolutely hands of say the left of the page 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.850
 I have to go back, so I ca n't help it-I'm going right upwards 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:29.240
 this 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:35.090
 Me this problem ne actually solved but Hey Hey Mr. I think that common 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.540
 I have a throat today and I would like to introduce you to your notebook. 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.540
 Shari 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.960
 Yes I say the sound of a violation a Here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.570
 Although there is one that I have received, Meha notebook and going to be a violation 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:54.990
 I write in notebook and English 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:57.700
 a little distorted form in a such feeling but this I turned white I think that there is no bees and flowers 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.570
 It's has become an if I open it 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.670
 Hmm 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.670
 When I open it like this 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 Hmm 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:14.480
 This it's you I'm a spoon of the notebook has become a little interesting form 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.480
 It's straight but this is different 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.510
 It's a bit like this and the angle is attached 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.640
 It is easy to put the left page in a mess by how this angle is attached 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.870
 What 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 Then I think that I want to shoot at an angle as well 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.930
 I would like to actually open the door here of violation you ask to look at this angle 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.040
 I am 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.829
 Think straight towards the note Please face the note 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.329
 Think of it as your usual angle 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.329
 Bake ridge in yes 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.780
 It becomes like this feeling probably angled of over 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.580
 First of all, here is a rehearsal note. 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.510
 those of a late is it right-handed 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.510
 Please Oite the right page in the center of the body 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:08.010
 Then of course I right to 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:12.480
 This line so it becomes to the horizontal toward the flower bed center 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:17.640
 You can write straight letters and the page on the left though 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:21.209
 Because we also by visiting a line in the center of the from here. It is what the left of the page 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.500
 It is easy to write on the rice page without difficulty. 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.170
 Voyeur earlier than usual 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.470
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.880
 Also written ran to the left of the later years as was the center with text from the 10 roots Well right in this kind of feeling 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.460
 Because it must be 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:40.150
 It would change the end to the ever-increasing I doing the right like this feeling after all 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:45.430
 If it were 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:52.090
 The page on the left is also on the right side of the boat and is here a rehearsal note 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:54.340
 A There is much less very notebook, which is designed as an axis so it is the right shoulder that has been developed 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.890
 I think it is considered 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.140
 In fact, it is this here left-handed who supports left-handed as well as those of wii equipment 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.489
 of 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:08.900
 Others it is the left of the page toward the center of the body 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:15.480
 In and towards the left you write I go left to the shaft 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:20.489
 Now it is easy to put on very smoothly for you draw a mini page 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.060
 The degree of design is yes, and it is amazing to introduce this Inami note here 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.210
 Was 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.050
 I want to go back and shoot beautifully 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.760
 If you want to say that prefecture, I would recommend this reaction 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.470
 I feel that was better I be I Anonanka is easy to write Mecha song 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.120
 Now the school has started and a new notebook 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.090
 We also have one and be used do is but then I think it is the here Iha another and using the 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.160
 Please try using it 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.850
 And looking back I doing this it is Once that say this time I note finished using will be fun 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.169
 If you see 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.910
 I think it's going straight, so it's going to be a nice finish 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.110
 Say Do 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.420
 I think this is a notebook, but it is near stationery and net 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.840
 Because I think it will sell for shopping 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:06.700
 See you please try to meter your purchase consideration if good 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:10.009
 Notebook that was considered the I guess the body of design today by saying yes 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.070
 Well another To chromatography over was my introduction 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.120
 It's a name that says "Don't drink it." 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.720
 No criticism 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:21.400
 Maybe there was a mountain where there was a person who developed it 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.080
 Or the shape of the time I went Katakana is good . 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.490
