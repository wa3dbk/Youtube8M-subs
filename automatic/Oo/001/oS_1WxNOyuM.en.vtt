00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.630
 modernism is that we put a pcb to 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.880
 each region so what makes that when 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.530
 the day comes back it is captured under a 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.460

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:50.230
 prisons that risk on some some 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.770
 too long and we're still at 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.320
 the old with the constator alba 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.030

 get the jean prize to laugh we take off the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.470
 brague that we put in a device 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.890
 so that requires yet there wait for the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.820
 jewel is what you can bring 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.080
 pion to see this common project 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.910
 but it will still be captured at 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.910
 the arrival here are last fairs 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.650
 open mouse skin nonprogressive 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:20.950
 that's why for his manias 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:31.620
 progress is returning this year with the 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:39.729
 time there since the years have been 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:42.419
 especially this supervisor 125 but the 125 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.430
 million to all tonight but had that 5 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:55.140
 self- inflows as usually 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:55.140
 but at least in French 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.340
 next week 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.340
 video 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:24.150
 the dovecote and state a privilege 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.730
 seigneurial until the eighteenth century it is 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.620
 to say that the dovecote makes you 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.670
 to have a dovecote show the 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:36.950
 power and power of a lord 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:39.180
 so the peasants the integral of 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.650
 the show why do we dream a lot of 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.750
 pigeons because they loved their flesh 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.290
 tender and also for their settlers 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.940
 rim 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.570
 because you have to know a dovecote 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.640
 simple also a hinged dovecote 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.510
 we have raised the pawns for their flesh and 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.510
 for their settlers
