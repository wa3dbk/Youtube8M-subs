00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.820
 well 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.820
 one 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:18.729
 the 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.369
 and that is when an artist resorts to politics 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.710
 it's because his talent 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 declining 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.369
 I will quote this statement so risky and in a way 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.780
 ask beyond 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.830
 I want to give you a reason why I have not uploaded more videos on youtube 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.370
 what happens is that he was there 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 explanation and as is customary 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.320
 the barefoot king always brings them 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.040
 today I will show you 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.380
 dennis inquisitions about a day 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.420
 I give them the scoop the army thinking 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.610
 flights as time is short 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.420
 here I leave 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.700
 what is published 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.970
 a sample of how it is that these living and celestial beings reach such a degree 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.620
 in fact society 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.820
 softer the treasury 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.880
 this year and a half 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 puig start the classes 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.619
 so I show you the reasons why the famous demorable 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.280
 army 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.460
 the saint has so much popularity and has flooded the usual excrement emanating 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.880
 of its excellent and more bodily valuations the devalued wind 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.770
 going to the next topic in this video 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.270
 great to mothers of applause when I show you this little tribute to 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.109
 most beautiful sport in 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:10.189
 first 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.199
 he explained that once 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.239
 the investigation 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.239
 today we present so much laziness that I decided to see the idiot box 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.819
 you call him 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.329
 extraction of football skills 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.349
 I decided to see something else 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.349
 a channel above a game between two Mexican teams 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.539
 of the league of chile 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:42.729
 give them laziness 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:46.449
 so on until you get to the llaneros channel which is the channel 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.329
 main village in 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.469
 that's beautiful if the players just played football I do not think 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.689
 There would be reasons to make this documentary but what I found 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.030
 then it was not soccer 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.789
 been the philosophy and politics of slip 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.609
 commentators who write that they talk about the players as if they will outline the 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.989
 life charl schwartzel igor squint 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.009
 moisés bailón expressed that no 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:20.189
 united in every detail and explaining with parsimony uses accuracy every gesture and 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.119
 every intention of these human beings whose life has passed on the lawn 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:25.829
 of a court 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.379
 the game yes the player's opinion 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.349
 do not just listen to the justifications the clear blunt comments 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.139
 and beautiful stick 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.139
 this is soccer 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.219
 we do not have the fans 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.339
 we took the game despite the network 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:45.089
 football gives rematch 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.299
 to continue working there 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.299
 the important thing is not the correct one 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:56.469
 we all support our coach and sweat the shirt to keep us in 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.519
 the fight 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.950
 good the show that goes in second term the important thing is that we take the 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.399
 result in someone else's house 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.399
 waves of nonsense later 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:09.739
 horror to former players 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.659
 they dared to give lectures on issues such as philosophy of 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.659
 history of political economy administration 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.159
 ecology and other matters that if not because they say it 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.689
 to people no more do not want 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:22.610
 so is 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.979
 the artists of the ball transcend the exercise of kicks to 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.840
 to venture into fields of knowledge, reason and the human condition 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:31.860
 the musicians 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.550
 the poets the plastic artists of upyd 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.050
 the responsibility to explain his works and his interpretations of reality 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.330
 not to enter 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.939
 controversial and assume political positions that can 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.740
 compromise 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.949
 great themes fall 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.990
 individuals whose grace lies in knowing the techniques for 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.320
 they have spent more than half of their lives playing as safe kids 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.260
 it is not surprising that these subjects who reach the category of idols have 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.930
 wages exhorted 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.150
 the more impoverished the condition of 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.860
 countries where you live 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.939
 you will spend years in school 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.939
 after the pressures of the teachers a month 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.669
 three minimum wages and they condemn you to live in a house of social interest 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.389
 if you're lucky 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.680
 you can waste your free time in front of a palette of colors 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.199
 This will cost more work to be able to embark 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.600
 they are successful 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.789
 they will become individuals 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.330
 they looked for his life 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.490
 to fitness and in a few words to run after a ball 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.789
 fran enjoy paid vacations 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.849
 this insurance will be married with more 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.080
 the three models 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.800
 they will eat in restaurants and most importantly they will be able to say what they 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.200
 get out of the cock with absolute attention 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.000
 millions of people
