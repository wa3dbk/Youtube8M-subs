and yeah so basically this is what I'm

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.990 
and yeah so basically this is what I'm
trying<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.290> figure<00:02:16.440> out<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.069> I'm<00:02:17.670> known

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
trying to figure out now so I'm known

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.580 
trying to figure out now so I'm known
for<00:02:18.030> five<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:18.540> six<00:02:18.870> days<00:02:19.050> since<00:02:19.260> I've<00:02:19.410> been

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
for five or six days since I've been

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.960 
for five or six days since I've been
doing<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:19.860> I've<00:02:20.040> had<00:02:20.220> an<00:02:20.340> idea<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:20.760> I'm

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
doing this I've had an idea that I'm

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.430 
doing this I've had an idea that I'm
probably<00:02:21.150> go<00:02:21.420> chout<00:02:21.690> because<00:02:21.989> I'm<00:02:22.110> not<00:02:22.200> raking

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
probably go chout because I'm not raking

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.680 
probably go chout because I'm not raking
up<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:22.980> how<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.310> works<00:02:23.459> like<00:02:23.790> people

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
up so is that how it works like people

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.809 
up so is that how it works like people
play<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.230> five<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.650> six<00:02:25.890> days<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.400> they

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
play for like five to six days and they

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.680 
play for like five to six days and they
don't<00:02:26.970> even<00:02:27.060> know<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.270> they're<00:02:27.510> glitched

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
don't even know that they're glitched

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.150 
don't even know that they're glitched
out<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.050> everything<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.500> you're<00:02:28.650> doing<00:02:28.680> is

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
out so everything that you're doing is

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.100 
out so everything that you're doing is
counting<00:02:29.520> for<00:02:29.670> nothing<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.390> that's<00:02:30.720> maybe<00:02:30.870> why

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
counting for nothing so that's maybe why

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.420 
counting for nothing so that's maybe why
a<00:02:31.140> lot<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.349> people's<00:02:31.650> numbers<00:02:31.950> are<00:02:32.069> off<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.310> you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
a lot of people's numbers are off if you

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.250 
a lot of people's numbers are off if you
ever<00:02:32.580> had<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.910> happen<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.450> maybe<00:02:34.019> all

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
ever had this happen to you maybe all

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.509 
ever had this happen to you maybe all
those<00:02:34.410> kills<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.010> got<00:02:35.160> during<00:02:35.400> that

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
those kills that you got during that

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.030 
those kills that you got during that
time<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.959> didn't<00:02:37.200> count<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.680> now

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
time on they didn't count and now

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.280 
time on they didn't count and now

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
trial code I could just start from

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.110 
trial code I could just start from
scratch<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.430> show<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:26.670> guys<00:03:26.790> what<00:03:27.000> you

need to do to rank up and just check if

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500 
need to do to rank up and just check if
everything<00:03:28.799> works<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.280> don't<00:03:30.239> know<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.420> guys

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
everything works I don't know you guys

everything works I don't know you guys
let<00:03:30.660> me<00:03:30.690> know<00:03:30.780> what<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.989> guys<00:03:31.079> want<00:03:31.140> me<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.440> do

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.580 
let me know what you guys want me to do
I<00:03:32.630> think<00:03:33.630> I'm<00:03:33.810> leaning<00:03:34.019> more<00:03:34.079> towards

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
I think I'm leaning more towards

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.410 
I think I'm leaning more towards
probably<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.340> making<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.670> new<00:03:35.790> account<00:03:35.819> but

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
probably just making a new account but

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.970 
probably just making a new account but
whatever<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.109> guys<00:03:37.170> want<00:03:37.350> me<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.500> do<00:03:37.590> I'll<00:03:37.769> do

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
whatever you guys want me to do I'll do

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.949 
whatever you guys want me to do I'll do
that<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.400> hopefully<00:03:39.329> treyarch<00:03:39.840> are

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
that and hopefully treyarch are

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.509 
that and hopefully treyarch are
activision<00:03:40.410> will<00:03:40.500> get<00:03:40.620> back<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.980> us<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.130> least

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
put the reset form back up explain this

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.620 
put the reset form back up explain this
give<00:03:44.370> us<00:03:44.489> some<00:03:44.730> like<00:03:45.000> something<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.480> do

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630
