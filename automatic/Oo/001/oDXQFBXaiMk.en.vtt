effect on the waterline and they do work
on<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.260> waterline<00:04:54.560> really<00:04:55.130> well<00:04:55.310> as<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.760> can

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
on the waterline really well as you can

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:03.279 
on the waterline really well as you can
see<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.599> dark<00:04:59.080> okay<00:05:00.080> so<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:01.599> also<00:05:02.599> pick<00:05:03.050> up

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
see is dark okay so I also pick up

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:09.219 
see is dark okay so I also pick up
another<00:05:03.620> elf<00:05:04.010> daily<00:05:04.789> moisture<00:05:05.449> stick<00:05:07.479> and<00:05:08.479> I

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.310 
another elf daily moisture stick and I
picked<00:05:09.500> up<00:05:09.680> two<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.580> glitter<00:05:11.000> eye<00:05:11.270> shadow

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
picked up two of the glitter eye shadow

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.830 
picked up two of the glitter eye shadow
shadow<00:05:12.320> applicators<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:16.150> then<00:05:17.150> I<00:05:17.389> picked<00:05:17.690> up

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
shadow applicators and then I picked up

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.339 
shadow applicators and then I picked up
the<00:05:17.990> elf<00:05:18.320> exact<00:05:19.220> lash<00:05:19.610> mascara<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.870> the

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
the elf exact lash mascara and the

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.899 
the elf exact lash mascara and the
reason<00:05:21.620> why<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.770> picked<00:05:21.979> up<00:05:22.159> this<00:05:22.370> mascara

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
reason why I picked up this mascara

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.990 
reason why I picked up this mascara
because<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.210> really<00:05:23.479> don't<00:05:23.690> like<00:05:23.870> elf<00:05:24.169> mascara

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
because I really don't like elf mascara

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.580 
because I really don't like elf mascara
because<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.389> brush<00:05:26.630> is<00:05:26.810> real<00:05:27.020> little<00:05:27.260> and<00:05:27.470> I

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
because the brush is real little and I

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.490 
because the brush is real little and I
think<00:05:27.860> this<00:05:28.070> would<00:05:28.250> be<00:05:28.280> very<00:05:28.760> good<00:05:29.599> for<00:05:29.659> the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
think this would be very good for the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.670 
think this would be very good for the
lower<00:05:31.250> lash<00:05:31.639> line<00:05:32.060> or<00:05:32.930> not<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.260> lower<00:05:33.470> lash

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
lower lash line or not the lower lash

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.250 
lower lash line or not the lower lash
line<00:05:33.949> but<00:05:34.130> your<00:05:34.310> lower<00:05:34.520> lashes<00:05:34.909> because<00:05:35.840> the

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
line but your lower lashes because the

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.740 
line but your lower lashes because the
brush<00:05:36.560> is<00:05:36.740> really<00:05:37.099> small<00:05:37.370> so<00:05:37.669> that<00:05:38.090> is<00:05:38.510> why<00:05:38.720> i

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
brush is really small so that is why i

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.320

the regular I'll eyelid primer from ELF
it<00:06:14.980> has<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.280> same<00:06:15.640> applicators<00:06:16.480> just<00:06:16.870> the

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
it has the same applicators just the

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.200 
it has the same applicators just the
container<00:06:18.250> is<00:06:18.400> more<00:06:18.850> round<00:06:19.980> so<00:06:20.980> that<00:06:21.010> is<00:06:21.640> the

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
container is more round so that is the

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.930
