to<00:04:43.230> kind<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.590> randomly<00:04:44.100> pin<00:04:44.550> if<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:45.210> have<00:04:45.390> long

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
raids and wrapping them and pinning them

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.220 
raids and wrapping them and pinning them
that<00:04:50.490> would<00:04:50.580> look<00:04:50.670> really<00:04:50.730> pretty<00:04:51.240> but<00:04:51.990> since

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230
