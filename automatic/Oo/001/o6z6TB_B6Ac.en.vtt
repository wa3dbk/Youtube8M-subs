00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.830 
think the accepting who you are means
that<00:06:50.800> others<00:06:51.069> will<00:06:51.279> too<00:06:51.430> is<00:06:51.669> a<00:06:51.699> little<00:06:52.240> poorly

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840

worded I mean go on the internet for

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.649 
worded I mean go on the internet for
about<00:06:55.300> 10<00:06:55.689> to<00:06:56.020> 15<00:06:56.430> minutes<00:06:57.430> and<00:06:57.789> tell<00:06:58.360> me<00:06:58.479> that

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659 
about 10 to 15 minutes and tell me that

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:01.559 
about 10 to 15 minutes and tell me that
again<00:06:58.810> with<00:06:59.319> exactly<00:06:59.979> the<00:07:00.279> same<00:07:00.310> words<00:07:00.789> I<00:07:01.120> get

the<00:07:01.719> intention<00:07:02.110> behind<00:07:02.229> it<00:07:02.500> but<00:07:02.680> I<00:07:02.710> really

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
the intention behind it but I really

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.050 
the intention behind it but I really
think<00:07:03.189> they<00:07:03.279> should<00:07:03.460> have<00:07:03.490> worded<00:07:03.759> it<00:07:03.879> like

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
think they should have worded it like

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.719 
think they should have worded it like
the<00:07:04.449> people<00:07:04.810> who<00:07:05.050> matter<00:07:05.650> will<00:07:06.189> accept<00:07:06.610> you

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
don't amount to anything due to the

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.930 
don't amount to anything due to the
nature<00:07:29.229> of<00:07:29.349> a<00:07:29.500> dream<00:07:29.770> episode<00:07:30.219> I<00:07:30.460> mean<00:07:30.759> we

nature of a dream episode I mean we

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.219 
nature of a dream episode I mean we
don't<00:07:31.029> get<00:07:31.240> to<00:07:31.330> spend<00:07:31.509> a<00:07:31.629> lot<00:07:31.750> of<00:07:31.900> time<00:07:32.080> with

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:32.229 
don't get to spend a lot of time with

don't get to spend a lot of time with
these<00:07:32.349> characters<00:07:32.860> so<00:07:32.889> I<00:07:33.069> was<00:07:33.159> hoping<00:07:33.490> for<00:07:33.550> a

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:33.699 
these characters so I was hoping for a

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:35.820 
these characters so I was hoping for a
little<00:07:33.940> more<00:07:34.089> genuine<00:07:34.779> interaction<00:07:35.050> but

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830 
little more genuine interaction but

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.230 
little more genuine interaction but
other<00:07:35.979> than<00:07:36.129> that<00:07:36.250> the<00:07:36.580> episode<00:07:36.940> was<00:07:37.060> pretty

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
other than that the episode was pretty

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.969 
other than that the episode was pretty
moral<00:07:37.719> was<00:07:37.839> decent<00:07:38.229> something<00:07:38.650> something
