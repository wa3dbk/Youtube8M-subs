hi<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:02.040> video<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.490> about<00:00:02.970> discharging<00:00:03.899> your

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
hi this video is about discharging your

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.780 
hi this video is about discharging your
airsoft<00:00:05.069> battery<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:07.400> little<00:00:08.400> display

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
airsoft battery in this little display

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.410 
airsoft battery in this little display
right<00:00:09.030> here<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:10.019> my<00:00:10.460> 9.6<00:00:11.460> an<00:00:11.820> elective<00:00:12.300> at

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
right here I have my 9.6 an elective at

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.720 
right here I have my 9.6 an elective at
er<00:00:12.450> II<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.110> having<00:00:13.769> some<00:00:14.130> charging

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
er II that is having some charging

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.720 
er II that is having some charging
issues<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.410> order<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.770> attempt<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.520> solve

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
issues so in order to attempt to solve

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.550 
issues so in order to attempt to solve
this<00:00:18.029> I'm<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> fully<00:00:18.779> discharge<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
this I'm going to fully discharge the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.279 
this I'm going to fully discharge the
battery<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.390> charge<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.510> back<00:00:21.660> up<00:00:21.840> again

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
battery and charge you back up again

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.550 
battery and charge you back up again
now<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.189> using<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.560> standard

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
now what I'm using is just a standard

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.660 
now what I'm using is just a standard
computer<00:00:25.920> case<00:00:26.250> fan<00:00:26.599> it's<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:28.019> 12<00:00:28.560> volts<00:00:29.039> with

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
computer case fan it's at 12 volts with

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.930 
computer case fan it's at 12 volts with
a<00:00:29.939> point<00:00:30.359> 14<00:00:30.869> amp<00:00:31.109> drain<00:00:31.500> rate<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.640> doesn't

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
a point 14 amp drain rate and it doesn't

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.510 
a point 14 amp drain rate and it doesn't
really<00:00:33.149> matter<00:00:33.510> too<00:00:34.170> much<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.130> amperage

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
really matter too much what the amperage

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180 
really matter too much what the amperage
is<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.390> voltage<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.170> long<00:00:37.920> as

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
is or what the voltage is as long as

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.450 
is or what the voltage is as long as
you're<00:00:39.000> connecting<00:00:39.719> something<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:41.070> is

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you're connecting something that is

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.740 
you're connecting something that is
above<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.450> voltage<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.739> battery<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.120> if

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
above the voltage of your battery so if

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990 
above the voltage of your battery so if
this<00:00:46.020> fan<00:00:46.260> said<00:00:46.559> nine<00:00:46.739> point<00:00:47.010> six<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
this fan said nine point six on it that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.029 
this fan said nine point six on it that
would<00:00:48.120> work<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:49.050> said<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.410> two<00:00:49.590> volts<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
would work it said like two volts I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
would work it said like two volts I
would<00:00:50.280> probably<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.449> mess<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.899> ban<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
would probably you know mess this ban of

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.819 
would probably you know mess this ban of
destroy<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.039> something<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.960> drain<00:00:55.590> rate

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
destroy it something now the drain rate

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.760 
destroy it something now the drain rate
with<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> amperage<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.649> get

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
with the amperage you want to get

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.310 
with the amperage you want to get
something<00:00:59.120> probably<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.449> less<00:01:00.780> than<00:01:01.079> one

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
something probably with less than one

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.579 
something probably with less than one
amp<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.420> battery<00:01:03.930> discharges

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
amp because if the battery discharges

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.760 
amp because if the battery discharges
too<00:01:04.890> quickly<00:01:05.360> it'll<00:01:06.360> heat<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
too quickly it'll heat it up and it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.190 
too quickly it'll heat it up and it
could<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.040> bad<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.390> commercially

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
could be bad for it but commercially

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.609 
could be bad for it but commercially
available<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:11.060> light<00:01:12.060> bulbs<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> battery

you<00:01:19.830> can't<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.610> Dean's<00:01:20.880> if

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you can't really get one with Dean's if

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.710 
you can't really get one with Dean's if
you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.740> don't<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.880> why<00:01:24.150> you'd<00:01:24.420> be

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you can I don't know really why you'd be

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.690 
you can I don't know really why you'd be
using<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> those<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.220> make<00:01:26.369> something

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
using one of those you make something

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.280 
using one of those you make something
yourself<00:01:26.790> against

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
yourself against

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.520 
yourself against
I<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:31.090> using<00:01:31.300> what<00:01:31.510> I've<00:01:31.630> got<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.140> spending

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
I like using what I've got so spending

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.520 
I like using what I've got so spending
seven<00:01:32.830> dollars<00:01:33.100> on<00:01:33.220> an<00:01:33.340> overpriced<00:01:33.700> battery
