00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
up Glinda for gang development so let's

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.830 
up Glinda for gang development so let's
enjoy<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.740> loosening<00:00:08.280> handle<00:00:08.730> alright<00:00:09.660> so

enjoy and loosening handle alright so
the<00:00:09.929> first<00:00:10.200> thing<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.590> want<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:11.010> when

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the first thing you want to do when

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.610 
the first thing you want to do when
sitting<00:00:12.150> blender<00:00:12.540> up<00:00:12.660> for<00:00:12.870> game<00:00:13.080> development

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
sitting blender up for game development

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.340 
sitting blender up for game development
is<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.190> come<00:00:14.460> up<00:00:14.610> here<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.150> switch<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.839> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
is to come up here and switch this to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.700 
is to come up here and switch this to
blend<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> game<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.080> over<00:00:19.410> here

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
blend the game and what see is over here

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.820 
blend the game and what see is over here
a<00:00:19.920> bunch<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.609> settings<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.390> changed<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> what

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
a bunch of settings have changed so what

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.890 
a bunch of settings have changed so what
this<00:00:22.949> has<00:00:23.160> done<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:23.970> enabled<00:00:24.720> all

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
this has done is it's just enabled all

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.570 
this has done is it's just enabled all
the<00:00:25.050> game<00:00:25.230> options<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.920> heard<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the game options and heard all the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
the game options and heard all the
options<00:00:27.060> which<00:00:27.269> really<00:00:27.960> aren't<00:00:28.140> relevant<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
options which really aren't relevant to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.429 
options which really aren't relevant to
blender<00:00:29.849> game<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.050> see<00:00:31.109> we've<00:00:31.410> got

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
blender game so as you can see we've got

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
blender game so as you can see we've got
all<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.800> stuff<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.460> also<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> physics

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
all this stuff and also here the physics

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.110 
all this stuff and also here the physics
panel<00:00:34.440> has<00:00:34.710> changed<00:00:36.079> now<00:00:37.100> by<00:00:38.100> default<00:00:38.160> if<00:00:39.059> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
panel has changed now by default if you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.200 
panel has changed now by default if you
go<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.629> detection<00:00:40.020> mode<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.030> we

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
go on detection mode here you see is we

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.139 
go on detection mode here you see is we
have<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> sort<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.079> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.860> lighting<00:00:44.579> it's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
have a sort of kind of lighting it's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.049 
have a sort of kind of lighting it's
sort<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.140> lighting<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.430> as

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
sort of lighting but not really so as

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.660 
sort of lighting but not really so as
you<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.620> when<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.739> scale<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.340> weird

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
you see when we scale this up weird

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.139 
you see when we scale this up weird
stuff<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> happening<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.230> lighting<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
stuff is happening with the lighting and

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.830 
stuff is happening with the lighting and
that<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:56.840> multi-textured

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that is because we are in multi-textured

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.619 
that is because we are in multi-textured
under<00:00:58.170> shading<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.789> multi-textured<00:00:59.789> now

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
under shading here multi-textured now

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.380 
under shading here multi-textured now
what<00:01:01.050> you're<00:01:01.170> gonna<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:03.090> is

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
what you're gonna want to do and this is

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.329 
what you're gonna want to do and this is
not<00:01:03.420> supported<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.140> all<00:01:04.320> computers<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.979> most

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
not supported on all computers but most

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.260 
not supported on all computers but most
computers<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.490> OpenGL

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
computers as you want to go OpenGL

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.899 
computers as you want to go OpenGL
shading<00:01:09.810> language<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.100> OpenGL

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
shading language right here is OpenGL

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.330 
shading language right here is OpenGL
and<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> switch<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.159> this

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and you want to switch it so what this

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.330 
and you want to switch it so what this
gonna<00:01:14.490> allow<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.920> able<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
gonna allow you to do is have be able to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.010 
gonna allow you to do is have be able to
much<00:01:18.000> more<00:01:18.299> advanced<00:01:18.570> stuff<00:01:18.869> using<00:01:19.290> nodes<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
much more advanced stuff using nodes and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.469 
much more advanced stuff using nodes and
shaders<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> stuff<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.939> your

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
shaders and stuff like that for your

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
shaders and stuff like that for your
texturing<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
texturing and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.940 
texturing and
level<00:01:26.400> stuff<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.020> click<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.350> what

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
level stuff so if you click on that what

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.030 
level stuff so if you click on that what
you<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:32.369> has<00:01:33.030> become<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> lot<00:01:33.840> nicer<00:01:34.740> as

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you see and it has become a lot nicer as

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.679 
you see and it has become a lot nicer as
you<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.310> see<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.670> some<00:01:36.030> specularity

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you can see you have some specularity

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.069 
you can see you have some specularity
here<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.009> light<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.610> works<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
here the light actually works and it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.120 
here the light actually works and it
kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> moves<00:01:41.240> it<00:01:42.240> works<00:01:42.570> quickly<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.470> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
kind of moves it works quickly and this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
kind of moves it works quickly and this
allows<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.700> shadows<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.600> lots<00:01:46.110> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
allows you to have shadows and lots of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.530 
allows you to have shadows and lots of
other<00:01:46.439> things<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.390> first

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
other things all right so the first

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.090 
other things all right so the first
thing<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.869> want<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> sit<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.770> blender

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
thing you want to sit up so that blender

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.460 
thing you want to sit up so that blender
we<00:01:50.250> perfectly<00:01:50.880> ready<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.689> game<00:01:51.990> development

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
we perfectly ready for game development

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.609 
we perfectly ready for game development
is<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.070> change<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.850> screen<00:01:54.240> layout<00:01:54.600> now<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
is to change the screen layout now you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.020 
is to change the screen layout now you
can<00:01:55.770> make<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.890> custom<00:01:56.159> one<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.880> should

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
can make a custom one but you should

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.670 
can make a custom one but you should
like<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.329> use<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> default<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.530> it's

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
like to use the default one because it's

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.929 
like to use the default one because it's
laid<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.070> very<00:01:59.100> well<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.670> you're<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.790> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
laid out very well so you're going to
