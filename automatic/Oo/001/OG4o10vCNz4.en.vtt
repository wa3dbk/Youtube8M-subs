warming up to it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.510 
warming up to it
the<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.289> few<00:00:19.439> times<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.800> drove<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.490> not

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
the first few times I drove it I was not

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.210 
the first few times I drove it I was not
I<00:00:21.270> mean<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.289> loved<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.500> way<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.710> looked<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.100> I

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
I mean I loved the way it looked and I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.220 
I mean I loved the way it looked and I
thought<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.490> was<00:00:23.580> pretty<00:00:23.730> peppy<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.330> now<00:00:25.080> that

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
thought it was pretty peppy but now that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.900 
thought it was pretty peppy but now that
I've<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.560> discovered<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.220> sport

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
I've really discovered the sport

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.370 
I've really discovered the sport
settings<00:00:27.480> which<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.170> there<00:00:28.320> are

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
settings which you know there are

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.900 
settings which you know there are
numerous<00:00:28.619> configurable<00:00:29.369> settings

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
numerous configurable settings

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.659 
numerous configurable settings
you<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.090> Porsche<00:00:30.449> style<00:00:30.840> with<00:00:31.550> for<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you know Porsche style with for the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.319 
you know Porsche style with for the
transmission<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:34.219> the<00:00:35.219> turbo<00:00:35.579> boost<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
transmission and the turbo boost and a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.420 
transmission and the turbo boost and a
number<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.079> other<00:00:37.200> parameters<00:00:37.710> between<00:00:37.950> eco

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
number of other parameters between eco

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.910 
number of other parameters between eco
normal<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> sport<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.530> sport<00:00:40.800> mode

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
normal and sport so the sport mode

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.290 
normal and sport so the sport mode
obviously<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.149> would

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
obviously is what the one that we would

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.260 
obviously is what the one that we would
want<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.540> live<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.860> uh<00:00:44.270> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
want to live in because it's uh it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.029 
want to live in because it's uh it
brings<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.660> much<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.050> much<00:00:46.289> more<00:00:46.500> eager

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
brings a much a much more eager

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.760 
brings a much a much more eager
eagerness<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.149> CVT<00:00:48.469> that<00:00:49.469> I've<00:00:49.559> been

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
eagerness to the CVT that I've been

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.110 
eagerness to the CVT that I've been
really<00:00:49.980> pleased<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.520> mean<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> basically

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
really pleased with I mean it basically

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
really pleased with I mean it basically
just<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.480> doesn't<00:00:51.870> shift<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.770> makes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
just like doesn't shift up if that makes

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.900 
just like doesn't shift up if that makes
sense<00:00:53.449> for<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.960> CVT<00:00:55.379> type<00:00:55.890> automatic<00:00:56.460> versus

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
sense for a CVT type automatic versus

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.299 
sense for a CVT type automatic versus
just<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.199> know<00:00:58.289> regular<00:00:58.500> automatic<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
just a you know regular automatic or a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.670 
just a you know regular automatic or a
manual<00:00:59.609> transmission<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> difference

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
manual transmission and the difference

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.170 
manual transmission and the difference
for<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.340> by<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.670> shifting<00:01:02.879> up

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
for that is you know by not shifting up

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.939 
for that is you know by not shifting up
it's<00:01:03.329> always<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.930> power<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.650> always

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
it's always on power so it's always

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
it's always on power so it's always
ready<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.729> has<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.869> power<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
ready to go and has you know power to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
ready to go and has you know power to
spare<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.760> whenever<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> hit<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> gas

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
spare you know whenever you hit the gas

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.570 
spare you know whenever you hit the gas
in<00:01:09.689> sport<00:01:10.020> mode<00:01:10.080> whereas<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.340> in

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
in sport mode whereas you know in in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.800 
in sport mode whereas you know in in
regular<00:01:11.939> mode<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.689> humble

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
regular mode it's a little more humble

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.660 
regular mode it's a little more humble
but<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.040> obviously<00:01:14.369> still<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
but you know this is obviously still a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
but you know this is obviously still a
really<00:01:15.060> striking<00:01:15.299> car<00:01:15.720> I've<00:01:16.200> been<00:01:16.350> getting<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
really striking car I've been getting a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.649 
really striking car I've been getting a
