00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.000
 Georgia if you do as an important benchmark 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.580
 also supports 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.580
 8 what I always do 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.979
 that is important 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.039
 just stronger powerful colors 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.039
 they are already trying to make some sort of clustering move 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 of course knows very well according to geerken 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:29.689
 well I think composition is very important to me 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.070
 strong his mother must be happy but not all 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.070
 must be but be powerful at all 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
 He also offers areas per card 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.510
 with the application of structure, they work together closely 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.510
 Another new house appeared on the painting 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.240
 That's why I have a lot 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.049
 affinity with southern areas bus martijn camera spain or 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.370
 such as france and 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.010
 especially those countries 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.539
 qirbi can often have very strong hiding there 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.140
 That is also about ever menem subjects like a straight face 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 People then want to shoulder the foam well to display the group that you are beautiful 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.180
 beautiful 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 to get a contract with a very nice Sunday 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 can create bild in an alley for us 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.060
 so time for the situations 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.070
 about which I cut much more about recognizability 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.380
 of the painting 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.469
 two country landscape much more likely also on 2 process the 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.230
 paint 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.190
 so the Zuidvliet two things and I also try to play a bit 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.160
 play in between 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.729
 the abstract pieces and 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.479
 recognizable pieces so it is necessary for an abstract but it does have one 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.180
 kind of recognition with fir branch 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.770
 so good to build a car 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.990
 Vahidi who have subjects made with a photo on site 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.400
 have made crane depend situation with a drawing 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 these are also being further elaborated on business 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.410
 I have also never been in that 95 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.479
 it made a very strong impression on me 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.459
 I also have a lot of images according to Amos 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.679
 and of course still out 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.679
 he submitted 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.569
 Arnhem if you look at where I now have a concrete 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.009
 after ten years ago, there is a clear line 

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.869
 that I recognize this my first instance much more in collision 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.509
 and that is in this team is a ticket back 4 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.309
 trying to put much more emphasis on the paint itself 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.159
 the sale must speak 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.280
 and the color scheme and the compositions should serve for me 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.449
 the protocol for one 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.659
 what influence does value have on your work and then 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.659
 the way they work and teach each other 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.429
 the father's name was also the notebook about a kind of tradition 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:00.629
 delivered 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.779
 so knowledge and skills are very important 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.789
 so that the Russian population in a child murder 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.229
 in a model example 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:13.389
 fish guild had to beat, maybe the muscles in construction and the crap that had to 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.679
 be good 9 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:18.909
 painting next to your studies thanks to the left goodness of the objects and the 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.329
 composition had to be the royal for the employer 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.329
 we are both our own input to the not so important 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.079
 but with my father as the right knowledge 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.349
 and the whole profession and is therefore very important to me 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.679
 but that is quite a difficult program at work because I give with 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.609
 when I was 12 no need to paint in nature 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.819
 that channel says that brand is an example 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.819
 it seems to be a lot of natural gas garden mixing colors 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:52.229
 If you go there a lot if you think you should keep up with the times 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.479
 Then you think that's the case prize winners turn yellow 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.219
 and there it is 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.019
 I followed the art academy myself 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.779
 that the film was little done yet 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.329
 with the main subject painting 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.669
 and much more came there 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.669
 regions yellow from arches what you want 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.029
 so it was from the other side again 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:18.279
 So you have developed your own style at some point 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.559
 and there you have 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.199
 further blocked 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.590
 at home i have my dad 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.529
 try to release alvarez influence 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.699
 do you think you've succeeded 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.229
 I think so 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.909
 but certainly in terms of color 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:35.370
 the micra subjects 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.789
 partly another painter prevails 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.509
 landscape and its southern france 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.569
 but unfortunately less 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.860
 that is that much less there are not a cent 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.779
 placed russian tries further and further 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.059
 we don't submit a stunt 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.900
 she so that Islam one because she has been the process of a father 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.210
 and what do you think you distinguish from the 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:04.439
 colleagues 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.649
 so a special thing about your work compared to the new college 

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.649
 colleagues years yes 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.959
 in 2007 she got under the name of my colleagues when everyone has his own 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.590
 unique way to count the eu difference the government of egypt will be at 19 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.599
 March also started coming I don't think so 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.449
 bring nothing new 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.770
 stosur from my colleagues 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.599
 but I think 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.659
 that is the difference, for example, by winding the bookwork to bid 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.129
 stop before 9 in the summer paintings 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.580
 has the disease 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.999
 twice to myself how far can I go 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:49.360
 in my burden of the ball flat what I do paint 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.900
 how much club can cause damage 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.509
 the successor of erik brems, for example, took a firm lead in this 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.830
 try to see even more nuances 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.369
 when it becomes difficult 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:02.930
 and I think that I have nothing in terms of color 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.930
 strong than the average 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.439
 entitled to 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.689
 lindo know
