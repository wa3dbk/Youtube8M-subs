00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.290
 good afternoon we are reviewing the 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.530
 images of the stock you're making 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.340
 on the court of the Aztec stadium 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.530
 outside of this casino to listen to what 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.960
 said today the 'maza' Rodriguez a man 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.519
 that the truth rarely speaks before the 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.259
 microphones today in the already classical 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.230
 club interview by the club 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.060
 America managed to talk to her 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.679
 Rosa Rodríguez when it's convenient to talk 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.269
 about obviously selection 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.699
 national on the criticisms that 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.430
 received and you listen to the mace 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.989
 Rodriguez who says that it is those who 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.469
 they seek discard leave out of the 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.469
 Mexican team 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.250
 mandate would worry not to be in this 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.050
 first list of nothing I do not have 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 fear of life is nothing I'm afraid of 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.320
 If this is no longer 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.210
 this here I have to support my country if 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.350
 I'm there I have to face and die 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 not on the court as always right 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.519
 well I want to get all the press out of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.989
 experience are not the selection I'm 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.789
 very calm as a witness simply 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.649
 I do my job the one that you like and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.509
 although I am not ten years old 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:11.640
 all kinds of criticism and how I am a 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.560
 professional I can say this what that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 receive be bad be good be of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.750
 you and whoever it is so you have to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.750
 to receive 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.330
 that obviously the comments that 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.040
 does the press in the type of programs 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.870
 like the one we do at night 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.060
 the blame on the other are those who 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.600
 seek to remove from the national team 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.550
 mexican 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 today seems to indicate that víctor manuel 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.600
 vucetich will give his first list of 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.340
 called to work there in the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.750
 high performance center and we'll see if 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.030
 is the rod Rodriguez that honestly 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.619
 has not been very good level to say 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.410
 in recent months as the program 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.050
 what we do here in the night said sales 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.030
 of its low level as a reference to the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.780
 press in general that's why we are 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:04.590
 We are not soccer players or 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.340
 of selected and because he is the spokesperson 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.560
 from vucetich 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.640
 but when it was from the chepo up to what 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:17.340
 better until the time I 've been a spokesperson 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.020
 more than the chepo of the tower and carlos 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.050
 candle who is a very good friend the mace 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.050
 rodríguez 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.370
 did not have variants to know 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.130
 hurt the team to teams 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.000
 rivals were coming they knew how to stand 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.520
 we like to complicate the game and good 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.240
 that's what happened 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.180
 We are very sad for a long time , I think that 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.450
 There are too many words and those who go to 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.950
 be those last two parties can 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.540
 give the face I say everything we must 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.600
 accept the wrong way that we have 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.640
 brought to our country the truth we are 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.860
 embarrassed what each of what 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.800
 we have belonged on the list is 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.560
 eliminatory we have done so well 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.590
 of you or with we expect nothing but 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.930
 simply because respect your opinions 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.540
 and we keep working or I am from 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.550
 those who think the people who are in good 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.070
 moment a good level 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.830
 he must be here if he is now watching 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.050
 one for your son I do not think he is 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.820
 asking how he is playing the truth is 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.850
 a player a great person i what 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.100
 I know him very much to his family and if 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.950
 are you analyst of the teacher of this type 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.720
 you are welcome 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.010
 they use the words of le mans a 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.870
 rodríguez gerardo speaking of course 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.580
 of the lack of reaction of the mx league 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.190
 as such america has been one of those 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.629
 added to the call there we are 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.269
 seeing images of people arriving at 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.650
 Aztec stadium has asked the people 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.810
 america because that's what the 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.630
 Red cross only carry oil 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.700
 soluble coffee lentils and sardines is what 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.680
 who is collecting if not after 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.920
 in case it takes too much of one thing 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.260
 Delegate from another and it's not useful if they have 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.720
 what to do as one is specific what 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.390
 is requesting the red cross you carry your 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.690
 12 kilos of lentils 2 liters of oil 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.599
 etc etc 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:22.800
 2 until 5 in the afternoon 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:26.440
 which teams to dogs 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.120
 two tickets two tickets for the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.040
 people for the america game against 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.900
 plates there are 10 thousand tickets available 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.030
 but the American people do not want that if 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.240
 they would end up, they would also have 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.110
 more tickets for being 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.180
 here these two well trying to scrub like 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.550
 as long as there are 10,000 tickets 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.080
 available is giving america two 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.610
 tickets per person as long as 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.530
 Obviously take what you have 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.750
 requested the liters of oil 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.310
 lentils etc etc but people told us 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.590
 america that if the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.330
 tickets and there's more demand from people and 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.520
 there's more of course help will be 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.509
 enabling more for the match against 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.650
 jaguars when buying a ticket when carrying 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.650
 your two liters of oil 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.030
 they put a stamp on the entrance so 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.669
 auto deliveries at the entrance they put a 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.590

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.680
 50 thousand 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.440
 hopefully in the stadium he has no doubt about 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.389
 know that it's okay that I've known 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.569
