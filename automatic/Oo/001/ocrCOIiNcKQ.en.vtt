00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
position here at the 10-yard line so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.990 
position here at the 10-yard line so
it's<00:00:45.870> 2nd<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.320> 10<00:00:46.559> he<00:00:47.100> tries<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.579> run<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> ball

Devin McCourty is not having that that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.639 
Devin McCourty is not having that that
guard<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.789> underrated<00:00:51.500> tackler<00:00:52.500> he

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
guard is a really underrated tackler he

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.590 
guard is a really underrated tackler he
makes<00:00:52.860> some<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.280> good<00:00:53.670> hits<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> run

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
makes some really good hits in the run

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.689 
makes some really good hits in the run
game<00:00:54.629> but<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.620> force<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> fourth<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
game but we force them to fourth and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.270 
game but we force them to fourth and
five<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> unlikely<00:00:58.590> somebody's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
five and this is unlikely somebody's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
five and this is unlikely somebody's
kicking<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.789> field<00:01:00.000> goal<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.449> ultimate<00:01:00.930> team

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
kicking a field goal and ultimate team

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
kicking a field goal and ultimate team
so<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.190> hold<00:01:02.399> them<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> three<00:01:02.910> points<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.420> get

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
so we hold them the three points we get

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.030 
so we hold them the three points we get
the<00:01:03.690> ball<00:01:03.870> back<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> hand<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> off

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040

you guys know your ultimate team and I'm

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.470 
you guys know your ultimate team and I'm
probably<00:04:26.940> going<00:04:27.180> over

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
probably going over

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.150 
probably going over
stuff<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.930> already<00:04:28.050> know<00:04:28.290> but<00:04:28.770> there<00:04:28.950> are<00:04:29.130> a

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
stuff you already know but there are a

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.250 
stuff you already know but there are a
lot<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.520> noobs<00:04:29.880> out<00:04:30.210> there<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.510> lot<00:04:30.780> of<00:04:30.810> people

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
lot of noobs out there a lot of people

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.900 
lot of noobs out there a lot of people
who<00:04:31.350> have<00:04:31.380> no<00:04:31.740> idea<00:04:32.100> what<00:04:32.340> they're<00:04:32.490> doing<00:04:32.790> and

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
who have no idea what they're doing and

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.240 
who have no idea what they're doing and
that's<00:04:33.300> kind<00:04:33.660> of<00:04:33.750> why<00:04:33.930> we<00:04:34.200> get<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.590> snipe<00:04:34.830> cards

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
that's kind of why we get to snipe cards

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.370 
that's kind of why we get to snipe cards
sometimes<00:04:35.670> but<00:04:36.420> if<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.750> guys<00:04:36.900> don't<00:04:37.170> know

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
sometimes but if you guys don't know

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.620 
sometimes but if you guys don't know
there's<00:04:37.680> team<00:04:37.980> MVP<00:04:38.310> collections<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.450> again

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
there's team MVP collections and again

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.970 
there's team MVP collections and again
i'm<00:04:39.720> always<00:04:39.960> speaking<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.560> people<00:04:40.710> who

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
i'm always speaking to the people who

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.030 
i'm always speaking to the people who
don't<00:04:41.630> know<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.960> much<00:04:43.140> about<00:04:43.200> ultimate<00:04:43.770> team

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
don't know that much about ultimate team

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.160 
don't know that much about ultimate team
not<00:04:44.250> all<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.520> prose<00:04:44.820> out<00:04:45.060> there<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:46.020> those

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
not all you prose out there but those

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.230 
not all you prose out there but those
MVP<00:04:46.710> collections<00:04:47.250> they<00:04:47.490> pretty<00:04:47.760> much<00:04:47.850> all

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
MVP collections they pretty much all

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.900 
MVP collections they pretty much all
need<00:04:48.480> at<00:04:48.630> one<00:04:48.840> at<00:04:49.320> least<00:04:49.590> one<00:04:50.010> elite<00:04:50.490> road<00:04:50.760> to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
need at one at least one elite road to

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.530 
need at one at least one elite road to
the<00:04:51.030> playoff<00:04:51.560> card<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.820> gotta<00:04:54.060> go<00:04:54.300> by<00:04:54.480> the

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
the playoff card and you gotta go by the

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.080 
the playoff card and you gotta go by the
chemistry<00:04:55.230> and<00:04:55.440> it's<00:04:56.100> very<00:04:56.430> important<00:04:57.030> to

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
chemistry and it's very important to

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.660 
chemistry and it's very important to
look<00:04:57.360> at<00:04:57.510> those<00:04:57.660> collections<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.500> then<00:04:58.980> make

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
look at those collections and then make

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.130 
look at those collections and then make
sure<00:04:59.820> you're<00:05:00.000> selling<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.600> right<00:05:00.810> chemistry

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
sure you're selling the right chemistry

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.470 
sure you're selling the right chemistry
for<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.620> right<00:05:01.830> amount<00:05:01.980> because<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:03.240> can

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
for the right amount because you can

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.050 
for the right amount because you can
snipe<00:05:03.870> like<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.620> zone<00:05:04.890> defense<00:05:05.400> terrell

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
snipe like the zone defense terrell

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.640 
snipe like the zone defense terrell

Marcel Reece goes for like a DK I've
caught<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:27.000> for<00:05:27.180> 20k<00:05:27.510> a<00:05:27.690> couple<00:05:28.080> times<00:05:28.290> because

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
caught it for 20k a couple times because

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.500 
caught it for 20k a couple times because
people<00:05:29.430> don't<00:05:29.580> pay<00:05:29.790> attention<00:05:29.910> to<00:05:30.390> the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
people don't pay attention to the

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.910 
people don't pay attention to the
chemistry's<00:05:31.020> and<00:05:31.200> they<00:05:31.260> sell<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.680> for

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
chemistry's and they sell it for

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.250 
chemistry's and they sell it for
whatever<00:05:32.490> price<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.120> opposite<00:05:33.690> chemistry<00:05:34.140> is

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
whatever price the opposite chemistry is

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.340 
whatever price the opposite chemistry is
going<00:05:34.470> for<00:05:34.740> so<00:05:35.010> that<00:05:35.610> would<00:05:35.850> be<00:05:35.880> my<00:05:36.060> first<00:05:36.990> tip

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
going for so that would be my first tip
