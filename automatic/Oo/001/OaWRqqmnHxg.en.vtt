00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.830 

the<00:05:49.500> next<00:05:49.770> 10<00:05:49.920> years<00:05:49.950> I<00:05:50.520> would<00:05:51.420> hope<00:05:51.540> to<00:05:51.600> see

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
the next 10 years I would hope to see

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.820 
the next 10 years I would hope to see
this<00:05:51.930> being<00:05:52.140> to<00:05:52.290> make<00:05:52.440> better<00:05:52.620> use<00:05:52.800> of

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
this being to make better use of

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.670 
this being to make better use of
technology<00:05:53.390> you<00:05:54.390> know<00:05:54.570> so<00:05:54.900> that<00:05:54.930> we<00:05:55.230> might<00:05:55.470> be

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
technology you know so that we might be

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.090 
technology you know so that we might be
able<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:55.980> expand<00:05:56.790> our<00:05:57.180> reach<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.710> future

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
able to expand our reach so the future

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.300 
able to expand our reach so the future
for<00:05:59.310> families<00:05:59.730> and<00:05:59.940> schools<00:06:00.270> I<00:06:00.540> think<00:06:01.010> this<00:06:02.010> is

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
for families and schools I think this is

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.070 
for families and schools I think this is
some<00:06:02.610> is<00:06:02.850> going<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.330> be<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.510> very<00:06:03.840> productive

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
some is going to be a very productive

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.430 
some is going to be a very productive
one<00:06:04.770> in<00:06:05.010> our<00:06:05.430> role<00:06:05.700> of<00:06:06.360> helping<00:06:06.990> schools

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
one in our role of helping schools

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.010 
one in our role of helping schools
bridge<00:06:08.070> that<00:06:08.400> gap<00:06:08.640> and<00:06:08.910> that<00:06:08.970> divide<00:06:09.630> that

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
bridge that gap and that divide that

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.590 
bridge that gap and that divide that
exists<00:06:10.710> between<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:11.430> home<00:06:11.760> and<00:06:12.060> the<00:06:12.300> school

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
exists between the home and the school

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.080 
exists between the home and the school
and<00:06:13.050> I<00:06:13.350> think<00:06:13.680> today<00:06:14.070> if<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:14.460> look<00:06:14.790> you<00:06:15.060> know

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
and I think today if you look you know

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.590 
and I think today if you look you know
from<00:06:15.440> 1993<00:06:16.440> to<00:06:16.650> today<00:06:17.400> almost<00:06:17.850> 20<00:06:18.180> years<00:06:18.390> later

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
from 1993 to today almost 20 years later

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.290 
from 1993 to today almost 20 years later
studies<00:06:19.440> have<00:06:19.620> shown<00:06:19.920> that<00:06:20.300> parental

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
studies have shown that parental

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.950 
studies have shown that parental
involvement<00:06:22.220> improves<00:06:23.330> student<00:06:24.330> achievement

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
involvement improves student achievement

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.070 
involvement improves student achievement
and<00:06:25.470> now<00:06:25.830> it<00:06:26.130> is<00:06:26.340> becoming<00:06:26.880> to<00:06:27.240> be<00:06:27.420> sound

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
and now it is becoming to be sound

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.790 
and now it is becoming to be sound
policy<00:06:29.070> to<00:06:29.790> consider<00:06:30.470> parental<00:06:31.470> involvement

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
policy to consider parental involvement

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.220 
policy to consider parental involvement
in<00:06:32.340> the<00:06:32.610> reform<00:06:33.000> movement<00:06:33.510> I've<00:06:33.930> seen<00:06:34.140> the
