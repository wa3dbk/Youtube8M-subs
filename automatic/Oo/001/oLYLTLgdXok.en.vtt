00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
able to spawn here because the the mob

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.490 
able to spawn here because the the mob
does<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> be<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> correct<00:01:09.150> area<00:01:09.600> like

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the pigs are able to spawn on grass

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.530 
the pigs are able to spawn on grass
slimes<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.280> within<00:01:14.520> 16<00:01:15.180> blocks<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
slimes have to be within 16 blocks of

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.190 
slimes have to be within 16 blocks of
bedrock<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:19.189> as<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.520> called<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.200> forget

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
bedrock or as I what is called I forget

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.340 
bedrock or as I what is called I forget
that<00:01:22.439> stuff<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.400> down<00:01:23.640> there<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.049> able<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that stuff way down there to be able to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.160 
that stuff way down there to be able to
spawn<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:26.369> has<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.729> dark<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.210> zombies<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
spawn it has to be dark for zombies and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.120 
spawn it has to be dark for zombies and
skeletons<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.890> such<00:01:29.100> things<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
skeletons and such things like that so I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.130 
skeletons and such things like that so I
think<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.420> right<00:01:33.540> area<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
think it's not the right area for the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660 
think it's not the right area for the
bat<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.619> let's<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.920> ahead<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.400> show<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
bat so let's go ahead and just show you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.990 
bat so let's go ahead and just show you
something<00:01:36.119> else<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:38.720> chicken<00:01:40.909> there<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
something else like a chicken there you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.899 
something else like a chicken there you
go<00:01:42.150> start<00:01:42.509> spawning<00:01:42.750> chickens<00:01:43.520> we<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.700> change

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
go start spawning chickens we can change

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
go start spawning chickens we can change
it<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.240> mushroom<00:01:45.780> cap<00:01:46.049> mushroom<00:01:46.470> car<00:01:46.619> was

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
it to a mushroom cap mushroom car was

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.289
