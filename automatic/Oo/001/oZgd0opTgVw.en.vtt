00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.820
 good day everyone on youtube i have the 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.730
 lately from a lot of members 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.610
 got a top 10 for once 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.260
 making my favorite lures so 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.410
 we are going to do that sometime we are going 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.180
 divide it into two clips 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.430
 and we start with number 10 people 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.090
 lives meines 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.220
 and our very large plug you 8 centimeters 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.650
 but a great plug in the fish 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.800
 polder in the shallow polder 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.440
 this plug your destiny only 35 40 centimeters 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 deeply and usually we troll it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.989
 five and six meters behind the boat and works 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.270
 really perfect for all this color does it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.890
 always very good already have a lot 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.980
 nice and large pike can attack 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.500
 and you that is number ten number 9 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.020
 those are the big heavy spoons that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.910
 we just roll it behind the boat 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.710
 all you have to do is get there 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.910
 a huge antique inc common 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.800
 put 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.420
 especially since these types of spoons are often the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.789
 tend to turn around 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.090
 in the water you have to try on it so 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.910
 sail as slowly as you like 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.880
 if it succeeds then this is really a perfect 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.740
 piece of artificial bait because it is so heavy 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 you have to put him reasonably short behind the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.599
 boat did not reach meters or 3 4 high punch 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 more than you really have a perfect piece 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.649
 lures 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.990
 ok that was now my own at number 8 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:47.140
 is a company under building with 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.210
 and rattle stairs plus we didn't 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.740
 only a very big pike is also very 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.210
 many large walleye have it 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.310
 caught 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.670
 this is a plus sad 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.380
 making noise and plates that are pretty deep 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.000
 you also have to get him behind the boat again 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.299
 to hold 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.530
 and what we do with this plug is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.000
 relatively the boat is allowed and then we give 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.670
 occasional very hard jerk on the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.140
 rod allowing the plug to accelerate into it 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.640
 water 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.530
 if you do that then you rod very slowly 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.709
 backwards does that are often than the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.299
 moments when you get the life 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.120
 and you can do that quite often 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.250
 one after the other you can really do it 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.239
 sometimes be amazed what you do with this 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.670
 flight received 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.230
 this is therefore a twist of the execution 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.750
 They have also, in my view therefore income 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.970
 but I always like to fill 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.349
 shallow polder 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.370
 to fish with a company from the plug 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.660
 number 7 is really a classic one 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.049
 I think everyone really has this 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.410
 they plugin fish case and rapala 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.090
 jointed 13 centimeters 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.970
 I use myself especially in the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.519
 fishing rod when we fish by boat and then 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.079
 also quite short behind the boat because 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.989
 as you can see there is a hefty one 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.370
 dip on this plug 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.620
 if you are 10 meters behind the boat 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.730
 drags then it goes like two and half past three 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.200
 meter 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.579
 so you really have to put it behind the boat 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.500
 to hold 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.850
 I fish in and especially in the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.850
 screw water from the engine 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.720
 so fairly close behind the boat to 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.519
 it is going very well and really again 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.680
 a pluk also live a lot with it 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.500
 caught and not alone 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.349
 this version also the eleven centimeters or the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.620
 9 centimeters are fine 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.340
 piece of lures for yes everywhere actually 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.690
 on money water 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.420
 in the polder I ca n't do it so badly 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.770
 think of this plug 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.800
 well then we go number 6 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.940
 last flight of this film and video 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.780
 the buster jerk and then in the 15 format 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.000
 centimeter with a weight of 15 grams 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.820
 well many people use this dress 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.430
 to wear the dresses alone 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.200
 turd and power are the boat and it gives 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.500
 a very nice effect to he very 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.980
 very zigzagging through the water is not very 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.810
 many pike fishermen can do that for you 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.990
 definitely really recommend that to agree 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.990
 to attempt 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.980
 troll me meter or 5 6 behind the boat 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.900
 And yes it is really incredible 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:28.340
 experience what you do with this plug on that 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:30.530
 way can really catch in the water and 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.580
 not just a great place to be 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.700
 diving but also just great plug 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.680
 behind the boat it roll well these were the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.380
 first five plugs next video will 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.970
 I make the top 5 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.970
 let's see it is number 1 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.480
 ok until next time
