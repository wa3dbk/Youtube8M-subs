00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it's the second part of the first record

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.950 
it's the second part of the first record
really<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> first<00:01:23.070> record<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.490> very<00:01:24.299> linear

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
really the first record was very linear

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.190 
really the first record was very linear
I<00:01:25.049> guess<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:26.299> went<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> started

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
I guess and then we went out and started

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.749 
I guess and then we went out and started
playing<00:01:28.530> shows<00:01:28.590> very<00:01:29.009> quickly<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.640> we

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
playing shows very quickly I think we

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
playing shows very quickly I think we
decide<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.689> had<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:30.960> quite<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.439> more

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
decide that we had like quite a bit more

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.069 
decide that we had like quite a bit more

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
personnel personality a lot more of a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
personnel personality a lot more of a
