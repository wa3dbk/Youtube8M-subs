00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.110
 8 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.910

 my son 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.039
 can attract 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.869
 you can also want one 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.869
 test this with thin wire 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.949
 to make 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.949
 I know him wholeheartedly that we are just our example 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.119

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.310
 of course a deen 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.639
 parking 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.029
 her editors also made the loop 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.049
 now I notice on this side 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.049
 market square where spotify 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.639
 with a headscarf loop 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.249
 the stroke goes as follows 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.749
 generally once 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.539
 twice 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.139
 participate four times 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.139
 through the eyes 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.909
 because of this 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.569
 make fights 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.179
 attract 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.179
 such a 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.859
 you can take a piece off 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.359
 aco church 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.559
 so we have now 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.749
 how sick 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.789
 and a sounding board group that 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.279
 now for clubs 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:29.430
 the main lines 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.430
 the first newspaper 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:40.559
 nwofor bet 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.139
 with a square 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:58.439
 then you can have 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.439
 knight's church 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.870
 so occurs 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.870
 so just could go on quickly 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.449
 9 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.900
 I first wanted to do small-scale ever jobs pig 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:24.869
 take this form to support the economy 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.289
 my columns the underlying 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.629
 and then the classic 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:33.930
 so becomes corner 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.930
 except it is not possible 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.870
 I have a problem for you 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.300
 by continuous 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.740
 follow 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.740
 at first 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.689
 sanchez 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.369
 she designed 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:06.610
 the lamp 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.490
 I have it here 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.930
 a balloon 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.939
 so who drive 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:16.159
 yes but just doing things are like that 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.759
 the police 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.319
 he does 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:24.319
 the buttons 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.919
 so is the confirmation 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.680
 tree caterpillar tree 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.569
 on a nice no 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.439
 forester is canceled 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.439
 you can put this carlos on that 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:48.389
 because you break through 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.430
 can you get me at different depth 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.580
 kums then 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.580
 jenson button the norwegian we don't 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.319
 certainly now on a beach 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.020
 were bullets youth circus il 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.360
 and possibly none 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.869
 children come to our editors 

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:10.180
 a completely different car 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.180

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.180
 how can you do that through the jury 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.779
 make another young leaf 

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:26.569
 call the police 

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:28.120
 I think the system did 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.680
 possible acted 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.399
 much to less 

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.610
 we want to destroy it through the revelation it does 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.969
 at the fair 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:42.189

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:51.039
 how could it sounded 

00:07:58.179 --> 00:07:59.779
 read here why 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.969
 but also other products 

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:06.219
