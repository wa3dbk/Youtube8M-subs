there it's been shorting right through

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.580 
there it's been shorting right through
the<00:04:20.060> coil<00:04:20.330> and<00:04:20.570> hitting<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.080> ground<00:04:21.380> of

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
the coil and hitting to the ground of

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.830 
the coil and hitting to the ground of
gaffes<00:04:21.980> okay<00:04:22.610> so<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.030> could<00:04:23.180> be<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.330> router<00:04:23.570> it

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
gaffes okay so it could be a router it

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.290 
gaffes okay so it could be a router it
could<00:04:24.140> be<00:04:24.290> as<00:04:24.410> simple<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:25.030> Ken<00:04:26.030> what<00:04:26.180> do<00:04:26.240> you
