00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
first transition and yeah I thought I

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.260 
first transition and yeah I thought I
was<00:04:25.660> gonna<00:04:25.780> lose<00:04:26.400> but<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.669> end<00:04:27.789> it<00:04:28.060> turned

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
was gonna lose but in the end it turned

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.200 
was gonna lose but in the end it turned
out<00:04:28.450> that<00:04:28.510> i<00:04:29.050> was<00:04:29.650> i<00:04:29.860> was<00:04:30.099> lucky<00:04:30.340> again<00:04:33.210> I'm
