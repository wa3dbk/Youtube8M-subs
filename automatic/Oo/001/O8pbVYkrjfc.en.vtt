00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
map actually i'll try and i'ma tell for

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.120 
map actually i'll try and i'ma tell for
to<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.290> start<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:33.250> u.s.<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:36.260> or<00:02:36.470> something

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
to the start of it u.s. you or something

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.480 
to the start of it u.s. you or something
survival

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.720 

and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.399 

it<00:02:43.269> actually<00:02:45.120> yeah<00:02:46.120> it's<00:02:46.690> not<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.019> every<00:02:47.260> run

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
it actually yeah it's not in every run

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.490 
it actually yeah it's not in every run
so<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.709> normally<00:02:48.069> hits<00:02:48.310> 21<00:02:48.849> FPS<00:02:49.810> it's<00:02:50.080> that's

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
