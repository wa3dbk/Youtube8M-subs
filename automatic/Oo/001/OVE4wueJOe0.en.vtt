this<00:00:15.839> time<00:00:16.199> I'm<00:00:16.470> switching<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.760> number<00:00:18.150> 10

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this time I'm switching to my number 10

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.340 
this time I'm switching to my number 10
but<00:00:18.890> because<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> little<00:00:20.640> bit<00:00:20.789> more

sailboat we want nice white crisp lines
for<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> boats<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.690> will<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.559> soft

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860

edge<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> horizon<00:00:57.840> line<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
edge when we get to the horizon line so

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.930 
edge when we get to the horizon line so
that<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.910> water<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.350> ground<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:02.399> blends

going to have just a little of that
green<00:02:44.620> brim<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.069> bent<00:02:45.370> into<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.850> water<00:02:46.060> here

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
green brim and bent into the water here

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.320
