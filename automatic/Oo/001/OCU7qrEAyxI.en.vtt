of the nice things is you can overlay

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.680 
of the nice things is you can overlay
your<00:01:36.520> speed<00:01:37.950> overlays<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:38.979> compass<00:01:39.610> so<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.600> can

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
your speed overlays a compass so you can

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.030 
your speed overlays a compass so you can
see<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:41.020> direction<00:01:41.320> you're<00:01:41.590> going<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:41.920> it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
you've been in the editing software it

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.830 
you've been in the editing software it
actually<00:01:50.170> lays<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.650> Garmin<00:01:51.549> or<00:01:51.729> Bing<00:01:52.090> Map<00:01:52.390> are

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
actually lays a Garmin or Bing Map are

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.620 
actually lays a Garmin or Bing Map are
not<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.260> garment<00:01:53.830> but<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:55.290> Bing<00:01:56.290> or<00:02:00.420> google<00:02:01.420> map

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
not a garment but a Bing or google map

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.920 
not a garment but a Bing or google map
right<00:02:02.290> over<00:02:02.619> top<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.220> image<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:04.720> then

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
right over top of the image but then

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.020 
right over top of the image but then
when<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.229> save<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.860> image<00:02:06.250> actually<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:07.000> a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
when you save the image actually to a

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.270 
when you save the image actually to a
video<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.750> map<00:02:07.960> disappears<00:02:08.739> but<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.129> has<00:02:09.250> a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
video the map disappears but it has a

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.559 
video the map disappears but it has a
little<00:02:09.610> out<00:02:10.170> outline<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:12.310> your<00:02:12.730> route<00:02:13.180> that

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
little out outline of your route that

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.900 
little out outline of your route that
appears<00:02:13.990> down<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.740> down<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.340> corner

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
appears down in the down in the corner

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.020 
appears down in the down in the corner
so

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.790 
so
even<00:02:17.810> though<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:17.990> doesn't<00:02:18.140> show<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.410> map

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
even though it doesn't show the map

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.010 
even though it doesn't show the map
you've<00:02:19.250> got<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.720> little<00:02:20.720> route<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.800> shows<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
you've got a little route it shows the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.490 
you've got a little route it shows the
little<00:02:24.020> red<00:02:24.170> dot<00:02:24.440> following<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.340> route

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
little red dot following the route

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.590 
little red dot following the route
pretty<00:02:27.500> nice<00:02:27.709> little<00:02:28.100> features<00:02:28.490> about<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
pretty nice little features about the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.420 
pretty nice little features about the
only<00:02:29.720> thing<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.140> would<00:02:30.319> like<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.650> see<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.160> it

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
only thing I would like to see is it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.809 
only thing I would like to see is it
actually<00:02:32.120> embed<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:33.290> google<00:02:33.739> map<00:02:33.980> or<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.610> big

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
actually embed the google map or the big

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.260 
actually embed the google map or the big
map<00:02:35.060> right<00:02:35.480> into<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.959> video<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:36.560> well<00:02:37.270> that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
map right into the video as well that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.449 
map right into the video as well that
would<00:02:38.420> be<00:02:38.450> ideal<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:39.020> like<00:02:39.590> these<00:02:39.800> rides<00:02:40.160> that

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
would be ideal for like these rides that

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.900 
would be ideal for like these rides that
we<00:02:40.610> lead<00:02:40.850> for<00:02:41.180> born<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.569> ride<00:02:41.720> magazine<00:02:42.130> and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910

North<00:02:46.910> Georgia<00:02:47.150> motorcycles<00:02:48.050> but<00:02:48.920> I'll<00:02:49.430> take

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
North Georgia motorcycles but I'll take

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
dislike is the fact that it is such a

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.780

use<00:07:04.070> that<00:07:04.570> while<00:07:05.570> you're<00:07:05.780> using<00:07:05.990> bluetooth

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
use that while you're using bluetooth

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.240 
use that while you're using bluetooth
because<00:07:07.190> you<00:07:07.340> get<00:07:07.520> a<00:07:07.580> an<00:07:08.440> echo<00:07:09.440> and<00:07:09.830> some<00:07:10.039> other

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
because you get a an echo and some other

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.390 
because you get a an echo and some other
issues<00:07:11.000> with<00:07:11.330> it<00:07:11.509> so<00:07:12.020> you<00:07:12.710> just<00:07:12.919> turn<00:07:13.160> off<00:07:13.190> the

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
issues with it so you just turn off the

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.620 
issues with it so you just turn off the
internal<00:07:14.090> mics<00:07:15.250> so<00:07:16.250> anyway<00:07:16.970> we're<00:07:17.240> here<00:07:17.539> at

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630
