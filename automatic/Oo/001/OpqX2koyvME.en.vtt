I never thought that I would find a
knife<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:23.190> deployed<00:02:23.819> better<00:02:24.530> than<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
knife that deployed better than the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.900 
knife that deployed better than the
flipper<00:02:27.300> designs<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.760> my

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
flipper designs like this this is my

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.199 
flipper designs like this this is my
Kershaw<00:02:30.330> skyline<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.340> would<00:02:32.340> rate<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:33.000> as

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
Kershaw skyline I would rate this as as

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.430 
Kershaw skyline I would rate this as as
a<00:02:33.300> solid<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.110> mean<00:02:34.290> great<00:02:35.100> deployment<00:02:36.440> super

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
a solid a I mean great deployment super

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.400 
a solid a I mean great deployment super
fast<00:02:37.680> super<00:02:37.920> easy<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.750> never<00:02:39.750> thought<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.350> I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
fast super easy I never thought that I

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.180 
fast super easy I never thought that I
would<00:02:40.650> find<00:02:40.920> unassisted<00:02:41.790> thumb<00:02:42.360> stud<00:02:43.190> style

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
would find unassisted thumb stud style

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.500 
would find unassisted thumb stud style
knife<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:45.480> would<00:02:45.660> actually<00:02:46.140> be<00:02:47.069> better

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
knife that would actually be better

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.540 
knife that would actually be better
deploying<00:02:48.510> than<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.110> knife<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.280> have

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550

same length and it looks cool so I

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.500 
same length and it looks cool so I
figured<00:04:51.990> I'd<00:04:52.140> include<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.300> as<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.360> can

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.460 
widely carried classic knives so you
know<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.180> question<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:09.750> how<00:05:09.990> does<00:05:10.050> the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
know the question is how does the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.610 
know the question is how does the
benchmade<00:05:11.070> compare<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:12.150> them

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
benchmade compare to them

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.390 
benchmade compare to them
well<00:05:13.620> that's<00:05:14.430> skyline<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.240> weak<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:17.010> normal

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
well that's skyline and weak the normal

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.880 
well that's skyline and weak the normal
price<00:05:17.640> would<00:05:17.970> be<00:05:18.060> $30<00:05:18.900> for<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.260> non<00:05:19.440> pimped

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890

those well you know the benchmade it's

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.350 
those well you know the benchmade it's
it's<00:05:42.690> definitely<00:05:43.610> it's<00:05:44.610> lighter

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
it's definitely it's lighter

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.540 
it's definitely it's lighter
I<00:05:45.390> mean<00:05:45.660> it's<00:05:46.020> lighter<00:05:46.290> than<00:05:46.590> all<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.950> these

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.850 

the<00:05:50.550> deployment<00:05:51.210> is<00:05:51.380> better<00:05:52.380> than<00:05:52.650> all<00:05:52.830> of

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
the deployment is better than all of

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.090 
the deployment is better than all of
these<00:05:53.780> it's<00:05:54.780> even<00:05:55.080> better<00:05:55.200> than<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.500> skyline

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
these it's even better than the skyline

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.210 
these it's even better than the skyline
which<00:05:56.340> I<00:05:56.730> wasn't<00:05:57.270> sure<00:05:57.420> if<00:05:57.510> that<00:05:57.690> was<00:05:57.750> possible

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
which I wasn't sure if that was possible

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.070 
which I wasn't sure if that was possible
the<00:05:59.220> deployment<00:05:59.850> is<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.030> lot<00:06:00.360> better<00:06:00.660> than<00:06:00.960> on

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
the deployment is a lot better than on

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.380 
the deployment is a lot better than on

the leek okay that leek frame lock can

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.480 
the leek okay that leek frame lock can
be<00:06:03.510> tricky<00:06:03.870> to<00:06:03.900> deploy<00:06:05.630> and<00:06:06.740> looks<00:06:07.740> wise<00:06:08.040> I
