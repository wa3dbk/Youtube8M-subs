00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.290 
I've tried this with like very accurate
quarterbacks<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:13.040> for<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.099> most<00:04:14.280> part<00:04:14.430> it's

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
quarterbacks and for the most part it's

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.479 
quarterbacks and for the most part it's
the<00:04:15.540> same<00:04:15.750> thing<00:04:16.019> he<00:04:16.230> overthrows<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.190> little

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the same thing he overthrows it a little

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.659 
the same thing he overthrows it a little
bit<00:04:17.790> where<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.750> corner<00:04:19.019> back<00:04:19.230> in<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.769> safety

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
bit where the corner back in the safety

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.610 
bit where the corner back in the safety
can<00:04:21.060> get<00:04:21.329> a<00:04:21.359> better<00:04:21.570> chance<00:04:21.900> at<00:04:22.169> getting<00:04:22.530> an

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
can get a better chance at getting an

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.470 
can get a better chance at getting an
interception<00:04:23.040> or<00:04:24.889> they<00:04:25.889> even<00:04:26.280> bump<00:04:26.610> him<00:04:26.820> they

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
interception or they even bump him they

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.150 
interception or they even bump him they
bump<00:04:27.750> him<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.110> he<00:04:28.230> can't<00:04:28.440> get<00:04:28.620> inside<00:04:28.800> position

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
bump him so he can't get inside position

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.680 
bump him so he can't get inside position
and<00:04:29.580> I'm<00:04:29.730> talking<00:04:29.940> about<00:04:30.000> bumping<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.510> wide

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
and I'm talking about bumping the wide

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.140 
and I'm talking about bumping the wide
receiver<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.320> again<00:04:31.889> this<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.580> not<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.760> one

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
receiver and again this is not a one

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.650 
receiver and again this is not a one
hundred<00:04:33.540> percent<00:04:33.570> thing<00:04:34.340> but<00:04:35.340> it's<00:04:35.639> it<00:04:36.240> stops

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
hundred percent thing but it's it stops

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.140 
hundred percent thing but it's it stops
it<00:04:36.930> for<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.350> most<00:04:37.560> part<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.100> if<00:04:38.910> you're

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
it for the most part and if you're

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.490 
it for the most part and if you're
playing<00:04:39.360> someone<00:04:39.750> that's<00:04:39.930> really<00:04:40.200> good<00:04:40.320> with

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
playing someone that's really good with

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.260 
playing someone that's really good with
face<00:04:40.650> catching<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.340> they<00:04:41.760> have<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:41.970> tall

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
face catching and they have a tall

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.800 
face catching and they have a tall
receiver<00:04:42.660> it's<00:04:42.990> still<00:04:43.440> hard<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:43.919> stop<00:04:44.419> but<00:04:45.419> it

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
receiver it's still hard to stop but it

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.350 
receiver it's still hard to stop but it
slows<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.710> down<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.919> bit<00:04:47.130> now<00:04:47.520> what<00:04:48.090> we're<00:04:48.240> going

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
slows it down a bit now what we're going
