00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
so let's take a look at the sunspot

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.840 
so let's take a look at the sunspot
regions<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.890> why<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> Sun<00:00:41.340> has<00:00:41.460> calmed

about five percent of its area overnight
however<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.430> close<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> limb<00:01:00.059> is

however it's so close to the limb is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
however it's so close to the limb is
really<00:01:00.840> hard<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> tell<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:01.559> direction<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
really hard to tell which direction is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
really hard to tell which direction is
going<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.049> over<00:01:04.320> the

next 24 hours we're going to lose the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
next 24 hours we're going to lose the
region<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> Northwest<00:01:06.990> slim<00:01:07.670> however

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
region over the Northwest slim however

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.340 
region over the Northwest slim however
we<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:09.780> been<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> source

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
we do know that it has been the source

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
we do know that it has been the source
of<00:01:10.470> most<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.890> our<00:01:11.010> activity<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.299> last<00:01:12.510> few

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of most of our activity in the last few

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.330 
of most of our activity in the last few
days<00:01:12.930> including<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> two<00:01:13.770> medium-sized

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
days including the two medium-sized

days including the two medium-sized
seafarers<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.360> occurred<00:01:15.979> next

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
seafarers that have just occurred next

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
seafarers that have just occurred next
let's<00:01:17.130> take<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> look<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.580> riu<00:01:17.790> 1287<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
let's take a look at riu 1287 in the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.859 
let's take a look at riu 1287 in the
southwest<00:01:20.000> according<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.030> Noah's<00:01:21.330> numbers<00:01:21.720> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
southwest according to Noah's numbers is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
southwest according to Noah's numbers is
also<00:01:22.350> about<00:01:22.409> twenty<00:01:22.740> percent<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.070> its<00:01:23.159> area<00:01:23.549> in

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
also about twenty percent of its area in

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.850 
also about twenty percent of its area in
the<00:01:23.820> last<00:01:23.850> 24<00:01:24.390> hours<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.650> some

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the last 24 hours you can see some

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.230 
the last 24 hours you can see some
evidence<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.759> fact<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
evidence of that in the fact that the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.880 
evidence of that in the fact that the
trailing<00:01:27.689> spots<00:01:28.460> disappeared<00:01:29.460> entirely

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
trailing spots disappeared entirely

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.870 
trailing spots disappeared entirely
however<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> leading<00:01:32.310> spot<00:01:32.520> doesn't<00:01:32.700> look

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
however the leading spot doesn't look

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.940 
however the leading spot doesn't look
all<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> different<00:01:33.590> next<00:01:34.590> let's<00:01:34.740> take<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
all that different next let's take a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.620 
all that different next let's take a
look<00:01:35.220> at<00:01:35.310> region<00:01:35.670> 1289<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> northeast

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
look at region 1289 in the northeast

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.959 
look at region 1289 in the northeast
this<00:01:38.439> seems<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.890> have<00:01:38.979> grown<00:01:39.100> by<00:01:39.399> about<00:01:39.430> twenty

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
this seems to have grown by about twenty

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.850 
this seems to have grown by about twenty
percent<00:01:40.210> overnight<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:41.409> can<00:01:41.439> see<00:01:41.619> that<00:01:41.770> the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
percent overnight you can see that the

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.109 
percent overnight you can see that the
leader<00:01:42.039> spot<00:01:42.369> is<00:01:42.520> much<00:01:42.670> larger<00:01:42.880> than

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
leader spot is much larger than

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.240 
leader spot is much larger than
yesterday<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:43.960> there<00:01:44.350> are<00:01:44.439> more<00:01:44.590> spots<00:01:45.100> in

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
yesterday and there are more spots in

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.069 
yesterday and there are more spots in
