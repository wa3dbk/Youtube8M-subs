a<00:00:51.390> 12<00:00:51.570> volt<00:00:51.780> battery<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> big<00:00:53.219> deal<00:00:53.430> you're

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a 12 volt battery not a big deal you're

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.580 
a 12 volt battery not a big deal you're
going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.359> want<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> hook<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> ground<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
going to want to hook the ground up to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.170 
going to want to hook the ground up to
the<00:00:55.680> threads<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.309> that's<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:56.760> grounds

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the threads because that's where grounds

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.360 
the threads because that's where grounds
and<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.359> power<00:00:57.870> side<00:00:58.170> comes<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.269> this<00:01:01.219> you<00:01:02.219> can

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and the power side comes to this you can

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
and the power side comes to this you can
see<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:03.719> we're<00:01:03.899> running

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
see how all right now we're running

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.749 
see how all right now we're running
current<00:01:04.379> through<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.619> doesn't<00:01:05.309> ever<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.610> hot

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
current through it doesn't ever get hot

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.430 
current through it doesn't ever get hot
I<00:01:06.000> got<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> infrared<00:01:06.720> meter<00:01:07.679> right<00:01:07.920> here

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
I got a infrared meter right here

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.080 
I got a infrared meter right here
and<00:01:09.890> even<00:01:10.130> though<00:01:10.190> we<00:01:10.310> can't<00:01:10.490> see<00:01:10.580> anything<00:01:10.850> I

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
and even though we can't see anything I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.030 
and even though we can't see anything I
thought<00:01:11.270> maybe<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:11.600> were<00:01:11.690> just<00:01:11.720> wrong<00:01:12.080> but<00:01:12.890> no

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
thought maybe we were just wrong but no

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.580 
thought maybe we were just wrong but no
you<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:13.460> see<00:01:13.610> right<00:01:13.640> here<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.630> gets<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.930> 77

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
you can see right here it gets the 77

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.020 
you can see right here it gets the 77
degrees<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.130> nothing<00:01:16.430> is<00:01:16.460> ever<00:01:16.580> happening

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
degrees so nothing is ever happening

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.210
