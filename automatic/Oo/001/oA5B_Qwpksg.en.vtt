00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.740
 logar where you relax 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.710

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.710
 posture that is new on difficult 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.700
 for the bodies of Westerners I you 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.700
 showed options we always start 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.880
 sitting posture legs in front of you 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.280
 the flex team we stretch back and there we 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.600
 will do the 2010 so you 're going to lead 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.150
 your high heel perineum level and 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.060
 the other bead will come over the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.590
 talent see me there my knees and touch 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.350
 still not good we're using a brick 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.300
 for this half lotus and la la c'est beau 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:21.320
 the knees are good we are in the 2000 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.170
 lotus and one has the size who world the 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.620
 ribcage which is released the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.960
 shoulders 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.390
 far from the ears we are there to 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.110
 breathe well 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.730
 if you want another option it's 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.200
 Too difficult it's simply 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.000
 to sit cross-legged 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.180
 if you sit cross-legged you put 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.960
 feet under the knees and here too 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.660
 do not touch the ground 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.540
 so my famous brick or your 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.840
 dictionary you organize yourself like 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.810
 you can at home and here we are we 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.720
 is here well we are right if still 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.500
 it's hard for you well you 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.450
 stay legs like that the legs 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.650
 like that where simply 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:09.629
 ap 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.489
 it's not necessary that it pulls you in 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.400
 knees if it pulls in the joints 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.109
 does not do this posture does not do 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.430
 no bassana is that you are not 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.530
 not yet done for you your 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.350
 yoga teacher will show you a 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.840
 postures to really soften your 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.970
 hips and pull your legs and you 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.360
 will maybe someday be able to do that 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.800
 of massana also think a returned in 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.080
 the lotus has a tendency when we want 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.930
 bring the sailboats knees so have 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.780
 the dance with the back a little like that one 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.460
 really has the back that is right imagine 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.800
 a straw of fruit juice if it is 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.300
 all curbet there is the energy the juice that 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.010
 do not go that does not come up in the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.840
 straw so your spine 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.270
 that's it she needs to be there 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.539
 right have no massana so the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.130
 thought to really have the right back 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:02.669
 finally you have to have your two glutes 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.190
 on the carpet because we tend 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.810
 also when we want to bring back 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.699
 we tend to do 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.800
 absolutely put your knees and you 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.919
 know a bit like that so you see 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.560
 the no really well anchored glutes 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.940
 in the ground so felt good what is 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.860
 important for you is that it pulls me 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.349

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.710

 do you adapt yoga this is a 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.449
 invitation to feel your body so 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.449

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.010

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.170
