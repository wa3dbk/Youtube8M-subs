00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460

on<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.850> CPU<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.600> from<00:02:37.870> 91<00:02:38.290> degree<00:02:38.470> Celsius<00:02:38.890> to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
a 2 degree Celsius and it also dropped 7

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
degree Celsius with the GPU so from 60

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.270

degrees<00:02:46.300> Celsius<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.780> 53<00:02:47.380> degrees<00:02:47.650> Celsius<00:02:48.100> so

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
degrees Celsius to 53 degrees Celsius so

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.760 
degrees Celsius to 53 degrees Celsius so
approximately<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.600> drops<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.140> temperature

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
approximately it drops your temperature

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.820 
approximately it drops your temperature
about<00:02:51.280> 10<00:02:51.550> degrees<00:02:51.640> Celsius<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:53.410> now<00:02:53.650> I'm

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
about 10 degrees Celsius and now I'm

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.710 
about 10 degrees Celsius and now I'm
already<00:02:54.010> at<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.460> conclusion<00:02:55.210> actually<00:02:55.570> and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
already at the conclusion actually and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.150 
already at the conclusion actually and
there's<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.930> bunch<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.320> positive<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.830> bunch<00:02:57.070> of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
there's a bunch of positive a bunch of

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.500 
there's a bunch of positive a bunch of
negative<00:02:57.400> things<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.820> can<00:02:57.970> say<00:02:58.120> about<00:02:58.150> this

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
negative things I can say about this

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.480 
negative things I can say about this
let's<00:02:59.260> start<00:02:59.470> with<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.830> positive<00:03:00.280> things

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
let's start with the positive things

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.850 
let's start with the positive things
like<00:03:00.670> always<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.690> has<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.930> nice<00:03:02.170> sleek<00:03:02.470> design

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
like always it has a nice sleek design

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.340 
like always it has a nice sleek design
you<00:03:03.160> have<00:03:03.190> easy<00:03:04.150> access<00:03:04.450> for<00:03:04.900> cleaning<00:03:05.050> the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
you have easy access for cleaning the

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.160 
you have easy access for cleaning the
fan<00:03:05.620> it's<00:03:06.520> USB<00:03:06.760> powered<00:03:07.270> with<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.660> USB

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
fan it's USB powered with that USB

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.830 
fan it's USB powered with that USB
pass-through<00:03:08.590> port<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.030> don't<00:03:10.240> lose<00:03:10.480> even

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
pass-through port so you don't lose even

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.479 
pass-through port so you don't lose even
B<00:03:10.960> port<00:03:11.140> on<00:03:11.290> your<00:03:11.320> laptop<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:12.100> that's<00:03:12.280> really

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
B port on your laptop and that's really

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.550 
B port on your laptop and that's really
nice<00:03:12.760> as<00:03:13.090> laptops<00:03:13.840> don't<00:03:14.050> always<00:03:14.170> have<00:03:14.530> that

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
nice as laptops don't always have that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.090 
nice as laptops don't always have that
many<00:03:14.950> USB<00:03:15.220> port<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:16.420> supports<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.170> 17<00:03:17.830> inch

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
many USB port it supports up to 17 inch

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.610 
many USB port it supports up to 17 inch
laptops<00:03:18.820> or<00:03:19.000> notebooks<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:19.660> that's<00:03:20.050> nice<00:03:20.410> as

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
laptops or notebooks so that's nice as

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.370

be pretty loud for a laptop cooler fan
it's<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:57.519> easy<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.940> carry<00:03:58.150> around<00:03:58.300> also<00:03:58.930> as

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
it's not easy to carry around also as

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.500 
it's not easy to carry around also as
it's<00:03:59.590> not<00:03:59.709> really<00:03:59.980> specifically<00:04:00.610> designed

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
it's not really specifically designed

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.150 
it's not really specifically designed
for<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:02.019> they're<00:04:02.500> not<00:04:02.590> gonna<00:04:02.739> be<00:04:02.890> able<00:04:03.010> to

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
for that they're not gonna be able to

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.860 
for that they're not gonna be able to
put<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.550> any<00:04:03.850> carrying<00:04:04.269> bag<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:04.660> rather

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
put it in any carrying bag it's rather

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.580 
put it in any carrying bag it's rather
big<00:04:05.170> so<00:04:05.760> keep<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.000> mind<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.390> if<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.410> fan

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
big so keep that in mind and if the fan

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.350 
big so keep that in mind and if the fan
fails<00:04:08.950> it'll<00:04:09.190> be<00:04:09.370> hard<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> replace<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.239> as

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
fails it'll be hard to replace it as

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.410 
fails it'll be hard to replace it as
it's<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.170> fan<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.800> can't<00:04:12.160> really<00:04:12.459> buy<00:04:12.880> in

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
it's a fan that you can't really buy in

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.870 
it's a fan that you can't really buy in
a<00:04:13.540> store<00:04:13.600> like<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:15.190> what<00:04:15.310> also<00:04:15.489> would

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
a store like that and what also would

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.250 
a store like that and what also would
have<00:04:15.970> been<00:04:16.120> nice<00:04:16.270> is<00:04:16.600> some

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
have been nice is some

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.190 
have been nice is some
thus<00:04:17.560> filtration<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.360> manner<00:04:19.360> and<00:04:19.600> perhaps

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
thus filtration that manner and perhaps

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.370 
thus filtration that manner and perhaps
a<00:04:20.740> speed<00:04:21.400> switch<00:04:21.670> for<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> fan<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.600> that<00:04:22.870> the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
a speed switch for the fan and that the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.340 
a speed switch for the fan and that the
USB<00:04:23.740> cable<00:04:23.950> would<00:04:24.280> have<00:04:24.430> been<00:04:24.720> not<00:04:25.720> hardwired

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
USB cable would have been not hardwired

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.430 
USB cable would have been not hardwired
into<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.160> laptop<00:04:28.150> cooler<00:04:28.420> itself<00:04:28.810> but
