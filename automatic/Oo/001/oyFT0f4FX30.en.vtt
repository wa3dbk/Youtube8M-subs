00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
cover off you'll see this and you'll see

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.639 
cover off you'll see this and you'll see
the<00:01:23.399> probability<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:24.990> pull<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
the probability that when you pull the

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:37.910 
the probability that when you pull the
trigger<00:01:25.679> this<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.340> slowly<00:01:26.609> go<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:36.920> while

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
trigger this will slowly go down while

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
trigger this will slowly go down while
taking<00:01:38.340> yours<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.909> gonna<00:01:39.240> stick<00:01:39.539> it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
taking yours at I'm gonna stick it

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
taking yours at I'm gonna stick it
through<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:40.140> there's<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.890> little<00:01:41.009> lower<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
through there there's a little lower and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.569 
through there there's a little lower and
then<00:01:42.299> go<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.229> gap<00:01:43.409> still<00:01:44.310> gets<00:01:44.429> in

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
then go be a little gap still gets in

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.529 
then go be a little gap still gets in
there<00:01:44.789> it<00:01:45.450> will<00:01:45.630> help<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.359> bit

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
there it will help to be a little bit

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.309 
there it will help to be a little bit
and<00:01:48.749> also<00:01:49.229> hit<00:01:50.130> throttle<00:01:50.929> use<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.229> bit

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
and also hit throttle use a little bit

00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:00.730 
and also hit throttle use a little bit
more<00:01:52.499> room<00:01:54.889> I'm<00:01:55.889> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> connect<00:01:56.490> it

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:30.930 

pulled<00:02:01.740> in

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.240 

I<00:02:34.740> try<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:36.210> get<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.360> under<00:02:37.600> there

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
I try to get it under there

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:47.610 
I try to get it under there
this<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:41.910> see<00:02:43.710> doesn't<00:02:44.710> go<00:02:44.800> down<00:02:46.530> then<00:02:47.530> I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
this can see doesn't go down then I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.140 
this can see doesn't go down then I
trust<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.040> fits<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.460> there<00:02:48.610> especially

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
trust it fits in there especially

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.630 
trust it fits in there especially
sea-ice<00:02:50.110> stuff<00:02:50.650> around<00:02:50.860> there<00:02:51.130> all<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.310> did<00:02:51.550> is

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
sea-ice stuff around there all I did is

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.350 
sea-ice stuff around there all I did is
take<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.880> flathead<00:02:52.800> shut<00:02:53.800> out<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.010> there<00:02:54.360> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
take a flathead shut out of there and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.570 
take a flathead shut out of there and
now<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.630> can<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.500> once<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.340> hit<00:02:57.460> the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
now you can see that once I hit the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.970 
now you can see that once I hit the
throttle<00:02:58.080> there's<00:02:59.080> no<00:02:59.260> more<00:02:59.730> like<00:03:01.800> now<00:03:02.800> what

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
throttle there's no more like now what
