00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.220
 by statistics and by the numbers and 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.980
 by players who are currently not 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.910
 only in Spain but in the rest of the leagues 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.389
 it is the most important 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.600
 the barcelona has great fault in everything 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.400
 this and doing some things very well and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.840
 that does not affect the quarry of the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.850
 real madrid that after all is the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.150
 most representative and the most important 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.460
 in today's real Maria is governed by the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.930
 results for today by day 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.190
 to day and to get the maximum idols 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.290
 possible what is what the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.550
 Real Madrid and all the fans have 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.680
 your frustration I understand your frustration 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.800
 when I was given the opportunity to 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.450
 play with the first team assiduously and 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.520
 they would probably think that 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.250
 they would have a gap also in the first 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.170
 team and I understand it because today 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.730
 is proving not only in the big 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.080
 teams but the Spanish team 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.780
 current has many players who are 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.390
 they form the quarry from my point of view 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.250
 there should be more connection 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.170
 the first team with the rest of the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.960
 quarry but that's a job that leads 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.850
 many years and that you can not make a 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.460
 day for another I would like to see much more 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 homegrown in the first team by 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.280
 feeling and for and by and for attraction 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.040
 facing the fan one of the reasons 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.720
 so I 'm most proud of it 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.800
 because one of my idols like roberto 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.130
 Carlos finished 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.960
 one or two matches on the bench myself 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.070
 acting in his position to be able to train 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.840
 as players of the first team of 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.549
 madrid an advanced learning and 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.659
 and to that you add that the player of the 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.640
 quarry of madrid and already comes very 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.229
 prepared because it can yield 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.670
 perfectly in the first team he 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.909
 called a couple of times to his office in 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.759
 the quarry made me go down told me two or 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.149
 three things as he thought he must 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.480
 act and it will correspond to me 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.310
 proportionality 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.190
 at certain times in which 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.520
 I was not doing things right and 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.080
 at that time I was exposed to 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 represent all the youth players that 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.740
 they were the quarry right now if 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.900
 did well you could probably be 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.310
 give more opportunities to the people of 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.520
 filial I remember in my stage of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.380
 fry or children see a quantity 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.990
 from days to vicente del bosque 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.970
 for the sports city 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.710
 I probably did not even know our 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.319
 names or team we played but we 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.439
 I asked 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.790
 he tried to help us they saw us many 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.409
 trainings being able to train 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.269
 and seeing him only supported by the 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.219
 bar going cold was something that a 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.480
 we were very motivated 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.189
 and a lot of satisfaction 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.569
 in this case the coach of the first 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.830
 team that is mourinho informas like 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.140
 responsible have bet on him 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.480
 has total respect and full latitude 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.040
 because he also feels that one is 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.620
 behaving like a professional acting 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.640
 in a position that is not yours 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.110
 obviously everyone and everyone 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.090
 fans of madrid would like to see a 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.310
 bet strongly by nacho and I would like 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.960
 see nacho play I would like to see him 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.850
 I liked the theory of seeing morata 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.290
 liked to see alex fernandez I like to see 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.250
 to the quarry I like to see adam I like 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.250
 see alley I like
