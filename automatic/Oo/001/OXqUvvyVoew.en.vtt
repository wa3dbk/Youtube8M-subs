to them it provides a good amount of
noise<00:02:45.260> isolation<00:02:46.569> but<00:02:47.569> i<00:02:47.959> doubt<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.470> as<00:02:49.150> this

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
noise isolation but i doubt it as this

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.880 
noise isolation but i doubt it as this
does<00:02:50.569> not<00:02:50.810> have<00:02:53.049> this<00:02:54.049> has<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.319> very<00:02:54.620> small

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
does not have this has a very small

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.509 
does not have this has a very small
cavity<00:02:55.459> actually<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.040> metal<00:02:58.040> mesh

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
cavity actually to the metal mesh

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.009 
cavity actually to the metal mesh
speakers<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.920> yeah<00:03:00.920> these<00:03:01.670> ones<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.989> i

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
speakers in it yeah these ones so i

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.559 
speakers in it yeah these ones so i
don't<00:03:03.440> think<00:03:03.799> it<00:03:04.130> would<00:03:04.489> be<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.060> effective

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
don't think it would be that effective

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.910 
don't think it would be that effective
for<00:03:06.140> nice<00:03:06.380> noise<00:03:06.739> isolation<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:08.320> would<00:03:09.320> have<00:03:09.590> to

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
for nice noise isolation I would have to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.280 
for nice noise isolation I would have to
check<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.810> big<00:03:11.810> bigger<00:03:12.230> plugs<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.959> they<00:03:14.959> could

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
check the big bigger plugs so they could

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.380 
check the big bigger plugs so they could
give<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.590> better<00:03:15.769> noise<00:03:16.130> isolation<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.090> bigger

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
give a better noise isolation the bigger

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.140 
give a better noise isolation the bigger
plugs<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.130> there<00:03:19.130> are<00:03:19.250> three<00:03:19.459> sizes<00:03:19.700> too<00:03:19.880> i

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
plugs and there are three sizes too i

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.270 
plugs and there are three sizes too i
guess<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.690> bigger<00:03:21.079> plugs<00:03:21.350> would<00:03:21.739> suit<00:03:22.070> my

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
guess the bigger plugs would suit my

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.900 
guess the bigger plugs would suit my
need<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:23.410> these<00:03:24.410> headphones<00:03:24.769> are<00:03:25.250> also<00:03:25.519> said

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
need and these headphones are also said

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.080 
need and these headphones are also said
to<00:03:25.940> be<00:03:26.150> good<00:03:26.630> at<00:03:26.989> buzz<00:03:27.250> not<00:03:28.250> bass-heavy<00:03:28.549> not

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
to be good at buzz not bass-heavy not

range so and that's what I prefer so I
will<00:03:38.109> burn<00:03:39.109> these<00:03:39.350> headphones<00:03:39.620> out<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.549> check

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
will burn these headphones out I check

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.020 
will burn these headphones out I check
them<00:03:41.180> out<00:03:41.269> around<00:03:41.690> for<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:41.959> week<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.440> then<00:03:43.030> post
