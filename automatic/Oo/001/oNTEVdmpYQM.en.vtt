how to organize an apartment but you
didn't<00:01:58.929> create<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.140> community<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.709> you<00:01:59.739> didn't

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
didn't create a community and you didn't

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.040 
didn't create a community and you didn't

neighbors our buildings look different

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.600 
neighbors our buildings look different
because<00:02:07.750> they<00:02:07.929> perform<00:02:08.380> different<00:02:08.610> what

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
because they perform different what

makes the Vancouver tower look special

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.459 
makes the Vancouver tower look special
is<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.430> it's<00:02:13.200> maximizing<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> real-estate

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
is that it's maximizing the real-estate

this this highway bridge also there was
a<00:02:21.530> park<00:02:21.890> right<00:02:22.160> next<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.520> site<00:02:22.700> where

a park right next to the site where

we're not allowed to cast shadows after
10<00:02:25.790> o'clock<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.150> morning<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.540> we<00:02:26.810> started

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
10 o'clock in the morning so we started

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.530 
10 o'clock in the morning so we started
mapping<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.980> constraints<00:02:28.760> there's<00:02:29.480> a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
mapping the constraints there's a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.910 
mapping the constraints there's a
setback<00:02:29.930> requirement<00:02:30.440> from<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> street

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
setback requirement from the street

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.320 
setback requirement from the street
there's<00:02:31.130> another<00:02:31.310> setback<00:02:31.730> from<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.030> highway

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
there's another setback from the highway

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.970 
there's another setback from the highway
then<00:02:32.960> there's<00:02:33.140> like<00:02:33.320> almost<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.710> deal-breaker

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
then there's like almost a deal-breaker

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.820 
then there's like almost a deal-breaker
which<00:02:34.550> is<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:35.030> 30<00:02:35.540> meter<00:02:35.750> setback<00:02:36.290> from<00:02:36.500> all<00:02:36.680> of

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
which is a 30 meter setback from all of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.530 
which is a 30 meter setback from all of
the<00:02:36.920> highways<00:02:37.070> because<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.120> city<00:02:38.330> doesn't

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the highways because the city doesn't

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.940 
the highways because the city doesn't
want<00:02:38.750> anybody<00:02:38.930> living<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.530> looking<00:02:39.800> straight

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
want anybody living and looking straight

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.940 
want anybody living and looking straight
out<00:02:40.250> at<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.700> ad<00:02:40.910> cars<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:42.320> finally<00:02:42.740> because

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
out at the ad cars and finally because

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.550 
out at the ad cars and finally because
of<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.130> park<00:02:43.400> our<00:02:44.000> footprint<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:44.780> reduced<00:02:45.260> to

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
of the park our footprint is reduced to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.060 
of the park our footprint is reduced to
a<00:02:45.950> tiny<00:02:46.340> 600<00:02:47.120> square<00:02:47.270> metre<00:02:47.570> triangle<00:02:48.170> which

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
a tiny 600 square metre triangle which

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.880 
a tiny 600 square metre triangle which
is<00:02:49.100> almost<00:02:49.490> too<00:02:49.700> small<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.240> -<00:02:50.750> built<00:02:50.960> as<00:02:51.470> soon

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
is almost too small to - built as soon

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.650 
is almost too small to - built as soon
as<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.100> know<00:02:52.340> what<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.240> really<00:02:53.510> going<00:02:53.600> to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
as you know what is this really going to

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.480 
as you know what is this really going to
do<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.900> can<00:02:54.050> start<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.530> who's<00:02:55.250> gonna<00:02:55.370> be

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
do you can start and who's gonna be

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.220 
do you can start and who's gonna be
using<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.030> how<00:02:56.180> they<00:02:56.330> how<00:02:56.900> they're<00:02:57.080> using

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
using it and how they how they're using

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.830 
using it and how they how they're using
it<00:02:57.350> how<00:02:57.680> what<00:02:58.130> is<00:02:58.220> their<00:02:58.370> complaints<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.630> where

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
it how what is their complaints of where

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.570 
it how what is their complaints of where
they<00:02:59.990> are<00:03:00.020> now<00:03:00.290> what<00:03:01.040> with<00:03:01.190> what<00:03:01.400> are<00:03:01.490> they

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
they are now what with what are they

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.340 
they are now what with what are they
dreaming<00:03:01.760> about<00:03:02.000> for<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.330> future<00:03:02.450> then<00:03:03.260> you

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
dreaming about for the future then you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.380 
dreaming about for the future then you
can<00:03:03.530> start<00:03:03.800> informing<00:03:04.550> your<00:03:04.940> design

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
can start informing your design

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.440 
can start informing your design
decisions<00:03:05.600> with<00:03:06.560> information<00:03:07.370> but<00:03:08.360> we

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
decisions with information but we

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.000 
decisions with information but we
thought<00:03:08.570> like<00:03:08.720> since<00:03:09.020> our<00:03:09.200> client<00:03:09.650> owns<00:03:09.800> the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
thought like since our client owns the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.160 
thought like since our client owns the
whole<00:03:10.130> site<00:03:10.400> as<00:03:11.000> soon<00:03:11.210> as<00:03:11.360> we<00:03:11.510> come<00:03:11.660> up<00:03:11.870> in<00:03:12.050> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
whole site as soon as we come up in the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.680 
whole site as soon as we come up in the
air<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.620> can<00:03:12.740> come<00:03:13.010> back<00:03:13.190> out<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:14.360> basically

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
air we can come back out and basically

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.630 
air we can come back out and basically
maximize<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.710> amount<00:03:15.800> of<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.250> nicest

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
maximize the amount of the nicest

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.030 
maximize the amount of the nicest
apartments<00:03:17.240> so<00:03:17.960> basically<00:03:18.230> as<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.770> drive

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
apartments so basically as you drive

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.140 
apartments so basically as you drive
over<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.400> bridge<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:19.820> like<00:03:19.940> there's

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
over the bridge it's like there's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.760 
over the bridge it's like there's
somebody<00:03:20.270> pulling<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.930> curtain<00:03:21.290> aside<00:03:21.380> sort<00:03:21.710> of

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
somebody pulling a curtain aside sort of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:32.130 
somebody pulling a curtain aside sort of
welcome<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.100> Vancouver

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
garbage you produce in the design

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.300

could turn into something that we could
