00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
multirotors they slip right in here but

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.800 
multirotors they slip right in here but
of<00:03:26.639> course<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.940> can<00:03:27.090> adapt<00:03:27.389> it<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.630> any

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
of course you can adapt it to any

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.449 
of course you can adapt it to any
multi-rotor<00:03:28.410> that's<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.920> size<00:03:29.130> class

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
multi-rotor that's in that size class

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.180 
multi-rotor that's in that size class
such<00:03:30.060> as<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.389> quantum<00:03:30.720> nova<00:03:31.109> if<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:32.010> just

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
such as the quantum nova if you just

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.770 
such as the quantum nova if you just
enlarge<00:03:32.459> these<00:03:32.670> holes<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.030> little<00:03:33.480> bit<00:03:33.600> with<00:03:33.750> a

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
enlarge these holes a little bit with a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.250 
enlarge these holes a little bit with a
knife

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
knife

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.990 
knife
they'll<00:03:34.470> slip<00:03:34.769> right<00:03:34.950> on<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.700> one<00:03:35.850> as

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
they'll slip right on in on that one as

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.870 
they'll slip right on in on that one as
well<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.750> wide<00:03:37.620> range<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:38.010> transmitters<00:03:38.700> as

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
well a wide range of transmitters as

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.550 
well a wide range of transmitters as
