disruptive and of course it was about

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.160 
disruptive and of course it was about
ten<00:05:03.340> years<00:05:03.370> into<00:05:04.000> my<00:05:04.030> marriage<00:05:04.510> when<00:05:04.780> my<00:05:04.960> wife

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
ten years into my marriage when my wife

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.560 
ten years into my marriage when my wife
found<00:05:05.470> that<00:05:05.770> out<00:05:05.950> and<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:06.310> was<00:05:06.490> just<00:05:06.790> exploring

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
found that out and it was just exploring

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.100 
found that out and it was just exploring
or<00:05:08.169> horribly<00:05:09.130> horribly<00:05:09.720> disturbing<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:10.870> her

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
or horribly horribly disturbing to her

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.890 
or horribly horribly disturbing to her
and<00:05:11.380> I<00:05:12.100> don't<00:05:12.370> think<00:05:12.580> she's<00:05:12.850> been<00:05:13.150> emotionally

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
and I don't think she's been emotionally

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.550 
and I don't think she's been emotionally
right<00:05:14.140> ever<00:05:14.470> since<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.660> I<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:17.020> don't<00:05:17.260> know<00:05:17.410> how

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
right ever since and I I don't know how

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.800 
right ever since and I I don't know how
much<00:05:18.010> credit<00:05:18.340> i<00:05:18.580> can<00:05:18.760> take<00:05:18.940> for<00:05:19.150> that

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
much credit i can take for that

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.890 
much credit i can take for that
certainly<00:05:20.810> certainly<00:05:21.320> I<00:05:22.210> think<00:05:23.210> some<00:05:23.600> of<00:05:23.630> us

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
certainly certainly I think some of us

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.410 
certainly certainly I think some of us
is<00:05:24.320> related<00:05:24.980> to<00:05:25.100> them

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420
