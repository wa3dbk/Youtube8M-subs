entire Bible my name is Janine Brown and
if<00:00:19.450> I<00:00:19.600> were<00:00:19.900> to<00:00:20.800> choose<00:00:21.070> my<00:00:21.340> favorite<00:00:21.369> book<00:00:21.970> of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
if I were to choose my favorite book of

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.710 
if I were to choose my favorite book of
the<00:00:22.210> Bible<00:00:22.600> I<00:00:22.720> think<00:00:22.750> I<00:00:23.440> would<00:00:23.590> choose<00:00:23.619> Matthew

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the Bible I think I would choose Matthew

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.269 
the Bible I think I would choose Matthew
Matthew's<00:00:25.720> Gospel<00:00:26.230> that<00:00:26.619> I've<00:00:26.740> worked<00:00:26.949> a<00:00:27.130> lot

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
Matthew's Gospel that I've worked a lot

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.779 
Matthew's Gospel that I've worked a lot
in<00:00:27.520> and<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:28.330> very<00:00:28.750> much<00:00:28.779> appreciated<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:30.460> one

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
in and I very much appreciated on one

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.360 
in and I very much appreciated on one
level<00:00:31.029> it's<00:00:31.390> because<00:00:31.960> Matthew<00:00:32.619> feels<00:00:33.100> like

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
level it's because Matthew feels like

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.250 
level it's because Matthew feels like
he's<00:00:33.610> a<00:00:33.640> high<00:00:33.910> Jay<00:00:34.149> on<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.300> myers-briggs<00:00:34.510> he's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
he's a high Jay on the myers-briggs he's

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.110 
he's a high Jay on the myers-briggs he's
got<00:00:35.470> things<00:00:35.800> in<00:00:36.010> boxes<00:00:36.220> and<00:00:36.489> things<00:00:36.820> are<00:00:36.940> very

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
got things in boxes and things are very

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.630 
got things in boxes and things are very
organized<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:37.810> I<00:00:37.930> like<00:00:38.200> that<00:00:38.440> that's<00:00:38.680> kind<00:00:39.550> of

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
organized and I like that that's kind of

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.799 
organized and I like that that's kind of
Who<00:00:39.820> I<00:00:39.880> am<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:41.170> on<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.320> much<00:00:41.559> deeper<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
Who I am but on a much deeper and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.459 
Who I am but on a much deeper and
probably<00:00:43.809> a<00:00:43.870> better<00:00:43.989> level<00:00:44.350> I<00:00:44.680> like<00:00:45.309> Matthew

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
probably a better level I like Matthew

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.080 
probably a better level I like Matthew
because<00:00:47.469> of<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.710> way<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:47.920> hear<00:00:48.640> Jesus

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
because of the way I hear Jesus

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.270 
because of the way I hear Jesus
portrayed<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.020> picture<00:00:50.440> of<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.829> portrait

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
portrayed so the picture of the portrait

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.000 
portrayed so the picture of the portrait
of<00:00:51.399> Jesus<00:00:51.610> in<00:00:52.329> Matthew<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:53.079> a<00:00:53.110> powerful<00:00:53.500> one<00:00:53.829> to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
of Jesus in Matthew is a powerful one to

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.569 
of Jesus in Matthew is a powerful one to
me<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:55.239> part<00:00:55.600> because<00:00:55.989> what<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.649> experienced

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
me in part because what we experienced

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.250 
me in part because what we experienced
in<00:00:57.760> Matthew<00:00:58.120> I<00:00:58.149> think<00:00:58.420> if<00:00:58.539> we<00:00:58.690> read<00:00:58.930> it<00:00:59.079> from

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
in Matthew I think if we read it from

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.729 
in Matthew I think if we read it from
cover<00:00:59.289> to<00:00:59.559> cover<00:00:59.649> is<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.489> very<00:01:00.820> Jewish<00:01:01.120> Jesus

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
cover to cover is a very Jewish Jesus

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.190 
cover to cover is a very Jewish Jesus
but<00:01:02.739> Jesus<00:01:02.770> very<00:01:03.700> much<00:01:04.619> Torah<00:01:05.619> abiding<00:01:07.200> Jew

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
but Jesus very much Torah abiding Jew

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.530 
but Jesus very much Torah abiding Jew
who<00:01:09.570> loves<00:01:10.570> God<00:01:11.049> with<00:01:11.680> all<00:01:11.890> his<00:01:12.340> heart<00:01:12.540> soul

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
who loves God with all his heart soul

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.160 
who loves God with all his heart soul
strength<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:14.320> mind<00:01:14.409> and<00:01:15.130> his<00:01:15.369> neighbor<00:01:15.700> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
strength and mind and his neighbor and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.700 
strength and mind and his neighbor and
comes<00:01:17.170> as<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:18.310> Messiah<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:19.090> Davidic<00:01:19.479> Messiah

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
comes as the Messiah the Davidic Messiah

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.940 
comes as the Messiah the Davidic Messiah
to<00:01:20.710> represent<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.689> mission<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.260> Israel<00:01:23.740> to

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
to represent the mission of Israel to

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.469 
to represent the mission of Israel to
the<00:01:23.979> nation's<00:01:24.549> so<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.390> very<00:01:25.600> Jewish<00:01:26.049> Messiah

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the nation's so this very Jewish Messiah

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.270 
the nation's so this very Jewish Messiah
stays<00:01:28.479> within<00:01:28.720> those<00:01:29.140> Jewish<00:01:29.439> parameters<00:01:30.009> for

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
stays within those Jewish parameters for

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.120 
stays within those Jewish parameters for
so<00:01:30.549> much<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.000> gospel<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.840> only<00:01:32.650> Gentiles

so much of the gospel and only Gentiles

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.030 
so much of the gospel and only Gentiles
we<00:01:33.369> see<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.790> he<00:01:33.909> interacts<00:01:34.270> with<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:35.040> are

that he has for his earthly ministry and

died<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:45.980> now<00:05:46.130> they're<00:05:46.910> back<00:05:47.180> again<00:05:47.390> it's<00:05:47.690> not

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
died and now they're back again it's not

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.840 
died and now they're back again it's not
really<00:05:47.870> them<00:05:48.290> but<00:05:48.500> it<00:05:48.620> is<00:05:48.650> it's<00:05:49.520> their

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
disembodied spirit so the Bible actually

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.490 
disembodied spirit so the Bible actually
does<00:05:52.730> have<00:05:52.970> something<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.419> say<00:05:53.630> about<00:05:53.660> again
