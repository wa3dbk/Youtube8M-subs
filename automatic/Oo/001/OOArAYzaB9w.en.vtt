00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
how isopropyl ninety percent would work

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.280 
how isopropyl ninety percent would work
in<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.890> stove<00:01:11.280> given<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.360> space<00:01:12.630> between<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in that stove given a space between the

wicks and the pot he said he doesn't

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.460 
wicks and the pot he said he doesn't
think<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.070> it'll<00:01:17.220> smut<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> pots<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.960> not

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
think that it'll smut the pots I'm not

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.219 
think that it'll smut the pots I'm not
too<00:01:19.680> sure<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:21.750> thought<00:01:22.110> I'd

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
too sure about that but I thought I'd

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.770 
too sure about that but I thought I'd
give<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.530> try<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.040> today<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> have

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
give it a try here today so what I have

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.499 
give it a try here today so what I have
is<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> half<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.950> fluid<00:01:26.130> ounce<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
is I have a half of a fluid ounce of the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
is I have a half of a fluid ounce of the
ninety<00:01:27.780> percent<00:01:28.070> isopropyl<00:01:29.070> alcohol<00:01:29.189> in

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
ninety percent isopropyl alcohol in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.630 
ninety percent isopropyl alcohol in
there<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:31.290> idea<00:01:31.619> behind<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.130> though<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
there the idea behind this though is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.090 
there the idea behind this though is
that<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.659> set<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> pot<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.590> onto<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that I can set the pot right onto the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.940 
that I can set the pot right onto the
burner<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> wait<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
burner I don't have to wait for it to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.830 
burner I don't have to wait for it to
blossom<00:01:37.950> or<00:01:38.340> bloom<00:01:39.560> let's<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> camera<00:01:41.130> two

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
blossom or bloom let's go to camera two

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.060 
blossom or bloom let's go to camera two
like<00:01:42.840> this

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:02:07.850 

and<00:01:50.070> let's<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.910> where<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.210> goes

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.029 

note<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:10.050> flames<00:02:10.380> have<00:02:10.680> yellow

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
note on this how the flames have yellow

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
note on this how the flames have yellow
tips<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.520> them<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:12.240> usually<00:02:12.420> did

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
tips on them just like they usually did

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.770 
tips on them just like they usually did
with<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.230> isopropyl<00:02:13.890> alcohol<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:15.450> far<00:02:15.750> I

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
with the isopropyl alcohol so far I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.110 
with the isopropyl alcohol so far I
don't<00:02:15.900> see<00:02:16.410> any<00:02:16.590> suit<00:02:17.040> underneath<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.880> pot

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
don't see any suit underneath the pot

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.460 
don't see any suit underneath the pot
from<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.690> angle<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.220> do<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
from this angle but we do have the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:35.870 
from this angle but we do have the
yellow<00:02:22.470> tips<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.430> said

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.340 

now<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.540> flames<00:02:37.020> are<00:02:37.260> getting<00:02:37.560> larger<00:02:37.800> and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
now the flames are getting larger and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.380 
now the flames are getting larger and
now<00:02:40.350> there<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.800> such<00:02:41.160> forming<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.850> outside

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
now there is such forming on the outside

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:55.110 
now there is such forming on the outside
edges<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.990> can<00:02:43.200> see

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.360 

okay<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.959> flames<00:02:56.200> are<00:02:56.409> getting<00:02:56.680> even<00:02:56.920> larger

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
okay the flames are getting even larger

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.820 
okay the flames are getting even larger
I<00:02:57.519> think<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.150> alcohol<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.870> vaporizing<00:02:59.440> and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
I think the alcohol is vaporizing and

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.380 
I think the alcohol is vaporizing and
getting<00:03:00.069> out<00:03:00.220> through<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.670> holes<00:03:00.909> that<00:03:01.239> the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
getting out through the holes that the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.000 
getting out through the holes that the
wick<00:03:01.599> is<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:02.099> forming<00:03:03.099> Jets<00:03:04.290> more<00:03:05.290> soot<00:03:05.769> is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
wick is in forming Jets more soot is

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:19.530 
wick is in forming Jets more soot is
forming<00:03:06.459> on<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.640> pot

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.640 

there<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.200> have<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.500> 10<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:21.129> 11<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:22.510> 12<00:03:22.840> at<00:03:23.170> seven

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
there we have to 10 to 11 to 12 at seven

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
there we have to 10 to 11 to 12 at seven
thirty<00:03:23.680> nine<00:03:27.900> let's<00:03:28.900> see<00:03:29.079> where<00:03:29.260> run<00:03:29.469> out<00:03:29.500> is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:45.930 

hey<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.939> flames<00:03:34.209> are<00:03:34.450> going<00:03:38.220> going

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:54.990 

so<00:03:46.360> hang<00:03:47.020> it<00:03:47.200> in<00:03:47.320> there

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.040 

come<00:03:55.750> on

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.020 

okay<00:04:04.920> let's<00:04:05.280> call<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:07.040> dead<00:04:08.040> at<00:04:08.310> nine<00:04:08.610> thirty

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:19.550 

nine<00:04:12.030> minutes<00:04:12.480> 30<00:04:12.840> seconds<00:04:14.990> okay<00:04:18.560> surprised

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
nine minutes 30 seconds okay surprised

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.220 
nine minutes 30 seconds okay surprised
that<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.920> got<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.220> water<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.640> boil<00:04:22.700> but<00:04:23.700> I

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
that it got the water to boil but I

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:41.540 
that it got the water to boil but I
think<00:04:25.230> you<00:04:25.320> can<00:04:25.470> see<00:04:26.870> you're<00:04:27.870> quite<00:04:28.380> city

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.740 

okay<00:04:42.120> can<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.420> see<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:44.400> circle<00:04:44.970> on<00:04:45.600> the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
okay can you see that the circle on the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.100 
okay can you see that the circle on the
inside<00:04:46.170> is<00:04:46.500> where<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.610> stove<00:04:48.360> was<00:04:48.660> touching

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
inside is where the stove was touching

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.710 
inside is where the stove was touching
the<00:04:49.230> pot<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.950> course<00:04:50.130> that's<00:04:50.370> clean<00:04:50.760> but

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
the pot so of course that's clean but

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.160 
the pot so of course that's clean but
it's<00:04:51.870> all<00:04:52.080> city<00:04:53.240> around<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.480> outside<00:04:54.930> edges

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
it's all city around the outside edges

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.800 
it's all city around the outside edges
where<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.710> flame<00:04:55.980> came<00:04:56.250> up<00:04:56.430> around<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.390> side

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.920 

so<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:01.140> really<00:05:01.530> don't<00:05:01.710> think<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.810> wicking<00:05:03.810> is

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
so I really don't think that wicking is

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.250 
so I really don't think that wicking is
going<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.170> be<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.440> way<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:05.300> use<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.570> isopropyl

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
going to be the way to use the isopropyl

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:15.460 
going to be the way to use the isopropyl
alcohol<00:05:08.480> good<00:05:09.480> idea<00:05:09.870> but<00:05:11.270> okay<00:05:12.270> recap<00:05:12.840> here

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.020 

this<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.650> my<00:05:18.620> little<00:05:19.620> soda<00:05:19.950> can<00:05:20.220> stove<00:05:20.610> where<00:05:21.000> I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
this is my little soda can stove where I

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.350 
this is my little soda can stove where I
added<00:05:21.510> wicking<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.730> two<00:05:23.730> cups<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.120> water

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
added wicking to it two cups of water

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.330 
added wicking to it two cups of water
starting<00:05:24.810> at<00:05:24.900> about<00:05:24.990> 60<00:05:25.500> degrees<00:05:25.620> room

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
starting at about 60 degrees room

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.130 
starting at about 60 degrees room
temperature<00:05:26.880> 63<00:05:27.740> humidity<00:05:28.740> 58<00:05:29.840> it<00:05:30.840> brought

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
temperature 63 humidity 58 it brought

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.020 
temperature 63 humidity 58 it brought
the<00:05:31.290> water<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.770> boil<00:05:32.070> in<00:05:32.250> seven<00:05:32.670> minutes<00:05:32.820> and

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
the water to a boil in seven minutes and

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.900 
the water to a boil in seven minutes and
39<00:05:33.360> seconds<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.260> then<00:05:34.860> ran<00:05:35.160> out<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.640> nine

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
39 seconds and then ran out in nine

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.200 
39 seconds and then ran out in nine
minutes<00:05:36.180> and<00:05:36.480> 30<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:38.370> last<00:05:38.610> time<00:05:38.880> when<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.120> used

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
minutes and 30 the last time when I used

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.000 
minutes and 30 the last time when I used
denatured<00:05:40.050> alcohol<00:05:42.440> that's<00:05:43.440> interesting

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
denatured alcohol that's interesting

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.960 
denatured alcohol that's interesting
when<00:05:44.700> I<00:05:44.730> use<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:45.060> de<00:05:45.210> natured<00:05:45.540> alcohol

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
when I use the de natured alcohol

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.490 
when I use the de natured alcohol
starting<00:05:47.970> at<00:05:48.060> about<00:05:48.120> 60<00:05:48.660> degrees<00:05:48.750> two<00:05:49.200> cups

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
starting at about 60 degrees two cups

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.950 
starting at about 60 degrees two cups
time<00:05:50.400> to<00:05:50.580> boil<00:05:50.760> with<00:05:51.030> seven<00:05:51.330> minutes<00:05:51.630> and<00:05:51.750> 30

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
time to boil with seven minutes and 30

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.550 
time to boil with seven minutes and 30
seconds<00:05:52.470> so<00:05:52.680> this<00:05:52.860> was<00:05:53.010> about<00:05:53.220> nine<00:05:53.520> minutes

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
seconds so this was about nine minutes

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.440 
seconds so this was about nine minutes
more<00:05:55.560> so<00:05:56.070> that's<00:05:56.280> pretty<00:05:56.490> much<00:05:56.670> the<00:05:56.730> same<00:05:57.120> time

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
more so that's pretty much the same time

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.170 
more so that's pretty much the same time
and<00:05:57.750> run<00:05:58.680> out<00:05:58.830> before<00:05:59.070> on<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.640> denatured

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
and run out before on the denatured

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.630 
and run out before on the denatured
alcohol<00:06:00.300> was<00:06:00.840> ten<00:06:01.110> minutes<00:06:01.470> whereas<00:06:02.220> this<00:06:02.430> was

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
alcohol was ten minutes whereas this was

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.310 
alcohol was ten minutes whereas this was
nine<00:06:02.940> minutes<00:06:03.360> 30<00:06:03.690> seconds<00:06:04.460> so<00:06:05.460> pretty<00:06:05.850> close

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
nine minutes 30 seconds so pretty close

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.000 
nine minutes 30 seconds so pretty close
the<00:06:07.320> only<00:06:07.590> big<00:06:07.800> difference<00:06:08.220> is<00:06:08.370> that<00:06:09.620> the<00:06:10.620> Dean

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
the only big difference is that the Dean

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.260 
the only big difference is that the Dean
ed<00:06:12.140> isopropyl<00:06:13.140> alcohol<00:06:13.790> really<00:06:14.790> set<00:06:15.060> it<00:06:15.150> up

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
ed isopropyl alcohol really set it up

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.420 
ed isopropyl alcohol really set it up
the<00:06:15.420> pot<00:06:17.420> if<00:06:18.420> you<00:06:18.540> don't<00:06:18.720> mind<00:06:18.930> suit<00:06:19.430> that's

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
the pot if you don't mind suit that's

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.890 
the pot if you don't mind suit that's
another<00:06:20.730> way<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:20.970> run<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:22.700> so<00:06:23.700> I<00:06:23.730> thank<00:06:24.180> b'man

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
another way to run it so I thank b'man

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.240 
another way to run it so I thank b'man
715<00:06:25.740> for<00:06:26.010> that<00:06:26.160> idea<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:27.710> always<00:06:28.710> look<00:06:28.980> forward
