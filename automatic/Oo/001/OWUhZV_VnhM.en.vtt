00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
your different HD settings and so it's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.480

would be that the recording mode for

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.870 
would be that the recording mode for
movie<00:04:34.110> mode<00:04:34.320> does<00:04:34.890> stop<00:04:35.280> once<00:04:35.610> or<00:04:35.730> twice
