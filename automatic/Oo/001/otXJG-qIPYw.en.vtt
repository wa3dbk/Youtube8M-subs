00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
alright this is our one room schoolhouse

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.760 
alright this is our one room schoolhouse
demo<00:00:01.829> for<00:00:02.310> math<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:03.149> so<00:00:03.480> soon<00:00:04.140> we<00:00:04.259> have<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> six

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
demo for math and so soon we have a six

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.039 
demo for math and so soon we have a six
year<00:00:04.859> old<00:00:05.009> eight<00:00:05.940> year<00:00:06.210> old<00:00:06.359> nine<00:00:06.600> year<00:00:06.810> old<00:00:06.930> an

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
year old eight year old nine year old an

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:07.880 
year old eight year old nine year old an
eleven<00:00:07.470> year<00:00:07.620> old

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
eleven year old

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.280 
eleven year old
okay<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:08.940> I've<00:00:09.360> written<00:00:09.540> an<00:00:09.719> expression

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
okay and so I've written an expression

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.470 
okay and so I've written an expression
on<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> board<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.010> let<00:00:11.580> everyone<00:00:11.849> copy<00:00:12.240> it

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
on the board and let everyone copy it

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.049 
on the board and let everyone copy it
what<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.750> have<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.139> three<00:00:13.500> open<00:00:14.219> parenthesis<00:00:14.759> 4

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
what we have is three open parenthesis 4

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.980 
what we have is three open parenthesis 4
plus<00:00:15.360> 7<00:00:15.570> close<00:00:16.170> parenthesis<00:00:16.830> minus<00:00:17.279> 3<00:00:17.880> plus<00:00:18.600> 3

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
plus 7 close parenthesis minus 3 plus 3

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.980 
plus 7 close parenthesis minus 3 plus 3
squared<00:00:19.710> times<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.580> thousand<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.330> 0<00:00:21.689> power

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
squared times a thousand to the 0 power

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.040 
squared times a thousand to the 0 power
and<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.519> who<00:00:23.730> knows<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.510> does<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.750> mean<00:00:24.900> when

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
and so who knows what does it mean when

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.500 
and so who knows what does it mean when
I<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.320> three<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:26.340> apprentices<00:00:27.000> beside

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
I have three and then apprentices beside

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.919 
I have three and then apprentices beside
it<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.349> does<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.500> mean<00:00:29.359> it<00:00:30.359> actually<00:00:30.599> means

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it what does that mean it actually means

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.920 
it what does that mean it actually means
x<00:00:31.349> right<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> time<00:00:32.579> sign<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.149> left<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.630> we

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
x right and the time sign is left now we

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.780 
x right and the time sign is left now we
just<00:00:34.110> write<00:00:34.320> three<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.040> then<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.250> parenthesis

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
just write three and then in parenthesis

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.040 
just write three and then in parenthesis
but<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.180> that's<00:00:36.450> what<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.840> means

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
but we know that that's what it means

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.830 
but we know that that's what it means
we're<00:00:37.230> gonna<00:00:37.290> multiply<00:00:37.680> there<00:00:38.570> now<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:39.750> we

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
we're gonna multiply there now when we

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.690 
we're gonna multiply there now when we
have<00:00:39.989> an<00:00:40.170> expression<00:00:40.440> how<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.160> where

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
have an expression how do we know where

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.979 
have an expression how do we know where
do<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.059> start<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.540> start<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
do we start we just start at the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.069 
do we start we just start at the
beginning<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.440> our<00:00:43.770> query<00:00:44.100> across<00:00:44.660> know<00:00:45.660> what

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
beginning of our query across know what

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.650 
beginning of our query across know what
how<00:00:46.289> did<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.500> start<00:00:49.820> order<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.879> operations<00:00:51.449> so

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
how did we start order of operations so

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.689 
how did we start order of operations so
first<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.260> brackets<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.460> them

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
first we have brackets if we have them

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:09.649 
first we have brackets if we have them
and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:55.219> parentheses<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:08.159> then<00:01:08.909> last<00:01:09.210> term

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and then parentheses and then last term

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.890 
and then parentheses and then last term
right<00:01:09.900> okay<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.390> we'll<00:01:12.689> go

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
right okay all right so what we'll go

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.140 
right okay all right so what we'll go
and<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.650> our<00:01:13.799> hierarchy<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.729> what's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and this will be our hierarchy so what's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.140 
and this will be our hierarchy so what's
the<00:01:15.270> first<00:01:15.509> thing<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.810> need<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.320> Kalen

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
the first thing we need to do Kalen

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.399 
the first thing we need to do Kalen
disease<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.570> friend<00:01:18.930> disease<00:01:19.200> first

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
disease you have friend disease first

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.570 
disease you have friend disease first
yeah<00:01:19.650> what's<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> say<00:01:20.159> inside<00:01:20.430> our

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
yeah what's it say inside our

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.190 
yeah what's it say inside our
parentheses<00:01:25.400> 4<00:01:26.400> plus<00:01:26.610> 7<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.030> 11<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.689> write

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
parentheses 4 plus 7 is 11 so we write

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.980 
parentheses 4 plus 7 is 11 so we write
down<00:01:28.340> 11<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.710> we've<00:01:31.710> got<00:01:31.920> 3<00:01:32.810> rewrite<00:01:33.810> our

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
down 11 and we've got 3 rewrite our

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
down 11 and we've got 3 rewrite our
whole<00:01:34.170> expression<00:01:37.280> okay<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.610> gonna

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
whole expression okay what are we gonna

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.319 
whole expression okay what are we gonna
do<00:01:39.030> next<00:01:41.479> we're<00:01:42.479> gonna<00:01:43.549> go<00:01:44.549> ahead<00:01:44.670> take<00:01:45.060> care

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
do next we're gonna go ahead take care

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.740 
do next we're gonna go ahead take care
of<00:01:45.479> our<00:01:48.590> maybe<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.310> 3<00:01:50.579> times<00:01:50.880> 11<00:01:51.390> which

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
of our maybe going to 3 times 11 which

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
of our maybe going to 3 times 11 which
would<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.350> 33<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:58.250> okay<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.490> are<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.640> gonna

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
would be 33 okay okay what are we gonna

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.210 
would be 33 okay okay what are we gonna
do<00:02:00.060> next

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.800 

all<00:02:05.220> right<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.580> what<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.030> what's<00:02:06.540> three

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
all right so what is it what's three

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.370 
all right so what is it what's three
squared

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
squared

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.920 
squared
what<00:02:07.530> does<00:02:07.619> pre-scored<00:02:08.009> mean<00:02:08.810> many<00:02:09.810> times

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
what does pre-scored mean many times

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.150 
what does pre-scored mean many times
right<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.380> three<00:02:13.680> squared<00:02:13.739> means<00:02:14.400> 3<00:02:14.880> times<00:02:15.290> 3<00:02:16.290> 3

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
right so three squared means 3 times 3 3

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.229 
right so three squared means 3 times 3 3
times<00:02:17.250> 3<00:02:21.530> times<00:02:22.530> 3<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.950> 9<00:02:23.130> that's<00:02:23.400> right<00:02:23.700> so

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
times 3 times 3 is 9 that's right so

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.510 
times 3 times 3 is 9 that's right so
let's<00:02:24.540> put<00:02:24.720> 9<00:02:24.989> there<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.650> know<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:26.069> thousands

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
let's put 9 there I know that thousands

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.420 
let's put 9 there I know that thousands
of<00:02:26.610> Vizio<00:02:26.880> powers<00:02:27.830> ok<00:02:28.830> well<00:02:29.040> let's<00:02:29.160> get<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
of Vizio powers ok well let's get to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.110 
of Vizio powers ok well let's get to
that<00:02:29.459> one<00:02:29.760> next

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.220 

all<00:02:33.120> right<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.540> what<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.840> our<00:02:33.900> order<00:02:34.110> of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
all right so what is our order of

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.030 
all right so what is our order of
operations<00:02:34.709> tells<00:02:34.800> me<00:02:35.010> active<00:02:35.340> do<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:37.040> do

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
operations tells me active do you do

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.979 
operations tells me active do you do

thousand<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.830> zero<00:02:41.220> power<00:02:42.050> one<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.319> right

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
thousand to the zero power one is right

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.280 
thousand to the zero power one is right
and<00:02:43.830> what<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.780> how<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:45.959> know<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
and what is how do we know that a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.780 
and what is how do we know that a
thousands<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.800> zero<00:02:47.010> power<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.250> one<00:02:47.550> because

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
thousands of zero power is one because

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
thousands of zero power is one because
anything<00:02:52.880> okay<00:02:53.910> let's<00:02:54.390> rewrite<00:02:54.750> our

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
anything okay let's rewrite our

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.910 
anything okay let's rewrite our
expression<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.720> what<00:02:57.720> do<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.900> do<00:02:58.140> next

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
expression and what do we do next

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.680 
expression and what do we do next
Audrey<00:02:59.640> can<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.940> look<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.330> tell<00:03:00.450> us<00:03:00.510> what<00:03:00.600> we

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
Audrey can you look and tell us what we

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.250 
Audrey can you look and tell us what we
have<00:03:00.840> left<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.230> what<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.470> have<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> do<00:03:01.799> next

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.020 

can<00:03:07.260> we<00:03:07.350> do<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.680> get<00:03:07.950> them<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.579> still<00:03:08.850> have

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
can we do that get them we still have

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.530 
can we do that get them we still have
something<00:03:09.269> that's<00:03:09.510> higher<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.200> list

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
something that's higher up on the list

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.390 
something that's higher up on the list
we<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.570> at<00:03:12.840> times<00:03:13.110> right<00:03:13.769> we<00:03:13.980> have<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.160> times

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
we have at times right we have the times

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.120 
we have at times right we have the times
we<00:03:14.519> have<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.880> first<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.959> what's<00:03:16.260> 9<00:03:16.620> times

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
we have to that first so what's 9 times

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.400 
we have to that first so what's 9 times
1<00:03:17.760> Jeb<00:03:19.609> we<00:03:20.609> have<00:03:20.730> 1<00:03:21.030> 9<00:03:21.329> how<00:03:21.690> much<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:22.019> we<00:03:22.079> have

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
1 Jeb we have 1 9 how much do we have

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.620 
1 Jeb we have 1 9 how much do we have
let's<00:03:23.130> try<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.370> skip<00:03:23.579> out<00:03:23.700> back<00:03:23.910> skip<00:03:24.390> count<00:03:24.600> by

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
let's try to skip out back skip count by

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.310 
let's try to skip out back skip count by
9<00:03:26.450> 1<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.170> that's<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.560> 9<00:03:28.950> okay<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.540> 9<00:03:30.750> times<00:03:31.019> 1<00:03:31.200> is

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
9 1 so that's it 9 okay so 9 times 1 is

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.550 
9 1 so that's it 9 okay so 9 times 1 is
9

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.800 

ok<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.790> now<00:03:36.000> we<00:03:36.660> do<00:03:36.840> 9<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:38.070> 3<00:03:38.430> okay<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.239> now<00:03:39.570> all

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
ok so now we do 9 is 3 okay so now all

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.780 
ok so now we do 9 is 3 okay so now all
we<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.049> left<00:03:40.079> are<00:03:40.470> add<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.920> subtract<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.670> so

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
we have left are add and subtract and so

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.030 
we have left are add and subtract and so
we<00:03:41.940> can<00:03:42.120> just<00:03:42.299> add<00:03:42.480> subtract<00:03:43.140> going<00:03:43.470> from<00:03:43.650> left

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
we can just add subtract going from left

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.020 
we can just add subtract going from left
to<00:03:44.160> right<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.760> what<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.600> 33<00:03:46.350> take<00:03:47.010> away<00:03:47.280> 3<00:03:47.640> and

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.630 

30<00:03:51.030> plus<00:03:51.480> 9<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:54.150> 39<00:03:54.840> good<00:03:55.709> job<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.489> our

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
30 plus 9 is 39 good job so that is our

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.320 
30 plus 9 is 39 good job so that is our
answer<00:03:56.820> we<00:03:57.060> simplify<00:03:57.480> our<00:03:57.540> expression<00:03:57.690> from

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
answer we simplify our expression from

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.260 
answer we simplify our expression from
on<00:03:59.020> order<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.470> operations<00:04:00.010> okay<00:04:00.670> next<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.120> want

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
on order of operations okay next I want

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.320 
on order of operations okay next I want
everybody<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.780> draw<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.940> triangle<00:04:03.940> on<00:04:04.150> your

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
everybody to draw a triangle on your

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.890 
everybody to draw a triangle on your
board

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
board

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.420 
board
when<00:04:05.050> should<00:04:05.200> make<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.500> special<00:04:05.980> triangle

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
when should make the special triangle

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.580 
when should make the special triangle
though<00:04:06.520> I<00:04:06.550> wanted<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.910> be<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.090> right<00:04:07.600> triangle

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
though I wanted to be a right triangle

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.740 
though I wanted to be a right triangle
who<00:04:09.490> knows<00:04:09.730> what<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:09.970> means<00:04:10.180> if<00:04:10.450> we<00:04:10.570> have<00:04:10.600> a

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
who knows what it means if we have a

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.990 
who knows what it means if we have a
right<00:04:11.110> triangle<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.890> has<00:04:12.070> that<00:04:12.280> one<00:04:12.670> right

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
right triangle it has that one right

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.300 
right triangle it has that one right
angle<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.630> has<00:04:13.780> one<00:04:14.170> right<00:04:14.500> angle<00:04:14.710> and<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.100> right

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
angle it has one right angle and a right

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.550 
angle it has one right angle and a right
angle<00:04:15.820> this<00:04:16.420> is<00:04:16.480> like<00:04:16.750> it's<00:04:17.109> like<00:04:17.170> this

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
angle this is like it's like this

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.860 
angle this is like it's like this
degrees<00:04:18.190> perpendicular<00:04:18.730> yeah

can<00:05:22.800> okay<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.460> we're<00:05:24.580> just<00:05:24.700> making<00:05:24.880> up

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
can okay and we're just making up

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.850 
can okay and we're just making up
numbers<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:25.690> I<00:05:25.720> here<00:05:26.050> we're<00:05:26.230> gonna<00:05:26.380> we're

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
numbers so I here we're gonna we're

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.990 
numbers so I here we're gonna we're
gonna<00:05:26.980> put<00:05:27.220> in<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.370> number<00:05:27.460> that's<00:05:27.669> gonna<00:05:27.820> be

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
gonna put in a number that's gonna be

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.820 
gonna put in a number that's gonna be
easy<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.419> I<00:05:28.510> realize<00:05:28.750> this<00:05:28.930> is<00:05:29.080> not<00:05:29.230> actually

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
easy and I realize this is not actually

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.460 
easy and I realize this is not actually
according<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.880> Pythagorean<00:05:31.450> theorem<00:05:31.780> so<00:05:32.020> will

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
according to Pythagorean theorem so will

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.170 
according to Pythagorean theorem so will
this<00:05:32.590> be<00:05:33.280> okay<00:05:33.390> all<00:05:34.390> right<00:05:34.570> so<00:05:35.380> now<00:05:35.620> we<00:05:35.680> have<00:05:36.180> 5

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
this be okay all right so now we have 5

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.300 
this be okay all right so now we have 5
centimeters<00:05:37.900> 8<00:05:38.169> centimeters<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.040> 10

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
centimeters 8 centimeters and 10

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.620 
centimeters 8 centimeters and 10
centimeters<00:05:39.750> okay<00:05:41.520> what<00:05:42.520> is<00:05:42.790> the<00:05:43.030> base<00:05:43.300> of

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
centimeters okay what is the base of

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.760 
centimeters okay what is the base of
this<00:05:43.780> triangle<00:05:44.080> what<00:05:44.320> would<00:05:44.440> you<00:05:44.530> like<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:44.740> use

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
this triangle what would you like to use

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.460 
this triangle what would you like to use
as<00:05:44.979> the<00:05:45.100> base<00:05:45.310> of<00:05:45.340> this<00:05:45.610> triangle<00:05:46.169> okay<00:05:47.169> five

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
as the base of this triangle okay five

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.020 
as the base of this triangle okay five
because<00:05:47.890> right<00:05:48.070> across<00:05:48.220> times<00:05:48.520> let's<00:05:48.790> use

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
because right across times let's use

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.780 
because right across times let's use
five<00:05:49.330> we're<00:05:49.720> gonna<00:05:49.810> figure<00:05:50.020> out<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.350> area<00:05:50.790> so

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
five we're gonna figure out the area so

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:59.640 
five we're gonna figure out the area so
area<00:05:52.530> equals<00:05:53.530> 1/2<00:05:54.540> times<00:05:56.280> five<00:05:57.280> which<00:05:58.150> is<00:05:58.650> our

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
area equals 1/2 times five which is our

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.909 
area equals 1/2 times five which is our
base<00:05:59.950> which<00:06:00.220> is<00:06:00.370> five<00:06:00.580> centimeters<00:06:01.140> times<00:06:02.140> the

let's go ahead and figure out what is
our<00:06:22.530> area<00:06:23.070> area<00:06:23.850> is<00:06:24.120> 1/2<00:06:24.870> times<00:06:25.380> what's<00:06:26.370> 5

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
our area area is 1/2 times what's 5

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.720 
our area area is 1/2 times what's 5
centimeters<00:06:27.570> times<00:06:28.170> 8<00:06:28.560> centimeters<00:06:29.220> so<00:06:29.460> first

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
centimeters times 8 centimeters so first

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.270 
centimeters times 8 centimeters so first
let's<00:06:29.940> just<00:06:30.090> multiply<00:06:30.210> our<00:06:30.540> numbers<00:06:31.020> together

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
let's just multiply our numbers together

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:44.990 
let's just multiply our numbers together
what's<00:06:32.280> 5<00:06:32.610> times<00:06:32.640> 8<00:06:33.600> Kalen<00:06:34.230> do<00:06:34.410> you<00:06:34.500> know<00:06:43.880> 40<00:06:44.880> is

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
what's 5 times 8 Kalen do you know 40 is

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.140 
what's 5 times 8 Kalen do you know 40 is
great<00:06:45.270> good<00:06:45.510> job<00:06:45.540> it's<00:06:46.350> 40<00:06:46.890> and<00:06:47.130> now<00:06:47.460> what<00:06:48.030> is

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
great good job it's 40 and now what is

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.280 
great good job it's 40 and now what is
stimulators<00:06:48.900> times<00:06:49.230> centimeters

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
stimulators times centimeters

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.740 
stimulators times centimeters
centimeters<00:06:52.290> squared<00:06:53.130> that's<00:06:53.490> right<00:06:53.820> now

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
centimeters squared that's right now

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.490 
centimeters squared that's right now
when<00:06:55.200> we<00:06:55.320> have<00:06:55.350> 1/2<00:06:56.130> times<00:06:56.550> 40<00:06:57.200> that's<00:06:58.200> saying

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
when we have 1/2 times 40 that's saying

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:05.270 
when we have 1/2 times 40 that's saying
what<00:06:58.710> is<00:06:58.830> half<00:06:59.190> of<00:06:59.300> 40<00:07:03.710> all<00:07:04.710> right<00:07:04.920> so<00:07:05.160> that's

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
what is half of 40 all right so that's

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.500 
what is half of 40 all right so that's
20<00:07:06.530> centimeters<00:07:07.530> squared<00:07:08.400> and<00:07:09.090> that's<00:07:09.240> the

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
20 centimeters squared and that's the

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.270 
20 centimeters squared and that's the
area<00:07:09.690> of<00:07:09.900> the<00:07:09.990> triangle<00:07:10.230> so<00:07:10.590> generally<00:07:11.010> every

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
area of the triangle so generally every

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.770 
area of the triangle so generally every
day<00:07:11.430> in<00:07:11.580> math<00:07:11.790> we<00:07:11.970> like<00:07:12.120> to<00:07:12.240> go<00:07:12.330> through<00:07:12.570> one

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
day in math we like to go through one

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.810 
day in math we like to go through one
expression<00:07:13.350> how<00:07:13.470> to<00:07:13.530> simplify<00:07:14.100> and<00:07:14.669> then<00:07:14.760> we

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
expression how to simplify and then we

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.440 
expression how to simplify and then we
don't<00:07:14.940> take<00:07:15.180> one<00:07:15.540> geometric<00:07:16.880> shape<00:07:17.880> and<00:07:18.240> we

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
don't take one geometric shape and we

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.750 
don't take one geometric shape and we
work<00:07:18.930> out<00:07:19.110> area<00:07:19.500> or<00:07:19.830> perimeter<00:07:20.100> or<00:07:20.460> something

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
work out area or perimeter or something

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.110 
work out area or perimeter or something
like<00:07:20.850> that

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
like that

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:28.610 
like that
