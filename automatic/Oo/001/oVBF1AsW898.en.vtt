00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello let's make some flowers very 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.160
 simple as you can see with paper that can 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.160
 be lilies or coves that will be worth 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.930
 to decorate the gifts as you see 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.550
 I'm going to start with some white ones with a 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.350
 white paper let's cut first 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.289
 a few squares of the size that you want 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.810
 I kind of do it 8 x 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.890
 8 10 x 10 I did not put it in this you are 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.279
 seeing 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.980
 and now we have to cut this way 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.930
 a kind of beige leaf like that or petal 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.960
 great that if it looks good but it's very 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.620
 easy to do it from a square 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.020
 just go from angle to angle 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.090
 You see what we can do without even 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.520
 draw it or put several sheets together 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.070
 to cut several at a time 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.530
 good second step with a little bit of 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.180
 yellow paper that can be a sheet 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.680
 normal or this one that I'm using myself 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.190
 tissue paper or Chinese paper that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.660
 you call in some places we roll it 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.600
 so that we have a kind 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.070
 of tubito this is going to be the central part 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.390
 of the flower 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.700
 next style 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.510
 Well look, we put it in the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.260
 bottom part of the sheet 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.090
 the sheet of paper I mean it would be 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.590
 respect those of the flower we roll over 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.290
 itself and we bend the tip towards 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.960
 up and now with a stapler what 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.510
 we see you already would be the flower is super 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.140
 easy I'm going to repeat it we put the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.180
 Yellow tube down by bending the tip 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 below so that we have a 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.420
 little open at the top and we fold it 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 Well, here I have two little flowers 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.990
 and we also have other ideas that is 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 do it with a decorated paper with which 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.770
 is decorated by one part is worth so 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.900
 purple concrete from the place of others 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.620
 models we cut the same way of 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.830
 petal 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.070
 and we are going to fold it leaving the part 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.250
 decorated on the outside so that when folded 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:04.530
 appear in the front see you see 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:10.450
 left him behind he placed the pistil in front 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.430
 I fold one part I fold the other clip and I 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.880
 the white flower remains inside and with the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.790
 decorated paper out do you see 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.050
 as many as you need or as you want 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.120
 Now what I'm going to do is the leaves 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.840
 using a green paper if you do not have 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.280
 you can paint one with colors or web like 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.960
 You can also do with fabric 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.490
 what we are doing with people with 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.560
 felt or with eva rubber 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.340
 we cut the same way 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.319
 from before but much smaller 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.390
 and we do now so bend towards 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.450
 in as you are seeing a part of 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.069
 the sheet the bottom part 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.209
 so that it takes a little bit of light from 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.280
 volume and have this form 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.290
 characteristic of the leaves and now the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.690
 we record or paste them at the base of the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.040
 flower we can put one or two I'll do it in 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.040
 flower bouquets so for now 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.629
 I will put one and I will show you the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.190
 different options you can put the 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.930
 flowers two by two three by three 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.900
 how am I doing now you see you place 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.430
 all three the staples and we put over 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.530
 a few leaves so you can not see the 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.170
 staples we can put them together you see 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.550
 to cover everything like a leaf on top 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.080
 with staple or with a little 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.030
 glue as I tell you so you do not 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.020
 see then here I have my bouquets 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.430
 made golden blue flowers and you're 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.989
 purple and red 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.939
 and now I'm going to give you ideas for 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.670
 place them in a box the nicest 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.859
 for me it is to put it in a corner but 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.359
 previously we can put a loop that 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.769
 go a little on fire with the color of 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.599
 our flowers I have this ribbon 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.920
 white paper 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.989
 I'm not going to return them any box 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.689
 I have shoes here and I'm going to paste 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.150
 so you can see an example, you would see 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.090
 so in the corner the red ones for example 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.170
 or any other you can place them 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.790
 as well as I will teach you instead of 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.799
 a bouquet you are placing 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.840
 down all those that you want us 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.819
 is a little longer and the 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.519
 we ended up with a couple of leaves or with 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.169
 one as you want depending also on 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.629
 how big your box or your 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.579
 gift package if konex flowers what 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.409
 better is that the bottom paper is smooth 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.030
 or white for example as you see in 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.469
 kraft color 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.769
 these are the different models that I have 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.769
 made with 2 with 3 a bouquet 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.630
 and well you can also make a bouquet 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.820
 gathering all these flowers doing more 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.560
 I hope you liked the idea and you 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.970
 I leave another couple of ideas to make flowers 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.639
 cardboard with a roll of paper 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.710
 hygienic and paper with doilies for 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.419
 decorate your gifts this is for gas and 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.699
 you know that you can always decorate a 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.820
 package very original up 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.820
 then
