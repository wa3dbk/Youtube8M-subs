alright<00:00:05.130> then<00:00:05.310> this<00:00:05.430> one<00:00:05.609> we're<00:00:05.730> going<00:00:05.819> to

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
alright then this one we're going to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.909 
alright then this one we're going to
talk<00:00:06.089> about<00:00:06.270> tour<00:00:06.720> machines<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.560> will<00:00:07.740> be<00:00:07.890> a

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
talk about tour machines this will be a

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.040 
talk about tour machines this will be a
basic<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.790> quick<00:00:09.030> introduction<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.719> tour

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
basic and quick introduction to tour

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.530 
basic and quick introduction to tour
machines<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:11.519> as<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.880> might<00:00:12.059> not<00:00:12.300> be

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
machines so as you might not be

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.049 
machines so as you might not be
surprised<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.200> hear<00:00:13.290> our<00:00:13.679> machine<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.790> set

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
surprised to hear our machine is a set

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.330 
surprised to hear our machine is a set
of<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.389> pole<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.380> that's<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.980> kind<00:00:23.250> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
of two pole so a and that's just kind of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
of two pole so a and that's just kind of
a<00:00:23.460> long-winded<00:00:23.730> way<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.269> saying<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.900> got

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
a long-winded way of saying it's got

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.580 
a long-winded way of saying it's got
seven<00:00:25.500> parts<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> first<00:00:27.240> part<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> Q<00:00:28.019> which

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
seven parts so the first part is Q which

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.519 
seven parts so the first part is Q which
is<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> finite<00:00:29.220> set<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.640> states<00:00:30.289> this<00:00:31.289> should

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
is the finite set of states this should

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.360 
is the finite set of states this should
sound<00:00:31.800> familiar<00:00:32.960> because<00:00:33.960> every<00:00:34.800> model<00:00:35.250> we've

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
sound familiar because every model we've

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.370 
sound familiar because every model we've
looked<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:35.969> far<00:00:36.000> has<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.690> finite<00:00:36.960> set<00:00:37.350> of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
looked at so far has a finite set of

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.130 
looked at so far has a finite set of
states<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.850> other<00:00:39.000> thing<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> has<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.809> an

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
states the other thing it has is an

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.060 
states the other thing it has is an
input<00:00:40.649> alphabet<00:00:41.190> Sigma<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:45.920> just<00:00:46.920> like

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
input alphabet Sigma and just like

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.690 
input alphabet Sigma and just like
before<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.640> input<00:00:48.360> alphabet<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.020> finite

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
before the input alphabet is finite

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.000 
before the input alphabet is finite
however<00:00:50.700> we're<00:00:51.360> gonna<00:00:51.449> make<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.079> special<00:00:52.500> rule

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
however we're gonna make a special rule

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
however we're gonna make a special rule
about<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> input<00:00:53.879> alphabet<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.510> we're<00:00:54.629> gonna

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
about the input alphabet and we're gonna

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.779 
about the input alphabet and we're gonna
say<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.140> input<00:00:55.289> alphabet<00:00:55.800> does<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.370> contain

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
say the input alphabet does not contain

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.360 
say the input alphabet does not contain
the<00:00:56.850> blank<00:00:57.210> symbol<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.500> blank<00:00:58.770> symbol<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the blank symbol the blank symbol is a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.040 
the blank symbol the blank symbol is a
symbol<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> appears<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> tape<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
symbol that appears on the tape when the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
symbol that appears on the tape when the
Turing<00:01:01.379> machine<00:01:01.410> begins<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.910> we're<00:01:03.120> gonna

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
Turing machine begins and we're gonna

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.299 
Turing machine begins and we're gonna
say<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> blank<00:01:04.170> symbol<00:01:04.379> cannot<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:05.010> part

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
say that the blank symbol cannot be part

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.000 
say that the blank symbol cannot be part
of<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.790> input<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> blank<00:01:07.530> symbol<00:01:10.010> looks

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
of the input so the blank symbol looks

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.719 
of the input so the blank symbol looks
like<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:15.890> that's<00:01:16.890> kind<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> confusing

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
like this this that's kind of confusing

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.270 
like this this that's kind of confusing
but<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:19.950> guy<00:01:20.100> right

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
but this little this little guy right

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.370 
but this little this little guy right
here<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> blank<00:01:21.030> symbol<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:22.170> we're<00:01:22.290> gonna

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
here is the blank symbol so we're gonna

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.960 
here is the blank symbol so we're gonna
say<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> our<00:01:22.860> name<00:01:23.009> put<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.640> cannot

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
say that our name put out that cannot

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.660 
say that our name put out that cannot
contain<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> blank<00:01:24.750> symbol<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.490> we're

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
contain the blank symbol and then we're

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.130 
contain the blank symbol and then we're
gonna<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.970> another<00:01:27.210> thing<00:01:27.479> called<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> tape

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
gonna have another thing called the tape

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
gonna have another thing called the tape
alphabet<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:29.250> gonna<00:01:29.340> represent<00:01:29.790> that

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
alphabet we're gonna represent that

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.190 
alphabet we're gonna represent that
using<00:01:30.479> gamma<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.280> gamma<00:01:32.780> contains<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
using gamma and the gamma contains the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.569 
using gamma and the gamma contains the
blank<00:01:34.829> symbol<00:01:35.150> but<00:01:36.150> gamma<00:01:36.979> also<00:01:37.979> contains<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
blank symbol but gamma also contains the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.330 
blank symbol but gamma also contains the
input<00:01:38.909> alphabet<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> subset<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.159> is

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
input alphabet as a subset so this is

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.420 
input alphabet as a subset so this is
the<00:01:41.549> tape<00:01:41.820> alphabet<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:48.119> blank<00:01:48.600> symbol

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
the tape alphabet and the blank symbol

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.590 
the tape alphabet and the blank symbol
is<00:01:50.430> an<00:01:50.700> element<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> tape<00:01:51.720> alphabet<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
is an element of the tape alphabet and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.740 
is an element of the tape alphabet and
Sigma<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> subset<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.880> but<00:01:56.880> can't<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.329> equal

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
Sigma is a subset of but can't be equal

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.160 
Sigma is a subset of but can't be equal
to<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:59.100> tape<00:01:59.340> alphabet<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.990> think

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
to the tape alphabet so if you think

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.709 
to the tape alphabet so if you think
about<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.710> Sigma<00:02:02.520> cannot<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.060> equal<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
about it Sigma cannot be equal to the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.929 
about it Sigma cannot be equal to the
tape<00:02:03.930> alphabet<00:02:04.130> because<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.460> blank<00:02:05.670> symbol

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
tape alphabet because the blank symbol

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.600 
tape alphabet because the blank symbol
has<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> tape<00:02:06.899> off<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
has to be in the tape off of it and the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.040 
has to be in the tape off of it and the
blank<00:02:08.819> symbol<00:02:09.060> cannot<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> input

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
blank symbol cannot be in the input

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.300 
blank symbol cannot be in the input
alphabet<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.950> has

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
alphabet so this has

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.160 
alphabet so this has
be<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> subset<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.090> because<00:02:12.930> gamma

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
be a subset of that because gamma

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.620 
be a subset of that because gamma
contains<00:02:13.709> at<00:02:13.860> least<00:02:13.950> one<00:02:14.160> symbol<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:15.150> Sigma

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
contains at least one symbol that Sigma

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.110 
contains at least one symbol that Sigma
does<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.989> contain<00:02:16.849> okay<00:02:17.849> when<00:02:18.000> you're

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
does not contain okay when you're

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.280 
does not contain okay when you're
learning<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.420> new<00:02:18.569> model<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.930> computation

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
learning a new model of computation

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.809 
learning a new model of computation
there's<00:02:19.830> two<00:02:20.010> things<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.459> want<00:02:20.489> to<00:02:20.700> pay

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
there's two things you want to pay

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.910 
there's two things you want to pay
attention<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.110> first<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.650> how<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
attention to the first one is how do you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.460 
attention to the first one is how do you
make<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.130> transition<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.390> second<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.050> what

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
make a transition the second one is what

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.559 
make a transition the second one is what
does<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.770> mean<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.069> accept<00:02:26.420> everything<00:02:27.420> else

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
does it mean to accept everything else

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.300 
does it mean to accept everything else
is<00:02:27.750> pretty<00:02:27.989> vanilla<00:02:28.230> between<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> different

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
is pretty vanilla between the different

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.000 
is pretty vanilla between the different
models<00:02:30.410> except<00:02:31.410> for<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.739> Turing

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
models except for with the Turing

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530 
models except for with the Turing
machine<00:02:32.040> there's<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.580> little<00:02:32.849> bit<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.030> subtlety

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
machine there's a little bit of subtlety

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.570 
machine there's a little bit of subtlety
with<00:02:33.810> Sigma<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.260> gap<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.099> don't<00:02:35.459> think

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
with Sigma and gap of it I don't think

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.300 
with Sigma and gap of it I don't think
you're<00:02:35.880> gonna<00:02:36.000> get<00:02:36.180> blown<00:02:36.420> away<00:02:36.660> by<00:02:36.840> now<00:02:37.310> so

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
you're gonna get blown away by now so

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.580 
you're gonna get blown away by now so
the<00:02:39.000> transition<00:02:40.880> relation<00:02:41.880> was<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.720> so

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the transition relation was like this so

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.039 
the transition relation was like this so
when<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.830> make<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> transition<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:45.750> take<00:02:46.019> a

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
when you make a transition you take a

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.539 
when you make a transition you take a
current<00:02:46.440> state<00:02:47.720> together<00:02:48.720> with<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:50.040> letter

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
current state together with a letter

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.509 
current state together with a letter
from<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.060> tape<00:02:51.299> alphabet<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.319> then<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.280> go

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
from the tape alphabet and then you go

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.620 
from the tape alphabet and then you go
to<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:55.620> next<00:02:55.890> state<00:02:56.250> together<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.299> letter

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
to the next state together with a letter

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.680 
to the next state together with a letter
from<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.080> tape<00:02:58.290> alphabet<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:59.540> then<00:03:00.540> you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
from the tape alphabet and then you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.199 
from the tape alphabet and then you
either<00:03:00.840> move<00:03:01.170> left<00:03:01.500> or<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.250> move<00:03:02.459> right<00:03:03.560> so

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
either move left or you move right so

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.789 
either move left or you move right so
what<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.330> transition<00:03:06.900> function<00:03:07.110> describes

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
what the transition function describes

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.570 
what the transition function describes
is<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.700> start<00:03:09.000> off<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.420> some<00:03:09.690> state<00:03:10.580> and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
is that you start off in some state and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.699 
is that you start off in some state and
you're<00:03:11.760> looking<00:03:12.120> at<00:03:12.209> some<00:03:12.480> letter<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:13.440> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
you're looking at some letter on the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.190 
you're looking at some letter on the
tape<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.280> Turing<00:03:14.640> machine<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.239> then<00:03:16.109> you

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
tape of the Turing machine and then you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.920 
tape of the Turing machine and then you
take<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> transition<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.160> another<00:03:17.280> state<00:03:17.930> and

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
take a transition to another state and

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.699 
take a transition to another state and
then<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.920> write<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.459> letter<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.500> write

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
then you write this letter so you write

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.560 
then you write this letter so you write
this<00:03:22.890> letter<00:03:22.950> over<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.880> top<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.390> letter

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
this letter over the top of the letter

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.199 
this letter over the top of the letter
that<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.840> saw<00:03:25.109> as<00:03:25.170> input<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.670> then<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.910> final

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
that you saw as input and then the final

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.979 
that you saw as input and then the final
thing<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.450> do<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.170> move<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.470> tape<00:03:29.430> head

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.620 

so<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.880> significant<00:03:35.880> feature<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.390> the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
so this is a significant feature of the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.870 
so this is a significant feature of the
Turing<00:03:36.900> machine<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.430> remember<00:03:38.850> a

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
Turing machine so if you remember a

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.940 
Turing machine so if you remember a
deterministic<00:03:39.569> finite<00:03:39.780> automaton<00:03:40.170> has<00:03:40.530> no

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
deterministic finite automaton has no

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.280 
deterministic finite automaton has no
auxilary<00:03:41.819> memory<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.690> remembers<00:03:42.930> what

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
auxilary memory it just remembers what

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.220 
auxilary memory it just remembers what
state<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:44.299> pushdown<00:03:45.299> automaton<00:03:45.900> has<00:03:46.200> a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
state it's in pushdown automaton has a

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.129 
state it's in pushdown automaton has a
stack<00:03:46.709> as<00:03:47.069> its<00:03:47.489> memory<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.810> play<00:03:48.989> around

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
stack as its memory so I can play around

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.900 
stack as its memory so I can play around
with<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.560> symbol<00:03:49.950> at<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.160> top<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.639> stack

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
with the symbol at the top of the stack

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.360 
with the symbol at the top of the stack
the<00:03:51.840> Turing<00:03:52.109> machine<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.739> other<00:03:52.859> hand<00:03:53.160> has

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
the Turing machine on the other hand has

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.270 
the Turing machine on the other hand has
a<00:03:53.400> tape<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.299> represent<00:03:54.840> its<00:03:55.019> memory<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.650> it

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
a tape to represent its memory and it

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.979 
a tape to represent its memory and it
can<00:03:56.430> move<00:03:56.609> around<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.150> tape<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.690> can<00:03:57.810> write

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
can move around the tape it can write

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.809 
can move around the tape it can write
things<00:03:58.260> over<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.620> tape<00:03:58.829> you<00:03:59.010> can<00:03:59.160> go<00:03:59.310> left<00:03:59.519> it

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
things over the tape you can go left it

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.390 
things over the tape you can go left it
can<00:03:59.940> go<00:04:00.090> right<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> Turing<00:04:01.680> machine<00:04:01.709> has<00:04:02.370> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
can go right so a Turing machine has a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.569 
can go right so a Turing machine has a
very<00:04:02.940> general<00:04:03.510> model<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.200> memory<00:04:04.579> it's

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
very general model of memory it's

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.520 
very general model of memory it's
essentially<00:04:06.209> are<00:04:06.329> a<00:04:06.359> sequential<00:04:07.049> access

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
essentially are a sequential access

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.069 
essentially are a sequential access
memory<00:04:08.060> meaning<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.329> you<00:04:09.569> can<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:09.900> access

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
memory meaning that you can just access

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.890 
memory meaning that you can just access
things<00:04:10.620> sequentially<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.609> time<00:04:11.850> so<00:04:12.660> it's<00:04:12.780> like

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
things sequentially in time so it's like

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.830 
things sequentially in time so it's like
a<00:04:12.930> VCR<00:04:13.350> tape<00:04:13.769> or<00:04:14.100> an<00:04:14.310> old<00:04:14.459> cassette<00:04:14.850> tape<00:04:15.150> you

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
a VCR tape or an old cassette tape you

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.750 
a VCR tape or an old cassette tape you
can<00:04:16.019> access<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.919> contents<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.549> tape

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
can access the contents of tape

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.930 
can access the contents of tape
sequentially<00:04:18.450> in<00:04:19.010> terms<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.159> performance<00:04:20.729> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
sequentially in terms of performance the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.700 
sequentially in terms of performance the
fact<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.269> it's<00:04:21.450> sequential<00:04:21.959> access<00:04:22.349> and<00:04:22.590> not

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
fact that it's sequential access and not

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.800 
fact that it's sequential access and not
random<00:04:23.070> acts

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
random acts

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.470 
random acts
matters<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.770> little<00:04:25.340> bit<00:04:25.550> but<00:04:25.910> in<00:04:26.030> terms<00:04:26.270> of

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
matters a little bit but in terms of

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.960 
matters a little bit but in terms of
what<00:04:26.690> problems<00:04:27.230> with<00:04:27.380> canna<00:04:27.650> can't<00:04:27.980> solve<00:04:28.250> the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
what problems with canna can't solve the

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.730 
what problems with canna can't solve the
fact<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:29.390> sequential<00:04:29.810> access<00:04:30.350> versus

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
fact that a sequential access versus

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.960 
fact that a sequential access versus
random<00:04:31.070> access<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.670> completely<00:04:32.150> irrelevant

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
random access is completely irrelevant

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.210 
random access is completely irrelevant
okay<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.630> that's<00:04:36.110> four<00:04:36.500> out<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:37.010> seven

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
okay so the that's four out of the seven

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.840 
okay so the that's four out of the seven
so<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.940> final<00:04:38.360> three<00:04:38.630> three<00:04:39.290> things<00:04:39.620> are<00:04:40.010> that

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
so the final three three things are that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.660 
so the final three three things are that
it's<00:04:41.030> got<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.270> start<00:04:41.630> state<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.770> it's<00:04:42.920> got<00:04:43.070> a<00:04:43.100> q0

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
it's got a start state so it's got a q0

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.370 
it's got a start state so it's got a q0
which<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> number<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.660> Q<00:04:44.960> which<00:04:45.170> is<00:04:45.200> the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
which is a number of Q which is the

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.890 
which is a number of Q which is the
start<00:04:45.800> date<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.400> other<00:04:47.240> thing<00:04:47.540> it's<00:04:47.690> got

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
start date the other thing it's got

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.590 
start date the other thing it's got
which<00:04:48.260> is<00:04:48.440> maybe<00:04:48.710> not<00:04:48.800> too<00:04:49.190> surprising<00:04:49.820> is<00:04:50.060> an

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
which is maybe not too surprising is an

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.720 
which is maybe not too surprising is an
accepting<00:04:51.110> state<00:04:51.410> so<00:04:51.890> it<00:04:51.980> has<00:04:52.130> Q<00:04:52.430> accept<00:04:54.730> which

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
accepting state so it has Q accept which

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.700 
accepting state so it has Q accept which
is<00:04:55.910> a<00:04:55.940> member<00:04:56.360> of<00:04:56.390> the<00:04:56.630> states<00:04:56.960> so<00:04:57.380> that's<00:04:57.560> the

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
is a member of the states so that's the

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.880 
is a member of the states so that's the
accepting<00:04:58.190> state<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:59.420> we've<00:04:59.570> got<00:04:59.780> 1<00:05:00.530> 2<00:05:00.560> 3<00:05:01.300> 4<00:05:02.300> 5<00:05:02.900> 6

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
accepting state so we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:10.620 
accepting state so we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6
so<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.400> final<00:05:04.820> thing<00:05:05.000> we<00:05:05.150> need<00:05:05.390> is<00:05:06.050> Q<00:05:06.590> reject

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.720 

so<00:05:11.630> Q<00:05:11.960> reject<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.620> member<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.430> States

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
so Q reject is a member of the States

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.050 
so Q reject is a member of the States
and<00:05:14.030> it's<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.300> special<00:05:14.780> state<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:16.060> represents

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
and it's a special state that represents

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.700 
and it's a special state that represents
the<00:05:17.180> fact<00:05:17.420> that<00:05:17.540> the<00:05:17.690> machine<00:05:18.020> rejected<00:05:18.590> the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
the fact that the machine rejected the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.850 
the fact that the machine rejected the
input<00:05:19.510> in<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.750> deterministic<00:05:21.650> finite

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
input in a deterministic finite

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.760 
input in a deterministic finite
automaton<00:05:22.280> or<00:05:22.790> a<00:05:22.850> pushdown<00:05:23.150> automaton<00:05:23.930> we

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
automaton or a pushdown automaton we

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.040 
automaton or a pushdown automaton we
implicitly<00:05:25.310> got<00:05:25.580> rejection<00:05:26.030> by<00:05:26.480> saying<00:05:26.840> that

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
implicitly got rejection by saying that

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.690 
implicitly got rejection by saying that
I'll<00:05:27.200> tell<00:05:27.380> you<00:05:27.440> what<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.830> accept<00:05:28.220> states<00:05:28.490> are

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
I'll tell you what the accept states are

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.420 
I'll tell you what the accept states are
and<00:05:28.970> if<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:29.990> ends<00:05:30.350> in<00:05:30.410> any<00:05:30.620> other<00:05:30.830> state<00:05:31.190> that

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
and if it ends in any other state that

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.030 
and if it ends in any other state that
are<00:05:31.760> rejected<00:05:32.060> or<00:05:32.540> it<00:05:32.660> didn't<00:05:32.870> accept<00:05:33.230> but<00:05:33.950> in

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
are rejected or it didn't accept but in

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.760 
are rejected or it didn't accept but in
a<00:05:34.130> Turing<00:05:34.460> machine<00:05:34.960> it's<00:05:35.960> helpful<00:05:36.260> to<00:05:36.440> define

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
a Turing machine it's helpful to define

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.640 
a Turing machine it's helpful to define
a<00:05:37.340> rejection<00:05:37.850> state<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:38.750> an<00:05:39.140> acceptance

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
a rejection state and an acceptance

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.580 
a rejection state and an acceptance
state<00:05:40.570> and<00:05:41.570> so<00:05:42.140> we<00:05:42.410> do<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.770> right<00:05:43.370> here<00:05:44.590> okay

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
state and so we do that right here okay

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.680 
state and so we do that right here okay
so<00:05:45.800> that's<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.490> basic<00:05:46.850> definition<00:05:47.000> of<00:05:47.570> a

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
so that's the basic definition of a

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.540 
so that's the basic definition of a
Turing<00:05:47.990> machine<00:05:48.020> this<00:05:48.770> is<00:05:48.980> the<00:05:49.130> seventh

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
Turing machine this is the seventh

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.910 
Turing machine this is the seventh
element<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:51.110> thing<00:05:51.290> I<00:05:51.380> want<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.620> do<00:05:51.740> now<00:05:51.890> is

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
element the thing I want to do now is

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.910 
element the thing I want to do now is
draw<00:05:52.430> a<00:05:52.460> schematic<00:05:53.090> diagram<00:05:53.650> well<00:05:54.650> like<00:05:54.890> a

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
draw a schematic diagram well like a

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.760 
draw a schematic diagram well like a
block<00:05:55.220> diagram<00:05:55.460> of<00:05:55.790> a<00:05:55.910> Turing<00:05:56.150> machine<00:05:56.450> and

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
block diagram of a Turing machine and

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.810 
block diagram of a Turing machine and
let's<00:05:57.770> look<00:05:57.860> at<00:05:58.010> you<00:05:58.130> thinking<00:05:58.280> about<00:05:58.550> the

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
let's look at you thinking about the

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:08.050 
let's look at you thinking about the
configuration<00:05:59.150> of<00:05:59.720> the<00:05:59.840> Turing<00:06:00.080> machine

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.129 

okay<00:06:09.060> so<00:06:09.120> a<00:06:09.539> Turing<00:06:09.870> machine<00:06:09.930> has<00:06:10.759> a<00:06:12.139> little

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
okay so a Turing machine has a little

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.499 
okay so a Turing machine has a little
control<00:06:13.650> thingy<00:06:13.979> that's<00:06:14.879> basically<00:06:15.270> what

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
control thingy that's basically what

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.339 
control thingy that's basically what
state<00:06:15.810> is<00:06:15.990> then<00:06:16.259> it's<00:06:17.129> got<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.370> tape<00:06:18.080> so<00:06:19.080> the

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
state is then it's got a tape so the

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:25.540 
state is then it's got a tape so the
tape<00:06:21.319> that<00:06:22.319> starts<00:06:22.680> off<00:06:22.860> with<00:06:23.099> the<00:06:23.250> contents

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
tape that starts off with the contents

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.339 
tape that starts off with the contents
so<00:06:26.550> this<00:06:26.699> particular<00:06:26.909> tape<00:06:27.659> contains<00:06:28.169> the

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
so this particular tape contains the

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.589 
so this particular tape contains the
words<00:06:28.530> cat<00:06:28.830> followed<00:06:29.759> by<00:06:29.909> a<00:06:29.940> bunch<00:06:30.150> of<00:06:30.330> blank

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
words cat followed by a bunch of blank

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.960 
words cat followed by a bunch of blank
symbols<00:06:31.050> and<00:06:31.860> when<00:06:32.129> we<00:06:32.250> draw<00:06:32.460> these<00:06:32.669> things

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
symbols and when we draw these things

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.820 
symbols and when we draw these things
what<00:06:33.210> we<00:06:33.360> usually<00:06:33.720> would<00:06:33.870> draw<00:06:34.110> is<00:06:34.440> a<00:06:34.470> little

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
what we usually would draw is a little

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.029 
what we usually would draw is a little
arrow<00:06:35.099> with<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:36.169> line<00:06:37.169> of<00:06:37.199> the<00:06:37.500> Naro<00:06:37.710> on<00:06:37.889> it

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
arrow with the line of the Naro on it

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.010 
arrow with the line of the Naro on it
that<00:06:38.789> would<00:06:38.940> tell<00:06:39.120> us<00:06:39.150> what<00:06:39.449> symbol<00:06:39.870> we're

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
that would tell us what symbol we're

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.809 
that would tell us what symbol we're
looking<00:06:40.319> at<00:06:40.469> and<00:06:40.710> instead<00:06:41.159> of<00:06:41.219> just<00:06:41.340> drawing<00:06:41.639> a

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
looking at and instead of just drawing a

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.869 
looking at and instead of just drawing a
generic<00:06:42.210> Q<00:06:42.539> here<00:06:42.780> we'd<00:06:43.710> want<00:06:44.669> to<00:06:44.759> pay

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:44.879 
generic Q here we'd want to pay

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:46.820 
generic Q here we'd want to pay
attention<00:06:45.120> to<00:06:45.330> what<00:06:45.599> state<00:06:45.930> the<00:06:46.229> thing<00:06:46.469> starts

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
attention to what state the thing starts

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.309 
attention to what state the thing starts
off<00:06:47.009> in<00:06:47.250> so<00:06:47.940> this<00:06:48.090> particular<00:06:48.330> Turing<00:06:48.990> machine

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 
off in so this particular Turing machine

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.170 
off in so this particular Turing machine
is<00:06:49.349> in<00:06:49.770> a<00:06:49.860> configuration<00:06:50.219> where<00:06:50.849> it's<00:06:51.000> in

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
is in a configuration where it's in

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.980 
is in a configuration where it's in
state<00:06:51.449> q0<00:06:51.949> looking<00:06:52.949> at<00:06:53.069> the<00:06:53.190> word<00:06:53.340> cat<00:06:53.610> and<00:06:53.990> the

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
state q0 looking at the word cat and the

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.779 
state q0 looking at the word cat and the
head<00:06:55.199> is<00:06:55.409> looking<00:06:55.740> at<00:06:55.860> the<00:06:56.009> C<00:06:56.250> right<00:06:56.490> there

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
head is looking at the C right there

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.659 
head is looking at the C right there
it's<00:06:57.750> convenient<00:06:58.139> to<00:06:58.409> have<00:06:58.590> a<00:06:58.620> shorter<00:06:59.340> way<00:06:59.490> of

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
it's convenient to have a shorter way of

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.700 
it's convenient to have a shorter way of
expressing<00:07:00.090> the<00:07:00.479> configuration<00:07:01.259> of<00:07:01.379> a<00:07:01.469> Turing

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
expressing the configuration of a Turing

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.129 
expressing the configuration of a Turing
machine<00:07:01.770> and<00:07:02.400> so<00:07:03.060> this<00:07:03.419> is<00:07:03.569> how<00:07:03.750> we<00:07:03.810> would

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
machine and so this is how we would

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:05.749 
machine and so this is how we would
write<00:07:04.500> down<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.860> configuration<00:07:05.550> of<00:07:05.639> this

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
write down the configuration of this

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:12.200 
write down the configuration of this
machine<00:07:06.150> we<00:07:06.360> write<00:07:06.539> down<00:07:06.719> to<00:07:06.870> c<00:07:07.520> q0<00:07:08.520> a<00:07:09.590> t<00:07:10.699> so<00:07:11.699> by

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
machine we write down to c q0 a t so by

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.899 
machine we write down to c q0 a t so by
convention<00:07:13.009> we're<00:07:14.009> just<00:07:14.219> gonna<00:07:14.400> write<00:07:14.699> down

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:14.909 
convention we're just gonna write down

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.320 
convention we're just gonna write down
the<00:07:15.659> name<00:07:15.930> of<00:07:15.960> the<00:07:16.139> state<00:07:16.560> to<00:07:17.520> the<00:07:17.669> right<00:07:17.940> of

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
the name of the state to the right of

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.420 
the name of the state to the right of
the<00:07:18.960> letter<00:07:19.199> that<00:07:19.349> we're<00:07:19.680> currently<00:07:19.860> looking

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
the letter that we're currently looking

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.809 
the letter that we're currently looking
at

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 
at

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.120 
at
so<00:07:21.419> since<00:07:21.630> I'm<00:07:21.779> looking<00:07:21.900> at<00:07:22.169> a<00:07:22.199> C<00:07:22.560> I'm<00:07:22.919> going<00:07:23.039> to

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130 
so since I'm looking at a C I'm going to

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.800 
so since I'm looking at a C I'm going to
write<00:07:23.279> down<00:07:23.310> the<00:07:23.610> name<00:07:23.789> of<00:07:23.819> the<00:07:24.060> state<00:07:24.360> to<00:07:24.690> the

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810 
write down the name of the state to the

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.230 
write down the name of the state to the
right<00:07:25.020> of<00:07:25.259> that<00:07:25.409> C<00:07:25.740> and<00:07:26.490> this<00:07:26.729> tells<00:07:26.969> me<00:07:27.090> that

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
right of that C and this tells me that

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.200 
right of that C and this tells me that
I'm<00:07:27.599> looking<00:07:27.719> at<00:07:27.960> cat<00:07:28.289> on<00:07:28.590> the<00:07:28.800> tape<00:07:29.039> I'm<00:07:30.000> in

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
I'm looking at cat on the tape I'm in

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.300 
I'm looking at cat on the tape I'm in
state<00:07:30.419> q0<00:07:30.750> and<00:07:31.349> I'm<00:07:31.500> looking<00:07:31.830> at<00:07:31.949> the<00:07:32.069> C

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.310 
state q0 and I'm looking at the C

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.730 
state q0 and I'm looking at the C
because<00:07:32.909> the<00:07:33.090> state<00:07:33.419> is<00:07:34.229> written<00:07:34.560> to<00:07:34.710> the

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
because the state is written to the

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.209 
because the state is written to the
right<00:07:34.830> of<00:07:35.219> the<00:07:35.310> ladder<00:07:35.490> I'm<00:07:35.699> looking<00:07:36.000> at

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:37.219 
right of the ladder I'm looking at

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.469 
right of the ladder I'm looking at
something<00:07:38.219> you<00:07:38.430> need<00:07:38.580> to<00:07:38.699> catch<00:07:38.909> is<00:07:39.270> that

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 
something you need to catch is that

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:40.999 
something you need to catch is that
there's<00:07:39.659> two<00:07:39.810> things<00:07:39.840> going<00:07:40.199> on<00:07:40.529> here<00:07:40.590> there's

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:41.009 
there's two things going on here there's

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.219 
there's two things going on here there's
something<00:07:41.190> called<00:07:41.430> the<00:07:41.639> state<00:07:41.940> of<00:07:42.810> the<00:07:42.960> Turing

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:43.229 
something called the state of the Turing

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:44.480 
something called the state of the Turing
machine<00:07:43.560> and<00:07:43.860> then<00:07:44.129> there's<00:07:44.310> something

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:44.490 
machine and then there's something

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.240 
machine and then there's something
called<00:07:44.669> the<00:07:45.000> configuration<00:07:45.930> of<00:07:46.199> the<00:07:47.009> torah'

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.250 
called the configuration of the torah'

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.820 
called the configuration of the torah'
machine<00:07:47.750> so<00:07:48.750> the<00:07:48.870> state<00:07:49.199> of<00:07:49.229> the<00:07:49.560> Turing

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:49.830 
machine so the state of the Turing

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.830 
machine so the state of the Turing
machine<00:07:50.750> simply<00:07:52.729> what<00:07:53.729> state<00:07:54.120> the<00:07:54.539> Turing

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 
machine simply what state the Turing

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.230 
machine simply what state the Turing
machine<00:07:55.139> is<00:07:55.169> in<00:07:55.469> it's<00:07:55.889> a<00:07:56.039> member<00:07:56.340> of<00:07:56.430> Q<00:07:56.729> in<00:07:57.000> this

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 
machine is in it's a member of Q in this

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.990 
machine is in it's a member of Q in this
