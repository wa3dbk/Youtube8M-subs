00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
paint and you cover it up and we spend a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.230 
paint and you cover it up and we spend a
lot<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.369> money<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.880> thing<00:01:18.090> looking

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
lot of money to get this thing looking

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.510 
lot of money to get this thing looking
right<00:01:18.740> but<00:01:19.740> which<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> bring<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
right but which it was time to bring the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.100 
right but which it was time to bring the
black<00:01:20.700> back<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.299> give<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> different<00:01:21.750> look

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
black back and give it a different look

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
black back and give it a different look
tried<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.650> bring<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> white<00:01:23.130> wore<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
tried to bring the white wore it out and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.929 
tried to bring the white wore it out and
we<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.200> some<00:01:25.350> different<00:01:25.680> finishes<00:01:25.979> Kenny's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
we use some different finishes Kenny's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.910 
we use some different finishes Kenny's
really<00:01:27.509> good<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.530> think

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
really good at that and I think

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
really good at that and I think
something<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.430> did<00:01:29.579> differently<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.119> year

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
something we did differently this year

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
something we did differently this year
is<00:01:30.450> inside<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> arc<00:01:31.140> where<00:01:31.350> you'll<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.890> able

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
is inside the arc where you'll be able

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.340 
is inside the arc where you'll be able
to<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> video<00:01:32.610> we've<00:01:33.360> put<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> darker

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to see on the video we've put a darker

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
to see on the video we've put a darker
natural<00:01:34.799> stain<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> same

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
natural stain and then and then the same

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.149 
natural stain and then and then the same
thing<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> SoCon<00:01:37.350> logo<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> paint

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
thing with the SoCon logo in the paint

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.280 
thing with the SoCon logo in the paint
so<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.670> think<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> clean<00:01:39.930> look<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
so I think it's got a clean look a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.889 
so I think it's got a clean look a
modern<00:01:40.619> look<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.759> floor<00:01:42.000> plays<00:01:42.270> great<00:01:42.659> it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
legs when I was coaching in my mid 40s

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.380 
legs when I was coaching in my mid 40s
or<00:01:52.409> actually<00:01:53.189> even<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.549> my<00:01:53.640> late<00:01:53.790> 30s<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.329> was
