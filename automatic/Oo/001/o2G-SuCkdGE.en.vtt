00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 as we know every year in the week 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.950
 santa millions of children love each other 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.330
 resurrection Sunday to search 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.160
 chocolate eggs that the rabbit of 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.320
 Easter has left them in other words 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.120
 a giant rabbit with humanoid form 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950
 imaginary hands out chocolate eggs 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.420
 decorated with metal wrappers that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.699
 they are bought in supermarkets to 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.439
 celebrate the resurrection of Jesus to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.160
 who can think of these stories in 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.720
 serious 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.550
 Disney has more realistic movies 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.050
 finding out I discovered that the story of the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 Easter bunny is a mixture of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.859
 European traditions very old myths 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.019
 urban lush goddesses many 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.870
 chocolates and money let's start with the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.880
 lamb is the result of two myths 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 when the Germans came to the USA in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.840
 the 18th century brought with them the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.120
 popular encounter called postpone that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 guess guess the pasqual hare 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 German, here you talk about long 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.969
 until they brought fertility in the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 spring after winter one year 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 will be for those women safe things 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 a little more of the account in front and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.710
 because of the cold that the wings of a 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.899
 little bird freezes being felt very 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.360
 guilty number remedying converted to 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.770
 bird in connected 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.480
 because that what you do when you 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.430
 wrong turns things into rabbit 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.720
 not the other element that gives life 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.790
 rabbit is that for Christians 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.370
 formerly they believed that the snows were 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.740
 those who could procreate without as I say 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.630
 doing rabbit things and keep your 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.310
 virginity by the way this made the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.140
 people related to rabbits with 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.090
 the Virgin Mary and where did it come from 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.550
 the colorful chocolate games is the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.140
 mix of three milestones one remembers no 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
 be the German goddess her legend 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.380
 also told that the rabbit still 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.760
 he kept his bird spirit so he did not 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.500
 I have the ability to lay eggs 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.270
 the colors of the rainbow once a year 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.890
 for the March equinox what not 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.330
 tells the story is if the goddess is 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.560
 worried that the rabbit's anatomy 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.340
 was adapted to put many 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.360
 eggs I prefer to think that if two in 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.310
 various cultures of the northern hemisphere 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.630
 after the equinox the towns are and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.280
 they have to earn painted eggs like 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.710
 symbol of fertility and abundance that 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.119
 would spring 3 Christianity 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.979
 prohibited from eating eggs during which 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.509
 it is so people started to put them together 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.670
 and decorate them and then eat them during 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.830
 the easter of resurrection then a 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.690
 German god with cult asexual rabbits 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.340
 and provision of eating egg they gave for 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.930
 result in a story that says well 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.920
 next to the cave where the body of 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.540
 Christ was put after the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.950
 crucifixion 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.840
 when the animal witnessed the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.759
 resurrection and he saw how Jesus put 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.320
 standing up to tell people what 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.240
 I had seen how he had no voice 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.560
 decided to distribute decorated eggs for 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.290
 fun of your human friends that a 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 miracle had happened and the chocolate was 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.380
 just in the 19th century that the French 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.860
 and the Germans created the eggs of 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.350
 chocolate in the year 1875 john harbor and 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.750
 He took the idea and foolishly lazy 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.190
 industry mission regardless of origin 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.630
 what matters is that you have to take advantage 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.640
 these parties to be with those who more 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.200
 we want to share this video so that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.610
 we all celebrate this date knowing 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.610
 the true story of the sea rabbit
