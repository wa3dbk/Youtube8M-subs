kind of combine to this with all chrome
for<00:00:30.350> those<00:00:30.439> pedals<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:31.220> mud<00:00:31.460> well<00:00:31.730> this

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
for those pedals the mud well this

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.509 
for those pedals the mud well this
is<00:00:32.719> quite<00:00:32.899> a<00:00:32.930> lots<00:00:33.170> of<00:00:33.260> space<00:00:33.530> around<00:00:33.769> here<00:00:34.129> so

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
is quite a lots of space around here so

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.569 
is quite a lots of space around here so
much<00:00:34.910> just<00:00:35.120> Falls<00:00:35.329> straight<00:00:35.570> through<00:00:36.579> it's

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
much just Falls straight through it's

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.389 
much just Falls straight through it's
quite<00:00:37.760> a<00:00:37.790> lot<00:00:38.000> of<00:00:38.120> float<00:00:38.360> as<00:00:38.660> well

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
quite a lot of float as well

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.420 
quite a lot of float as well
so<00:00:40.399> more<00:00:40.760> than<00:00:40.940> an<00:00:41.059> armless<00:00:41.390> mono<00:00:41.719> pedal<00:00:42.430> this

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
so more than an armless mono pedal this

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.770 
so more than an armless mono pedal this
offers<00:00:43.760> some<00:00:43.940> benefits<00:00:44.390> when<00:00:44.570> you're<00:00:44.660> going

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
they can feel a bit vague when you come

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.180 
they can feel a bit vague when you come
to<00:00:56.510> clip<00:00:56.809> out<00:00:57.020> it<00:00:57.289> can<00:00:57.500> take<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.739> bit<00:00:57.950> of<00:00:58.010> a

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
to clip out it can take a bit of a

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.970 
to clip out it can take a bit of a
footbridge<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.760> get<00:00:59.000> your<00:00:59.180> foot<00:00:59.360> out<00:00:59.770> not<00:01:00.770> so

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
footbridge to get your foot out not so

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.740 
footbridge to get your foot out not so
good<00:01:01.129> if<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:01.370> get<00:01:01.489> into<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:01.850> bit<00:01:02.090> difficulty

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
good if you get into a bit difficulty

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.850 
good if you get into a bit difficulty
and<00:01:02.989> really<00:01:03.379> need<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.620> get<00:01:03.710> out<00:01:03.829> quickly

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
and really need to get out quickly

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.340 
and really need to get out quickly
aluminium<00:01:06.860> cage<00:01:07.460> is<00:01:07.880> reasonably<00:01:08.569> robust<00:01:09.079> as

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
aluminium cage is reasonably robust as

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.230 
aluminium cage is reasonably robust as
you<00:01:09.439> can<00:01:09.590> see<00:01:09.799> it's<00:01:09.979> taken<00:01:10.639> quite<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:10.850> bit<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.179> a

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
you can see it's taken quite a bit of a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.059 
you can see it's taken quite a bit of a
beating<00:01:11.659> here<00:01:11.869> but<00:01:12.139> it's<00:01:12.350> protected<00:01:12.889> the

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
beating here but it's protected the

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.459 
beating here but it's protected the
mechanism<00:01:13.609> inside<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:15.310> all<00:01:16.310> good<00:01:16.369> really<00:01:17.469> it

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
mechanism inside so all good really it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.300 
mechanism inside so all good really it
is<00:01:18.740> they<00:01:19.189> are<00:01:19.219> quite<00:01:19.609> heavy<00:01:20.200> 487<00:01:21.200> grams<00:01:21.469> for

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
is they are quite heavy 487 grams for

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.629 
is they are quite heavy 487 grams for
the<00:01:22.340> pair<00:01:22.639> but<00:01:23.740> then<00:01:24.740> they<00:01:24.889> are<00:01:24.979> designed<00:01:25.429> for

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
the pair but then they are designed for

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.730 
the pair but then they are designed for
downhill<00:01:25.849> use<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:26.599> lots<00:01:27.079> of<00:01:27.170> downhill<00:01:27.529> riders

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
downhill use and lots of downhill riders

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.160 
downhill use and lots of downhill riders
do<00:01:28.039> use<00:01:28.310> them<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.999> do<00:01:29.149> seem<00:01:29.359> to<00:01:29.389> like<00:01:29.689> them<00:01:29.929> so

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
do use them and do seem to like them so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.129 
do use them and do seem to like them so
there<00:01:30.289> is<00:01:30.409> something<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.749> the<00:01:32.749> big<00:01:32.929> thing

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:33.139 
there is something in it the big thing

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:36.399 
there is something in it the big thing
for<00:01:33.169> me<00:01:33.380> though<00:01:33.789> with<00:01:34.789> these<00:01:34.939> pedals<00:01:35.389> is<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:36.169> Q

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
for me though with these pedals is the Q

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.909 
for me though with these pedals is the Q
factor<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.950> now<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.099> Q<00:01:37.340> factor<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:38.919> the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:39.919 
factor and now the Q factor is the

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:42.190 
factor and now the Q factor is the
distance<00:01:40.369> between<00:01:40.579> here<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.509> centre<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.109> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
distance between here and centre of the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.339 
distance between here and centre of the
pedal<00:01:42.529> and<00:01:43.689> Schwerner<00:01:44.689> pedal<00:01:45.429> it's<00:01:46.429> 52<00:01:46.909> mil<00:01:47.349> on

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:48.349 
pedal and Schwerner pedal it's 52 mil on

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.129 
pedal and Schwerner pedal it's 52 mil on
these<00:01:48.560> pedals<00:01:48.950> 57<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.270> means<00:01:50.539> your<00:01:50.749> feet<00:01:50.959> are

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:51.139 
these pedals 57 this means your feet are

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
these pedals 57 this means your feet are
further<00:01:51.560> apart<00:01:51.770> kind<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.819> in<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:52.999> more

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
further apart kind of in a more

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.979 
further apart kind of in a more
confident<00:01:55.159> inspiring<00:01:55.759> position<00:01:56.569> at<00:01:56.749> least

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:56.989 
confident inspiring position at least

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:59.949 
confident inspiring position at least
for<00:01:57.200> me<00:01:57.729> whether<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:58.880> get<00:01:58.999> on<00:01:59.149> with<00:01:59.299> that<00:01:59.450> is

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
for me whether you get on with that is

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.109 
for me whether you get on with that is
up<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.529> but<00:02:00.770> if<00:02:01.399> you're<00:02:01.579> doing<00:02:01.700> lots<00:02:02.029> of

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
up to you but if you're doing lots of

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.940 
up to you but if you're doing lots of
downhill<00:02:02.329> riding<00:02:02.809> and<00:02:03.139> you<00:02:03.229> want<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.529> clip<00:02:03.709> in

downhill riding and you want to clip in

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.050 
downhill riding and you want to clip in
then<00:02:04.520> these<00:02:04.729> pedals<00:02:05.209> certainly<00:02:05.569> worth<00:02:05.719> a<00:02:05.899> look
