00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
talked about the three lines of energy

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.210 
talked about the three lines of energy
one<00:00:18.480> two<00:00:19.350> three<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.529> case<00:00:22.550> one<00:00:23.869> two

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
one two three so in this case one two

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.769 
one two three so in this case one two
three<00:00:27.170> so<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.590> protect<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.630> in

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
three so this is protect this one but in

three so this is protect this one but in
general<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.470> want<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> write<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> symbol<00:00:32.550> it's

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
general you want to write a symbol it's

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:45.650 
general you want to write a symbol it's
like<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:35.750> made<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.930> Germany<00:00:43.969> but<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.329> board

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
like this made in Germany but this board

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.119 
like this made in Germany but this board
is<00:00:45.989> flat<00:00:47.600> it's<00:00:48.890> CR<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:51.090> there<00:00:52.129> yeah

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
is flat it's CR here and one there yeah

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
is flat it's CR here and one there yeah
I<00:00:53.930> cannot<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.620> fingers<00:00:57.500> are<00:00:58.500> you

opponent oh you're you pull your
opponent<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:28.630> are<00:02:28.660> actually<00:02:29.319> doing<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:30.599> so

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
opponent you are actually doing this so

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.440 
opponent you are actually doing this so
you're<00:02:31.980> pulling<00:02:32.980> you're<00:02:33.519> connecting<00:02:34.239> here

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
you're pulling you're connecting here

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.240 
you're pulling you're connecting here
when<00:02:35.049> you<00:02:35.170> push<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.620> same<00:02:35.829> thing<00:02:36.040> you're

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
when you push the same thing you're

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.750 
when you push the same thing you're
connecting<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.090> but<00:02:38.040> when<00:02:39.040> your<00:02:39.430> fight

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
connecting like this but when your fight

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.410 
connecting like this but when your fight
normally<00:02:40.569> is<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:41.079> this<00:02:41.319> coordinate<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
normally is in this coordinate on the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.809 
normally is in this coordinate on the
body<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.950> called<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.549> pun

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
body so this is called the pun

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.090 
body so this is called the pun
coordinate<00:02:46.299> on<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:47.230> here<00:02:47.560> when<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.799> push

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
coordinate on this here when you push

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.910 
coordinate on this here when you push
it's<00:02:48.370> hop<00:02:48.639> Hill<00:02:49.200> same<00:02:50.200> as<00:02:50.410> when<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.829> are

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
it's hop Hill same as when you are

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.740 
it's hop Hill same as when you are
pushing<00:02:51.220> something<00:02:51.700> it's<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.359> it's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
pushing something it's like this it's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.720 
pushing something it's like this it's
very<00:02:52.870> very<00:02:53.319> difficult<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.160> have<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.340> wait

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
very very difficult you have to wait

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.000 
very very difficult you have to wait
until<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.480> go<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.840> top<00:02:56.049> they<00:02:56.290> go<00:02:56.319> like

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
until you go to the top they go like

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.569 
until you go to the top they go like
that<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:58.239> human<00:02:58.630> power<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:59.079> like<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.160> here

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
that so human power is like that so here

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.250 
that so human power is like that so here
if<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.000> pull<00:03:01.329> here<00:03:01.569> it's<00:03:01.720> very<00:03:01.810> very

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
if you pull here it's very very

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.280 
if you pull here it's very very
difficult<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:03.250> if<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.700> pull<00:03:04.060> something<00:03:04.569> this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
difficult but if you pull something this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.440 
difficult but if you pull something this
is<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.530> middle<00:03:05.889> if<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.220> pull<00:03:06.670> here<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.150> turns

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
is the middle if you pull here it turns

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.039 
is the middle if you pull here it turns
very<00:03:07.630> easily<00:03:09.359> now<00:03:10.359> do<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.569> understand<00:03:10.959> that

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
very easily now do you understand that

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.370 
very easily now do you understand that
theory<00:03:12.329> okay<00:03:13.329> if<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.930> understand<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.590> now

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.010

here here

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.260 
here here

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
this is his power stance so this is a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.560 
this is his power stance so this is a
peak<00:03:26.600> when<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.290> pull<00:03:27.800> it's<00:03:28.310> here<00:03:29.060> that's<00:03:29.330> his

peak when I pull it's here that's his
peak<00:03:29.900> very<00:03:30.470> strong<00:03:30.830> so<00:03:31.490> when<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.700> go<00:03:31.970> like<00:03:32.180> this

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
peak very strong so when I go like this

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.540 
peak very strong so when I go like this
here<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.900> see<00:03:33.410> when<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.590> did<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:34.010> here<00:03:34.310> I
