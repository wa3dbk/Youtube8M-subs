that<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.230> show<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.830> going<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.370> be

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that I want to show you is going to be

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.930 
that I want to show you is going to be
performed<00:02:27.090> against<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.720> wall<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.880> up

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
performed against a wall and you go up

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.360 
performed against a wall and you go up
against<00:02:36.180> any<00:02:36.330> wall<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.960> just<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.250> you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
against any wall and just like what you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.820 
against any wall and just like what you
do<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.580> push<00:02:38.940> up<00:02:39.120> against<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.570> wall<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:40.500> are<00:02:40.650> not

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
do a push up against the wall we are not

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.860 
do a push up against the wall we are not
going<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.130> bend<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.580> elbows<00:02:41.970> though<00:02:42.270> we're

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
going to bend the elbows though we're

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.110 
going to bend the elbows though we're
going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.260> put<00:02:43.470> our<00:02:43.590> body<00:02:43.920> weights<00:02:44.280> against

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
going to put our body weights against

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.670 
going to put our body weights against
the<00:02:45.300> wall<00:02:45.480> with<00:02:45.630> our<00:02:45.690> hands<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> wall<00:02:46.380> and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the wall with our hands on the wall and

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.620 
the wall with our hands on the wall and
we<00:02:47.220> are<00:02:47.370> going<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.940> bring<00:02:48.840> our<00:02:49.380> chest<00:02:50.630> forward

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
we are going to bring our chest forward

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.920 
we are going to bring our chest forward
and<00:02:52.520> back

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
and back

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.950 
and back
so<00:02:54.930> we're<00:02:55.080> arching<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.830> back<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.960> bringing

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
so we're arching the back and bringing

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.520 
so we're arching the back and bringing
it<00:02:58.080> forward<00:02:58.490> keeping<00:02:59.490> this<00:02:59.610> straight<00:03:00.000> and

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
it forward keeping this straight and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.810 
it forward keeping this straight and
again<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.680> similar<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.340> when<00:03:02.550> we<00:03:02.640> did

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
again it's similar to like when we did

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.550 
again it's similar to like when we did
with<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.090> dumbbell<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.900> few<00:03:04.080> moments<00:03:04.470> ago

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
with the dumbbell just a few moments ago

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.310 
with the dumbbell just a few moments ago
in<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.520> type<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:06.000> position<00:03:06.480> but<00:03:07.110> we're

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
in this type of a position but we're

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.020 
in this type of a position but we're
stabilizing<00:03:07.920> ourselves<00:03:08.340> now<00:03:08.490> against<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
stabilizing ourselves now against the

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.160 
stabilizing ourselves now against the
wall<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:10.080> elbows<00:03:10.470> straight<00:03:12.020> retracting<00:03:13.020> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
wall so elbows straight retracting the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.840 
wall so elbows straight retracting the
shoulder<00:03:13.530> blades<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:16.250> another<00:03:17.250> version<00:03:17.490> of

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
shoulder blades and another version of

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.450 
shoulder blades and another version of
this<00:03:17.970> exercise<00:03:18.350> can<00:03:19.350> also<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.770> performed<00:03:19.950> on

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
this exercise can also be performed on

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.810 
this exercise can also be performed on
the<00:03:20.850> floor<00:03:24.890> instead<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:25.950> using<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.400> wall<00:03:26.550> we

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
the floor instead of using the wall we

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.910 
the floor instead of using the wall we
use<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.210> floor<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.900> we<00:03:28.560> are<00:03:28.680> just

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
use in the floor and we are just

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.270 
use in the floor and we are just
dropping<00:03:30.080> our<00:03:31.080> shoulders<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.800> chest<00:03:31.830> and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
dropping our shoulders and chest and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.990 
dropping our shoulders and chest and
back<00:03:32.970> up<00:03:33.180> again<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:34.770> again<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.250> movement<00:03:35.520> is

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
back up again so again the movement is

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.540 
back up again so again the movement is
right<00:03:36.600> from<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:38.670> shoulders<00:03:40.070> if<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.460> a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
right from the shoulders if this is a

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.880 
right from the shoulders if this is a
little<00:03:41.790> hard<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.210> you<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.410> drop<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.830> your

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
little hard on you you can drop to your

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.270 
little hard on you you can drop to your
knees<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.660> do<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.780> exercise<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.710> this<00:03:46.740> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
knees and do the exercise like this and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.280 
knees and do the exercise like this and
I<00:03:47.760> probably<00:03:48.030> would<00:03:48.240> recommend<00:03:48.720> starting<00:03:49.170> in

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
I probably would recommend starting in

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.580 
I probably would recommend starting in
this<00:03:49.380> position<00:03:49.830> first<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:51.320> then<00:03:52.320> as<00:03:52.470> you

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
this position first and then as you

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.230 
this position first and then as you
develop<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.160> strength<00:03:53.580> in<00:03:53.790> if<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:53.970> doesn't

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
develop the strength in if it doesn't

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.080 
develop the strength in if it doesn't
hurt<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:55.070> going<00:03:56.070> with<00:03:56.370> your<00:03:56.520> knees<00:03:56.700> off<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
hurt you going with your knees off the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.480 
hurt you going with your knees off the
floor<00:03:58.760> one<00:03:59.760> last<00:03:59.970> exercise<00:04:00.360> for<00:04:01.490> developing
