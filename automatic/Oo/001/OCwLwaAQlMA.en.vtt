00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:08.951
 Figure 36 equals 3 times the number 12. Write this comparison as a striking formula. 

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:20.149
 So they say that the number 36 (I will write 36) equals 3 hit 12. 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:24.275
 I used this little asterisk (*), if I used "x" here, would you benefit? 

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:26.149
 No, I have written a 3x format (3x). 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:32.483
 Well ... to write this little star which is usually used to represent multiplication on the computer ... 

00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:40.718
 You have to press "shift" with the number "8". It is also located on the keypad. 

00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:43.018
 By doing so I was able to show the beating signal. 

00:00:43.018 --> 00:00:50.846
 This can be read "36 equals 3 hit 12". Or "36 times three times the sum of 12". 

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:56.051
 Let us verify our response. correct answer! Let's solve two other questions. 

00:00:56.051 --> 00:01:04.578
 We can compare numbers 4 and 20 using the combination to say that 20 is greater than 4 by 16. 

00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:06.180
 That's true. 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.468
 We can also compare numbers 4 and 20 using multiplication. 

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:13.646
 Fill the blank correctly to compare numbers 4 and 20 using multiplication. 

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:18.470
 If they say that "20 equals (vacuum) hit 4". 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.245
 Well we know that 4 hit 5 equals 20. Or that 5 hit 4 equals 20. 

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:30.581
 If 20 equals 5 times as much as 4 times, then I get 20. 

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:33.885
 Well, I'll check my answer. 

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.447
 Let's do one more ... 

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:38.913
 Figure 6 equals 3 times the number 2. 

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:41.911
 Write this comparison as a striking formula. 

00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:52.581
 We can write that 6 tsui 2 (then press "shift" and the number "8" to get the signal multiplication ... those signal in the form of snowflake ...) 

00:01:52.581 --> 00:02:00.051
 2 hit 3. If I can write it on this shape, or I can write "2 hit 3 equals 6." These two answers are certainly acceptable. 

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.884
 Here I say that the 6 ... well ... I can say ... I would like to say the formula: 

00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:08.646
 "3 times the number 2." I think this is more fun. 

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:12.469
 If this is exactly: "6 equals 3 times the number 2" 

00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.000
 We are done.
