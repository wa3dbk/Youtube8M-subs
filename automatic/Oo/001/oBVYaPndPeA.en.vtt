00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.779
 because we often lose paradise 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.949
 that is, we lose this condition of freedom 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.949
 because we saw knotting our lives and covering it 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.560
 always healthy in all cultures 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.280
 that the man the woman learn learn to know that recognize their 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 fears 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.409
 and recognize the things that they did not expect 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.380
 and show them 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.190
 instead, fear tells me popularly 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.650
 better bad known than good to know I stayed 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.650
 in insurance security is that it leaves me peace of mind 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.220
 viena 21 governs fear so my choices and my decisions and the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.510
 free 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.160
 if it is not governed by fear normally that decision never 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.420
 it leads me to think 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.590
 always going to lead to try to keep that security is for me 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.750
 it's something that paralyzes me remember 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
 the fear says stage i can see 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.730
 the rigid person is always afraid 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 because I prefer to maintain the way of seeing things 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.650
 to open up to change kutxa what someone says or thinks 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.860
 because if I open myself to what the other thinks about there I have to change something 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.950
 there something I have to modify and as I'm afraid I prefer 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.710
 close me 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.710
 and the fear of realizing that life is a permanent change 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.120
 as he did not accept that everything is easy that everything has to change lilian clark 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.320
 mentally 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.090
 I cling to the way of being mine they started the way of doing things 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.170
 when one does 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.460
 is showing 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.360
 who does not learn from me 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.840
 samuel l is not to be fulfilled 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.760
 know how to live 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.760
 take what life 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.910
 what he can not do well 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.840
 and the things that you find unpleasant 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.760
 learn what I can get out of me 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.040
 this is one lives much lighter in life and not so closed 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.709
 peking where I have this that I do not lack was that of what 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.319
 and if I really 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 not so happy because this or that is missing 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.069
 Now I do not have this because things were not as expected 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.229
 is that there is still a lot to grow and I am very tied 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:28.199
 with many fears 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.749
 this person who, as an annual, is attached to security 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.319
 fearful iveco to give them apparently 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.319
 and tebar to tie by all means that nothing is always missing 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:46.040
 sometimes one realizes that sustaining indecisions sustain this path 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.159
 decision 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.379
 they do nothing but 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.079
 dry life 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.139
 very good mistakes, I love people who are wrong 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.469
 because people who are wrong in front 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.059
 I always say 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.129
 I want my children 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.549
 they have this 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.799
 what dad did not do wrong 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.279
 do not fit, do not shut up 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.909
 if what always got up 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.909
 and I prefer to teach them to get up 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.669
 to not avoid that never 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.399
 that being flexible is not 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.899
 is to be able to open a gap to think that others can be daily what is missing 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.809
 we enjoy little for 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.409
 much we have 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.019
 and we suffer a lot 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.019
 so little that 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.169
 we enjoy 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.109
 little at 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.319
 I do not know what we have 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.759
 and we suffer 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:44.599
 so little that
