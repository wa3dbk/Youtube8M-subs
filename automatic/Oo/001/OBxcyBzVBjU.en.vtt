hey guys my other camera just broke
while<00:00:06.180> not<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> camera<00:00:06.810> but<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.080> battery

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
while not the camera but the battery

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.480 
while not the camera but the battery
charger<00:00:07.799> broke<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.340> i'm<00:00:09.120> using<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.510> secondary

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
charger broke so i'm using my secondary

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:19.570 
charger broke so i'm using my secondary
digicam<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:12.150> record<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> last<00:00:12.870> race<00:00:13.200> and

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.570 

and<00:00:20.580> by<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.450> way<00:00:21.740> you<00:00:22.740> don't<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.220> press

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and by the way you don't have to press

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.090 
and by the way you don't have to press
triangle<00:00:23.970> right<00:00:24.390> up<00:00:24.540> to<00:00:24.660> start<00:00:24.900> anymore<00:00:25.110> the

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
triangle right up to start anymore the

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.390 
triangle right up to start anymore the
g25<00:00:26.670> seems<00:00:27.270> to<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.540> fully<00:00:27.779> supported<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.160> game

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
g25 seems to be fully supported the game

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.620 
g25 seems to be fully supported the game
stars<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> clutch<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> already<00:00:30.930> enabled

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
stars and the clutch is already enabled

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
stars and the clutch is already enabled
so<00:00:33.680> there's<00:00:34.680> no<00:00:34.920> need<00:00:34.980> any<00:00:35.250> more<00:00:35.430> depressed

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
so there's no need any more depressed

00:00:35.850 --> 00:01:10.490 
so there's no need any more depressed
trying<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> gt5<00:00:38.040> prologue

I'm<00:01:47.770> not<00:01:48.190> yet<00:01:48.670> familiar<00:01:48.970> with<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.630> physics

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
I'm not yet familiar with the physics

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.440 
I'm not yet familiar with the physics
and<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.260> track<00:01:50.590> or<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:50.950> soft<00:01:51.340> sorry<00:01:52.030> about<00:01:52.210> that

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
the physics all I'm just driving this

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.929 
the physics all I'm just driving this
lower<00:01:59.810> little<00:02:00.140> car<00:02:00.409> but<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.740> physics<00:02:01.130> are<00:02:01.340> so

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
lower little car but the physics are so

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.850 
lower little car but the physics are so
improved<00:02:02.479> over<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:04.299> gt5<00:02:05.469> prologue<00:02:06.469> and<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860

the understeer from this car on the
brake<00:02:24.690> king<00:02:24.960> also<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:26.010> very<00:02:26.160> very<00:02:26.870> realistic

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.490 

and<00:02:56.349> that's<00:02:57.129> race<00:02:57.730> victory<00:02:58.480> number<00:02:58.720> three<00:02:59.290> for

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
and that's race victory number three for

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.420 
and that's race victory number three for
me

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
I believe I'm gonna win the price car

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.059 
I believe I'm gonna win the price car
now<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.909> don't<00:03:09.120> want<00:03:09.480> your<00:03:10.069> gt5

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
now and if you don't want your gt5

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.490 
now and if you don't want your gt5
experience<00:03:11.700> will<00:03:11.819> be<00:03:11.909> spoiled<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:13.200> better

start<00:03:13.859> looking<00:03:14.250> away<00:03:14.579> now<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.480> just

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
start looking away now and I just

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.740 
start looking away now and I just
reached<00:03:22.049> level<00:03:22.379> 1<00:03:23.239> yes<00:03:26.329> which<00:03:27.329> would<00:03:27.510> mean<00:03:27.689> i

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
reached level 1 yes which would mean i

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.440 
reached level 1 yes which would mean i
could<00:03:27.900> buy<00:03:28.139> a<00:03:28.170> new<00:03:28.409> car<00:03:28.709> but<00:03:29.219> i<00:03:29.939> don't<00:03:30.389> think
