00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.859
 Justine and Sebastian young photographer 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.540
 having met at nomadic workshops 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.849
 have created an association 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.769
 the workshop of the small photographers thanks 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.750
 to which anime and initiations 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.930
 and travels the world looking 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.550
 of image and dating so that's 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.170
 a room pictures that we discovered in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.590
 africa with a photographer who 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.090
 is is amado to mopti in mali 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.439
 and this gentleman is working with since one 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.070
 thirty years then we as soon as we have 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.040
 saw that we liked it instantly we go 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.630
 to say so we liked it so much that 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.850
 Caen is back in France we is 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.920
 made an ex of the objects we have 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.149
 found a reason for me so 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.160
 now we work with that and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.539
 occasionally in the street as soon as we 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 can actually as soon as the time we the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.600
 allows and the principle it is hyper 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.489
 simple you have an optics you 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.930
 recover on an enlarger or if you 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.309
 have the means you can buy a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.780
 room optic then there is a 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.699
 leaked deposit on a sliding plate 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.620
 in the interior and that connected to a rod 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.199
 which allows us to go beyond the frosted 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.630
 so that's all system that allows us to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.390
 make a focus and once that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.260
 the focus is made we see from his 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.670
 side where we put photo paper and this 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.770
 photo paper the plate count 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.830
 fonts made to shots we 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.270
 gets negative in fact and then we get it 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.650
 puts in the baths that inside 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.619
 so inside we put a bath of 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.560
 revealing a fixer bath so we 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.210
 pass the picture we took in the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.070
 revealing the fixer once 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.290
 it is done it is rinsed with water it is 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.290
 put back in front and resume negative in 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 photo and a26 negative we redo the same 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.820
 process 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.280
 gives a positive the positive c6 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.890
 that we sell at a free price in the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.140
 street in this big box you have a 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.630
 lab and a camera makes them 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.979
 two mixed that allows us to everything 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.259
 do work to those who are at 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.550
 the outside and anything does not 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.170
 to be forced to have a lab next door 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.290
 we can develop in the desert where we 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.760
 wants even if no dark black the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.870
 street photography appeared with 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.910
 the invention of photographic processes 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.220
 cheap fast enough for 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.870
 capture a portrait but it's from 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.760
 of the 30s that the profession of minutes 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.040
 eros knows a boom unparalleled thanks 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.530
 to the use of silver paper more 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.550
 easy to manipulate 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.560
 today we can still 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.420
 encountered in some countries such as the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
 portugal chile india afghanistan 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.990
 greece and so many others but their 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.130
 activity has been reduced 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.100
 before the arrival of the phone 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.990
 photographic low in the future the already 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.420
 our big project project that we have 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.250
 for three years is to ride these 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.300
 mobile workshops in a truck actually 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.180
 we make interventions in 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.640
 primary schools with children so 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.850
 we teach them the pinhole cyanotype 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.890
 he van dyke different processes the street 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.200
 plays the role of a scene that mixes 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.540
 more and more people practicing circus music 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.040
 dance and with the participation of our 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.020
 young minutes eros and their room 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.970
 artisanal witness of a piece 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.970
 history photography
