00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.950 
because it's stuck pretty good but it's
fairly<00:01:48.630> simple<00:01:49.340> I'll<00:01:50.340> show<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.960> firewall

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
fairly simple I'll show you the firewall

that<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> painted<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> paint

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
that I painted that I'm going to paint

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.679 
that I painted that I'm going to paint
but<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:56.390> looks<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
but there we have it looks like a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.370 
but there we have it looks like a
completely<00:01:58.439> different<00:01:58.530> truck<00:01:59.240> well<00:02:00.380> looks

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
completely different truck well looks

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.810 
completely different truck well looks
better<00:02:01.920> anyway<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.820> did<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.490> did<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.640> on

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
better anyway I did that and did up on

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.029 
better anyway I did that and did up on
the<00:02:05.909> cowl<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.479> which<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:07.259> rough<00:02:07.680> right
