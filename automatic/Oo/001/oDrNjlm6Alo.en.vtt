00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
first thing I'm going to want to do is

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.589 
first thing I'm going to want to do is
actually<00:02:33.680> eat<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.819> of<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.030> original

actually eat one of the original
double-decker<00:02:36.560> hamburgers<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:38.239> correct<00:02:38.989> me

double-decker hamburgers and correct me

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.750 
double-decker hamburgers and correct me
if<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.319> am<00:02:39.349> wrong<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.799> this<00:02:40.040> but<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.220> think<00:02:40.549> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
if I am wrong on this but I think the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.390 
if I am wrong on this but I think the
mascot<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.049> little<00:02:42.349> boy<00:02:42.530> kind<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.220> little

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
mascot the little boy kind of a little

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.370 
mascot the little boy kind of a little
chubby<00:02:43.819> little<00:02:43.970> boy<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.269> think<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.810> started

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
chubby little boy I think that started

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.880 
chubby little boy I think that started
because<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.340> story<00:02:46.670> was<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.780> for<00:02:48.230> free<00:02:48.590> food

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
because the story was that for free food

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.650 
because the story was that for free food
he<00:02:49.190> would<00:02:49.310> do<00:02:49.459> like<00:02:49.700> some<00:02:49.910> cleaning<00:02:50.390> in<00:02:50.540> the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
he would do like some cleaning in the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.300 
he would do like some cleaning in the
restaurant<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.739> he<00:02:51.859> would<00:02:51.980> get<00:02:52.100> free

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
restaurant and he would get free

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.729 
restaurant and he would get free
hamburgers<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.150> he<00:02:53.690> went<00:02:53.930> from<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.260> slender

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
hamburgers so he went from a slender

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.080 
hamburgers so he went from a slender
bill<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.190> started<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.519> gain<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.730> little<00:02:55.940> weight

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
bill and started to gain a little weight

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.210 
bill and started to gain a little weight
because<00:02:56.510> when<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.780> eat<00:02:57.220> double-decker

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
because when you eat double-decker

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.330 
because when you eat double-decker
hamburgers<00:02:59.000> constantly<00:02:59.810> all<00:03:00.049> day<00:03:00.380> long<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.830 
hamburgers constantly all day long you
are<00:03:01.459> probably<00:03:01.700> going<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.120> put<00:03:02.359> on<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> few

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
are probably going to put on a few

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.500 
are probably going to put on a few
pounds<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.260> am<00:03:03.470> going<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.829> actually<00:03:04.150> not<00:03:05.150> eat

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510
