00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
rid of Jack and which they'll freeze up

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.320 
rid of Jack and which they'll freeze up
very<00:03:21.720> tiny<00:03:22.019> bit<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.830> transfer<00:03:23.519> budget<00:03:23.730> but<00:03:24.060> you

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
very tiny bit of transfer budget but you

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.449 
very tiny bit of transfer budget but you
know<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.630> little<00:03:25.320> bit<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.680> still<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.070> good<00:03:26.400> amount

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
know a little bit is still a good amount

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.600 
know a little bit is still a good amount

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
it goes in a half time being 00 so I was

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.530 
it goes in a half time being 00 so I was
like<00:03:38.580> all<00:03:38.700> right<00:03:38.760> nothing's<00:03:39.120> working<00:03:39.269> out<00:03:39.450> in

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
like all right nothing's working out in

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.729 
like all right nothing's working out in
this<00:03:39.600> half<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.019> let's<00:03:40.260> make<00:03:40.530> some

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
this half so let's make some

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.620 
this half so let's make some
substitution<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.820> know<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.060> always<00:03:42.330> make

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
substitution so you know I always make

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.750 
substitution so you know I always make
my<00:03:42.750> substitutions<00:03:43.410> around<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.769> 60th<00:03:44.280> 70th

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
my substitutions around the 60th 70th

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.229 
my substitutions around the 60th 70th
minute<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.209> do<00:03:45.450> decide<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.989> do<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:47.239> we

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
minute so we do decide to do that and we

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.930 
minute so we do decide to do that and we
decide<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.900> make<00:03:49.830> regular<00:03:50.340> sub<00:03:50.519> juice<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.820> we

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
decide to make regular sub juice like we

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.220 
decide to make regular sub juice like we
do<00:03:51.060> but<00:03:51.090> at<00:03:51.299> night<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.690> if<00:03:51.780> we<00:03:51.810> get<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.989> chance

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
do but at night and if we get a chance

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.100 
do but at night and if we get a chance
with<00:03:52.380> Daniel<00:03:52.650> email<00:03:52.920> over<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.580> top<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.269> it

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
with Daniel email over the top so it

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.590 
with Daniel email over the top so it
does<00:03:55.320> end<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.590> time<00:03:55.799> again<00:03:56.310> 00<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.030> two<00:03:57.209> games

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
does end of time again 00 so two games

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.750 
does end of time again 00 so two games
two<00:03:57.840> points<00:03:58.230> not<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.799> best<00:03:59.040> start<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.549> want
