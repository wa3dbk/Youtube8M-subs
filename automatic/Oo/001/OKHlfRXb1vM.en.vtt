00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
to make sure that the follower is

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.460 
to make sure that the follower is
sitting<00:00:20.670> along<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.030> line<00:00:21.270> right<00:00:21.360> here<00:00:21.470> it's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
sitting along this line right here it's

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.460 
sitting along this line right here it's
not<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.070> hard<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.310> misplace<00:00:23.700> but<00:00:24.150> the

something seemingly difficult part is
getting<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.540> trapdoor<00:00:28.020> to<00:00:28.140> sit<00:00:28.320> straight<00:00:28.560> so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
getting the trapdoor to sit straight so

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.960 
getting the trapdoor to sit straight so
what<00:00:28.860> you<00:00:28.920> want<00:00:29.040> to<00:00:29.100> do<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.490> make<00:00:29.700> sure<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
lines up with these ridges right here

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.690 
lines up with these ridges right here
those<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:31.740> ridges<00:00:32.010> inside<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.370> there<00:00:32.489> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
those little ridges inside of there so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.000 
those little ridges inside of there so
just<00:00:33.110> sit<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.379> that<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> only<00:00:37.650> one<00:00:37.830> way

just sit down like that so only one way

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.260 
just sit down like that so only one way
that<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.280> goes<00:00:38.400> in<00:00:38.580> so<00:00:38.850> that's<00:00:39.000> pretty<00:00:39.150> simple

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that it goes in so that's pretty simple

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.590 
on just by getting it over like so take
these<00:01:02.340> smaller<00:01:02.730> screws<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.239> put<00:01:03.360> them<00:01:03.480> in

here because this will if you use longer

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
here because this will if you use longer
screws<00:01:13.289> they'll<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.619> sit<00:01:13.860> inside<00:01:14.039> the<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
screws they'll just sit inside the the

together a bit unconventional same idea
but<00:05:28.840> different<00:05:29.840> shape<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:30.380> it<00:05:30.700> separates

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
but different shape so it separates

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
pressure relief trick works on this

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.310 
pressure relief trick works on this
model<00:05:39.860> too<00:05:40.190> so<00:05:40.700> you<00:05:41.600> know<00:05:41.720> half<00:05:41.930> screw<00:05:42.200> these

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
model too so you know half screw these

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.400 
model too so you know half screw these
screws<00:05:42.680> all<00:05:42.920> seven<00:05:43.220> of<00:05:43.280> these<00:05:44.140> pull<00:05:45.140> on<00:05:45.290> the

pull on the retaining latch pick it out

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.470 
pull on the retaining latch pick it out
as<00:05:49.070> you<00:05:49.250> see<00:05:49.370> this<00:05:49.490> one<00:05:49.610> already<00:05:49.760> has<00:05:49.910> some<00:05:50.210> so

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
as you see this one already has some so

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.000 
as you see this one already has some so
just<00:05:51.020> be<00:05:51.110> able<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.350> use<00:05:51.470> that<00:05:51.500> method<00:05:51.800> right

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
just be able to use that method right

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.230 
just be able to use that method right
now<00:05:52.160> so<00:05:52.670> you<00:05:52.790> an<00:05:52.850> idea<00:05:53.030> what's<00:05:53.180> going<00:05:53.360> on<00:05:53.450> a

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
now so you an idea what's going on a

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:06.380 
now so you an idea what's going on a
little<00:05:56.240> bit<00:05:56.330> of<00:05:56.360> the<00:05:56.510> case

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.490 

actually<00:06:07.390> there<00:06:07.480> was<00:06:07.540> an<00:06:07.660> eighth<00:06:07.900> screw<00:06:08.290> I<00:06:08.320> was

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
actually there was an eighth screw I was

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.950 
actually there was an eighth screw I was
not<00:06:08.620> aware<00:06:08.680> of<00:06:09.060> real<00:06:10.060> Rubik's<00:06:10.480> Cube<00:06:10.720> to<00:06:10.840> me

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
not aware of real Rubik's Cube to me

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.420 
not aware of real Rubik's Cube to me
anyways<00:06:13.170> we've<00:06:14.170> done<00:06:14.290> that<00:06:14.470> I<00:06:14.800> should<00:06:15.220> release

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
anyways we've done that I should release

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.670 
anyways we've done that I should release
a<00:06:15.460> little<00:06:15.610> bit<00:06:15.790> of<00:06:15.880> tension<00:06:16.170> the<00:06:17.170> feed<00:06:17.350> shaft

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
a little bit of tension the feed shaft

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.740 
a little bit of tension the feed shaft
will<00:06:18.130> have<00:06:18.340> a<00:06:18.370> little<00:06:18.640> less<00:06:18.730> tension<00:06:18.970> on<00:06:19.240> it<00:06:19.270> so

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
will have a little less tension on it so

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.610 
will have a little less tension on it so
should<00:06:20.650> be<00:06:20.680> able<00:06:20.830> to<00:06:21.130> get<00:06:22.060> the<00:06:22.180> bb's<00:06:22.420> free<00:06:22.620> if

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
should be able to get the bb's free if

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.870 
should be able to get the bb's free if
they're<00:06:23.950> jammed<00:06:24.160> up<00:06:24.310> in<00:06:24.430> there<00:06:24.550> as<00:06:24.610> you<00:06:24.700> see

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
they're jammed up in there as you see

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.300 
they're jammed up in there as you see
there's<00:06:25.390> point<00:06:25.660> 12<00:06:25.900> using<00:06:26.260> this<00:06:26.410> and<00:06:26.800> usually

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
there's point 12 using this and usually

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.590 
there's point 12 using this and usually
that's<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.670> number<00:06:27.880> one<00:06:28.000> cause<00:06:28.210> of<00:06:28.270> this

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
that's the number one cause of this

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.110 
that's the number one cause of this
issue<00:06:28.780> so<00:06:30.390> screw<00:06:31.390> this<00:06:31.480> back<00:06:31.690> down<00:06:32.010> back<00:06:33.010> down

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
issue so screw this back down back down

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.530 
issue so screw this back down back down
and<00:06:34.200> and<00:06:35.850> I<00:06:36.850> don't<00:06:37.000> think<00:06:37.180> I<00:06:37.240> have<00:06:37.330> to<00:06:37.420> explain
