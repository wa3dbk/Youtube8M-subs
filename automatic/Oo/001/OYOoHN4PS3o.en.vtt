if they make a run that at least give

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.440 
if they make a run that at least give
frizziness<00:00:32.250> some<00:00:32.430> time<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.730> try<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.180> some

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
frizziness some time to try to get some

frizziness some time to try to get some
sort<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> support<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.829> his<00:00:34.980> main<00:00:35.160> he's<00:00:35.340> try<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
sort of support on his main he's try to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.680 
sort of support on his main he's try to
bring<00:00:35.790> those<00:00:35.880> vultures<00:00:36.090> back<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.510> no<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
bring those vultures back but no it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.639 
bring those vultures back but no it
looks<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:36.960> they're<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.320> slipped

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
looks like they're going to be slipped

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
looks like they're going to be slipped
through<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.550> huge<00:00:38.790> no<00:00:39.000> Ruby<00:00:39.329> backing<00:00:39.690> off

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
through this is huge no Ruby backing off

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.750 
through this is huge no Ruby backing off
wow<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> thought<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.129> might<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.370> able<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> jut

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
wow I thought he might be able to jut

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.010 
wow I thought he might be able to jut
against<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.480> Goliath<00:00:42.719> three

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
against that just to Goliath three

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.900 
against that just to Goliath three
vultures<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.980> tank<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.489> think<00:00:44.700> he<00:00:44.789> could

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
vultures and a tank and I think he could

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.209 
vultures and a tank and I think he could
have<00:00:45.030> pushed<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.289> laid<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.800> mines<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
have pushed that and laid some mines and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.290 
have pushed that and laid some mines and
done<00:00:47.340> some<00:00:47.520> economic<00:00:47.940> damage<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
done some economic damage on that

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
done some economic damage on that
secondary<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> brought<00:00:48.989> those<00:00:49.110> vultures

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
secondary and brought those vultures

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.350 
secondary and brought those vultures
back<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:50.250> he<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.000> lost<00:00:51.090> some

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
back with he would have lost some

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.520 
back with he would have lost some
vultures<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:52.289> he<00:00:52.350> would<00:00:52.469> have

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
vultures there but I think he would have

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
vultures there but I think he would have
gotten<00:00:52.710> some<00:00:52.890> SCV<00:00:53.250> kills<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.640> think<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
gotten some SCV kills and I think that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.850 
gotten some SCV kills and I think that
might<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.390> been<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.899> significant<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
might have been a significant of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.959 
might have been a significant of
advantage<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.430> perhaps<00:00:56.610> push

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
advantage and perhaps push

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.340 
advantage and perhaps push
simultaneously<00:00:57.449> he<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.170> allow

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
simultaneously he is going to allow

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.450 
simultaneously he is going to allow
brilliant<00:00:58.800> maneuver<00:00:58.890> though<00:00:59.129> he's<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
brilliant maneuver though he's going to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
brilliant maneuver though he's going to
come<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.699> around<00:00:59.879> uncie<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.539> tanks<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
come back around uncie just tanks and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.630 
come back around uncie just tanks and
retake<00:01:01.620> position<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> middle<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> map

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
retake position in the middle of the map

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
retake position in the middle of the map
and<00:01:03.270> he's<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.660> able<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.140> but

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and he's going to be able to do so but

that<00:01:10.799> twelve<00:01:11.070> o'clock<00:01:11.250> expansion<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that twelve o'clock expansion but I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
that twelve o'clock expansion but I
think<00:01:13.290> he's<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.950> able<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> hold

maybe a little bit premature just wanted

taking control of the middle of the map
this<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.070> very<00:01:59.189> significant<00:01:59.790> because<00:01:59.850> first

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this is very significant because first

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
this is very significant because first
of<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.479> there's<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> ramp<00:02:01.500> edge<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> you

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
of all there's that ramp edge and you

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.649 
of all there's that ramp edge and you
can<00:02:02.250> funnel<00:02:02.490> troops<00:02:02.790> either<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.360> any

can funnel troops either in any

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.200 
can funnel troops either in any
direction<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.490> lot<00:02:05.610> easier<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.909> just

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
direction and it's a lot easier to just

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.819 
direction and it's a lot easier to just
hold<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.659> cover<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.170> wraiths<00:02:07.590> being

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
exposed are going to be able to take

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.830 
exposed are going to be able to take
that<00:02:08.970> bear<00:02:09.209> except<00:02:09.420> they're<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.810> a

that bear except they're going to get a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780 
that bear except they're going to get a
spot<00:02:10.110> at<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.259> same<00:02:10.470> time<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> say<00:02:11.370> rubies<00:02:11.670> in

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
spot at the same time so I say rubies in

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.430 
spot at the same time so I say rubies in
a<00:02:11.849> pretty<00:02:12.000> good<00:02:12.090> position<00:02:12.300> although<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
a pretty good position although a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.470 
a pretty good position although a
a bit<00:02:13.620> delayed<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:14.070> his<00:02:14.370> he<00:02:14.910> has<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.240> armory

a bit delayed on his he has an armory

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.090 
a bit delayed on his he has an armory
it's<00:02:15.630> not<00:02:15.780> spinning<00:02:16.080> though<00:02:16.350> keep<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.890> mind

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
it's not spinning though keep in mind

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.860 
it's not spinning though keep in mind
and<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> upgrades<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.940> play<00:02:18.090> huge<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.510> think

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and the upgrades can play huge I think

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.240 
and the upgrades can play huge I think
that<00:02:18.990> was<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.260> thing<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.650> knot<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.980> versus

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
that was one thing in the knot of versus

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.270 
that was one thing in the knot of versus
kannada<00:02:20.550> game<00:02:20.760> upgrades<00:02:21.480> were<00:02:21.600> absolutely

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
kannada game upgrades were absolutely

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.770 
kannada game upgrades were absolutely
important<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.460> gly<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.360> not<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.690> to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
important and gly it's not there to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.910 
important and gly it's not there to
support<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.440> thought<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.800> would<00:02:25.890> be

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
support so I thought there would be

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.830 
support so I thought there would be
single<00:02:26.250> eyes<00:02:26.340> we<00:02:26.520> saw<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.730> armory<00:02:27.120> down<00:02:27.300> but

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
single eyes we saw the armory down but

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
single eyes we saw the armory down but
no<00:02:28.050> Goliath<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.740> support<00:02:29.130> against<00:02:29.520> those

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
no Goliath to support against those

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.310 
no Goliath to support against those
wraiths<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.180> maybe<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.750> they'll<00:02:30.930> be<00:02:31.080> cleaned

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
wraiths so maybe that they'll be cleaned

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.110 
wraiths so maybe that they'll be cleaned
up<00:02:31.410> by<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.100> Wraith<00:02:32.370> force<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.850> looks<00:02:33.030> like

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
up by the Wraith force it looks like

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.380 
up by the Wraith force it looks like
there<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.300> an<00:02:33.510> SUV<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.990> help<00:02:34.430> wow<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.820> two<00:02:36.060> only

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
there is an SUV to help wow the two only

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.850 
there is an SUV to help wow the two only
three<00:02:36.600> tanks<00:02:36.810> left<00:02:36.960> at<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.320> position<00:02:37.470> and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
three tanks left at that position and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.220 
three tanks left at that position and
SUV<00:02:38.280> backing<00:02:38.700> off<00:02:38.850> more<00:02:39.510> Minds<00:02:39.750> being<00:02:39.990> planted

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
SUV backing off more Minds being planted

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.930 
SUV backing off more Minds being planted
it<00:02:40.530> looks<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.830> at<00:02:40.980> some<00:02:41.130> expansions<00:02:41.610> ruby

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
it looks like at some expansions ruby

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.250 
it looks like at some expansions ruby
wants<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.270> make<00:02:42.390> sure<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.600> if<00:02:42.720> he's<00:02:42.870> take<00:02:43.080> if

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
wants to make sure that if he's take if

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.810 
wants to make sure that if he's take if
there<00:02:43.410> are<00:02:43.470> any<00:02:43.620> expansions<00:02:44.070> going<00:02:44.280> up<00:02:44.400> he's

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
there are any expansions going up he's

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.030 
there are any expansions going up he's
going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.240> one<00:02:45.390> taking<00:02:45.630> them<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
going to be the one taking them and it

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.580 
going to be the one taking them and it
looks<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.870> yeah<00:02:48.870> more<00:02:49.110> vultures<00:02:49.410> being

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
looks like yeah more vultures being

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.560 
looks like yeah more vultures being
pushed<00:02:50.010> across<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.520> Ruby<00:02:51.030> bringing<00:02:51.330> up<00:02:51.390> a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
pushed across and Ruby bringing up a

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.300 
pushed across and Ruby bringing up a
larger<00:02:51.960> tank<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.500> getting<00:02:52.830> caught<00:02:53.100> I

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
larger tank for so getting caught I

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.890 
larger tank for so getting caught I
guess<00:02:53.490> with<00:02:53.970> those<00:02:54.120> extra<00:02:54.420> machine<00:02:54.660> shops

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
guess with those extra machine shops

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.510 
guess with those extra machine shops
producing<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.410> lot<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.680> tanks<00:02:55.890> but<00:02:56.010> has<00:02:56.160> nothing

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
producing a lot of tanks but has nothing

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.710 
producing a lot of tanks but has nothing
to<00:02:56.640> do<00:02:56.910> with<00:02:57.060> those<00:02:57.150> rates<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.510> are<00:02:57.540> just

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
to do with those rates that are just

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.630 
to do with those rates that are just
kind<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.870> pecking<00:02:58.200> away<00:02:58.290> at<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.250> middle<00:02:59.520> I

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
kind of pecking away at the middle I

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.980 
kind of pecking away at the middle I
think<00:02:59.850> that's<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.060> more<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.420> nuisance<00:03:00.630> at

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
think that's just more of a nuisance at

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.480 
think that's just more of a nuisance at
the<00:03:01.050> moment<00:03:01.350> than<00:03:01.470> anything<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.430> a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
the moment than anything but it's a

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.970 
the moment than anything but it's a
little<00:03:02.730> bit<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.060> might<00:03:03.330> might<00:03:04.230> first<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.890> all

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
little bit that might might first of all

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.940 
little bit that might might first of all
that<00:03:05.130> scouting<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:06.150> might<00:03:06.420> give

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
that scouting and that might give

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.350 
that scouting and that might give
basically<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.520> Xion<00:03:08.730> some<00:03:09.000> time<00:03:09.210> to

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
basically for Xion some time to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.750 
basically for Xion some time to
reestablish<00:03:09.690> position<00:03:10.440> there<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.710> new<00:03:11.100> sneaky

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
reestablish position there a new sneaky

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.340 
reestablish position there a new sneaky
sneaky<00:03:12.090> sneaky<00:03:12.120> trying<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.900> go<00:03:12.990> for<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
sneaky sneaky trying to go for that

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.930 
sneaky sneaky trying to go for that
temple<00:03:13.710> backside<00:03:14.130> all<00:03:14.250> ready<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.430> tank<00:03:14.760> since

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
temple backside all ready to tank since

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.700 
temple backside all ready to tank since
each<00:03:15.180> position<00:03:15.510> along<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.380> edge<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.680> it

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
each position along that edge so it

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.560 
each position along that edge so it
needs<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.070> careful<00:03:17.400> though<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.330> looks

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
needs to be careful though and it looks

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.090 
needs to be careful though and it looks
like<00:03:18.690> yeah<00:03:19.110> some<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.620> more<00:03:19.770> vultures

yeah no weapons 14 confer Ruby on the
opposite<00:04:00.209> end<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.510> think<00:04:00.540> that's<00:04:00.810> going<00:04:00.900> to

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.240 
opposite end I think that's going to
hurt<00:04:01.080> him<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> mid<00:04:01.500> game<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.800> losing<00:04:02.130> that

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
hurt him to the mid game and losing that

hurt him to the mid game and losing that

so<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:57.699> is<00:04:57.789> going<00:04:57.909> to<00:04:57.969> work<00:04:58.060> out<00:04:58.240> well<00:04:58.419> for

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
so this is going to work out well for

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.140 
so this is going to work out well for
him<00:04:58.719> but<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.139> mine<00:04:59.379> in<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.710> way<00:04:59.860> nice<00:05:00.279> there<00:05:00.669> by

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
him but a mine in the way nice there by

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.730 
him but a mine in the way nice there by
Ruby<00:05:01.479> it<00:05:01.569> looks<00:05:01.719> like<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:01.870> comp<00:05:02.139> set<00:05:02.349> now<00:05:02.500> going

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
Ruby it looks like a comp set now going

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.019 
Ruby it looks like a comp set now going
off<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.949> clear<00:05:03.129> that<00:05:03.219> so<00:05:03.400> Ruby's<00:05:03.699> at<00:05:03.849> least

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:04.029 
off to clear that so Ruby's at least

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.879 
off to clear that so Ruby's at least
going<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:04.240> know<00:05:04.360> this<00:05:04.479> is<00:05:04.629> happening<00:05:04.810> but<00:05:05.740> the

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
going to know this is happening but the

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.379 
going to know this is happening but the
question<00:05:06.189> is<00:05:06.250> what<00:05:06.610> can<00:05:06.729> he<00:05:06.849> do<00:05:07.000> about<00:05:07.210> it

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
question is what can he do about it

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.730 
question is what can he do about it
looks<00:05:07.629> like<00:05:07.779> he<00:05:07.900> still<00:05:08.110> has<00:05:08.289> some<00:05:08.500> troops

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
looks like he still has some troops

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.170 
looks like he still has some troops
positioned<00:05:09.430> in<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.550> middle<00:05:09.699> of<00:05:09.759> Abaddon<00:05:10.029> oh

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
positioned in the middle of Abaddon oh

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.119 
positioned in the middle of Abaddon oh
nice<00:05:10.599> using<00:05:11.139> the<00:05:11.229> superior<00:05:12.009> move

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
nice using the superior move

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.219 
nice using the superior move
manoeuvrability<00:05:12.879> of<00:05:13.029> those<00:05:13.509> rates<00:05:13.750> to<00:05:13.960> try<00:05:14.169> to

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
manoeuvrability of those rates to try to

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.379 
manoeuvrability of those rates to try to
sneak<00:05:14.469> around<00:05:14.620> there<00:05:14.889> still<00:05:15.099> glide<00:05:15.340> there<00:05:15.669> but

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
sneak around there still glide there but

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.850 
sneak around there still glide there but
the<00:05:16.509> very<00:05:16.719> least<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.169> looked<00:05:17.379> like<00:05:17.529> and<00:05:17.770> it

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
the very least it looked like and it

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.439 
the very least it looked like and it
looks<00:05:18.039> like<00:05:18.189> some<00:05:18.699> more<00:05:18.819> stds<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.210> come<00:05:19.330> to

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
looks like some more stds to come to

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.290 
looks like some more stds to come to
repair<00:05:19.689> but<00:05:20.339> didn't<00:05:21.339> get<00:05:21.400> any<00:05:21.550> SUV<00:05:21.939> kills<00:05:22.150> and

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
repair but didn't get any SUV kills and

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.309 
repair but didn't get any SUV kills and
I<00:05:22.330> thought<00:05:22.539> if<00:05:22.659> he's<00:05:22.779> a<00:05:22.810> little<00:05:23.050> bit<00:05:23.139> more<00:05:23.229> on

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
I thought if he's a little bit more on

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:24.600 
I thought if he's a little bit more on
the<00:05:23.379> ball<00:05:23.500> he<00:05:23.650> might<00:05:23.770> get<00:05:23.919> one<00:05:24.099> or<00:05:24.129> two<00:05:24.250> before

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
the ball he might get one or two before

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.189 
the ball he might get one or two before
he<00:05:24.639> had<00:05:24.789> to<00:05:24.849> pull<00:05:24.999> out<00:05:25.180> just<00:05:25.389> against<00:05:26.050> that

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
he had to pull out just against that

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.839 
he had to pull out just against that
single<00:05:26.469> Goliath<00:05:26.830> not<00:05:27.069> going<00:05:27.279> to<00:05:27.339> do<00:05:27.460> so<00:05:27.639> ever

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
single Goliath not going to do so ever

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.450 
single Goliath not going to do so ever
but<00:05:28.259> more<00:05:29.259> tanks<00:05:29.469> moving<00:05:29.650> across<00:05:29.889> that<00:05:30.159> bottom

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
but more tanks moving across that bottom

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.279 
but more tanks moving across that bottom
edge<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.849> this<00:05:31.569> is<00:05:31.719> going<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.050> work<00:05:32.139> out

like a long that seed while he's doing

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.100 
like a long that seed while he's doing
the<00:05:48.639> same<00:05:48.789> thing<00:05:49.000> that<00:05:49.149> ruby<00:05:49.719> was<00:05:49.750> thinking

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
the same thing that ruby was thinking

the same thing that ruby was thinking

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
about doing earlier but I think that's

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.969 
about doing earlier but I think that's
more<00:05:51.580> for<00:05:51.759> isolation<00:05:52.210> tactics<00:05:52.750> to<00:05:53.139> keep<00:05:53.349> Ruby
