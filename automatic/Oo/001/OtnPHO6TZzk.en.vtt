00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:47.310 

very<00:02:28.520> loud<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:31.370> sounds<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:31.730> cool

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.680 

switch<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:49.070> you<00:02:49.130> can<00:02:49.310> turn<00:02:49.490> it<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:50.450> I

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
switch so you can turn it on and if I

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.340 
switch so you can turn it on and if I
think<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.320> will<00:02:51.440> then<00:02:51.740> go<00:02:52.670> by<00:02:53.060> itself<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.140> this

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
think it will then go by itself so this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.090 
think it will then go by itself so this
is<00:02:54.530> how<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.770> dreadmaster<00:02:55.610> big<00:02:56.150> flame<00:02:56.570> looks

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
is how the dreadmaster big flame looks

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.860 
is how the dreadmaster big flame looks
here<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.160> can<00:02:58.340> see<00:02:58.490> if<00:02:58.550> we<00:02:58.730> surprised<00:02:59.150> me<00:02:59.420> and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
here you can see if we surprised me and

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.250 
here you can see if we surprised me and
dry<00:03:00.440> me<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.860> says<00:03:01.150> what<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.180> did<00:03:02.480> here<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.780> tried

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
dry me it says what I did here I tried

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:14.490 
dry me it says what I did here I tried
to<00:03:03.410> turn<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.740> on

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.380 

so<00:03:15.500> both<00:03:15.740> the<00:03:16.100> switch<00:03:16.310> does<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.850> same<00:03:17.090> thing

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
so both the switch does the same thing

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:26.770 
so both the switch does the same thing
it<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:18.410> kind<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.070> hidden<00:03:25.420> Thank<00:03:26.420> You<00:03:26.540> viewer
