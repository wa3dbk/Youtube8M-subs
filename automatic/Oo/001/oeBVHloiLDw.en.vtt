00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
the iphone but obviously it's really

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.500 
the iphone but obviously it's really
hard<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.340> confirm<00:02:56.640> right<00:02:56.820> now<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
hard to confirm right now but it is the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.240 
hard to confirm right now but it is the
trend<00:02:57.810> that's<00:02:57.930> happening<00:02:58.200> starting<00:02:59.190> with

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
trend that's happening starting with

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.680 
trend that's happening starting with
motor<00:02:59.459> oil<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.730> some<00:02:59.910> other<00:03:00.030> companies<00:03:00.450> but

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
motor oil and some other companies but

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.880 
motor oil and some other companies but
that<00:03:00.959> leads<00:03:01.140> me<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> question<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.860> day
