00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the main challenges not only movement

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
the main challenges not only movement
which<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.649> come<00:01:01.800> across<00:01:01.980> those<00:01:02.250> challenges

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
which you come across those challenges

with<00:01:02.850> dancers<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.600> show<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.140> movement<00:01:04.979> isn't

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
with dancers and show so movement isn't

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
with dancers and show so movement isn't
so<00:01:05.610> much<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> issue<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.450> also<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.320> fact

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so much the issue but it's also the fact

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:23.130 
so much the issue but it's also the fact
that<00:01:07.619> they're<00:01:08.250> moving<00:01:08.369> much<00:01:08.640> faster

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.699 

for<00:01:24.140> speed<00:01:24.469> we<00:01:25.130> have<00:01:25.399> over<00:01:25.850> 240<00:01:26.630> costumes<00:01:27.200> just

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:27.709 
for speed we have over 240 costumes just

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:28.840 
for speed we have over 240 costumes just
when<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:27.979> think<00:01:28.130> you're<00:01:28.310> done<00:01:28.340> there<00:01:28.670> was<00:01:28.759> a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
when you think you're done there was a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.639 
when you think you're done there was a
couple<00:01:29.000> more<00:01:29.209> that<00:01:29.329> we<00:01:29.479> added<00:01:29.659> at<00:01:29.929> the<00:01:30.049> end<00:01:30.200> so

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
couple more that we added at the end so

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.419 
couple more that we added at the end so
I<00:01:30.890> think<00:01:31.310> we're<00:01:31.429> at<00:01:31.490> 242<00:01:32.420> total<00:01:32.899> costumes

I think we're at 242 total costumes
