00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330

probably<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.809> likely<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.440> yes<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.309> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
probably more likely to not yes when you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.279 
probably more likely to not yes when you

out<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.479> proposal<00:02:02.780> we<00:02:03.200> previously<00:02:03.530> made<00:02:03.950> before

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.129 
out a proposal we previously made before

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:08.830 
out a proposal we previously made before
to<00:02:07.129> address<00:02:07.459> an<00:02:07.640> issue<00:02:07.759> they'd<00:02:08.090> raised<00:02:08.390> about

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
to address an issue they'd raised about

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.510 
to address an issue they'd raised about
what<00:02:09.170> they<00:02:09.289> call<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.649> back<00:02:09.800> diving<00:02:10.220> contracts

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.610 

well<00:02:14.090> I'm<00:02:14.150> sure<00:02:14.330> what<00:02:14.600> essentially<00:02:15.320> that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
well I'm sure what essentially that

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.950 
well I'm sure what essentially that
proposal<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:16.880> has<00:02:17.060> previously

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
proposal was and this has previously

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.210 
proposal was and this has previously
been<00:02:18.050> known<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:18.590> what<00:02:18.680> essentially<00:02:18.980> that

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
been known but what essentially that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.630 
been known but what essentially that
proposal<00:02:19.760> was<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.150> if<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.290> have<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:21.980> contract

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
proposal was is if you have a contract

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.690 
proposal was is if you have a contract
in<00:02:22.850> which<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.810> player<00:02:24.220> doesn't<00:02:25.220> play<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
in which the player doesn't play the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.700 
in which the player doesn't play the
last<00:02:26.150> two<00:02:26.390> years<00:02:26.420> let's<00:02:26.900> say<00:02:26.990> of<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.320> nine<00:02:27.530> or<00:02:27.560> a

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
last two years let's say of a nine or a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.160 
last two years let's say of a nine or a
ten<00:02:27.950> year<00:02:28.100> contract<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.690> team<00:02:29.930> has

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
ten year contract and the team has

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.170 
ten year contract and the team has
received<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.800> benefit<00:02:31.250> in<00:02:31.310> terms<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.790> its<00:02:31.940> cap

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
received a benefit in terms of its cap

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.270 
received a benefit in terms of its cap
charge<00:02:32.540> because<00:02:33.020> those<00:02:33.380> years<00:02:33.710> were<00:02:33.860> averaged

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
charge because those years were averaged

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.550 
charge because those years were averaged
in<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.670> they<00:02:34.760> were<00:02:34.820> low<00:02:35.120> years<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:36.200> what<00:02:36.440> you

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
in and they were low years that what you

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.470 
in and they were low years that what you
do<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.010> recalculated<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.060> club<00:02:38.270> has

do is you recalculated and the club has

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.150 
do is you recalculated and the club has
that<00:02:38.690> cap<00:02:38.930> hit<00:02:39.200> over<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.470> remaining<00:02:39.860> term<00:02:40.130> of

that cap hit over the remaining term of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.730 
that cap hit over the remaining term of

the contract or a longer period that

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.890 
the contract or a longer period that
would<00:02:42.890> mimic<00:02:43.370> buyouts<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.360> keeps<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.840> a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
would mimic buyouts it keeps it a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.410 
would mimic buyouts it keeps it a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.199 

it's<00:03:03.200> really<00:03:03.680> well<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.400> think<00:03:04.489> two<00:03:04.790> things<00:03:04.819> to

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
it's really well I think two things to

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.550 
it's really well I think two things to
back<00:03:05.360> into<00:03:05.599> the<00:03:05.720> other<00:03:05.840> one<00:03:05.989> first<00:03:06.170> players

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
back into the other one first players

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.500 
back into the other one first players
are<00:03:06.769> very<00:03:06.920> interested<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.910> we<00:03:08.060> didn't<00:03:08.360> tell

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
are very interested and we didn't tell

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.119 
are very interested and we didn't tell
anybody<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.930> wants<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.379> come<00:03:09.530> they<00:03:09.739> can<00:03:09.920> come

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
anybody that wants to come they can come

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.000 
anybody that wants to come they can come
and<00:03:10.340> I'm<00:03:10.459> glad<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.879> have<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.180> them<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:12.260> i

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
and I'm glad to have all of them so i

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.040 
and I'm glad to have all of them so i
think<00:03:13.489> it's<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:14.060> reflection<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.930> how

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
think it's a a reflection of how

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.630 
think it's a a reflection of how
interested<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.650> involved<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.190> players<00:03:16.430> are

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
interested and involved the players are

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.410 
interested and involved the players are
that's<00:03:16.910> first<00:03:17.319> secondly<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:20.000> know<00:03:20.120> we<00:03:20.269> could

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
that's first secondly you know we could

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.729 
that's first secondly you know we could
have<00:03:20.540> taken<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.900> couple<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.200> weeks<00:03:21.290> off<00:03:21.560> i

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
have taken a couple of weeks off i

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.430 
have taken a couple of weeks off i
suppose<00:03:22.040> it's<00:03:22.819> hard<00:03:23.120> for<00:03:23.360> me<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.630> see<00:03:23.900> how<00:03:24.380> you

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
suppose it's hard for me to see how you

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.960 
suppose it's hard for me to see how you
make<00:03:24.830> an<00:03:24.950> agreement<00:03:25.190> if<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.519> aren't<00:03:25.819> talking

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
make an agreement if you aren't talking

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.440 
make an agreement if you aren't talking
and<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.260> talk<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:28.090> sometimes<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.420> doesn't

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
and so you talk and sometimes it doesn't

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.270 
and so you talk and sometimes it doesn't
lead<00:03:29.810> anywhere<00:03:29.840> perhaps<00:03:30.560> very<00:03:30.830> often<00:03:31.160> it

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
lead anywhere perhaps very often it

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.559 
lead anywhere perhaps very often it
doesn't<00:03:31.430> lead<00:03:31.670> anywhere<00:03:31.700> but<00:03:32.060> if<00:03:32.299> you<00:03:32.360> aren't

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
doesn't lead anywhere but if you aren't

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.300 
doesn't lead anywhere but if you aren't
talking<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.530> hundred<00:03:33.709> percent<00:03:34.069> sure<00:03:34.099> it

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
talking it's a hundred percent sure it

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.949 
talking it's a hundred percent sure it
doesn't<00:03:34.580> lead<00:03:34.670> anywhere<00:03:34.700> as<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.599> level<00:03:35.930> of

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
doesn't lead anywhere as the level of

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.380 
doesn't lead anywhere as the level of
interest<00:03:36.290> or<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.709> interest<00:03:37.040> from<00:03:37.579> certain
