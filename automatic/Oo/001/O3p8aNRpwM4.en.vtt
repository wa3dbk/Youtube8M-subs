command<00:02:15.860> spread<00:02:16.580> players<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.150> then<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:17.360> do

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
command spread players and then you do

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.120 
command spread players and then you do
your<00:02:17.540> ex<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.980> then<00:02:19.850> Y<00:02:19.910> or<00:02:20.060> Z<00:02:20.270> coordinates<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
your ex and then Y or Z coordinates and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.750 
your ex and then Y or Z coordinates and
then<00:02:22.960> minimum<00:02:23.960> space<00:02:24.260> between<00:02:24.530> players<00:02:24.890> so

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
then minimum space between players so

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.640 
then minimum space between players so
look<00:02:25.880> if<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.090> want<00:02:26.240> 200<00:02:26.840> space<00:02:27.200> at<00:02:27.440> least

look if you want 200 space at least
between<00:02:27.800> players<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:30.410> could<00:02:30.530> do<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.740> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
between players you could do that and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.660 
between players you could do that and
then<00:02:32.080> x<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.320> z<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:33.650> like<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.550> you're

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
then x and z is for like what you're

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.760 
then x and z is for like what you're
standing<00:02:35.030> right<00:02:35.060> now<00:02:35.300> it'll<00:02:36.140> spread<00:02:36.410> them<00:02:36.590> out

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
standing right now it'll spread them out

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.610 
standing right now it'll spread them out
randomly<00:02:37.640> around<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:40.420> with<00:02:41.620> minimum
