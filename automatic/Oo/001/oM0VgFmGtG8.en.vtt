over a week since I had my surgery on my

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.259 
over a week since I had my surgery on my
skate<00:00:07.259> faloona<00:00:07.529> ligament<00:00:08.189> doctor<00:00:09.000> said<00:00:09.240> that

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
skate faloona ligament doctor said that

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.110 
skate faloona ligament doctor said that
when<00:00:10.110> she<00:00:10.260> actually<00:00:10.380> got<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:10.830> there<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
when she actually got in there the the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.870 
when she actually got in there the the
ligament<00:00:12.660> wasn't<00:00:12.990> even<00:00:13.200> attaching<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.490> fish

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
ligament wasn't even attaching the fish

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.540 
ligament wasn't even attaching the fish
to<00:00:15.030> be<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.330> sea<00:00:15.570> fish<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.289> bones<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.130> begin<00:00:17.369> with

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
to be a sea fish the bones to begin with

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.810 
to be a sea fish the bones to begin with
she<00:00:17.850> could<00:00:17.970> freely<00:00:18.300> freely<00:00:18.810> move<00:00:19.289> them<00:00:19.500> around

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
she could freely freely move them around

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.779 
she could freely freely move them around
so<00:00:21.380> that's<00:00:22.380> always<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.580> good

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
so that's always a it's not like a good

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.599 
so that's always a it's not like a good
thing<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> hear<00:00:24.359> but<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.810> better<00:00:25.529> than<00:00:25.800> her

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
thing to hear but it is better than her

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.670 
thing to hear but it is better than her
saying<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.269> only<00:00:27.420> torn<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:27.930> 30

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
saying that was only torn about 30

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.169 
saying that was only torn about 30
percent<00:00:28.890> you'd<00:00:29.279> even<00:00:29.550> need<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> surgery<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
percent you'd even need the surgery to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.590 
percent you'd even need the surgery to
begin<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:32.099> really

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
begin with because that would really

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.799 
begin with because that would really
really<00:00:33.600> suck<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.940> found<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.630> what's

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
really suck so I found out what's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.549 
really suck so I found out what's
causing<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.200> pain<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.760> basically

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
causing the pain and it's basically

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:49.369 
causing the pain and it's basically
right<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.969> here<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:44.149> this<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:47.750> there<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:49.050> I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.830 
right in here so this and there you go I
got<00:00:50.190> three<00:00:50.430> pins<00:00:50.700> normally<00:00:51.390> she<00:00:51.539> said<00:00:51.719> she

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
got three pins normally she said she

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
got three pins normally she said she
only<00:00:51.960> puts<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.370> bad<00:00:53.579> she<00:00:53.610> had

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879

only puts two but it was so bad she had
to<00:00:53.910> put<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> third<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> third

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to put a third one in there the third

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.279 
to put a third one in there the third
one<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> bottom<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.960> actually

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
one is that bottom one and it's actually

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.049 
one is that bottom one and it's actually
pinching<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.010> nerve<00:01:00.590> in<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:02.100> which<00:01:02.699> basically

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
pinching a nerve in my which basically

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
pinching a nerve in my which basically
can<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.809> basically<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.619> my

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
can it's basically going to like my

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.080 
can it's basically going to like my
thumb<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:06.530> right<00:01:07.530> now<00:01:07.619> my<00:01:07.799> thumb's<00:01:08.040> numb<00:01:08.400> but

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
thumb so right now my thumb's numb but

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.080 
thumb so right now my thumb's numb but
just<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.080> moving<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.530> around<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
just like moving it around like that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.770 
just like moving it around like that
it's<00:01:12.090> hurts<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.680> hell<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.630> will

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's hurts like hell and it will

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
it's hurts like hell and it will
actually<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.890> cause<00:01:17.700> shooting<00:01:18.150> pain

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
actually just cause shooting pain

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
actually just cause shooting pain
through<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:19.049> thumb<00:01:19.909> from<00:01:20.909> my<00:01:21.060> wrist<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:22.530> it's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
through my thumb from my wrist and it's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.679 
through my thumb from my wrist and it's
definitely<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:23.790> fun<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.299> gotta<00:01:24.330> clean<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
definitely not fun so I gotta clean that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.590 
definitely not fun so I gotta clean that
thing<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.439> few<00:01:25.830> times<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.159> day<00:01:26.570> which<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
thing out a few times a day which is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
thing out a few times a day which is
hydrogen<00:01:28.020> peroxide<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:30.079> that's<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.619> this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
hydrogen peroxide and that's it so this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.240 
hydrogen peroxide and that's it so this
calf's<00:01:32.369> definitely<00:01:33.229> much<00:01:34.229> safer<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> feel

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
calf's definitely much safer or I feel

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.530 
calf's definitely much safer or I feel
much<00:01:35.369> more<00:01:35.430> secure<00:01:36.030> than<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.229> did<00:01:37.939> with<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
much more secure than I did with the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.749 
much more secure than I did with the
other<00:01:39.570> cast<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> post<00:01:40.740> off<00:01:40.920> cast<00:01:41.220> so

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
other cast like the post off cast so

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.819
