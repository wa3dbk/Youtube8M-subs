work<00:02:56.860> with<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.489> this<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:57.850> fun<00:02:58.150> where<00:02:58.450> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
work with it and this is fun where the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.470 
work with it and this is fun where the
child<00:02:58.810> can<00:02:59.080> respond<00:02:59.530> back<00:02:59.769> to<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.730> friend

eventually via the toy wall continue to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.560 
eventually via the toy wall continue to

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
contributed to make this happen and

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.090 
contributed to make this happen and
we've<00:03:28.060> moved<00:03:28.330> rapidly<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:29.590> get<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.830> where<00:03:29.950> we

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
we've moved rapidly to get to where we

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.410 
we've moved rapidly to get to where we
are<00:03:30.130> right<00:03:30.250> now<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.790> then<00:03:30.970> we're<00:03:31.120> not<00:03:31.150> going

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
are right now and then we're not going

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.690 
are right now and then we're not going
to<00:03:31.510> stop<00:03:31.780> our<00:03:32.110> vision<00:03:32.560> really<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.280> get<00:03:33.549> our

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
to stop our vision really is to get our

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.449 
to stop our vision really is to get our
technology<00:03:34.269> into<00:03:34.600> most<00:03:34.989> toys<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:35.920> toys

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
technology into most toys so that toys

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.650 
technology into most toys so that toys
are<00:03:36.820> not<00:03:36.850> only<00:03:37.209> affordable<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.530> fun<00:03:38.829> but

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
are not only affordable and fun but

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.120 
are not only affordable and fun but
educational<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.710> strong

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
educational you have to have a strong

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.250 
educational you have to have a strong
team<00:03:41.520> of<00:03:41.580> people<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:42.720> group<00:03:42.960> has<00:03:43.230> a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
team of people and this group has a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.940 
team of people and this group has a
strong<00:03:43.740> team<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.430> has<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.940> vision<00:03:45.360> beyond<00:03:46.260> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
strong team and has a vision beyond the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.090 
strong team and has a vision beyond the
initial<00:03:47.750> technology<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.960> they<00:03:49.110> have<00:03:49.290> so

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
initial technology that they have so

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.010 
initial technology that they have so
we're<00:03:50.400> taking<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.360> best<00:03:51.570> of<00:03:51.810> what's

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
we're taking the best of what's

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.660 
we're taking the best of what's
available<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.680> then<00:03:52.830> plugged<00:03:53.100> Watson<00:03:53.460> into

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
available and then plugged Watson into

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.210 
available and then plugged Watson into
it<00:03:53.790> as<00:03:53.910> far<00:03:54.090> as<00:03:54.210> being<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.600> brain<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:56.040> made

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
it as far as being the brain and we made

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.370 
it as far as being the brain and we made
something<00:03:56.520> just<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.690> really<00:03:57.990> really

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
something just just really really

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.530 
something just just really really
awesome<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.220> we<00:03:59.400> give<00:03:59.580> quantifiable<00:04:00.480> results

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
awesome and we give quantifiable results

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.840 
awesome and we give quantifiable results
via<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.170> parent<00:04:01.440> panel<00:04:01.740> so<00:04:02.220> there's<00:04:02.370> no<00:04:02.550> smoke

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
via the parent panel so there's no smoke

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.300 
via the parent panel so there's no smoke
and<00:04:02.880> mirrors<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.750> gives<00:04:04.020> parents<00:04:04.260> access<00:04:04.920> to

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
and mirrors this gives parents access to

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.340 
and mirrors this gives parents access to
