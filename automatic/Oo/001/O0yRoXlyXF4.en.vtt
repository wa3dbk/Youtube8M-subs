you can share you can share many things
but<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.930> thing<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.880> since<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.120> HTC<00:00:39.750> one

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
but the the thing is since the HTC one

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.400 
but the the thing is since the HTC one
it's<00:00:40.110> made<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.830> aluminium<00:00:41.610> body<00:00:42.410> it

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it's made of an aluminium body it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.450 
it's made of an aluminium body it
actually<00:00:43.710> does<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.430> work<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.730> well<00:00:45.120> with

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
actually does not work that well with

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.420 
actually does not work that well with
NFC<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:48.380> because<00:00:49.380> NFC<00:00:49.860> actually<00:00:50.250> works

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
NFC because because NFC actually works

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
NFC because because NFC actually works
smoothly<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.270> perfectly<00:00:51.450> with<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.440> phones

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
smoothly and perfectly with the phones

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.190 
smoothly and perfectly with the phones
with<00:00:52.980> plastic<00:00:53.460> devices<00:00:53.760> that's<00:00:54.200> negative

side<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> phone<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:57.390> again<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
side of the phone but then again the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.390 
side of the phone but then again the
build<00:00:58.140> quality<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.620> something<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> matters

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
build quality is something that matters

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.670 
build quality is something that matters
doesn't<00:00:59.610> it<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:02.390> how<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.450> you<00:01:03.600> turn<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.229> NFC

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
doesn't it so how do you turn on the NFC

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.580 
doesn't it so how do you turn on the NFC
is<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:05.910> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> show<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.360> now<00:01:06.590> first
