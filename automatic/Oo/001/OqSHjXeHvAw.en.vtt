 You can get some weapons. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.310
 in the game is very simple. 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 galley is not a box bug here 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.420
 What makes some misses do? 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.760
 a medical mission within the g8 and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.430
 layoffs 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.640
 Can you get these weapons? 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.780
 to show you here how to get 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.790

 on top but yes but do not know 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.989
 to worry 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.940
 showing how to take this new toque 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 First of all, I advise you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.070
 stay as soon as you do not stay in the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.579
 middle of the street so be very old 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.340
 This is because you will see the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.120
 oligarch equipment or adr of the following 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.120
 way to adr 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.609

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:32.369
 seconds what was it already passed 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.710

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.910

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.050
 the number is very close to that of houses and 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.790
 no buildings can happen even in the building 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.549

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.050
 Throw the rocket is pretty easy to jazz 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.620

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.190
 of war and that flamethrower does not have 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.350

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.360

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.720

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:32.270

 You can see the forrÃ³ here. 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.420
 It's time I already got the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.780
 The research weapon can then take 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.090
 Sometimes you just catch it, you only 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.710
 killed those caroli that the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.630

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.320
 and some of them will change a screen 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.870
 also remembering what you need to call 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.480
 friends in the room and will not have to 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.760

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.510

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.510
 things he will bring the paulo 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.330

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.250
 Can you see the guys watch me get sex? 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.440
 but such an order that I took the gun here 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.069
 only if I change the section they will 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.069
 climb 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.199
 I do not know why it goes up because I do not know if 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.629
 I had this brand of model that the 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.610
 I already have walls, but I bought it. 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.349
 This group yesterday on the day of 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.539
 independence in the United States is 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.199
 so for those who do not know 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:07.180
 yesterday a new thing arrived there is and today 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.979
 It's no longer on the day of 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.409
 independence that these things well 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.610
 So I bought yesterday not for anyone who does not 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:21.190
 got to get things there yesterday had 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:23.500
 money or why not because 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.330
 You did not even know the day. 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.060
 So here's the tip, you gotta get these 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.360
 vagas so now you vote for 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:36.819
 How do you guys get it? 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.930
 baseball bat and the balance of 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.610
 cabal 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:55.050
 then you will see that the services 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:58.409
 cypress services something in this 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.699
 fifth mission here 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:05.039
 and without it and you also need to call 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:10.229
 your friends to samarco - I think one 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:16.219
 person will start a service called 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:19.589
 here the colleague so people are here 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:22.830
 I called my friends here and we go. 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:27.689
 that the last survivor is 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:33.059
 the following for you to get the tacutacu 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:34.800
 three of the flight or try to remember that the 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:38.120
 shakira that grabs 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.740
 I think I needed to travel. 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.740
 let's go there 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:50.610
 here is so so I thought what the 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.550
 baseball bat is it's just that I've 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:58.380
 I had applied because I caught again 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:07:02.300
 and to find the crowbar a foot of 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.300
 goat that should be here 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:12.960
 the people to get a goat foot you 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.610
 they got the crowbar 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.240
 it will be here on the map are also 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.740
 you try to straighten out what 's there if 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.730
 They can see I've got the taco 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.670
 baseball 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:27.450
 only he soon managed to call himself his 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:29.250
 friends, because if someone picks it up already 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.470
 it was late for everyone who is new 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.900
 to be able to pick up again then're guys 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.810
