the outside and kind of take out these
gold<00:03:38.190> storages<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.420> pekus<00:03:39.780> can<00:03:39.989> get<00:03:40.139> right

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
gold storages so the pekus can get right

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.289 
gold storages so the pekus can get right

so the wall breakers get that wall open

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.460 
so the wall breakers get that wall open
and<00:03:45.120> now<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.389> a<00:03:45.480> straight<00:03:45.780> shot<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.200> town

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
why that tech on the right side just

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.710 
why that tech on the right side just
went<00:04:29.460> right<00:04:29.640> past<00:04:29.909> the<00:04:30.090> archer<00:04:30.330> tower<00:04:30.479> but

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
the way on the left side they were in

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.680 
the way on the left side they were in
Center<00:04:35.370> I'm<00:04:35.490> not<00:04:35.670> sure<00:04:35.820> how<00:04:36.000> they<00:04:36.210> got<00:04:36.630> to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
Center I'm not sure how they got to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.810 
Center I'm not sure how they got to
either<00:04:36.960> side<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.500> base<00:04:37.650> but<00:04:37.980> you<00:04:38.670> know

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
either side of the base but you know

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.700 
either side of the base but you know
that's<00:04:39.420> kind<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.020> pecker<00:04:40.200> works<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.680> just

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
that's kind of the pecker works it just

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.500 
that's kind of the pecker works it just
goes<00:04:41.010> wherever<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.460> wants<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.180> now<00:04:42.360> we're

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
goes wherever it wants and now we're
