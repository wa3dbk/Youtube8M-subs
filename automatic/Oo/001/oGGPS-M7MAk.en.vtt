it's<00:01:32.119> designed<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.479> be<00:01:32.599> intelligent<00:01:33.109> so<00:01:33.289> you

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:33.349 
it's designed to be intelligent so you

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.199 
it's designed to be intelligent so you
can<00:01:33.529> tell<00:01:33.709> it<00:01:33.799> to<00:01:33.859> backup<00:01:34.310> every<00:01:34.609> so<00:01:34.819> many<00:01:34.880> days

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
can tell it to backup every so many days

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.599 
can tell it to backup every so many days
at<00:01:35.569> a<00:01:35.599> certain<00:01:35.990> time<00:01:36.200> only<00:01:37.039> when<00:01:37.340> it's<00:01:37.459> plugged

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
at a certain time only when it's plugged

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.269 
at a certain time only when it's plugged
in<00:01:37.849> only<00:01:38.329> when<00:01:38.509> it's<00:01:38.599> connected<00:01:38.779> to<00:01:38.959> Wi-Fi

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:39.279 
in only when it's connected to Wi-Fi

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:42.190 
in only when it's connected to Wi-Fi
basically<00:01:40.279> customize<00:01:40.819> it<00:01:41.029> however<00:01:41.599> you<00:01:41.929> want
