just is like weightless on this thing
this<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:18.950> probably<00:04:19.130> not<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.489> best<00:04:19.609> way<00:04:19.850> to

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
this is probably not the best way to

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.270 
this is probably not the best way to
handle<00:04:20.209> your<00:04:20.450> mouse<00:04:20.630> by<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.079> way<00:04:21.260> just<00:04:21.890> trying

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
handle your mouse by the way just trying

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.360 
handle your mouse by the way just trying
to<00:04:22.400> prove<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.760> point<00:04:23.229> so<00:04:24.229> this<00:04:24.950> is<00:04:24.979> a<00:04:25.130> very

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
to prove a point so this is a very

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.290 
to prove a point so this is a very
slippery<00:04:26.360> surface<00:04:26.870> so

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
slippery surface so

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.570 
slippery surface so
you<00:04:27.360> want<00:04:27.539> make<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.080> lot<00:04:28.379> it<00:04:28.530> won't<00:04:28.740> snag<00:04:29.310> on

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
you want make a lot it won't snag on

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
performance if you once you've learned

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.899 
performance if you once you've learned
how<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.270> use<00:05:24.479> it<00:05:24.690> so<00:05:25.289> once<00:05:25.949> you<00:05:26.190> change<00:05:26.669> your

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
how to use it so once you change your

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.529 
how to use it so once you change your
dpi<00:05:27.949> you'll<00:05:28.949> notice<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.310> if<00:05:29.789> I<00:05:29.969> go<00:05:30.000> lower<00:05:30.419> on

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
dpi you'll notice that if I go lower on

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.459 
dpi you'll notice that if I go lower on
the<00:05:30.810> DPI<00:05:31.139> more<00:05:31.919> you<00:05:32.190> need<00:05:32.370> more<00:05:32.639> motion<00:05:33.090> to<00:05:33.469> to

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
the DPI more you need more motion to to

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.800 
the DPI more you need more motion to to
move<00:05:34.889> your<00:05:35.039> mouse<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.580> if<00:05:36.419> i<00:05:36.479> increase<00:05:36.719> the

move your mouse and if i increase the
GPI<00:05:37.199> just<00:05:37.770> you<00:05:38.099> just<00:05:38.370> take<00:05:38.639> a<00:05:38.669> small<00:05:39.150> super

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
GPI just you just take a small super

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.379 
GPI just you just take a small super
small<00:05:40.020> nudge<00:05:40.319> and<00:05:40.710> it'll<00:05:41.340> affect<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.969> the

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
small nudge and it'll affect the the

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.959 
small nudge and it'll affect the the
pointer<00:05:42.750> what<00:05:43.740> this<00:05:43.889> happens<00:05:44.310> on<00:05:44.430> your<00:05:44.699> games

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
pointer what this happens on your games

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.629 
pointer what this happens on your games
is<00:05:45.270> that<00:05:45.479> when<00:05:45.750> you<00:05:45.900> want<00:05:45.930> more<00:05:46.409> you<00:05:46.949> want<00:05:47.460> more

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
is that when you want more you want more

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.999 
is that when you want more you want more
position<00:05:48.150> i<00:05:48.270> guess<00:05:48.479> you<00:05:49.139> can<00:05:49.289> lower<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.680> DPI

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
position i guess you can lower the DPI

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.730 
position i guess you can lower the DPI
and<00:05:50.310> move<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.639> in<00:05:50.819> and<00:05:51.180> your<00:05:51.419> your<00:05:51.870> aim<00:05:52.229> will

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
and move it in and your your aim will

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.939 
and move it in and your your aim will
move<00:05:52.919> slowly<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:54.240> pinpoint<00:05:55.169> certain<00:05:55.560> parts<00:05:55.830> of

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
move slowly to pinpoint certain parts of

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.510 
move slowly to pinpoint certain parts of
your<00:05:56.639> enemy<00:05:56.969> I<00:05:57.120> guess<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.719> if<00:05:58.650> you<00:05:58.800> move<00:05:59.009> it<00:05:59.219> hi

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
your enemy I guess and if you move it hi

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.589 
your enemy I guess and if you move it hi
you<00:06:00.060> get<00:06:00.360> go<00:06:00.979> really<00:06:01.979> fast<00:06:02.279> if<00:06:02.610> you<00:06:02.759> need<00:06:02.940> quick

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
you get go really fast if you need quick

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.040 
you get go really fast if you need quick
turns<00:06:04.409> or<00:06:04.770> other<00:06:05.250> fast<00:06:05.879> move<00:06:06.180> fast<00:06:06.389> movements

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
turns or other fast move fast movements

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.339 
turns or other fast move fast movements
facts<00:06:07.229> aiming<00:06:07.620> you<00:06:08.279> can<00:06:08.460> go<00:06:08.610> with<00:06:08.759> high<00:06:08.879> DPI<00:06:09.349> so

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
facts aiming you can go with high DPI so

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.260 
facts aiming you can go with high DPI so
that's<00:06:10.529> about<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.740> I<00:06:11.159> guess<00:06:11.639> let's<00:06:11.879> play<00:06:12.090> some

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
that's about it I guess let's play some

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:22.490 
that's about it I guess let's play some
games

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500

alright<00:07:13.330> so<00:07:13.570> that's<00:07:13.690> about<00:07:14.080> it<00:07:14.110> for<00:07:14.320> the<00:07:14.710> CM

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
alright so that's about it for the CM
