00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.820
 do not 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.160
 hello youtube friends this is the channel 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.670
 of w gamer and today I want 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.560
 tell them about kenya craft 0.11 point zero 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.050
 maybe the leader will be added today in 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.390
 day we have the meder reactor but it is not 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.820
 the full portal at this time 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.370
 I will teach this assumption concepts about 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.559
 lead in the craft Pocket Edition 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.750
 shows how the portal is from the outside 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.640
 inside inside you see one of the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.530
 many called gas that I'll talk about 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.660
 of the level bots a first engine 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.640
 main and what can not be missing is the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.070
 gas is this creature that is seen in the 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.560
 concept that we now see this has 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.540
 the power to fly mainly so 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.640
 that is a ghost throws balls of fire 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.070
 and now other of the mods that there is is 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.229
 this the juice of magma we are jumps and 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.240
 it looks like this is how the clouds line that 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.850
 we have now but this one is from the vall 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.010
 next would be the emblaze that would be that 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.380
 he can plan to vote not to 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.600
 die throws balls of fire to carry 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.670
 well these were the neder mods and for 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.619
 what spoke of the leader because in a list 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.420
 of a tomaso tweeter gives us 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.920
 understand in the tweet that this is what 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.930
 he wants to get him out in the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.729
 and update in this image which 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.340
 you see the never as signaled for 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.680
 future updates and that's why I said 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.200
 same as I guess for the 0.11 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.659
 zero point will be added neder since 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.490
 is indicated in the good view this was 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.770
 everything give me a like for the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.200
 research that I did subscribe for 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.390

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.970
