what's<00:00:00.210> going<00:00:00.539> on<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.810> Bob<00:00:01.260> Buskirk<00:00:01.650> here

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
what's going on guys Bob Buskirk here

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.889 
what's going on guys Bob Buskirk here
again<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.100> think<00:00:02.310> computers<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.750> we're

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
again I think computers and today we're

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.960 
again I think computers and today we're
taking<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.170> look<00:00:04.290> at<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.890> king<00:00:05.190> one<00:00:05.430> laser

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
taking a look at the king one laser

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.030 
taking a look at the king one laser
platinum<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.629> thousand-watt<00:00:07.290> modular<00:00:07.859> power

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
platinum a thousand-watt modular power

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.220 
platinum a thousand-watt modular power
supply<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.820> as<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.599> can<00:00:09.719> guess<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.900> reason

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
supply and as you can guess the reason

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.540 
supply and as you can guess the reason
why<00:00:10.440> it's<00:00:10.559> called<00:00:10.710> laser<00:00:10.920> platinum<00:00:11.429> is

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
why it's called laser platinum is

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.749 
why it's called laser platinum is
because<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.660> 80<00:00:13.349> plus<00:00:13.799> platinum<00:00:13.830> certified

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
because it's 80 plus platinum certified

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.609 
because it's 80 plus platinum certified
and<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.179> means<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and what that means is it's one of the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.109 
and what that means is it's one of the
most<00:00:16.740> efficient<00:00:17.250> power<00:00:17.369> supplies<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.940> there

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
most efficient power supplies out there

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.330 
most efficient power supplies out there
you<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.420> get<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.840> will<00:00:19.289> run<00:00:19.470> at<00:00:19.710> ninety-two

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
you can get it will run at ninety-two

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.519 
you can get it will run at ninety-two
percent<00:00:20.369> efficient<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.480> fifty<00:00:22.020> percent<00:00:22.289> load

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
percent efficient at fifty percent load

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.800 
percent efficient at fifty percent load
in<00:00:22.800> eighty-seven<00:00:23.490> percent<00:00:23.519> efficient<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.539> one

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
in eighty-seven percent efficient at one

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.509 
in eighty-seven percent efficient at one
hundred<00:00:24.869> percent<00:00:25.050> load<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.680> let's<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.369> get

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
hundred percent load so let's just get

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.769 
hundred percent load so let's just get
to<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> good<00:00:26.820> part<00:00:26.880> open<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.689> check

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
to the good part open it up and check

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:38.029 
to the good part open it up and check
out<00:00:28.199> what's<00:00:28.349> inside

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.100 

so<00:00:39.039> the<00:00:39.190> box<00:00:39.370> is<00:00:39.550> pretty<00:00:39.610> plain<00:00:40.059> on<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.719> front

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
so the box is pretty plain on the front

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.229 
so the box is pretty plain on the front
kinguin<00:00:42.040> has<00:00:42.309> a<00:00:42.340> picture<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.059> power

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
kinguin has a picture of the power

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.689 
kinguin has a picture of the power
supply<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.379> lets<00:00:44.559> us<00:00:44.680> know<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:44.890> it<00:00:45.160> is<00:00:45.309> 80

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
supply and it lets us know that it is 80

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.579 
supply and it lets us know that it is 80
plus<00:00:45.969> platinum<00:00:46.059> certified<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.079> it<00:00:47.440> is<00:00:47.559> a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
plus platinum certified and it is a

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.829 
plus platinum certified and it is a
thousand<00:00:48.100> watt<00:00:48.190> power<00:00:48.430> supply<00:00:48.519> now<00:00:49.329> on<00:00:49.600> the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
thousand watt power supply now on the

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.189 
thousand watt power supply now on the
back<00:00:50.050> here<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:51.129> have<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.960> listing<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:53.079> the

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
back here you have a listing of the

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.290 
back here you have a listing of the
features<00:00:53.680> and<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.579> tells<00:00:54.729> you<00:00:54.909> a<00:00:54.970> little<00:00:55.089> bit

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
features and it tells you a little bit

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.500 
features and it tells you a little bit
about<00:00:55.479> the<00:00:56.250> ecotel<00:00:57.250> intelligent<00:00:58.120> thermal

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
about the ecotel intelligent thermal

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.420 
about the ecotel intelligent thermal
control<00:00:58.870> system<00:00:58.930> what<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.620> does<00:00:59.860> is<00:00:59.890> it<00:01:00.220> will

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
control system what that does is it will

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.819 
control system what that does is it will
increase<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.210> fan<00:01:01.449> speed<00:01:01.629> as<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.019> power

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
increase the fan speed as the power

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.439 
increase the fan speed as the power
supply<00:01:03.070> heats<00:01:03.399> up<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:03.760> gets<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.360> certain

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
supply heats up and gets to a certain

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.359 
supply heats up and gets to a certain
temperature<00:01:05.050> obviously<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:05.950> will<00:01:06.159> decrease

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
temperature obviously it will decrease

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.630 
temperature obviously it will decrease
when<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.570> temperature<00:01:08.020> goes<00:01:08.350> down<00:01:08.409> now<00:01:09.340> I'm

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
when the temperature goes down now I'm

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.190 
when the temperature goes down now I'm
getting<00:01:09.880> inside<00:01:10.360> here<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.660> pretty<00:01:10.750> simple

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
getting inside here is pretty simple

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.419 
getting inside here is pretty simple
actually<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:13.090> lift<00:01:13.300> this<00:01:13.450> up<00:01:13.690> here<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.429> we

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
actually just lift this up here and we

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.290 
actually just lift this up here and we
can<00:01:15.670> see<00:01:15.910> inside<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:18.220> have<00:01:18.490> your<00:01:18.789> user's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
can see inside you have your user's

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.499 
can see inside you have your user's
manual<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:20.640> set<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.850> thumb<00:01:22.390> screws<00:01:22.690> here<00:01:22.960> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
manual a set of thumb screws here and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.149 
manual a set of thumb screws here and
looks<00:01:25.509> like<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.720> have<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.899> nice<00:01:26.200> pretty<00:01:26.770> thick

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
looks like you have a nice pretty thick

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.210 
looks like you have a nice pretty thick
power<00:01:27.490> cable<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:29.380> guessing<00:01:29.710> this<00:01:29.890> bag

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
power cable and I'm guessing this bag

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.630 
power cable and I'm guessing this bag
has<00:01:30.550> all<00:01:30.909> your<00:01:31.300> cables<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:33.490> actually

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
has all your cables and you actually

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.930 
has all your cables and you actually
have<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:33.970> power<00:01:34.179> supplies<00:01:34.630> nicely<00:01:35.110> packaged

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
have the power supplies nicely packaged

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.690 
have the power supplies nicely packaged
it<00:01:36.940> looks<00:01:37.119> like<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:38.409> our<00:01:38.649> journal<00:01:39.550> power

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
it looks like a little our journal power

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.889 
it looks like a little our journal power
supply<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:41.429> it's<00:01:42.429> not<00:01:42.670> overly<00:01:43.270> large<00:01:43.539> but<00:01:43.810> it

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
supply but it's not overly large but it

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.389 
supply but it's not overly large but it
definitely<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.380> longer<00:01:44.860> from<00:01:45.009> what<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.160> can<00:01:45.250> see

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
definitely is longer from what I can see

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.190 
definitely is longer from what I can see
it<00:01:45.819> is<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.030> thousand<00:01:46.450> watt<00:01:46.539> power<00:01:46.750> supply<00:01:46.840> so

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
it is a thousand watt power supply so

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.900 
it is a thousand watt power supply so
anytime<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.709> you<00:01:48.190> usually<00:01:48.340> go<00:01:48.670> over<00:01:48.880> a

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
anytime you you usually go over a

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.150 
anytime you you usually go over a
thousand<00:01:49.360> watch<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.720> power<00:01:49.929> supply<00:01:50.160> does

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
thousand watch the power supply does

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.410 
thousand watch the power supply does
tend<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.700> be<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:52.090> bit<00:01:52.200> larger<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:54.729> as<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.060> can

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
tend to be a bit larger now as you can

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.880 
tend to be a bit larger now as you can
see<00:01:55.629> here<00:01:56.020> on<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.470> front<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:57.750> has<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:59.170> penguin

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
see here on the front it has a penguin

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.729 
see here on the front it has a penguin
logo<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.640> lift<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.090> up<00:02:01.179> so<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.360> can<00:02:01.509> see<00:02:01.739> so

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739 
logo and lift it up so you can see so

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.559 
logo and lift it up so you can see so
you<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.129> Kingman<00:02:03.550> logo<00:02:03.879> there<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.090> white

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
you have the Kingman logo there a white

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.410 
you have the Kingman logo there a white
fan<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.890> pretty<00:02:06.099> large<00:02:06.340> fan<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:06.879> the<00:02:07.179> side

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
fan it's pretty large fan on the side

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.080 
fan it's pretty large fan on the side
here<00:02:07.660> it's<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.989> sticker<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:09.099> says<00:02:09.550> laser

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
here it's just a sticker that says laser

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.050 
here it's just a sticker that says laser
platinum<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.260> top<00:02:11.470> obviously<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:12.879> have

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
platinum on the top obviously you have

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.059 
platinum on the top obviously you have
your<00:02:13.209> output<00:02:13.629> graph<00:02:13.930> which<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.800> pretty<00:02:14.950> much

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
your output graph which is pretty much

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.059 
your output graph which is pretty much
all<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.569> same<00:02:16.599> on<00:02:16.810> every<00:02:17.140> power<00:02:17.410> supply<00:02:17.830> and

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
all the same on every power supply and

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.520 
all the same on every power supply and
then<00:02:18.340> looking<00:02:18.670> at<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.660> side<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.140> where<00:02:20.290> all

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
then looking at this side is where all

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.500 
then looking at this side is where all
your<00:02:20.709> connections<00:02:20.980> go<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.610> once<00:02:22.120> we<00:02:22.209> take<00:02:22.480> a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
your connections go and once we take a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.509 
your connections go and once we take a
look<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.440> modular<00:02:23.890> cables<00:02:24.220> you'll<00:02:24.340> see

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
look at the modular cables you'll see

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.440 
look at the modular cables you'll see
why<00:02:24.640> these<00:02:24.700> connections<00:02:25.120> are<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.690> but

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
why these connections are like this but

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.520 
why these connections are like this but
there<00:02:28.450> did<00:02:28.750> they're<00:02:28.900> different<00:02:29.290> than<00:02:29.379> most

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
there did they're different than most

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.930 
there did they're different than most
power<00:02:29.830> supplies<00:02:30.129> that<00:02:30.280> we've<00:02:30.430> seen<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.819> I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
power supplies that we've seen and I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.330 
power supplies that we've seen and I
like<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.239> they<00:02:31.450> do<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:32.040> cover<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.250> if

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
like it that they do have cover so if

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.830 
like it that they do have cover so if
you're<00:02:33.459> not<00:02:33.550> using<00:02:33.819> them<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.269> don't<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.660> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
you're not using them you don't have the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.839 
you're not using them you don't have the
open<00:02:35.140> connections<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.550> can<00:02:36.700> keep

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
open connections like that you can keep

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.290 
open connections like that you can keep
them<00:02:37.000> covered<00:02:37.239> up<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:38.040> then<00:02:39.040> right<00:02:40.030> here<00:02:40.060> you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
them covered up and then right here you

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.990 
them covered up and then right here you
can<00:02:40.599> see<00:02:40.780> where<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.290> actual<00:02:41.769> cables<00:02:42.580> go<00:02:42.730> in

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
can see where the actual cables go in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.170 
can see where the actual cables go in
and<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.989> protected<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:45.190> sometimes<00:02:45.939> you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
and it is protected so sometimes you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.660 
and it is protected so sometimes you
won't<00:02:46.420> actually<00:02:46.780> see<00:02:47.439> this<00:02:47.980> protected<00:02:48.579> so

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
won't actually see this protected so

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.520 
won't actually see this protected so
when<00:02:48.790> you're<00:02:48.909> moving<00:02:49.180> your<00:02:49.269> tables<00:02:49.629> around

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
when you're moving your tables around

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.710 
when you're moving your tables around
will<00:02:50.680> actually<00:02:51.160> fray<00:02:51.850> your<00:02:52.030> tables<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:52.600> this

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
will actually fray your tables but this

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.780 
will actually fray your tables but this
is<00:02:52.870> nicely<00:02:53.050> protect<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> which<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.100> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
is nicely protect it which I like the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.640 
is nicely protect it which I like the
other<00:02:54.910> side<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.330> playing<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.990> on<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.470> back

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
other side is playing and on the back

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.350 
other side is playing and on the back
here<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.800> is<00:02:59.950> open<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:00.970> that

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
here all you have it is open so that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.480 
here all you have it is open so that
does<00:03:01.660> provide<00:03:01.990> extra<00:03:02.350> cooling<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.280> just

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
does provide extra cooling and you just

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.699 
does provide extra cooling and you just
have<00:03:03.670> your<00:03:03.700> power<00:03:04.060> switch<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.810> power

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
have your power switch and power

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.680 
have your power switch and power
connector<00:03:06.280> now<00:03:06.880> taking<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.390> look<00:03:07.540> at<00:03:07.600> the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
connector now taking a look at the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.300 
connector now taking a look at the
connectors<00:03:08.080> they<00:03:08.230> do<00:03:08.410> come<00:03:08.620> in<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:08.830> nice<00:03:09.040> bag

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
connectors they do come in this nice bag

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.890 
connectors they do come in this nice bag
as<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.819> said<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.880> they<00:03:12.880> use<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.270> flat<00:03:13.510> cable

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
as I said and they use the flat cable

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.890 
as I said and they use the flat cable
system<00:03:14.760> I'm<00:03:15.760> not<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.940> huge<00:03:16.090> fan<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.390> flat<00:03:16.600> cable

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
system I'm not a huge fan of flat cable

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900 
system I'm not a huge fan of flat cable
system<00:03:17.200> but<00:03:17.350> what<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.500> mean<00:03:17.739> by<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.220> these

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
system but what I mean by that is these

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.150 
system but what I mean by that is these
cables<00:03:19.450> are<00:03:19.630> made<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.290> be<00:03:20.380> flat<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:21.010> they're

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
cables are made to be flat so they're

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.830 
cables are made to be flat so they're
easier<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.580> move<00:03:21.819> around<00:03:21.940> inside<00:03:22.330> your<00:03:22.660> case

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
easier to move around inside your case

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.300 
easier to move around inside your case
and<00:03:23.050> you<00:03:23.110> can<00:03:23.230> see<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.500> connections<00:03:23.980> as<00:03:24.160> I

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
and you can see the connections as I

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.170 
and you can see the connections as I
said<00:03:24.720> they're<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.900> square<00:03:26.410> type<00:03:26.800> of

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
said they're the square type of

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.060 
said they're the square type of
connectors<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.480> let's<00:03:29.470> take<00:03:29.830> all<00:03:29.980> these

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
connectors and let's take all these

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.440 
connectors and let's take all these
cables<00:03:30.489> out<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.760> see<00:03:30.940> what<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.180> have<00:03:31.420> here<00:03:33.450> it

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
cables out and see what we have here it

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:44.940 
cables out and see what we have here it
looks<00:03:34.840> like<00:03:36.450> put<00:03:37.450> them<00:03:37.569> in<00:03:37.690> order<00:03:37.959> here<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.560> on

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
looks like put them in order here so on

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.860 
looks like put them in order here so on
the<00:03:45.160> modular<00:03:45.610> cable<00:03:46.000> side<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.360> have<00:03:46.540> three

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
the modular cable side you have three

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.949 
the modular cable side you have three
sets<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:48.269> SATA<00:03:49.269> connectors<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:50.830> have<00:03:50.980> 12<00:03:51.959> sets

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
sets of SATA connectors you have 12 sets

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.850 
sets of SATA connectors you have 12 sets
of<00:03:54.630> molex<00:03:55.630> connectors<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:57.310> have<00:03:57.640> three

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
of molex connectors and you have three

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.430 
of molex connectors and you have three
PCI<00:03:59.860> Express<00:04:00.190> connectors<00:04:00.670> along<00:04:01.120> with<00:04:01.480> what's

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
PCI Express connectors along with what's

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.910 
PCI Express connectors along with what's
all<00:04:02.620> included<00:04:02.920> on<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.610> power<00:04:03.790> supply<00:04:04.060> itself

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
all included on the power supply itself

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.190 
all included on the power supply itself
so<00:04:05.920> there<00:04:06.070> is<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.220> lot<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.570> cables<00:04:07.570> this<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.900> this

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
so there is a lot of cables this is this

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.930
