00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
scheme we were going with this I was

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.689 
scheme we were going with this I was
matching<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.180> previous<00:00:19.279> color<00:00:20.279> scheme<00:00:20.580> which

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
matching a previous color scheme which

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.880 
matching a previous color scheme which
is<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:21.090> bit<00:00:21.210> more<00:00:21.420> gray<00:00:21.810> than<00:00:21.840> blue<00:00:22.260> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
is a little bit more gray than blue and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.609 
is a little bit more gray than blue and
the<00:00:23.699> client<00:00:24.060> sent<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.510> piece<00:00:24.750> right<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.470> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that's basically the client gives me

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.509 
that's basically the client gives me
something<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.289> okay<00:00:28.490> take<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
make it look awesome right so on the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.260 
make it look awesome right so on the
weathering<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.050> did<00:00:37.260> more<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:41.149> when<00:00:42.149> you

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
weathering I did more of like a when you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
weathering I did more of like a when you
do<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.899> wanted<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> give<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:43.950> bit

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
do I wanted to give like a little bit

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
do I wanted to give like a little bit
more<00:00:44.190> movement<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> weathering<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.840> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
more movement with the weathering so I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.950 
more movement with the weathering so I
had<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.230> more<00:00:46.910> rusting<00:00:47.910> off<00:00:48.090> into<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> certain

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
had it more rusting off into a certain

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.690 
had it more rusting off into a certain
direction<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.680> ring<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
direction the right ring so the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.779 
direction the right ring so the
weathering<00:00:51.120> actually<00:00:51.690> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> adds<00:00:52.350> this

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
weathering actually kind of adds this

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.180 
weathering actually kind of adds this
element<00:00:53.789> write<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.829> fast

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
element write it like it's going fast

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.700 
element write it like it's going fast
right<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.899> works<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.199> well<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
right I I think it works really well I

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
right I I think it works really well I
am<00:00:59.070> actually<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.640> couldn't<00:00:59.940> put<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.180> finger<00:01:00.300> on

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
am actually I couldn't put my finger on

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
am actually I couldn't put my finger on
it<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.020> think<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.379> why<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.649> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
it but I think that's why I like this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
it but I think that's why I like this
yeah<00:01:02.370> almost<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:03.570> movement

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
yeah almost has like little movement

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.890 
yeah almost has like little movement
marks<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> yeah<00:01:05.220> okay<00:01:05.729> fantastic<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.689> we've

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
marks on it yeah okay fantastic so we've

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.170 
marks on it yeah okay fantastic so we've
got<00:01:07.080> what's<00:01:07.380> called<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.400> not<00:01:08.549> called<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
got what's called I'm not called it's a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.690 
got what's called I'm not called it's a
painted<00:01:09.540> cockpit<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:11.720> i<00:01:13.100> like<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.340> do<00:01:14.490> them

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
painted cockpit and I i like to do them

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
painted cockpit and I i like to do them
this<00:01:15.090> way<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.680> each<00:01:16.830> his<00:01:16.860> own

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
this way but you know to each his own

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.749 
this way but you know to each his own
and<00:01:17.840> I<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.799> happens<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and I I think what happens is is it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.550 
and I I think what happens is is it
allows<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.540> model<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
allows the model to get like this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590 
allows the model to get like this
additional<00:01:23.040> end<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.909> why<00:01:24.360> did

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
additional end with it right so why did

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.749 
additional end with it right so why did
you<00:01:24.720> pick<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.140> color<00:01:25.380> um<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.610> it's

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you pick this color um just because it's

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.819 
you pick this color um just because it's
space<00:01:27.000> wolves<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.630> wanted<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> go<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.770> a
