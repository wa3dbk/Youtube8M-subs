00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
Eagle which is basically like all those

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
Eagle which is basically like all those
sort<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.740> except<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> level

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
sort of except it's more of the level

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.310 
sort of except it's more of the level
one<00:01:38.909> Tuner<00:01:39.210> monster<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.750> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> same

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
one Tuner monster but kind of the same

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.139 
one Tuner monster but kind of the same
idea<00:01:40.500> behind<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:42.229> goes<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> thunderbolt

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
idea behind it goes to a thunderbolt

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.450 
idea behind it goes to a thunderbolt
then<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.840> maxy<00:01:46.290> maxy<00:01:46.500> helps<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> lot

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
then we have a to maxy maxy helps a lot

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.530 
then we have a to maxy maxy helps a lot
because<00:01:47.579> we<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.299> drawing

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
because we don't really have a drawing

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.789 
because we don't really have a drawing
chin<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.049> stack<00:01:49.200> coming<00:01:49.439> though<00:01:49.560> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
chin for this stack coming though this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.980 
chin for this stack coming though this
is<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.100> guess<00:01:50.189> pretty<00:01:50.520> much<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> because

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
is I guess pretty much it and because

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
is I guess pretty much it and because
you<00:01:52.079> don't<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.409> need<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:53.189> since

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you don't really need one as much since

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.429 
you don't really need one as much since
you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.750> want<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.020> monsters<00:01:55.290> be

you know you want your monsters be

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.330 
you know you want your monsters be
destroyed<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:55.979> bring<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.159> other

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
monsters and so on and so forth but this

break through skills I didn't know it's

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.140 
break through skills I didn't know it's
it<00:03:30.190> seems<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.579> always<00:03:30.760> have<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:30.910> problem

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
it seems like I always have that problem

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.849 
it seems like I always have that problem
I'm<00:03:31.299> not<00:03:31.329> sure<00:03:31.569> if<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.720> should<00:03:31.750> go<00:03:31.930> with<00:03:32.170> to

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
I'm not sure if I should go with to

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.470 
I'm not sure if I should go with to
effect<00:03:33.160> failures<00:03:33.549> or<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.120> breakthrough

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
effect failures or to breakthrough

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.000 
effect failures or to breakthrough
skills<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:34.989> went<00:03:35.200> ahead<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.530> decided<00:03:35.590> I

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
skills so I went ahead and decided I

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.259 
skills so I went ahead and decided I
should<00:03:36.220> go<00:03:36.340> with<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.940> breakthrough

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
should go with the to breakthrough

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.270 
should go with the to breakthrough
skills<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.750> then<00:03:37.840> go<00:03:37.900> with<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.079> mexi's<00:03:38.620> so

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
skills and then go with the mexi's so

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.460 
skills and then go with the mexi's so
that's<00:03:39.700> reason<00:03:39.849> on<00:03:40.030> that<00:03:40.209> breakthrough<00:03:41.169> skill

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
that's reason on that breakthrough skill

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.140 
that's reason on that breakthrough skill

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
this card is that when it's on the field

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.530 
this card is that when it's on the field
you're<00:04:39.370> ghosts<00:04:39.550> or<00:04:39.670> monsters<00:04:39.700> whenever<00:04:40.390> you

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
you're ghosts or monsters whenever you

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.880 
you're ghosts or monsters whenever you
would<00:04:40.660> take<00:04:40.840> damage<00:04:41.050> from<00:04:41.260> on<00:04:41.410> your<00:04:41.440> Gusto's

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
would take damage from on your Gusto's

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.470 
would take damage from on your Gusto's
that<00:04:42.520> your<00:04:42.640> opponent's<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.030> sandwich<00:04:43.330> instead

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
that your opponent's a sandwich instead

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.720 
that your opponent's a sandwich instead
so<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.560> course<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:44.860> can<00:04:44.890> just<00:04:45.160> run<00:04:45.400> all<00:04:45.610> of

your monsters into your opponent's
monsters<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.620> they'll<00:04:47.770> just<00:04:47.920> keep<00:04:48.070> searching

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
out for other ones to keep doing that

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
your opponent and there's just a lot of

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.850 
your opponent and there's just a lot of
strategies<00:04:53.260> like<00:04:53.380> that's<00:04:53.560> like<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.770> main

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
strategies like that's like the main

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.990 
strategies like that's like the main
stretch<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.160> can<00:04:54.220> do<00:04:54.310> it's<00:04:54.400> like<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.550> kamikaze

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
stretch you can do it's like a kamikaze

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.150 
stretch you can do it's like a kamikaze
strategy<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.630> guess<00:04:55.930> but<00:04:56.410> it's<00:04:56.560> really<00:04:56.890> easy<00:04:57.040> to

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
strategy I guess but it's really easy to

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.830 
strategy I guess but it's really easy to
do<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.460> comes<00:04:57.640> in<00:04:57.730> handy<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.090> it's<00:04:58.210> extremely

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
do it comes in handy and it's extremely

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.750 
do it comes in handy and it's extremely
annoying<00:04:59.170> for<00:04:59.410> your<00:04:59.500> opponent<00:04:59.830> and<00:04:59.950> I<00:04:59.980> think

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
annoying for your opponent and I think

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.920 
annoying for your opponent and I think
it's<00:05:00.850> not<00:05:00.970> that<00:05:01.090> we're<00:05:01.210> actually<00:05:01.360> able<00:05:01.570> to<00:05:01.690> use

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
it's not that we're actually able to use

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.750 
it's not that we're actually able to use
this<00:05:02.050> card<00:05:02.320> easily<00:05:02.830> now<00:05:02.950> because<00:05:03.610> before

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
this card easily now because before

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.390 
this card easily now because before
palooka<00:05:04.390> it<00:05:05.140> you<00:05:05.470> really<00:05:06.040> couldn't<00:05:06.250> use

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
palooka it you really couldn't use

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.830 
palooka it you really couldn't use
freeze<00:05:06.730> I<00:05:06.760> mean<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.210> course<00:05:07.270> there's<00:05:07.600> always<00:05:07.720> a

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
freeze I mean of course there's always a

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.650 
freeze I mean of course there's always a
way<00:05:08.050> but<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.950> it<00:05:09.280> wasn't<00:05:09.670> as<00:05:09.730> easy<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.060> do<00:05:10.360> or

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
way but it it wasn't as easy to do or

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.690 
way but it it wasn't as easy to do or
are<00:05:11.230> really<00:05:11.380> worth<00:05:11.650> it<00:05:11.890> and<00:05:12.070> now<00:05:12.400> it

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
are really worth it and now it

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.310 
are really worth it and now it
definitely<00:05:13.150> is<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.540> this<00:05:13.630> makes<00:05:13.900> this<00:05:14.050> card

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
definitely is and this makes this card

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.630 
definitely is and this makes this card
really<00:05:14.710> awesome<00:05:16.080> then<00:05:17.080> we<00:05:17.200> have<00:05:17.440> our<00:05:17.740> two<00:05:18.340> and

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
really awesome then we have our two and

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.400 
really awesome then we have our two and
I<00:05:18.670> guess<00:05:18.850> no<00:05:18.970> goal<00:05:19.210> dos<00:05:19.360> which<00:05:20.140> of<00:05:20.380> course

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
I guess no goal dos which of course

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.500 
I guess no goal dos which of course

might<00:05:58.840> be<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.050> best<00:05:59.230> it's<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.890> one<00:06:00.010> I<00:06:00.040> use<00:06:00.280> the

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
might be the best it's the one I use the

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.910 
might be the best it's the one I use the
most<00:06:00.550> and<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.880> really<00:06:01.090> enjoy<00:06:01.710> total<00:06:02.710> bird

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
most and I really enjoy total bird

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.620 
most and I really enjoy total bird
because<00:06:03.460> it's<00:06:03.910> actually<00:06:04.150> does<00:06:04.390> command

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
because it's actually does command

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.090 
because it's actually does command
handing<00:06:04.870> those<00:06:04.990> dos<00:06:05.200> so<00:06:05.500> it's<00:06:05.800> kind<00:06:05.950> of<00:06:05.980> cool

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
handing those dos so it's kind of cool

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.170 
handing those dos so it's kind of cool
actually<00:06:06.220> be<00:06:06.430> able<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.610> use<00:06:06.730> this<00:06:06.850> card<00:06:07.060> no

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
actually be able to use this card no

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.060 
actually be able to use this card no
more<00:06:07.300> getting<00:06:07.480> it<00:06:07.570> from<00:06:07.720> box<00:06:08.230> opening<00:06:08.590> up<00:06:08.680> it

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
more getting it from box opening up it

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.740 
more getting it from box opening up it
seems<00:06:09.250> like<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.400> while<00:06:09.850> back<00:06:10.090> a<00:06:10.330> long<00:06:10.450> time<00:06:10.510> ago

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
seems like a while back a long time ago

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.810 
seems like a while back a long time ago
and<00:06:11.170> then<00:06:11.710> we<00:06:11.770> have<00:06:11.890> that<00:06:12.010> I<00:06:12.130> guess<00:06:12.280> no<00:06:12.430> Phoenix

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
and then we have that I guess no Phoenix

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.580 
and then we have that I guess no Phoenix
that<00:06:13.120> I'm<00:06:13.540> testing<00:06:13.930> out<00:06:14.020> as<00:06:14.170> well<00:06:14.320> in<00:06:14.440> this

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
that I'm testing out as well in this

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.010 
that I'm testing out as well in this
inning<00:06:14.800> comes<00:06:15.220> in<00:06:15.340> handy<00:06:15.430> as<00:06:15.610> well<00:06:15.870> so<00:06:16.870> yeah

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
inning comes in handy as well so yeah

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.050 
inning comes in handy as well so yeah
that<00:06:17.410> is<00:06:17.680> the<00:06:17.710> ghost<00:06:18.160> right<00:06:18.370> profile<00:06:18.670> it's<00:06:18.970> a

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
that is the ghost right profile it's a

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.810 
that is the ghost right profile it's a
lot<00:06:19.240> of<00:06:19.270> fun<00:06:19.480> to<00:06:19.570> use<00:06:19.920> fairly<00:06:20.920> cheap<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.400> make<00:06:21.610> I

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
lot of fun to use fairly cheap to make I

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.310 
lot of fun to use fairly cheap to make I
mean<00:06:22.000> maybe<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:22.390> emergency<00:06:22.690> teleport<00:06:22.960> might

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
mean maybe the emergency teleport might

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.960 
mean maybe the emergency teleport might
beat<00:06:23.470> them<00:06:23.680> more<00:06:23.980> expensive<00:06:24.250> card<00:06:24.670> I'm<00:06:24.820> not

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
beat them more expensive card I'm not

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.340 
beat them more expensive card I'm not
really<00:06:25.060> sure<00:06:25.390> honestly<00:06:25.840> I<00:06:25.900> don't<00:06:26.050> think<00:06:26.200> those

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
really sure honestly I don't think those

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.620 
really sure honestly I don't think those
are<00:06:26.560> that<00:06:27.010> bad<00:06:27.190> anymore<00:06:27.460> of<00:06:27.670> them<00:06:27.820> but<00:06:28.540> yeah

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
are that bad anymore of them but yeah

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.000 
are that bad anymore of them but yeah
it's<00:06:28.780> a<00:06:28.840> lot<00:06:28.960> of<00:06:29.020> fun<00:06:29.200> used<00:06:29.470> if<00:06:29.680> you're<00:06:29.890> just

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
it's a lot of fun used if you're just

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.860 
it's a lot of fun used if you're just
looking<00:06:30.100> for<00:06:30.280> you<00:06:30.910> know<00:06:30.940> more<00:06:31.360> of<00:06:31.390> a<00:06:31.480> fun<00:06:31.690> deck

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
looking for you know more of a fun deck

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.060 
looking for you know more of a fun deck
that<00:06:32.080> is<00:06:32.320> pretty<00:06:32.590> competitive

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
that is pretty competitive

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.380 
that is pretty competitive
I<00:06:33.160> really<00:06:33.370> do<00:06:33.460> suggest<00:06:33.640> Gusto's<00:06:34.120> because<00:06:34.300> they

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
I really do suggest Gusto's because they

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.390 
I really do suggest Gusto's because they
are<00:06:34.570> really<00:06:34.900> competitive<00:06:35.140> still<00:06:35.590> I<00:06:35.620> think<00:06:35.979> you

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
are really competitive still I think you

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.860 
are really competitive still I think you
know<00:06:36.490> I'm<00:06:37.300> not<00:06:37.450> really<00:06:37.570> sure<00:06:37.660> what's

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
know I'm not really sure what's

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.330 
know I'm not really sure what's
classifying<00:06:38.320> that<00:06:38.500> but<00:06:38.710> you<00:06:39.070> know<00:06:39.190> they're

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
classifying that but you know they're

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.940 
classifying that but you know they're
not<00:06:39.430> that<00:06:39.610> weak

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
not that weak

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.010 
not that weak
they're<00:06:40.130> a<00:06:40.310> lot<00:06:41.120> of<00:06:41.240> fun<00:06:41.450> I'm<00:06:41.750> really<00:06:41.930> enjoying

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
they're a lot of fun I'm really enjoying

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.900 
they're a lot of fun I'm really enjoying
them<00:06:42.260> we'll<00:06:42.410> have<00:06:42.560> some<00:06:42.710> tools<00:06:42.920> using<00:06:43.700> them

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
them we'll have some tools using them

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.250 
them we'll have some tools using them
because<00:06:44.210> this<00:06:44.480> is<00:06:44.540> a<00:06:44.690> little<00:06:44.900> bit<00:06:44.990> different

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
because this is a little bit different

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.350 
because this is a little bit different
than<00:06:45.440> that<00:06:45.860> I'm<00:06:46.490> using<00:06:46.640> right<00:06:46.760> here<00:06:47.030> than<00:06:47.270> the

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
than that I'm using right here than the

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.930 
than that I'm using right here than the
one<00:06:47.510> that<00:06:47.780> I<00:06:47.810> had<00:06:48.080> for<00:06:48.320> the<00:06:48.530> dual<00:06:48.680> video<00:06:48.830> and<00:06:49.220> so

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
one that I had for the dual video and so

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.430 
one that I had for the dual video and so
we'll<00:06:50.060> have<00:06:50.090> more<00:06:50.540> of<00:06:50.600> an<00:06:50.660> updated<00:06:50.960> duel<00:06:51.200> on

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
we'll have more of an updated duel on

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.500 
we'll have more of an updated duel on
that<00:06:51.620> and<00:06:51.890> then<00:06:52.400> of<00:06:52.550> course<00:06:52.580> I'm<00:06:53.270> still

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
that and then of course I'm still

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.820 
that and then of course I'm still
playing<00:06:53.690> to<00:06:53.840> have<00:06:53.960> my<00:06:54.110> Quan<00:06:54.320> Camaro<00:06:54.590> deck

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
playing to have my Quan Camaro deck

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.820 
playing to have my Quan Camaro deck
profile<00:06:55.160> which<00:06:55.960> maybe<00:06:56.960> later<00:06:57.350> this<00:06:57.590> week<00:06:57.800> to

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
profile which maybe later this week to

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.930 
profile which maybe later this week to
early<00:06:58.220> next<00:06:58.400> thing<00:06:58.490> I<00:06:58.550> think<00:06:58.670> I'm<00:06:58.760> still

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
early next thing I think I'm still

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.070 
early next thing I think I'm still
missing<00:06:59.120> a<00:06:59.300> card<00:06:59.540> so<00:06:59.630> I'm<00:06:59.720> going<00:06:59.840> to<00:06:59.900> try<00:07:00.050> to

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
missing a card so I'm going to try to

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.570 
missing a card so I'm going to try to
get<00:07:00.230> that<00:07:00.440> evos<00:07:01.540> a<00:07:02.800> TCG<00:07:03.800> version<00:07:04.130> of<00:07:04.250> photon

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
get that evos a TCG version of photon

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.620 
get that evos a TCG version of photon
galaxy<00:07:05.150> since<00:07:05.510> they<00:07:05.690> got<00:07:05.840> some<00:07:05.960> new<00:07:06.080> cards<00:07:06.410> and

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
galaxy since they got some new cards and

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.640 
galaxy since they got some new cards and
yeah<00:07:08.630> I<00:07:08.660> think<00:07:08.810> that's<00:07:09.140> pretty<00:07:09.380> much<00:07:09.500> all

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
yeah I think that's pretty much all

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.320 
yeah I think that's pretty much all
noble<00:07:09.980> knights<00:07:10.160> know<00:07:10.580> the<00:07:10.670> Knights<00:07:10.850> I<00:07:11.000> guess<00:07:11.120> -

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
noble knights know the Knights I guess -

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.120 
noble knights know the Knights I guess -
other<00:07:11.990> than<00:07:12.140> that<00:07:12.350> if<00:07:12.560> you<00:07:12.650> guys<00:07:12.770> have<00:07:12.980> any
