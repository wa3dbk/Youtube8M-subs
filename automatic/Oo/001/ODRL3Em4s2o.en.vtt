anyway<00:00:12.030> pretty<00:00:12.269> close<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:13.259> let's<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.650> look

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
anyway pretty close so let's have a look

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.060 
anyway pretty close so let's have a look
at<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.099> mess<00:00:14.370> I've<00:00:14.519> created<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:15.770> mmm

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
at the mess I've created here mmm

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.640 
at the mess I've created here mmm
what<00:00:17.670> those<00:00:17.820> two<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.150> wise<00:00:18.449> what<00:00:19.410> do<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.529> need

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
what those two it wise what do you need

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.359 
what those two it wise what do you need
wires<00:00:19.920> Shang<00:00:21.140> let<00:00:22.140> me<00:00:22.230> tell<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:23.100> because

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
wires Shang let me tell you it's because

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.259 
wires Shang let me tell you it's because
I<00:00:26.689> destroyed<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:28.400> it's<00:00:29.400> probably<00:00:29.609> best<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
I destroyed it it's probably best not to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.840 
I destroyed it it's probably best not to
use<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> 40-watt<00:00:30.960> soldiering<00:00:31.560> iron<00:00:31.850> apparently

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
use a 40-watt soldiering iron apparently

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.810 
use a 40-watt soldiering iron apparently
15s<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.510> good<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> go<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.290> 25<00:00:34.739> ib<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.190> 25<00:00:35.610> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
15s a good way to go or 25 ib is 25 in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.229 
15s a good way to go or 25 ib is 25 in
this<00:00:35.910> case<00:00:37.460> it<00:00:38.460> kind<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.760> might<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.059> melted

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
this case it kind of might have melted

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.229 
this case it kind of might have melted
away<00:00:39.450> some<00:00:39.930> solder<00:00:40.290> pads<00:00:40.500> completely<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.969> I'm

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
away some solder pads completely so I'm

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.110 
away some solder pads completely so I'm
going<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:43.440> wires<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:47.120> that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
going from one of these wires to that

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.540 
going from one of these wires to that
going<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.390> -<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.170> solders<00:00:49.980> that's<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> solder

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
going on - so solders that's the solder

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.869 
going on - so solders that's the solder
point<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.899> managed<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.829> keep<00:00:53.039> solder<00:00:53.670> point

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
point so on managed to keep solder point

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.510 
point so on managed to keep solder point
intact<00:00:54.710> there's<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> other<00:00:56.190> side<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
intact there's on the other side of the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
intact there's on the other side of the
board<00:00:56.699> there's<00:00:56.940> also<00:00:57.090> two<00:00:57.329> points<00:00:58.109> right<00:00:58.410> in

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
board there's also two points right in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.780 
board there's also two points right in
this<00:00:59.129> hole<00:00:59.809> that<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:00.989> join<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:02.969> two

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
this hole that do join up to these two

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.649 
this hole that do join up to these two
anyway

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
anyway

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.210 
anyway
and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.020> we've<00:01:07.140> got<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.470> mess<00:01:07.830> over<00:01:08.010> here

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
and then we've got this mess over here

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.359 
and then we've got this mess over here
yeah<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> had<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
yeah on this one I had to go from the

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.469 
yeah on this one I had to go from the
via<00:01:14.810> directly<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> resistor<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.479> solder

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
via directly to the resistor the solder

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.440 
via directly to the resistor the solder
pads<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.869> I'm<00:01:18.960> very<00:01:19.380> good<00:01:19.650> check<00:01:20.119> now<00:01:21.119> those

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
pads of I'm very good check now those

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
pads of I'm very good check now those
wires<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.020> little<00:01:22.140> bit<00:01:22.320> longer<00:01:22.530> than<00:01:22.710> my

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
wires are a little bit longer than my

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.130 
wires are a little bit longer than my
liking<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:24.210> aren't<00:01:24.360> shorting<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.900> any

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
liking but they aren't shorting out any

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
liking but they aren't shorting out any
other<00:01:25.259> beers<00:01:25.650> or<00:01:25.860> bits<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.880> solder<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.509> we're

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
other beers or bits of solder so we're

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
other beers or bits of solder so we're
gonna<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.900> ahead<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.189> back

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
gonna go ahead and get this one back

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.830 
gonna go ahead and get this one back
together<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.860> try<00:01:31.860> flashing<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.900> wind<00:01:33.900> bond

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
together and try flashing the wind bond

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.960 
together and try flashing the wind bond
BIOS<00:01:37.880> EEPROM<00:01:39.409> you<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> model

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
BIOS EEPROM you can see it's the model

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.410 
BIOS EEPROM you can see it's the model
number<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> I'll<00:01:44.460> give<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.790> go<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.299> what

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
number so I'll give that a go see what

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.860 
number so I'll give that a go see what
happens

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
happens

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.470 
happens
hopefully<00:01:47.710> we'll<00:01:47.830> have<00:01:47.860> some<00:01:48.130> luck<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.360> I'll

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
hopefully we'll have some luck and I'll

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.230 
hopefully we'll have some luck and I'll
be<00:01:49.570> able<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.810> flash<00:01:50.520> execute<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.550> BIOS<00:01:51.820> onto<00:01:52.120> it

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
be able to flash execute a BIOS onto it

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.790 
be able to flash execute a BIOS onto it
and<00:01:52.660> we'll<00:01:52.810> be<00:01:52.900> all<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.320> upgrade<00:01:53.440> to<00:01:53.770> a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
and we'll be all going to upgrade to a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.960 
and we'll be all going to upgrade to a
160<00:01:54.340> gig<00:01:54.490> hard<00:01:54.700> drive<00:01:54.790> yeah<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:57.580> do<00:01:57.760> manage

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
160 gig hard drive yeah if you do manage

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.150 
160 gig hard drive yeah if you do manage
to<00:01:58.120> mess<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.600> up<00:01:58.690> as<00:01:58.870> much<00:01:59.050> as<00:01:59.260> this<00:01:59.410> make<00:02:00.130> sure

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
to mess it up as much as this make sure

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.750 
to mess it up as much as this make sure
you<00:02:00.400> put<00:02:00.610> some<00:02:01.770> captain<00:02:02.770> tape<00:02:02.980> or<00:02:03.340> something

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
you put some captain tape or something

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.390 
you put some captain tape or something
that<00:02:03.850> will<00:02:03.940> prevent<00:02:04.320> conducting<00:02:05.320> if<00:02:05.920> anything

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
that will prevent conducting if anything

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.330 
that will prevent conducting if anything
does<00:02:06.580> short<00:02:07.030> out<00:02:07.210> or<00:02:07.420> come<00:02:07.630> loose<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:09.160> for

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
does short out or come loose just for

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.750 
does short out or come loose just for
safety's<00:02:09.880> sake<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.210> course<00:02:11.220> how<00:02:12.220> do<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.430> keep

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
safety's sake of course how do I keep

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.160 
safety's sake of course how do I keep
losing<00:02:13.420> things<00:02:13.750> I've<00:02:14.380> recorded<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.990> is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
losing things I've recorded this is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.690 
losing things I've recorded this is
sparta<00:02:20.970> no<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.210> not<00:02:22.300> actually<00:02:22.690> Sparta<00:02:23.170> but

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
sparta no it's not actually Sparta but

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.370 
sparta no it's not actually Sparta but
just<00:02:24.700> thought<00:02:24.850> I'd<00:02:25.000> give<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.210> status<00:02:25.630> update<00:02:25.930> to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
we're starting off with the it's basic

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.860 
we're starting off with the it's basic
driver<00:03:46.280> chip<00:03:46.520> with<00:03:46.700> 10<00:03:47.000> gig<00:03:47.210> whatever<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:47.780> you

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
driver chip with 10 gig whatever so you

go<00:03:47.990> and<00:03:48.320> we'll<00:03:49.070> be<00:03:49.160> stepping<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.610> up<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.940> a

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
go and we'll be stepping it up to a

go and we'll be stepping it up to a
massive<00:03:50.770> 160<00:03:51.770> Seagate<00:03:54.520> now<00:03:55.520> this<00:03:55.850> video<00:03:56.150> is

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
probably quite out of order because I

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.330 
probably quite out of order because I
took<00:03:58.580> videos<00:03:58.940> at<00:03:59.150> random<00:03:59.690> points<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.950> it's

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
took videos at random points so it's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.110
