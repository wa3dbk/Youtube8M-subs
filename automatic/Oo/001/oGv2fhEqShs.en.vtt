00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.360
 I'm back in the middle of it 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.610
 so it can be that one through the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230
 Do not stick to the macro nutrient 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.930
 ratio over one kilo of water overnight 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.550
 was the case with me since I was 30 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.100
 there was too much and 30 grams 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.109
 did not take enough protein with me 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.109
 calorie intec, however, was in the frame 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.600
 No, I do not think that's marco 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.460
 Nutrient or I would not say 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.450
 that that likes and he is already proportionate 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.920
 it's just that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.750
 food choice or so was to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.960
 Example times more sodium sea ​​salt 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.180
 Turn less salt in it but I have 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.090
 30 grams were too much to take 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.280
 maybe 100 grams of water back though 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.100
 everything in the body internally expires before 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.800
 also the body board said the body 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 point or so that's all about the body 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.399
 controlled by ourselves because we can not do anything 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.140
 That's why I'm the one who 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.880
 absolute opponents of the balance 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.210
 of course we need to overestimate 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.950
 very much as an orientation in on duration though 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.470
 the scales are shots and so everyone 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.970
 day alone the vague to is already called us 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.310
 because the things are not calibrated that 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.750
 I already said in my video 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.460
 if I weigh myself now 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.930
 do not eat anything I drink nothing 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.610
 got it logo and ten minutes later 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.000
 the same would be put at my home 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:36.030
 then i will get another result 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.630
 because the goods are just shit and one 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.250
 kilo is nothing it even came to 23 kilo 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.890
 times may vary among women 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.720
 405 daily that means the scales 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 absolutely not our friend in a diet 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.049
 but if we optically an optical 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.729
 Make an embossed diet or visually 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.540
 oriented the similar calls now times 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.159
 that's what we all do 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.590
 then it makes sense once in the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.000
 week increase in size I say it 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.970
 time and again I can not do it often 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.150
 enough to emphasize the dimensions are the important 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.090
 while the weight can go up or down 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.790
 go 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.860
 the park because our body a 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.709
 homeostasis systems a balance 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.629
 system and everything we try 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.480
 somehow impose the body will be 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.519
 at the latest after a few days that will be 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.239
 be controlled by the body and 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.190
 be eliminated 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.500
 except you just have less calories to us 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.480
 As we consume there the body can 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.890
 not against or worked out 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.959
 By contrast, by using existing resources 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.959
 mined and used for energy 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.540
 provides and works that way 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.040
 our diet so yes it can 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.829
 be that you pull in the kielwasser over 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.010
 night no i would not say that 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:03:00.879
 that were the 30 gram cups but that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.610
 was something else you did not sow 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.150
 horny I can answer almost said 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.390
 because his body is not closed 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.540
 system is and always around it somehow 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.950
 Fingering we can just finger around 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.390
 to maintain its optimal status and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.130
 your body has thought about where 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.930
 I have to keep a kilo of water because 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.040
 I got maybe a kilo less 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.560
 Maybe you have that day 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.420
 less drunk embodies one kilo 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.150
 to keep 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:36.280
 who knows that more, I can do that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.489
 Do not even say I have the car now 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.489
 completely shackled but 1000
