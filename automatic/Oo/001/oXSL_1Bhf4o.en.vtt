 Talk this is from youtube 1021 and bringing 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.110
 collector who were announced 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.540
 only for europe is nothing announced 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.489
 for the United States or here for the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.130
 Brazil, come on, I told you to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.350
 You two editions, let's start. 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:45.239
 then by edition called rivals edition 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.440
 and here you can see what's coming 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.809
 of extra in this edition né 2 custom leave 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.870
 of naruto and sakineh the naruto 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.659
 using the CASS and ask skindô 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.089
 using naruto skindono a thing well 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.219
 It's nice to see yourself and at the same time 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.800
 one weird thing got a right 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.110
 little weird to see that using the sas 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.870
 this orange costume of our hero of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.420
 economic and it is also a bit strange 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.120
 see our hero in the river this hair 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.000
 blonde is not wearing the clothes of the service but 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.850
 I also think it will be interesting to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.710
 have them so with these skins exchanged 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.380
 it's not going to be a bit cool to be 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 playing with them and bring in that possible 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.900
 gameplay of them so here in the channel you 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.780
 can also see in this online edition the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.280
 three game covers how much for pc xbox 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.980
 360 and playstation 3 and a kitchen as well 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.220
 Nice to meet anyone who does the seizure. 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.580
 game, you 'll be able to receive three days 15 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.250
 well of the hour sack of naruto shafiq and 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.410
 Sakura look at how nice it was. 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.640
 well folks show ne 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.640
 I'll do anything to get 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.140
 these codes're not I ask 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.420
 spain and my mother open edition 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.890
 when you get to her house and she gives me 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.000
 the codes but you can add the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.770
 my psn 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.810
 of course I'll need a game 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.119
 European so that the propellers work I 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.190
 I end up getting the digital game of 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.290
 spanish fishing ohl is also has the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.569
 possibility of such issues such 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.819
 pre-sales codes arrive in Brazil 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.739
 then you would not have to do that and 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.329
 We hope you arrive in Brazil like me. 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.420
 I said for now it's only 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.330
 announced to Europe and staff after 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.000
 to demonstrate it 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.250
 For you the rival edition is in a 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.670
 another that I found much more of the time 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.330
 much cooler and more interesting, 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.150
 skins that will see in it edition is samurai 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.010
 and dish you can see that this 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.920
 editing is a bit more complex than 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.810
 the rivals edition it is up almost type 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.970
 same as the two I got from 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.810
 storm 3 do you remember when I made a 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.870
 boxe she's the one that comes from this naruto doll. 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.210
 they are murai come already already those two 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.670
 codes where you will have naruto with 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.010
 sesc clothing and serve with the clothing of the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.950
 naruto that most probably that there 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.980
 be a poster showing there the south and 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.740
 huambo and tati angle and danced right 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.380
 I believe that yes it is a poster of the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.390
 same way he also had posters on the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.180
 last editions of storm collector 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.940
 3 and from which they have opposed the kurama mode and 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.190
 also the poster aside the bito né when 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.500
 I was still the mask tube river 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.400
 black am then galerinha is there for you 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.470
 the two collector editions of the storm 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.900
 revolution for now only europe 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.670
 Let's hope these editions do not 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.010
 can go to the United States and 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.830
 also to Brazil, also facilitating 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.630
 of course our life here for more than 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.510
 I already know that if you come to Brazil 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.880
 will have a salty price but do 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.459
 What I'm going to try to pick up if I have 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.320
 in brazil and the galleys something else that 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.709
 I'm making it very clear quickly. 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.200
 that image showing the 3 samurais 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.450
 sasc and sakura and naruto you will power 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.850
 get those codes just for you 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.950
 make the period in two games to though 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.950
 You've made the worst of the edition. 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.860
 rivals or the samurai edition are those 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.180
 three codes there actually a code only 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.920
 it's not that it will possibly free 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.959
 these three to these three of them is that 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.269
 are you going to be able to get 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.609
 in case you make the pre-sale of the game be 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.250
 I believe that it is normal for the 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.180
 collector's editions're crew to be 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.729
 like this 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.820
 after you see this video if you already 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.810
 intend to make the worst of the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.550
 game is 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.890
 the site is already there our own 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.569
 new images can see the 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.639
 naruto revolution e 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.499
 can be doing the worst there if you 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.960
 Anyway, I do not want 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:46.419
 I highly recommend doing the journal and 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.459
 game on these edits on this site 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.129
 why this site is certainly the one 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:53.709
 Europe is because the edition already announced is 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.389
 Then to Europe and then possibly only 

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:57.759
 I'm going to send it to Europe, that's it. 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.129
 really do not have much use for the 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.439
 people there you ask me, you go 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.349
 Do your worst, come on, I'll answer. 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.939
 I'm not going to wait to see this 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.949
 edition goes to the United States as 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.080
 I think it will certainly go because the 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.119
 last year announced the first for the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.580
 europe collector's editions are from 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:17.649
 storm 3 then they went to the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.080
 is that case really 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:22.479
 Do not come to Brazil, I still have to 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.490
 option is that my mother in Spain and 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.409
 maybe you know I came from there also 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.869
 Last year I can request this edition 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.180
 in a store that I always bought there 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:31.990
 They'll send the codes back to my house. 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.339
 and such 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.439
 and then I can be directing the 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.389
 codes on my Spanish skin but it 's 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.269
 As I told you, I would need to 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.009
 a game in a European revolution so that 

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:44.110
 the licenses would work in the case then 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:46.360
 I would buy the game in Spanish fishing 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.550
 digitally for Delhi tuesday 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.289
 but frankly speaking, even guys I 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.580
 I do not know yet what I'm going to do about it. 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.279
 of these issues 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.779
 I want to assure and ed shanta do not know 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:58.360
 How do I go about getting her? 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:00.759
 but I really wanted to come to the 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.379
 Brazil would make it a lot easier 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.459
 little more expensive but I would try to get 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.740
 right here 

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:07.569
 beauty and chicken no more is this then 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.180

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.199
