if you look at the shape it's very

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
if you look at the shape it's very
different<00:00:23.340> that's<00:00:24.060> because<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.750> actually

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
different that's because it's actually

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.259

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.080 
won't see very good at hand action for
me<00:00:31.470> I'm<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> good<00:00:31.859> shooter<00:00:32.160> gamer<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
me I'm not a good shooter gamer but the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.819 
me I'm not a good shooter gamer but the
design<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.170> hold<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
design is really so you can hold it you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.310 
design is really so you can hold it you
can<00:00:34.950> clutch<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.690> gamers<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> pick<00:00:37.140> up

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
can clutch it gamers like to pick up

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.799 
can clutch it gamers like to pick up
their<00:00:37.500> mouse<00:00:38.239> swiping<00:00:39.239> there's<00:00:39.570> very

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
their mouse swiping there's very

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.090 
their mouse swiping there's very
different<00:00:39.870> types<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.469> movements<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
different types of movements so it's the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580 
different types of movements so it's the
shape<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.640> designed<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.870> gaming<00:00:43.200> movements

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.200 
it also if you notice has vertical side
buttons<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.739> why<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.640> important<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
buttons so why this is important so a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.450 
buttons so why this is important so a
standard<00:00:48.690> v<00:00:49.079> button<00:00:49.379> Mouse<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.950> side<00:00:50.129> buttons

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
forward and back right so you'd have

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
forward and back right so you'd have
like<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> forward<00:00:52.890> button<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.309> back<00:00:53.460> button<00:00:53.670> here

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
like a forward button a back button here

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
like a forward button a back button here
well<00:00:54.120> when<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> get<00:00:54.629> moved<00:00:54.780> forward<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.230> back

well when I get moved forward and back

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.369 
well when I get moved forward and back
this<00:00:56.010> part<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:56.489> hand<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.510> moves<00:00:58.050> on

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
this part of my hand actually moves on

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.529 
this part of my hand actually moves on
the<00:00:58.649> mouse<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.250> when<00:00:59.969> you're<00:01:00.090> gaming<00:01:00.270> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the mouse and when you're gaming and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.970 
the mouse and when you're gaming and
moving<00:01:00.780> fast<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> don't<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.649> part<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
moving fast you don't want that part of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.429 
moving fast you don't want that part of
your<00:01:02.039> hand<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.550> move<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.840> did<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.260> just

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
your hand to move so we did is we just

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
your hand to move so we did is we just
came<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> pretty<00:01:05.280> simple<00:01:05.729> solution<00:01:06.210> is

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
came up with a pretty simple solution is

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.120 
came up with a pretty simple solution is
why<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.900> make<00:01:07.049> those<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:07.680> side<00:01:07.920> buttons

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
why not make those two side buttons

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.520 
why not make those two side buttons
vertical<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.810> hand<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.140> not<00:01:10.260> moving

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
vertical this way my hand is not moving

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.940 
vertical this way my hand is not moving
just<00:01:10.680> my<00:01:10.979> thumb<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.939> two<00:01:12.090> buttons<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.290> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
just my thumb on the two buttons so this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.560 
just my thumb on the two buttons so this
way<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> always<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.640> which<00:01:15.150> buttons<00:01:15.479> you're

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
way you always know which buttons you're

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
way you always know which buttons you're
going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> press<00:01:15.960> now<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.830> hand<00:01:17.040> your<00:01:17.280> thumb

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
going to press now your hand your thumb

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.550 
going to press now your hand your thumb
actually<00:01:17.670> rests<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> side<00:01:18.930> buttons<00:01:19.290> but

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
actually rests on the side buttons but

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
actually rests on the side buttons but
they're<00:01:19.979> hard<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> depress<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:21.060> they're

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
they're hard to depress like they're

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.140 
they're hard to depress like they're
well<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> force<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.380> fire<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:23.000> stronger<00:01:24.000> so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
well the force to fire is stronger so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.920 
well the force to fire is stronger so
you're<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> hit<00:01:24.720> them

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
you're not going to hit them

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.810 
you're not going to hit them
accidentally

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.390 
this on and with gaming mice you know
typically<00:03:15.480> being<00:03:15.780> wired<00:03:16.200> mice<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.950> actually

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
typically being wired mice you actually

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.650 
typically being wired mice you actually
want<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.700> make<00:03:17.880> sure<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.210> your<00:03:18.330> cable

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
want to make sure that your cable

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.680 
want to make sure that your cable
doesn't<00:03:18.810> get<00:03:19.020> stuck<00:03:19.440> behind<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:20.130> PC<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.540> it

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
doesn't get stuck behind the PC so it

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.050 
doesn't get stuck behind the PC so it
doesn't<00:03:21.960> get<00:03:22.020> stuck<00:03:22.350> behind<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.860> PC<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.610> your

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
doesn't get stuck behind the PC on your

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.910 
doesn't get stuck behind the PC on your
VGA<00:03:24.420> connections<00:03:25.350> or<00:03:25.500> anything<00:03:25.680> because

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
VGA connections or anything because

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.020 
VGA connections or anything because
that's<00:03:26.100> happened<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.490> me<00:03:26.550> before

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that's happened to me before

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.820 
that's happened to me before
so<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.690> set<00:03:27.900> up<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.350> see<00:03:28.620> that

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
so this is set up and you can see that

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.400 
so this is set up and you can see that
there's<00:03:29.190> an<00:03:29.340> LCD<00:03:29.760> display<00:03:29.910> as<00:03:30.540> well<00:03:30.780> on<00:03:31.200> the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
there's an LCD display as well on the

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.370 
there's an LCD display as well on the
mouse<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.460> when<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.820> change<00:03:33.120> my<00:03:33.420> dpi<00:03:33.840> settings

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
mouse so when I change my dpi settings

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.580 
mouse so when I change my dpi settings
it<00:03:34.590> changes<00:03:35.400> on<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.640> LCD<00:03:35.940> display<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:37.410> for

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
it changes on the LCD display so for

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.830 
it changes on the LCD display so for
example<00:03:38.010> my<00:03:38.190> default<00:03:38.820> low<00:03:39.120> sensitivity<00:03:39.480> is

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
example my default low sensitivity is

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.650 
example my default low sensitivity is
400<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.530> shows<00:03:40.800> 400<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.550> LCD<00:03:41.850> display<00:03:42.030> by

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
400 it shows 400 on the LCD display by

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.090 
400 it shows 400 on the LCD display by
having<00:03:42.960> the<00:03:43.050> LCD<00:03:43.380> display<00:03:43.680> because<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.950> can

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
having the LCD display because you can

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.270 
having the LCD display because you can
actually<00:03:44.490> further<00:03:45.090> tweak<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.750> in<00:03:46.440> software

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
actually further tweak this in software

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.180 
actually further tweak this in software
you<00:03:47.610> can<00:03:48.090> make<00:03:48.270> this<00:03:48.390> as<00:03:48.570> low<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:48.900> 200<00:03:49.470> dpi<00:03:49.650> and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
you can make this as low as 200 dpi and

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.920 
you can make this as low as 200 dpi and
it'll<00:03:50.790> show<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:51.000> when<00:03:51.240> you<00:03:51.330> change<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.750> it'll

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
it'll show you when you change it it'll

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.650 
it'll show you when you change it it'll
show<00:03:51.960> it<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> LCD<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:53.100> LCD<00:03:53.490> also<00:03:53.850> assists

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
show it on the LCD the LCD also assists
