00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.210
 and the television genres to give a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.580
 proper concept about gender 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 television, it is necessary to quote the point of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.949
 view of the issuer and the perspective of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.750
 receiver then for the sender the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.330
 gender is a norm of coherence 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.850
 textual is to say relation to what 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.010
 notes with language while 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.410
 for the receiver the genres establish 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 a series of recognizable codes for 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.020
 classify certain typologies this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 instead it defines the characteristics and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.790
 the type of gender thus we deduce that the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.129
 Gender concept can be understood 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.200
 as a communication strategy that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.010
 is configured from the conjunction 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.480
 of a series of logical type components 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.059
 It should be noted that there is no 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.879
 closed repertoire of genres or of a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.219
 certain specialty as there 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.010
 genres that become extinct and new ones 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.350
 that can be created little by little 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.839
 television just like man has 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.010
 has evolved and this is reflected 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.130
 in three phases 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.840
 first the television palette that were 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.110
 the first years of development 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.760
 television black and white second the neo 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.620
 television is the revolution in 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.840
 content where there was a greater 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.990
 competition due to the proliferation of 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.480
 broadcasters and television companies and the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.800
 hyper television that tries to exaggerate 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.440
 the genera already established 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.840
 with hyper television the classification 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.150
 traditional of the genres is broken for 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.810
 give way to innovative trends that 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.970
 combine more than one format is this way 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.130
 Within this third phase there are 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.130
 five types of television genres 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.130
 we will start with the informative genre 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.470
 television builds a reality 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.200
 informative from the facts 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.210
 occurred in society does not invent the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.670
 reality as in fiction but that 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.610
 seeks to interpret it within this 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.870
 genre we find the news that 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 they offer a reflection of the world 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.820
 transformed into narration however in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.360
 hyper television has resorted to 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.410
 use of techniques such as yellowness and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.880
 sensationalism among others the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.070
 motorcycle was voted a few 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.930
 centimeters where their bodies fell 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.150
 they led to a meeting in the head 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.879
 cantonal and very hurried 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.549
 has been invaded by another genre that 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.709
 is the advertising the report is 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.260
 characterized by presenting a theme of 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.450
 present in a profound way the captain 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.610
 of his school's sports team but 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.040
 when losing a match a teammate 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.769
 hit to the point that he fractured the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.170
 clavicle the documentary is a genre that 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.579
 offers non-subjective information where 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.400
 there are considerations of type 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.650
 artistic or deeper analysis 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.709
 about the causes and meaning of 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.290
 facts narrated player is advancing 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.609
 faster than the average of the countries 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.139
 from the countries of the other 18 countries and 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.060
 advancing in the sense with the sense 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.799
 correct the debate is the same as the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.109
 conversation between two or more people 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.629
 but adding an element of 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.510
 controversy the equator that they ask to be 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.410
 open that debate I do agree 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.510
 in signing treaties with nations 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.730
 the audiovisual interview is a dialogue 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.190
 between journalist and interviewed with the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.320
 purpose of obtaining information or 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.880
 a definition of the personality of 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.230
 I would like them to be 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.480
 here also to discuss these issues 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.530
 but of course not but if they have not 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.530
 could come have their reasons 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:01.530
 we continue with the genre fiction to the 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.900
 Fiction television shows provide 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.620
 a set of heterogeneous formulas and 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.440
 variables subject to trends and trends 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.680
 changes in the tastes of the audience in 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.900
 this genre we find the soap opera 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.989
 the telenovela is a genre organized in 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.200
 around melodramatic contents 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.520
 fictional but at the same time true 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.320
 we can quote the well-known novels 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.810
 mexicanas that monopolize our attention 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.670
 with dramatic stories many times 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.160
 based on entanglements where in the end the 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.110
 good always win instead the 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.310
 Colombian novels try to show us 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.430
 its different 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.770
 as is the case of Pablo Escobar without 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.770
 tits there is no paradise and rosary scissors 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:51.590
 that were coming for a suck 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.590
 they had to break legs 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:11.389
 the gender of the hand the docudrama could 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.979
 define itself as the construction 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.260
 reconstruction or dramatization of 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.080
 real events interpreted by 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.130
 its authentic protagonists in the 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.870
 documented genre the talk show 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.030
 responds to a format where a series of 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.729
 ordinary people are telling in 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.700
 succession personal experiences or more 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.130
 intimates referred to a single theme and 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.840

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.320
 the most scandalous marginal aspects 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.320
 morbid and raw reality
