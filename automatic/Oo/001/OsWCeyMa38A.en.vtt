00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:07.656
Namaskar! Welcome to Nishamadhulika.com.

00:00:08.702 --> 00:00:11.083
Today we will prepare soup stick.

00:00:11.202 --> 00:00:16.780
Soup stick is readily available in market but it can be prepared at home easily.

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:19.740
So let's start preparing soup stick.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:23.976
For soup stick take Plain flour - 1 cup.

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:27.210
Olive oil - 1 tbsp.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.054
Salt - 1/4 tsp or salt to taste.

00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:35.617
Sugar - 1/2 tsp.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.593
Instant dry active yeast - 1/2 tsp.

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:46.625
For soup stick we will prepare the dough.

00:00:47.115 --> 00:01:01.898
Take plain flour in a bowl and add sugar, salt, instant dry active yeast.

00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:09.124
The yeast doesn't need to be activated.

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:20.194
Add 2 tsp of oil and keep aside a little bit for further use.

00:01:21.218 --> 00:01:22.987
Mix all the ingredients.

00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:33.882
To the flour add lukewarm water in small quantities and prepare soft dough.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.475
Soft dough is ready.

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:53.593
Grease your palms with oil and knead the dough until it becomes soft.

00:01:53.998 --> 00:02:01.670
Knead the dough for 4-5 mins until soft.

00:02:03.913 --> 00:02:07.796
Soft dough is ready.

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:14.725
On touching, the grains of sugar or yeast may not be felt now.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.159
The dough is  smooth, elastic, and bounces back when pressed.

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:24.517
The dough is finally ready.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.613
We have used 1/3 cup of water for dough preparation.

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:38.170
Grease the dough with oil and keep aside for 2 hours to rest

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:44.069
And rise until it doubles in size, then  we will prepare the soup stick.

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:53.053
After 2 hours the dough is double in size.

00:02:53.263 --> 00:02:59.990
Apply dry plain flour on palm and punch the dough.

00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:13.964
Roll them into balls. Now flatten them.

00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:29.135
Sprinkle some flour on the board and roll it into thickness of 1/2 cm.

00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:32.166
Roll it in rectangular shape.

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:40.368
Rectangular shaped dough is finally ready.

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.743
Slice it from the edges to make it perfectly rectangular.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.531
Now slice the dough into 1/2 inch thick strips.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.438
Take a strip and twist it.

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.962
Keep it on a butter paper sheet.

00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:46.743
Prepare the strips likewise with the remaining dough.

00:04:46.955 --> 00:04:54.056
Preheat the oven in convection mode at a temperature of 180 degree centigrade.

00:04:54.603 --> 00:04:57.642
Now we will bake the soup stick.

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:08.923
Place the tray in the oven and set it at 180 degree centigrade for 10 mins.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.305
And then we will check it.

00:05:23.877 --> 00:05:26.938
Take out the tray and check the soup stick.

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:33.915
The soup stick have turned brown and now we will turn them.

00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:40.751
We had  baked the stick for 16 mins at 180 degree centigrade.

00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:53.111
Now we will bake them for 5-6 mins after flipping them.

00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:57.939
We have turned all the soup stick and now bake it.

00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:11.956
Take the soup stick from the oven.

00:06:18.414 --> 00:06:23.163

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:32.467
It took 3o mins to bake the soup stick at 180 degree centigrade

00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:39.310
We baked the soupstick for 10 mins and then we checked it but it was white.

00:06:39.396 --> 00:06:45.372
We baked it for 6 mins and flipped it and baked for 10 mins again

00:06:45.646 --> 00:06:51.365
Again the soup stick were not crunchy so we baked it again for 5 mins.

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:59.697
So it took around 30 mins to prepare the crunchy soup stick

00:07:00.463 --> 00:07:07.135
For different ovens the baking time will vary.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:20.540
Bake the soup stick for 15-16 mins and then turn them to bake again for 5 mins.

00:07:21.518 --> 00:07:25.494
Bake them until golden brown.

00:07:26.057 --> 00:07:31.479
