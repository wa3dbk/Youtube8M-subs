00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
a little more tutorials i guess you

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.970 
a little more tutorials i guess you
could<00:00:18.840> call<00:00:19.050> them<00:00:20.900> or<00:00:21.900> training<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.769> more

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
could call them or training as more

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:41.160 
could call them or training as more
training<00:00:23.460> those<00:00:23.640> who

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.439 

when<00:00:41.890> we<00:00:42.070> first<00:00:42.250> opened<00:00:42.489> up<00:00:42.820> it'll<00:00:43.030> ask<00:00:43.210> you<00:00:43.390> a

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
when we first opened up it'll ask you a

when we first opened up it'll ask you a
question<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.620> then<00:00:47.649> it<00:00:48.039> will<00:00:48.219> tell<00:00:48.609> you<00:00:48.730> to

question and then it will tell you to

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.450 
question and then it will tell you to
give<00:00:49.120> your<00:00:49.269> name<00:00:49.510> it<00:00:50.170> Alaska<00:00:50.620> over<00:00:50.859> your<00:00:51.070> birth

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
daily test now a daily test is all of

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.760 
daily test now a daily test is all of
the<00:00:59.789> subjects<00:01:00.789> in<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.739> training<00:01:02.739> room<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.439> a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
the subjects in the training room so a

the subjects in the training room so a
daily<00:01:06.189> test<00:01:06.430> would<00:01:06.670> do<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.850> logic<00:01:07.390> test<00:01:07.539> the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
daily test would do a logic test the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.160 
daily test would do a logic test the

math test a memory test a visual test in
a<00:01:11.259> focused<00:01:11.830> test<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:13.210> after<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.630> other

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
a focused test one after the other

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.059 
a focused test one after the other
you'll<00:01:15.369> do<00:01:15.550> those<00:01:15.759> once<00:01:16.090> per<00:01:16.300> day<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:17.069> you

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:18.069 
you'll do those once per day and you

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.249 
you'll do those once per day and you
know<00:01:18.250> like<00:01:19.090> brain<00:01:19.450> ages<00:01:19.750> will<00:01:19.869> tell<00:01:20.049> you<00:01:20.140> if

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
know like brain ages will tell you if

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.559 
know like brain ages will tell you if
you've<00:01:20.409> improved<00:01:20.799> or<00:01:21.250> actually<00:01:22.210> this<00:01:22.330> one

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
you've improved or actually this one

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.260 
you've improved or actually this one
tells<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:23.020> how<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:24.490> percentage<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.210> your

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
tells you how what percentage of your

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.749 
tells you how what percentage of your
brain<00:01:25.690> that<00:01:25.720> you<00:01:25.869> are<00:01:26.110> actually<00:01:26.229> using<00:01:26.740> on<00:01:27.580> my

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
brain that you are actually using on my

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.699 
brain that you are actually using on my
first<00:01:28.000> daily<00:01:28.390> test<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.869> believe<00:01:29.319> it's<00:01:29.500> that<00:01:29.619> i

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
first daily test I believe it's that i

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:39.120 
first daily test I believe it's that i
was<00:01:29.860> using<00:01:30.299> seven<00:01:31.299> percent<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:33.310> my<00:01:34.060> brain<00:01:38.130> so

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
was using seven percent of my brain so

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.649 
was using seven percent of my brain so
you<00:01:39.190> can<00:01:39.340> see<00:01:39.459> these<00:01:39.640> little<00:01:39.789> icons<00:01:40.000> mean<00:01:40.390> that

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
you can see these little icons mean that

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.410 
you can see these little icons mean that
i<00:01:40.750> haven't<00:01:41.459> used<00:01:42.459> play<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.240> game<00:01:43.600> yet<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:45.420> no

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
i haven't used play this game yet the no

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.730 
i haven't used play this game yet the no
icons<00:01:47.079> mean<00:01:47.200> i<00:01:47.350> have<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:49.149> a<00:01:49.299> little<00:01:49.329> quick

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.960 

sample

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.140 

loading<00:01:59.840> is<00:01:59.960> pretty<00:02:00.200> fast

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.870 

so<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.840> point<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.260> start<00:02:05.950> at<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.220> number<00:02:06.670> and

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
so the point is to start at a number and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.499 
so the point is to start at a number and
you<00:02:07.630> want<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.870> add<00:02:07.990> 4<00:02:08.290> to<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.680> so<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.700> then

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
you want to add 4 to it so that and then

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.620 
you want to add 4 to it so that and then
and<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.200> want<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> keep<00:02:11.530> going<00:02:12.240> until<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.450> get

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
and you want to keep going until you get

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.750 
and you want to keep going until you get
to<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.810> end<00:02:13.960> so<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.470> start<00:02:14.830> 41<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.550> want<00:02:15.700> to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
to the end so you start 41 you want to

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.270 
to the end so you start 41 you want to
subtract<00:02:16.270> 3<00:02:16.800> subtract<00:02:17.800> 3<00:02:18.540> subtract<00:02:19.540> 3

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the daily test you don't have a timer

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.080 
the daily test you don't have a timer
you're<00:03:00.689> actually<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.290> supposed<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.700> a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
you're actually just supposed to do a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.289 
you're actually just supposed to do a
certain<00:03:04.049> amount<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.470> these<00:03:07.939> you<00:03:08.939> also<00:03:09.150> have<00:03:09.269> a

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
certain amount of these you also have a

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.599 
certain amount of these you also have a
home<00:03:09.540> button<00:03:09.780> up<00:03:09.930> here<00:03:10.159> so<00:03:11.159> we<00:03:11.220> can<00:03:11.340> pause<00:03:11.579> it

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609

home button up here so we can pause it
we<00:03:11.939> can<00:03:12.060> resume<00:03:12.359> back<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.959> game<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.829> can

we can resume back to that game we can

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.190 
we can resume back to that game we can
restock<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.519> game<00:03:14.700> altogether<00:03:14.909> and<00:03:15.870> go<00:03:15.900> into
