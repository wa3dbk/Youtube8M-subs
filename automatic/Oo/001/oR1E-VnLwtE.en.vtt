00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.240
 another last mode presentation 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.790
 today yes I still have a weidemann 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.059
 headers found similar to 4270 cx 100 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.699
 like jaycee lee in chelsea like dlc can 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.279
 We are all telescopic handlers 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.539
 watch here 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.740
 Unfortunately this does not quite fit in here 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.109
 the broad one as you can see and me 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.279
 thought he wanders when you jump off 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.059
 He no longer wanders but rather wanders 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.980
 just as funny gets so wanders there 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.649
 This is a pity 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.350
 Unfortunately I believe in the 100 ps 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.090
 Let's have a look in the shop for one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.800
 telescopic loader to find jan weiler man 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 only we have also in picture me 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 think that has commented on 113 of 100 ps 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.770
 costs and 17,000 euros 320 euros 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 maintenance costs day we'll see if 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.410
 what i do free that is me in many 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.760
 call sticks but the weidemann seems 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.559
 I'm sure the morning spider 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.570
 you do not have to be where are you from 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.080
 otherwise be steady ex police surface oha 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.340
 physics well , there is no father because it 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 I can only speculate 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 so I'm not sure I could be too 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.869
 lock free I do not want anything 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 but they may cry out 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.790
 times better test if it is due to that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.590
 when everything comes out to watson 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.630
 second then it could be safe 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.119
 you can see that 13 actually 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.450
 is first of all a yes in itself 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.869
 that makes me that good 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.430
 I am sure of the top speed 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:45.899
 are 20 km h 25 behind is no no 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.090
 no speed maxim maximow 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.790
 stated ok 430 it takes longer 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.880
 until he comes on tour was 30 km up 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.320
 every case can be properly managed 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.079
 also the view that of course cool 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 then here free anywhere 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.020
 view have no cabin great steering wheel 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.689
 actually the animation or or 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.590
 Fittings are also cool the brake pedal 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.569
 we find 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.580
 lights we have unfortunately works 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.530
 not that is a pity but we have 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.930
 after all, at least functioning 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.269
 light that I express here in front 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.190
 and then almost a relapse 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.480
 not front back the further one logo 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.930
 from one side also on it and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.849
 we can raise it accordingly 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.480
 Pushing out is quite a lot 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:37.819
 Of course I have to say here 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.319
 nice to turn the shovel 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:46.670
 it's a pity that you really only 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.670
 maximum height is just what 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.489
 to stack high such as for example 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.019
 ball inside hayloft or something like that 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.390
 you would be so high now 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.730
 you should actually okay that 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.079
 it does not work 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.420
 we can live too high but we can 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.160
 do not give them that much forward 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.069
 that in 90 degrees angle forward 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.829
 bloated that is a real pity 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.840
 I do not know what that is supposed to mean 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.040
 I think that's just okay 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.220
 we can with left as has said 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.340
 right mouse button forward to backward 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.510
 retract 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.340
 I think I would be so 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.590
 somehow three stars give visual 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.569
 yes, we would get four of us 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.650
 very well out of the field is 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.750
 okay but a nice back is 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.940
 also there and because you buy the part or 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.829
 reset is it depends in the lead 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.900
 air and there you have to get in and 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.669
 start the motor he adverse psychosis 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.139
 then let's go down with his luck 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.090
 just on the right side at all 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.849
 four wheels again that's what I think 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.400
 can not be and also that one here 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.720
 from a certain height actually already 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.400
 from here no longer just does not happen 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.040
 We can learn more straightforward 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.750
 ahead 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.569
 the function is not far enough forward 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.389
 is that 90 degrees angle so here 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.680
 can unload something parallel to the ground 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:17.340
 I think that's a pity 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.840
 I do not know why that is so 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.269
 not normal that must be a mistake 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.860
 be because I want something more than 23 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.570
 meter scale with the part and it works 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.060
 It's just not possible here 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.620
 further than here 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.690
 this is not because of the fork because 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.120
 even without it does not go so well 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.169
 There are only three stars here 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.919
 visually a beautiful part you have to 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.600
 you do not say anything 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.520
 sounds quiet and discreet and I believe 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.979
 it certainly makes fun especially because 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.620
 the innenansicht beautiful here makes it well 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.820
 you could maybe still a bit 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.139
 the field of view change the field of view 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.820
 show a bit more of the field of vision 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.479
 You can always do that in the 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.680
 giants editor but if these too 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.840
 this error to come then he 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.320
 in the evening he has the three stars full 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.820
 earned 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.139
 I would like a little bit more 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.639
 We're tinkering with this 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.040
 That's especially when you fix it 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.900
 the part purchase that is gefixed and 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.090
 Maybe the error is wrong 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.130
 from this place are good that 's it too 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.410
 me I can not not have the courage 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.120
 unreservedly recommend how would wait 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.800
 or will not be able to do it yourself 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.830
 Try if I can 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.260
 to fix these things 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.760
 and yes, you would believe it 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.010
 certainly have fun 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.080
 okay that's it then only friends do it 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.080
 good until soon servus
