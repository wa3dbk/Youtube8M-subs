00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.800
 today we will cook fish pie 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:24.029
 this fish pie was cooked by my sister 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 husband and recipe it was very interesting i 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.309
 This recipe is lucky for the first time how to cook 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.329
 for live dough you'll see me on 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:36.770
 site and there is in my video tube you can 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.020
 stay there take a dough and 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.500
 make a small square out of it 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 spread it on a leaf then on this 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.609
 leaf 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.859
 we stack potatoes thinly thinly 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.460
 chopped potatoes you look like me 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.829
 I do it all potatoes and I fold 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.960
 next to each other a little bit 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.309
 friend comes to all 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.990
 so that the whole area of this and our revel 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:12.830
 lay potatoes raw as follows 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.829
 layer will be chopped onion half rings 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.399
 thin half rings bow and need to put 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.790
 lot 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.000
 because of the number of onions depends 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.240
 taste I took two huge big 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.299
 bulbs 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.229
 put one on the bottom 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.520
 of the rope on top of our cake 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.390
 it means three cakes 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 here's an example so now you need salt 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.990
 because unsalted potatoes are stupid not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.850
 salty foods don't know on her either 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.159
 under salt 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.979
 period than we put the cake under the salt 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.130
 then here comes the bow and the following 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.009
 a layer of fish will go fish fresh 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.079
 cut into floors and halves along 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.460
 along the ridge bones all cleaned all 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.610
 fins all-all way 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.890
 We lay out this fish entirely, that is, not 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.170
 cut into pieces do not make it stuffing a 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:18.200
 right all the way right now I'm 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.100
 I will show you how to do this 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.200
 such a fish 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.960
 peeled but she skinned i'm not 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.500
 filmed because it doesn't matter 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:34.610
 This is the fish that Christopher caught in 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.730
 the sea at first probably it is called 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.680
 she was very fat like these need 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.810
 four pieces put just be 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.090
 enough here I will right now 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.070
 fit u now in reverse order 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.990
 I report onions first and then potatoes 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.820
 and on top I'll put the next cake 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.920
 still need to add bay leaves and 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:04.760
 any if you have seasoning 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:07.420
 for fish will be very cool and top 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.349
 we put potatoes again 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.819
 on the bottom on the bottom potato pancakes 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:18.150
 it was more necessary a little bit on the box all 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.390
 equal try you have to close everything let 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.380
 between potatoes but some distances 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:31.560
 here is this potato top and log they 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:36.599
 cleave top cakes are cakes 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:40.540
 share with fish but in general of course they eat 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:44.610
 together tear down the cover with fish with 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.610
 potatoes all as one one piece 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:54.540
 fish all the pits can not be afraid 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:57.640
 so here is such a wind and when me 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.239
 my husband's sister met this 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.980
 the recipe I was still very young and me 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:08.769
 I really liked this cake 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.870
 all liked it cooked din of those 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.670
 then she taught me a lot and 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.350
 it was still then generally young i was 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:21.220
 another 21 22 years old here i have many recipes 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:25.780
 but using and here this one of hers 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.140
 recipes and wherever I cooked such 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.160
 pie 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:37.020
 Sam liked the dough need a little bit 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.020
 knead it up 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:49.170
 I make a cake a little less than 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.780
 can then from the borders because I will 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.140
 carry her she grow a little they 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.140
 colors 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.780
 Now let's take another round to 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:31.930
 secure all the places because close up 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:38.229
 I need to carefully Th I juice will be 10 kick 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:45.229
 on the leaf it is undesirable to try 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:51.099
 less juice and tortilla itself will be 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.099
 delicious tasty will be potatoes with onions 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:01.450
 and cut off 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.450
 some here let ios 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.770
 my 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:18.399
 you 3 now put in the oven on 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:21.449
 Crete is different to a temperature of 180 degrees 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:26.099
 put the finished cake in the oven on 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:30.329
 we beat the middle of the egg 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.329
 until smooth 

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:44.079
 the crust became slightly golden I'm 150 

00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:45.939
 let him stand still 

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:48.609
 I do not know that potatoes are not yet 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:51.099
 cooked chicken legs are ready and 

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:55.919
 below and above so I decided 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.919
 top cover with taiga 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.169
 I think the cake is ready 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.860
 lubricate the egg 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:33.009
 bye pie is hot now face on it 

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:36.389
 will be ready and up the spiral 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:36.389
