00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.599
 hi to all from the former twenty in the video 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.460
 of today we will answer to have francesco 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.369
 receive information on tarmo 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.859
 we are talking about terrestrial turtles andrea 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.160
 the weather controlled better off or in 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.960
 Home Lipari use of bases made 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.480
 I have to build something more 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.239
 repaired and possible precautions for 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.129
 protect the interdicts the rectangle 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.870
 can be done both outside the home 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.489
 the important thing is that it is respected e 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.500
 those none of ideal paralysis 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.290
 precisely to complete it 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.629
 which means reaching and getting 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.970
 sufficiently low temperatures that 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.699
 for turtles then commits 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.290
 supermario ghega if there are around 4 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.180
 5 degrees centigrade 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.330
 if we can guarantee these 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.680
 temperatures in the house to come otherwise 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.710
 let's do the trick outside 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.890
 obviously we have to cater to have 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.330
 ideal shelters to protect 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.950
 on the other hand among those sony agents 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.500
 atmospheric so avoid the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.900
 flooding and especially predators 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.260
 predators like rodents against which 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.600
 it can be sufficient 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.920
 a typical cage with cruciani he must 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.690
 be buried 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.310
 be careful though to also protect from 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.780
 all because of tourists 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.950
 lane t that can reach e 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.950
 turtles the measure 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.990
 francesco instead asks testudo 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.910
 hermanni I built about two years 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.170
 the pottery on the balcony and now that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.750
 winter comes I don't know how to behave 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.000
 I'll leave you out or report 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.000
 absolute free inside then all 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.440
 the emperor was not rigid 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.690
 Francesco tartarughina can be 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.770
 left quietly where it is 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.660
 finds precisely because I believe that the inter 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.970
 ha tale is well sheltered from the gods 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.350
 Atmospheric agents can also lead to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.180
 inside obviously as we said 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.340
 first we must respect the good 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.720
 temperatures 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.720
 ok with the next questions
