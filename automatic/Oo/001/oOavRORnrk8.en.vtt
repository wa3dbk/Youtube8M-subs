my other drill to work on toss placement
but<00:00:26.220> he<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.460> having<00:00:26.760> trouble<00:00:26.910> with<00:00:27.150> his

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
but he was having trouble with his

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.660 
but he was having trouble with his
height<00:00:27.750> he<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.769> asking<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.250> height<00:00:29.460> should

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
height he was asking what height should

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.030 
height he was asking what height should
I<00:00:29.730> toss<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.300> how<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.660> practice<00:00:30.990> being<00:00:31.800> more

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
I toss and how can I practice being more

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.450 
I toss and how can I practice being more
consistent<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.820> my<00:00:33.059> height<00:00:33.510> well<00:00:34.460> there

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
consistent with my height well there

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.450 
consistent with my height well there
isn't<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:36.239> height<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.829> everybody<00:00:38.340> should

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
isn't one height that everybody should

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.310 
isn't one height that everybody should
toss<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.420> first<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
toss to you because first of all the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.510 
toss to you because first of all the
most<00:00:40.440> obvious<00:00:40.920> thing<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.250> we're<00:00:41.430> all

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
most obvious thing is we're all

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
most obvious thing is we're all
different<00:00:41.760> heights<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.680> less

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
different heights but a little less

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
different heights but a little less
obvious<00:00:44.100> than<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.120> all<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
obvious than that is that we all have a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.020 
obvious than that is that we all have a
little<00:00:45.840> bit<00:00:46.020> different<00:00:46.410> rhythms<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.760> our

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
little bit different rhythms with our

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.049 
little bit different rhythms with our
service<00:00:48.719> motion<00:00:49.140> some<00:00:49.530> players<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.430> quick

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
service motion some players have a quick

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
service motion some players have a quick
rhythm<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.110> they<00:00:52.230> put<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> toss<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.250> they

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
rhythm and they put the toss up and they

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.610 
rhythm and they put the toss up and they
immediately<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.969> into<00:00:54.000> their<00:00:54.510> motion<00:00:55.260> other

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
immediately go into their motion other

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.939 
immediately go into their motion other
players<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:57.000> slower

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
players have a little bit slower

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.010 
players have a little bit slower
smoother<00:00:58.949> rhythm<00:00:59.489> they'll<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> toss<00:01:00.719> up

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
smoother rhythm they'll put the toss up

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
smoother rhythm they'll put the toss up
and<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.649> take<00:01:01.859> their<00:01:02.039> time<00:01:02.250> getting<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and kind of take their time getting to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.820 
and kind of take their time getting to
their<00:01:03.000> trophy<00:01:03.359> pose<00:01:03.539> before<00:01:04.290> they<00:01:04.379> finally

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
their trophy pose before they finally

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820 
their trophy pose before they finally
goes<00:01:05.070> through<00:01:05.640> their<00:01:05.850> full<00:01:06.210> motion<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.740> know

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
goes through their full motion you know

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.830 
goes through their full motion you know
pro<00:01:08.100> example<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.939> somebody<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> very

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
pro example of somebody with a very

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.550 
pro example of somebody with a very
quick<00:01:10.260> rhythm<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.189> Doga<00:01:12.180> pull-off<00:01:12.570> he's<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
quick rhythm is Doga pull-off he's the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
quick rhythm is Doga pull-off he's the
person<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.220> me<00:01:14.340> immediately<00:01:15.030> comes<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
person that for me immediately comes to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.780 
person that for me immediately comes to
mind<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:16.290> seems<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.890> he<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.460> hits<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
mind it seems like he actually hits the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.710 
mind it seems like he actually hits the
ball<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> still<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> rise<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.720> for

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
ball with it still on the rise so for

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.590 
ball with it still on the rise so for
example<00:01:22.140> using<00:01:22.470> him<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.909> his<00:01:24.210> toss

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
example using him you know his toss

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.130 
example using him you know his toss
height<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.740> much<00:01:26.040> lower

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
height is going to be much lower

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.480 
height is going to be much lower
ultimately<00:01:28.140> than<00:01:28.829> somebody<00:01:29.189> who<00:01:29.310> has<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
ultimately than somebody who has a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.840 
ultimately than somebody who has a
little<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:29.880> longer<00:01:30.380> smoother<00:01:31.380> motion<00:01:32.130> like

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
little bit longer smoother motion like

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
little bit longer smoother motion like
Federer<00:01:33.270> who<00:01:33.810> allows<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.380> ball<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.619> come<00:01:34.770> down

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
Federer who allows the ball to come down

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.960 
Federer who allows the ball to come down
from<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> top<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> toss<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.700> Paul<00:01:38.700> in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
from the top of the toss so Paul in

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.730 
from the top of the toss so Paul in
short<00:01:39.240> there's<00:01:39.479> no<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.079> can't<00:01:40.320> tell<00:01:40.590> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
short there's no like I can't tell you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.230 
short there's no like I can't tell you
it's<00:01:40.860> seven<00:01:41.220> foot<00:01:41.430> eight<00:01:41.460> inches<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.119> that's

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it's seven foot eight inches and that's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
it's seven foot eight inches and that's
where<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> toss<00:01:42.689> should<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.710> depends<00:01:44.040> on

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
where the toss should be it depends on

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.920 
where the toss should be it depends on
your<00:01:44.280> rhythm<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.060> heights<00:01:45.299> but

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
your rhythm and on your heights but

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.270 
your rhythm and on your heights but
here's<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.200> drill<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.829> work<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.220> that

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
here's a drill that you can work on that

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.940 
here's a drill that you can work on that
and<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> suggest<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.930> find<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.530> wall

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and what I suggest you do is find a wall

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.240 
and what I suggest you do is find a wall
or<00:01:50.280> any<00:01:50.430> kind<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> surface<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.250> use

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
or any kind of surface that you can use

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.190 
or any kind of surface that you can use
for<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.640> purpose<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.689> doesn't<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.079> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
for this purpose and it doesn't have to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.539 
for this purpose and it doesn't have to
be<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> tennis<00:01:55.710> court<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.189> anywhere

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
be on a tennis court it can be anywhere

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.240 
be on a tennis court it can be anywhere
and<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.530> stand<00:01:59.070> up

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
and what I want you to do is stand up

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.459 
and what I want you to do is stand up
next<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> wall<00:01:59.750> reach<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.170> fully

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
next to the wall reach up and fully

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.920 
next to the wall reach up and fully
extend<00:02:01.979> with<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.430> racket<00:02:02.759> next<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> and

extend with your racket next to it and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.029 
extend with your racket next to it and
then<00:02:04.860> you're<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> pick<00:02:05.640> out<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> spot

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
then you're going to pick out a spot

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.369 
then you're going to pick out a spot
typically<00:02:08.039> about<00:02:08.250> 8<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.700> 12<00:02:08.819> inches<00:02:09.090> above<00:02:09.539> the

tip of your racket at full extension so

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.510 
tip of your racket at full extension so
you'll<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:14.010> here

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
you'll see here

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.270

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640

to the left and I'm just simply
practicing<00:03:32.760> my<00:03:32.940> ability<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.709> consistent

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
practicing my ability to be consistent

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.250 
practicing my ability to be consistent
with<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.820> placement<00:03:36.270> of<00:03:36.330> my<00:03:36.390> toss<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.990> as<00:03:37.080> you

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
with the placement of my toss and as you

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.840 
with the placement of my toss and as you
do<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.590> you're<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.310> find<00:03:38.520> that<00:03:38.760> the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
do this you're going to find that the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.510 
do this you're going to find that the
more<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.300> use<00:03:39.510> your<00:03:39.630> shoulder<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:41.010> guide

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
more that you use your shoulder to guide

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.430 
more that you use your shoulder to guide
the<00:03:41.790> ball<00:03:41.970> up<00:03:42.150> into<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.450> air<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:43.260> more

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
the ball up into the air the more

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.470 
the ball up into the air the more
consistent<00:03:43.920> you're<00:03:44.250> going<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.550> be<00:03:44.700> if<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.360> use

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
consistent you're going to be if you use

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.210 
consistent you're going to be if you use
the<00:03:45.630> smaller<00:03:45.990> parts<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.470> your<00:03:46.620> body<00:03:46.800> like<00:03:46.920> your

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the smaller parts of your body like your

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.940 
the smaller parts of your body like your
wrists<00:03:47.490> your<00:03:48.209> elbow<00:03:48.600> your<00:03:48.810> hand<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.680> kind<00:03:49.890> of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
wrists your elbow your hand to kind of

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.800 
wrists your elbow your hand to kind of
flip<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.370> ball<00:03:50.520> up<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.820> air<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.630> have<00:03:51.660> a

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
flip the ball up in the air you have a

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.250 
flip the ball up in the air you have a
very<00:03:52.080> short<00:03:52.830> abrupt<00:03:53.450> tossing<00:03:54.450> motion<00:03:54.810> you'll

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
very short abrupt tossing motion you'll

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.720 
very short abrupt tossing motion you'll
find<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:55.740> very<00:03:56.040> difficult<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.610> be

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
find that it's very difficult to be

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.030 
find that it's very difficult to be
consistent<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:57.530> really<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.590> just<00:03:58.650> want<00:03:58.980> to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
consistent so really you just want to

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.430 
consistent so really you just want to
have<00:03:59.130> one<00:03:59.160> hinge<00:03:59.820> point<00:04:00.150> your<00:04:00.750> shoulder<00:04:01.230> and

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
have one hinge point your shoulder and

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.490 
have one hinge point your shoulder and
just<00:04:01.920> guide<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.700> lift<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.720> ball<00:04:03.870> up<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.350> where

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
just guide and lift the ball up to where

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.550 
just guide and lift the ball up to where
you<00:04:04.590> want<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.980> go<00:04:06.170> progression<00:04:07.170> number<00:04:07.380> two

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
you want it to go progression number two

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.260 
you want it to go progression number two
would<00:04:07.800> be<00:04:07.920> starting<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.520> that<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.970> same

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
would be starting in that that same

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.960 
would be starting in that that same
position<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:09.959> now<00:04:10.470> actually<00:04:11.040> go<00:04:11.070> back<00:04:11.550> into

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.550 
straight up-and-down fashion if you have
a<00:05:12.030> little<00:05:12.360> bit<00:05:12.480> of<00:05:12.570> arc<00:05:12.780> to<00:05:12.960> your<00:05:13.080> toss<00:05:13.290> that's

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
a little bit of arc to your toss that's

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.920 
a little bit of arc to your toss that's
totally<00:05:13.950> fine<00:05:14.160> as<00:05:14.370> well<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:15.300> key<00:05:15.570> here<00:05:15.900> is

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
totally fine as well the key here is

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.020 
totally fine as well the key here is
that<00:05:16.170> you're<00:05:16.320> using<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:17.070> mark<00:05:17.580> on<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.850> wall

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
that you're using that mark on the wall

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.390 
that you're using that mark on the wall
or<00:05:18.240> that<00:05:18.360> tape<00:05:18.690> as<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:18.930> reference<00:05:19.590> points<00:05:20.070> in

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
or that tape as a reference points in

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.660 
or that tape as a reference points in
you're<00:05:20.940> gaining<00:05:21.410> consistency<00:05:22.410> in<00:05:22.650> how<00:05:23.310> your

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
you're gaining consistency in how your

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.580 
you're gaining consistency in how your
toss<00:05:23.910> travels<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.750> height<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.230> travels

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
toss travels the height that it travels

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.800 
toss travels the height that it travels
to<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:26.160> direction<00:05:26.490> that<00:05:26.670> it<00:05:26.820> travels<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.330> you

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
to the direction that it travels and you

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.810 
to the direction that it travels and you
want<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.290> to<00:05:28.320> be<00:05:28.560> as<00:05:28.650> consistent<00:05:29.280> as<00:05:29.340> possible

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
want it to be as consistent as possible

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.050 
want it to be as consistent as possible
however<00:05:30.270> ultimately<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:31.230> happens<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:31.770> be

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
however ultimately that happens to be

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.420 
however ultimately that happens to be
relative<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.960> piece<00:05:34.110> of<00:05:34.260> tape<00:05:34.430> so

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
relative to the piece of tape so

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.740 
relative to the piece of tape so
hopefully<00:05:35.700> that<00:05:35.820> makes<00:05:35.850> sense

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
hopefully that makes sense

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.300 
hopefully that makes sense
