the long sides we will start with the
longest<00:00:37.900> side<00:00:38.080> so<00:00:38.379> let's<00:00:38.559> thread<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.980> lacing

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
longest side so let's thread the lacing

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:49.890 
longest side so let's thread the lacing

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.570 

now<00:00:50.900> we<00:00:50.960> will<00:00:51.380> adjust<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.890> square<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:52.550> that

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
now we will adjust the square so that

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.030 
now we will adjust the square so that
the<00:00:52.880> spots<00:00:53.150> line<00:00:53.450> up<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.380> first<00:00:54.710> square

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
the spots line up the first square

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.490 
the spots line up the first square
should<00:00:55.670> overlap<00:00:56.150> the<00:00:56.450> one<00:00:56.630> next<00:00:56.900> to<00:00:57.200> it<00:00:57.230> check

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
should overlap the one next to it check

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.650 
should overlap the one next to it check
to<00:00:58.309> see<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.700> slots<00:00:59.059> are<00:00:59.270> lining<00:00:59.450> up

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
to see that the slots are lining up

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.530 
to see that the slots are lining up
here's<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.559> good<00:01:00.770> tip<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.640> slots<00:01:01.940> align<00:01:02.330> when

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
here's a good tip the slots align when

here's a good tip the slots align when
the<00:01:02.629> squares<00:01:02.989> are<00:01:03.199> overlapped<00:01:03.710> three<00:01:04.220> zigzags

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
the squares are overlapped three zigzags
