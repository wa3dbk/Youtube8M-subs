the reason I got this one is it was
actually<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.120> good<00:00:36.469> version<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.739> Batman

I<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.480> he's<00:00:45.719> their<00:00:46.289> best<00:00:46.469> hero<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.950> my

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
I think he's their best hero in my

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.119 
I think he's their best hero in my
opinion<00:00:48.050> but<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> way<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.590> he<00:00:49.739> looks<00:00:49.980> in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
opinion but the way that he looks in

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.010 
opinion but the way that he looks in
this<00:00:50.309> figure<00:00:50.520> was<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.300> awesome<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.930> I
