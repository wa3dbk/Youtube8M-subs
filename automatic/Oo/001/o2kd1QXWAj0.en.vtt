one it's extremely light and the reason
it's<00:00:16.560> light<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.730> neodymium

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
it's light is because of the neodymium

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.009 
it's light is because of the neodymium
woofer<00:00:18.869> magnet<00:00:19.710> woofer<00:00:19.980> that's<00:00:20.160> inside<00:00:21.019> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
playing CDs music playback there's a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.239 
playing CDs music playback there's a
slight<00:01:27.119> boost<00:01:27.359> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.749> low<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:28.109> high<00:01:28.249> and

slight boost on the low and the high and
the<00:01:29.460> DJ<00:01:29.789> setting<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:31.799> important<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.399> us

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the DJ setting which is important for us

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.270 
the DJ setting which is important for us
because<00:01:32.819> of<00:01:33.060> our<00:01:33.179> torque<00:01:33.479> software<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.280> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
because of our torque software and the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.899 
because of our torque software and the
hardware<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.319> it<00:01:37.319> is<00:01:37.649> a<00:01:37.679> 5<00:01:38.340> DB<00:01:38.700> boost

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

then is the handles that we designed

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.050 
then is the handles that we designed
into<00:02:07.319> the<00:02:07.439> cabinet<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.550> mentioned<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.000> a

watt<00:02:48.560> subwoofer<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:50.120> that's<00:02:50.840> basically<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.769> a

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
watt subwoofer so that's basically it a

watt subwoofer so that's basically it a
robust<00:02:53.780> design<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.230> guess<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> last<00:02:54.799> thing<00:02:55.040> I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
robust design I guess the last thing I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.009 
robust design I guess the last thing I
would<00:02:55.280> mention<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.910> flared<00:02:56.150> ports<00:02:56.599> which

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
would mention is the flared ports which

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.690 
would mention is the flared ports which
minimize<00:02:57.560> port<00:02:57.920> turbulence<00:02:58.370> which<00:02:58.549> is<00:02:58.670> a

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
minimize port turbulence which is a

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.880 
minimize port turbulence which is a
great<00:02:58.940> feature<00:02:59.209> especially<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.560> DJ

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
great feature especially in the DJ

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.410 
great feature especially in the DJ

it<00:03:05.090> minimizes<00:03:05.720> port<00:03:06.440> Distortion<00:03:07.099> which<00:03:07.250> is

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
it minimizes port Distortion which is

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.960 
it minimizes port Distortion which is
