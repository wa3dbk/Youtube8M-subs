open<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.610> egg<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.390> already<00:01:48.570> picked<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
open up this egg that I already picked a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
open up this egg that I already picked a
little<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.940> says<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
little bit more it says this is a
