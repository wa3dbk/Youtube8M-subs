00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.599
 it's basically a question I do not know what 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 said something about the real you as a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.650
 reference or as the one who made him a 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 moment hinge and the story is beautiful 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.439
 then I would like you to count it 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 because they want a story, never the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.130
 contain and you want the account to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.289
 I would love it when I go to the program 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.789
 Jorge Rial I start talking in a 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.300
 era where you could talk was already 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.490
 divorced I was with the chipping 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.250
 If you are pregnant you are not pregnant and 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.080
 so 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.120
 I saw that he gave him a lot 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.010
 ball what I told you saw that one did not 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.830
 it was an interesting there was no danger 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:49.120
 there was quilombo 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:51.160
 then because then there was nothing 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.370
 of that began to talk seriously and 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.720
 if he looked at me and being together 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.510
 in sea ​​of ​​silver because he confessed that 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.800
 I really had been like I did not 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.780
 it had been a trigger but like that 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.550
 he was thinking a lot about what I 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.350
 told history in addition to the story in 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.270
 reality had to do with this that I 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.070
 I felt so one feels so bad 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.899
 when when she got divorced can 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.430
 not have on all the ladies that 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.090
 they have my age do not get married 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.009
 divorce with what people think 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.420
 because to say a misfortune for 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.960
 divorce does not get married so you're 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.550
 still like that a moment point for this 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.770
 term and starts to where they have 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.979
 start at that moment decision in a 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.080
 very very very ugly moment because first 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.890
 break the mold your father because we 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.650
 same 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.020
 raised with this that I do not part for 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.650
 you clear then one costs you 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.260
 break that mold and you think that love 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.190
 he does not deserve it and it seems that in the end 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.440
 goes well and have the children 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.930
 good is how the notebook has everything 8 and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.940
 have a marriage that is not so 8 and 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.250
 it is in 4 but it does not have the same 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.990
 general average be for some day you 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.080
 I felt that not safari and I in a 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.490
 moment since it really decides the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.709
 death 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.709
 is going to death because there really is 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.020
 need for assholes 50 years and 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.480
 then I said 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.730
 and then thanks to nobody I have turned everything 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.180
 that I tried to see that to see it as a 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.890
 blessing is like that and when I told him 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.440
 to them because I saw that he was listening to me 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.390
 interested that you really see 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.720
 first with a dad and how do not you see 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.130
 usually and this and second counting 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.500
 something that surely many people of the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.650
 other side with your age or with mine or with 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.270
 whoever it may be living 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.340
 look 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.310
 and it is neither pri nor for a side nor for 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.990
 the other you saw because here you see they are 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.830
 like those who are in favor I do not 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.319
 Interests you saw but I say one tries not to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.840
 since 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.370
 since it comes out it's like that you dress and it makes you 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.150
 the track and you accept some can 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.700
 lose weight reaching 150 kilos 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.849
 one can reach those surpassing 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.739
 the 10 kilos or one can not stand the 500 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.049
 grams of mairata reach the track that 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.510
 it occurs to you in the decision to take 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.540
 a decision of something to leave something 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.040
 it does not happen to all the same and each one 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.780
 holds over the needle and others do not 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.760
 they hold so much and others do not want it 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.370
 endure and others believe that they do not have 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.069
 because to put up with it was my case and good 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.200
 try but the thing does not differ 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.640
 because I saw a lot that I am now that 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.200
 has social networks that practically 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.510
 I kill myself every time I'm with twitter and 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.099
 that I see the amount of people 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.019
 ignorant that it was not before 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.099
 protagonist in total life now to 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.599
 through the social network can be 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.640
 protagonist well if what you sing them 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:55.360
 the balls and blog entry 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.460
 bullies is going to be clear this 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.870
 but I saw that there were people who were 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.140
 for one side and there are people who were for 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.830
 the other 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.280
 and well what is the thing that is there 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.270
 see that the cabriel hall took that and I say 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.490
 I 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.040
 well he told me and you see that marcela tauro 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.730
 I knew it and that's what happened that's what 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.100
 who commented more so far is not that 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.230
 and I convinced him not to but I 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.960
 It seems that when one is sometimes in 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.160
 a similar situation and can 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.790
 observe another person who is 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.560
 allowed that he managed to move to that step that 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.600
 I must say that sometimes so difficult to 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.490
 point that you said you preferred is the 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.960
 death before making a decision or knowing 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.730
 how to handle that question and is that very 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.650
 ugly apart apart there is no worse thing is 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.920
 that when one reaches a certain 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.800
 wave crest 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.990
 let the enemy know the enemy between 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.950
 quotes know that you have some 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.100
 weakness like you're in love I say 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:03.300
 I do not know if someone from here has 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.730
 past or not but it seems like it was 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.170
 when those who are yours and those who are 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.450
 who are in front and those who are in 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.280
 the negotiating table and they look at you 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.210
 as distinct and one feels the look of 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.030
 different because one thinks that the mind 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.500
 dominates the heart and one has grown up 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.060
 arriving number one for dad and 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.639
 anesthetizing the heart putting heart 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.710
 a cubetera 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.719
 copying those paternal models that 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.099
 said our parents saw the one 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:33.020
 he feels he eats it understand then they are 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.939
 pretty hard to break those molds to me 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.219
 it seems to me that they always ended up 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.050
 giving the heart and when he sends us something 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.699
 It should be like a child now 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.789
 uses one thing but if the 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.789
 amount of country kant people and 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.740
 of things and after where is the 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.539
 heart is enough in kindergarten and 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.009
 he really is in college others 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.360
 I would die 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.669
 would have to see later when they put the 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.330
 head on the pillow happier but still 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.599
 he does what he can 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.139
 I like this pearl like this to me 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.139
 I like it 's made
