00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.960
 Hello everyone, Kate, and today we are 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.570
 let's play fifa 14 from ea sports 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.449
 1 for what I want to bow to the developers 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.400
 So this for animation until graphics here, too, 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.439
 at the level but if you compare it with 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.449
 the last version of the improvement is not very 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.609
 meaningful and overall revolution here is not 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.559
 happened but from what only cost 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.489
 shock animation and overall work 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.309
 ball player 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.559
 I do not want to intercept the game but work 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.450
 done here so good that 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.120
 sometimes when watching replay you feel 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.430
 the depth and atmosphere of the match second 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.250
 pleasant moment was the presence of 16,000 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.410
 real players and 600 teams figures 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.449
 really good but also pay for 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.210
 they will have a place on the disk and weigh 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.789
 the game is not much is not enough h1 and 3 gigabytes 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.670
 however on modern devices it is not 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.500
 will become a hindrance well and on old it is old 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.839
 it will simply slow down 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.490
 fancy play so play new 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.229
 football will not come to everyone 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.299
 well now let's go to a little 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.820
 unpleasant moment namely the game 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.310
 Regime Deal in is that for us 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.950
 only available Ultimate Team Series 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.869
 penalty and match of the week last by the way 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.520
 It seemed to me the most interesting 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.350
 because it allows you to run matches 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.479
 which are about to take place in 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.900
 real life all other mode 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.570
 sold separately for real money 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.310
 control in the game is divided into two types 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.409
 classic and swipe control though 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.360
 the second I frankly did not like so 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.939
 does not give full control over the sword 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.920
 However, even playing the classics with 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.869
 change players and give commands with wipes 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.220
 the goalkeeper 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.110
 conclusion I want to say that despite 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.479
 certain game confidence to play me 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.490
 definitely worth it because for me 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.060
 Clearly better than the Donat system in real 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.850
 football 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.619
 and with me on it all play modern 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.360
