00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.800 
all the switches etc to make the thing
work<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:45.980> let's<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.130> go<00:02:47.250> around<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.519> back<00:02:47.810> to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
work so let's just go around it back to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.500 
depth of the matches there you can see
what<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> mean<00:03:06.390> these<00:03:06.599> just<00:03:06.870> slide<00:03:07.560> into<00:03:07.799> place

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
what I mean these just slide into place

what I mean these just slide into place
like<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:10.970> they'll<00:03:11.970> all<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.359> covered<00:03:12.660> up

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
like that and they'll all be covered up
