they're<00:01:10.460> just<00:01:10.700> trying<00:01:11.539> to<00:01:11.570> indoctrinate<00:01:12.700> all

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700

they're just trying to indoctrinate all
the<00:01:13.820> franchise<00:01:14.390> or<00:01:14.800> maybe<00:01:15.800> they've<00:01:16.070> toned<00:01:16.490> it

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
the franchise or maybe they've toned it

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.010 
the franchise or maybe they've toned it
down<00:01:16.759> for<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.270> way<00:01:17.450> i<00:01:17.479> haven't<00:01:17.840> played<00:01:17.930> a

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
down for the way i haven't played a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.190 
down for the way i haven't played a
gamecube<00:01:18.560> version<00:01:18.590> yet<00:01:19.070> but<00:01:19.849> seriously<00:01:20.509> if

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
gamecube version yet but seriously if

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.960 
gamecube version yet but seriously if
they<00:01:21.560> could<00:01:21.770> have<00:01:21.890> like<00:01:22.099> had<00:01:22.280> an<00:01:22.369> option<00:01:22.789> where

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
they could have like had an option where

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.520 
they could have like had an option where
the<00:01:23.060> enemies<00:01:23.390> hit<00:01:23.569> harder<00:01:23.959> you<00:01:24.110> take<00:01:24.319> more

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
the enemies hit harder you take more

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.199 
the enemies hit harder you take more
damage<00:01:24.740> depth<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.819> would<00:01:26.000> have<00:01:26.090> really

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:26.209 
damage depth that would have really

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.020 
damage depth that would have really
helped<00:01:26.690> my<00:01:27.679> second<00:01:28.190> problem<00:01:28.429> is<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:28.940> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
helped my second problem is that the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.960 
helped my second problem is that the
game<00:01:29.240> feels<00:01:29.569> hollow<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.679> it<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.399> my<00:01:31.550> second

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
game feels hollow and it is my second

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.270 
game feels hollow and it is my second
problem<00:01:32.179> because<00:01:32.840> i'm<00:01:33.259> not<00:01:33.619> even<00:01:33.770> sure<00:01:33.920> what<00:01:34.190> I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
problem because i'm not even sure what I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.820 
problem because i'm not even sure what I
mean<00:01:34.520> well<00:01:35.270> I'm<00:01:35.390> sure<00:01:35.690> what<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:35.869> mean<00:01:36.200> but<00:01:36.530> it's

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
mean well I'm sure what I mean but it's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.830 
mean well I'm sure what I mean but it's
kind<00:01:37.190> of<00:01:37.250> hard<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.550> explain<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:38.569> sort<00:01:38.750> of

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
kind of hard to explain it's sort of

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.109 
kind of hard to explain it's sort of
like<00:01:38.899> a<00:01:39.200> glass<00:01:39.740> three<00:01:40.550> fourth<00:01:40.849> of<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.090> way

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
like a glass three fourth of the way

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.320 
like a glass three fourth of the way
full<00:01:41.479> there's<00:01:42.440> still<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:42.890> lot<00:01:43.190> but<00:01:43.580> when<00:01:44.179> you

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
full there's still a lot but when you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.290 
full there's still a lot but when you
look<00:01:44.539> at<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.780> you're<00:01:45.080> gonna<00:01:45.259> notice<00:01:45.709> that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
look at it you're gonna notice that

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.750 
look at it you're gonna notice that
there's<00:01:46.810> stuff<00:01:47.170> missing<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:48.040> that's<00:01:48.640> what

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
there's stuff missing and that's what

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.430 
there's stuff missing and that's what
this<00:01:48.880> game<00:01:49.090> feels<00:01:49.300> like<00:01:49.540> this<00:01:49.900> game<00:01:50.110> feels

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
this game feels like this game feels

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.700 
this game feels like this game feels
huge<00:01:50.980> when<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.790> first<00:01:52.090> play<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.570> it's<00:01:52.780> almost

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
huge when you first play it it's almost

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.000 
huge when you first play it it's almost
on<00:01:53.980> inspiring<00:01:54.490> but<00:01:54.700> after<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> while<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.860> get

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
on inspiring but after a while you get

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.990 
on inspiring but after a while you get
this<00:01:57.220> sensation<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.440> something's<00:01:59.440> missing

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
this sensation that something's missing

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.070 
this sensation that something's missing
like<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.120> must<00:02:01.360> have<00:02:01.510> overlooked<00:02:01.960> something

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
like you must have overlooked something

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.250 
like you must have overlooked something
because<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:03.520> can't<00:02:03.910> be<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.300> entire<00:02:04.840> game

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
because this can't be the entire game

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.190 
because this can't be the entire game
not<00:02:06.220> really<00:02:06.730> disappointing<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.690> you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
not really disappointing is just you

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.080 
not really disappointing is just you
know<00:02:08.260> something<00:02:08.650> weird<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.850> third

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
know something weird and the third

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.300 
know something weird and the third
problem<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.600> have<00:02:10.780> with<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.050> game<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.950> mean

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
problem I have with this game and I mean

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.720
