Trek<00:00:08.880> Enterprise<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.809> few<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.170> pointed

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
Trek Enterprise and a few you pointed

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.839 
Trek Enterprise and a few you pointed
out<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.950> TIE<00:00:11.190> fighter<00:00:11.490> would<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:11.759> been

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
out that the TIE fighter would have been

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.150 
out that the TIE fighter would have been
a<00:00:11.880> more<00:00:12.059> obvious<00:00:12.150> choice<00:00:12.630> since<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> tie-in

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
a more obvious choice since the tie-in

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.290 
a more obvious choice since the tie-in
TIE<00:00:14.519> fighter<00:00:14.820> stands<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.599> twin<00:00:15.839> ion<00:00:16.379> engines

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
TIE fighter stands for twin ion engines

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.630 
TIE fighter stands for twin ion engines
so<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.930> action<00:00:19.160> you<00:00:20.160> can<00:00:20.310> see<00:00:20.490> that

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
so here it is in action you can see that

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.189 
so here it is in action you can see that
the<00:00:20.760> bluish<00:00:21.060> Colonna<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.050> looks

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the bluish Colonna for this one looks

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.210 
the bluish Colonna for this one looks
very<00:00:22.320> cool<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.170> make<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.350> more<00:00:25.470> exciting<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
very cool and to make it more exciting I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.290 
very cool and to make it more exciting I
added<00:00:26.730> an<00:00:26.849> actual<00:00:27.240> laser<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:29.060> here's<00:00:30.060> how<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
added an actual laser to here's how I

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.170 
added an actual laser to here's how I
added<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> ion<00:00:31.050> propulsion<00:00:31.550> the<00:00:32.550> TIE<00:00:32.880> fighter

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
where I showed how to add ion propulsion
to<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.729> did<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.149> bit<00:01:48.299> differently<00:01:48.750> this

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
to it I did it a bit differently this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
to it I did it a bit differently this
way<00:01:49.560> works<00:01:49.799> better<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.610> simply<00:01:50.939> made<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> loop

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
way works better and simply made a loop

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330 
way works better and simply made a loop
of<00:01:51.540> thin<00:01:51.810> bare<00:01:52.049> wire<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.100> sharp

of thin bare wire here for the sharp

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
of thin bare wire here for the sharp
edge<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.850> wrap<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.840> aluminum<00:01:55.170> foil<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.590> a
