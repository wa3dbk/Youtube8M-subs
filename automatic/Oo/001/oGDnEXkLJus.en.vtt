we<00:00:32.009> also<00:00:32.690> made<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> contact<00:00:34.230> through<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:34.770> old

we also made a contact through my old

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
agency with NASA and NASA at that time

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.920 
agency with NASA and NASA at that time
was<00:00:40.230> very<00:00:40.410> interested<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.300> using<00:00:42.300> robots<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
was very interested in using robots to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.369 
was very interested in using robots to
construct<00:00:43.469> space<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> initial<00:00:45.690> ideas

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
construct space and the initial ideas

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.740 
construct space and the initial ideas
for<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> space<00:00:46.890> station<00:00:47.480> there<00:00:48.480> were<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> lot

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
for the space station there were a lot

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
for the space station there were a lot
of<00:00:48.780> different<00:00:49.140> ones<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.350> robotic

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of different ones but robotic

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.680 
of different ones but robotic
construction<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:50.850> very<00:00:51.030> much<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> part<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
construction was very much a part of it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.660 
construction was very much a part of it
so<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.110> worked<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.680> NASA<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:54.440> conceptualize

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
so we worked with NASA to conceptualize

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.740 
so we worked with NASA to conceptualize
construction<00:00:56.670> processes<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.270> robots<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
construction processes with robots and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.510 
construction processes with robots and
to<00:00:57.809> help<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.109> set<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.350> test<00:00:59.100> beds<00:00:59.340> with

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to help them set up test beds with

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
to help them set up test beds with
industrial<00:00:59.969> robots<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.930> test<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
industrial robots to test out some of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.170 
industrial robots to test out some of
these<00:01:01.800> ideas<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:03.530> somewhere<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.189> period

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
these ideas and somewhere in that period

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.850 
these ideas and somewhere in that period
that<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.659> won't<00:01:06.780> say<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.110> because<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.560> NASA

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that I won't say it was because of NASA

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.060 
that I won't say it was because of NASA
that<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.280> seemed<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> kind<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.560> arrive<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that it seemed to kind of arrive in a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.310 
that it seemed to kind of arrive in a
parallel<00:01:11.580> fashion<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.630> exposed<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.140> what

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
parallel fashion I was exposed to what

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.350 
parallel fashion I was exposed to what
NASA<00:01:13.590> calls<00:01:13.890> deployable<00:01:14.250> structures

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
NASA calls deployable structures

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.219 
NASA calls deployable structures
so<00:01:16.200> rather<00:01:16.890> than<00:01:17.869> constructing<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> structure

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so rather than constructing a structure

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.749 
so rather than constructing a structure
in<00:01:19.320> space<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.710> would<00:01:19.799> unfold<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.310> structure<00:01:20.640> in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
in space you would unfold a structure in

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.499 
in space you would unfold a structure in
space<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.710> really<00:01:22.710> triggered<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.729> kind

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
space and that really triggered the kind

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.109 
space and that really triggered the kind
of<00:01:24.710> initial<00:01:26.840> thinking<00:01:27.840> about<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:30.030> know

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
of initial thinking about you know

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.350 
of initial thinking about you know
what's<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.640> how<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.079> consider

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
what's the how do you consider

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.390 
what's the how do you consider
deployable<00:01:36.560> transformable<00:01:38.180> pop-up<00:01:40.400> objects

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
deployable transformable pop-up objects

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.270 
deployable transformable pop-up objects
that<00:01:41.549> change<00:01:42.030> themselves<00:01:42.299> by<00:01:42.810> themselves<00:01:43.560> how

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that change themselves by themselves how

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
that change themselves by themselves how
do<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.460> even<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.759> about<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.750> know

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
do you even think about that you know

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.010 
do you even think about that you know
how<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.290> think<00:01:46.409> about<00:01:46.530> that

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
how do you think about that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.380 
how do you think about that
my<00:01:49.189> focus<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.229> know<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:53.030> how<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> would

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
my focus I was you know with how I would

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.179 
my focus I was you know with how I would
interact<00:01:54.720> with<00:01:55.079> all<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.829> these<00:01:55.920> influences

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
interact with all of these influences

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.889 
interact with all of these influences
and<00:01:56.670> different<00:01:56.909> tools<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.509> very<00:01:57.689> utilitarian

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and different tools was very utilitarian

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.050 
and different tools was very utilitarian
in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> sense<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.200> was<00:02:02.060> had

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
in the sense that you know if I was had

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.819 
in the sense that you know if I was had
a<00:02:03.090> project<00:02:03.360> where<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.469> wanted<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
a project where you know I wanted to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.690 
a project where you know I wanted to
make<00:02:04.950> an<00:02:05.100> expanding<00:02:05.549> sphere<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:06.149> 59

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
make an expanding sphere of 59

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.969 
make an expanding sphere of 59
individual<00:02:07.240> machine<00:02:07.689> pieces<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.679> had<00:02:08.830> to

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
individual machine pieces and it had to

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.610 
individual machine pieces and it had to
be<00:02:09.129> suspended<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:10.000> open<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.629> close<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.200> you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
be suspended and open and close and you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.080 
be suspended and open and close and you
know<00:02:11.879> which<00:02:12.879> had<00:02:13.660> not<00:02:13.810> been<00:02:13.870> done<00:02:14.080> before<00:02:14.260> I

know which had not been done before I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.210
