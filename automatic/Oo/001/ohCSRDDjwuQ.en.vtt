00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.010 
expecting to get a shift car based off a
steamroller<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.510> pretty<00:01:00.690> cool<00:01:00.960> it's

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

like I said he rolls well as little logo
is<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> 10<00:01:27.960> ton<00:01:28.229> weight<00:01:31.670> right<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.390> is

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
is a 10 ton weight right in there and is

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.399 
is a 10 ton weight right in there and is
DX<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> nice<00:01:34.740> shiny<00:01:35.159> sticker<00:01:35.579> and

pretty cool so I assume the front of the
cars<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.479> steamroll<00:01:40.020> hey<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:41.100> figure<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
cars to steamroll hey just figure that

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.899 
cars to steamroll hey just figure that

but it's a nice little bronze color and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.880 
but it's a nice little bronze color and
it<00:01:45.479> does<00:01:45.720> definitely<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> more

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it does definitely one of the more

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.120 
it does definitely one of the more
unique<00:01:47.100> shift<00:01:47.610> cars<00:01:47.990> next<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.380> fire<00:01:49.680> braver
