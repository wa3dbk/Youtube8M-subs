00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.090
 pomegranate 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.090
 showing the right time to open the photos 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.619
 in the same way you are perfectly 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.509
 we asked to open her photos 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.810
 directed direct to the album of 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.220
 images with all images available 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.350
 here on the device now let's try a 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.349
 search a little more elaborate let's go 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.150
 see if she can synchronize one or 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.390
 two different elements look at the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.160
 twitter about corinthians 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.860
 O 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.280
 looking on twitter i found some 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.350
 tweets it's automatically here the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.410
 latest tweets she met the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.190
 tag or that mentions the word 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:41.069
 corinthians search for pizza near me 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.709
 O looking for the same way he lists which 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.410
 are the pizzerias here in the vicinity is in a 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.440
 radius of up to one kilometer seen all 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:55.680
 pizza options that we have here in 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:58.500
 region is going to be hot today. 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.160
 maximum temperature can reach 27 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.299
 degrees celsius too hot for me there 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.670
 people see it automatically 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.170
 understand the context that I would be 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.880
 interested in knowing what the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.220
 temperature and adds a 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.640
 Just a joke there in the end too hot for 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.959
 me 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.239
 one of the questions that the staff 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.640
 When do you pick up a personal assistant? 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.910
 kind of waking up for example let's 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.989
 see what she tells us to tell 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.780
 a joke I think you would not understand 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.690
 if I count the falls on my tongue and 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.150
 they are not so funny other than 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.370
 other personal voice assistant 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.859
 who can find a way from another 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.609
 Syria, more serious, let us say in this 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.170
 Score 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.780
 so that's what they were the first 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.730
 impressions of the silva in Portuguese 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.970
