off as it's shaking and the second one
is<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.259> inch<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.190> half<00:01:46.220> screen<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.630> will

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
is a inch and a half screen that will

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.200 
is a inch and a half screen that will
not<00:01:48.200> allow<00:01:48.500> any<00:01:48.799> rocks<00:01:49.220> below<00:01:49.549> an<00:01:49.850> inch<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.149> a

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
half to fall down through so we can

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.770 
half to fall down through so we can
create<00:01:53.420> our<00:01:53.690> screen<00:01:54.170> topsoil
