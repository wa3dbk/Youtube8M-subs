00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.990
 without even being a car mechanic every 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.070
 motorist can quite independently 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.160
 service 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.280
 Your car is a TV project checked 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.800
 currently focus on replacement 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.050
 oils try to make it your own 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.760
 hands have to say experience in this 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.769
 sense i have zero of course all this 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.809
 the procedure can be done on the street but I 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.629
 still decided to call the service on 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.879
 lift in principle every car enthusiast 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.739
 and can safely take any 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.869
 free flyover but we are for convenience 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:09.090
 decided to apply professional 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:09.090
 lift so it will be somewhat easier 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.310
 so that I do not confuse anything valuable 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.840
 advice helps me perm race car driver 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.539
 and the head of the motorsport federation 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.030
 Kama region Andrei Romanchenko to start 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.280
 will have to unlock engine protection this 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.259
 four bolts 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.350
 so we that we have one part from the car 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.679
 smith we have no protection now we are quite 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.670
 can get to 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.289
 oil filter but it is a little later 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.319
 first carter remove the protection we got 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.360
 to crankcase hunt hot tepid 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.780
 oil is hot there too 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.439
 small cork so that it gets cold 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.140
 because you need to be well we can 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.890
 wait for 10 15 minutes you need to wait 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.509
 if there is no experience, then probably cloning. 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.929
 but the more she probably will not so pour 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.610
 somehow a little angle also desire 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.549
 get burned I don't therefore decided 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.680
 wait for a while to find the capacity 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.730
 mastering masterpiece 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.829
 Domestic industry galvanized pelvis 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.190
 any tass plastic any 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:27.280
 tank where are you ready to drain the dirty 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:29.769
 oil first unscrew the crankcase plug 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.780
 the key to the word is the second key on 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:38.620
 today and then remove the cork with your hands 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:43.600
 that's all happened all my life 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:48.670
 black dirty oil now 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.480
 it remains to wait until the entire contents 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.730
 crankcase will merge will continue to shoot 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.250
 oil filter for this will need 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.220
 one more tool this one if you want 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.410
 grab specifically for filters here it 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.769
 same tool first then 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.769
 by hands 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.740
 all deletion and filter like this 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.790
 it looks like a blend display 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.950
 then wrap the cork back 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.950
 old oil in the crankcase 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.340
 the turn of the new is now the time of the new 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.690
 spare parts 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:35.570
 oil filter 1 piece 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:39.920
 but even protection is now important to take 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.920
 oil of some brand 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.620
 you now need to fill it up right 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.550
 spinning the filter we put in place the protection 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.110
 and you can lower the car one more 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.630
 tool that we have 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.230
 funnel actually canister themselves 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.190
 oil professionals advice before 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.450
 you will pour read a book where 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.930
 specified how much oil is needed 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.640
 pour into the engine because if you 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.669
 you can pour a lot in some way 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.459
 will merge the extra and this repetition 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.680
 the procedure is almost done left 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.370
 check the oil level then the car 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.590
 to bring 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.110
 drown out wait a couple of minutes and 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.940
 check the oil level after 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.690
 the car stood for a while again 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.710
 check the oil level according to the old scheme 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:41.290
 probe wipe 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:45.270
 until the end of the level the most something let us down 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:49.540
 total we spent about 40 minutes 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.180
 of course without a proper tool and without 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.390
 expert advice firstly I would 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.630
 it was done wrong in the second 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.980
 would be done longer in the third 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.700
 soiled with flowers soiled 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.920
 hands but we saved 500 rubles a 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.460
 that is the average cost per perm 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.730
 procedure for changing the oil in the service station 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.730
 think for yourself
