there's herbicides on the ground those
plants<00:03:43.660> are<00:03:43.780> sucking<00:03:44.200> some<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.680> into

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
plants are sucking some of that into

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.129 
plants are sucking some of that into
them<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:46.030> does<00:03:46.329> come<00:03:46.480> through<00:03:46.780> into<00:03:46.959> the

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
them and that does come through into the

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.159 
them and that does come through into the
wine<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.739> we<00:03:48.459> do<00:03:48.730> know<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.090> food<00:03:49.510> affects

wine and we do know that food affects
people<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:50.889> mean<00:03:51.040> think<00:03:51.819> about<00:03:52.060> how<00:03:52.239> many

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329
