00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
in the heart actually sends more

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.940 
in the heart actually sends more
information<00:02:31.569> upstairs<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.470> brain<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.860> our

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
information upstairs to the brain in our

training<00:02:39.730> portion<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.930> second<00:02:41.380> T<00:02:41.650> if<00:02:41.860> you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
training portion the second T if you

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.490 
training portion the second T if you
will<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.430> technology<00:02:42.630> practice<00:02:43.630> use<00:02:43.930> apply

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
will the technology practice use apply

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.430 
will the technology practice use apply
and<00:02:45.030> experience<00:02:46.030> something<00:02:46.330> different<00:02:46.540> work

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
and experience something different work

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.210 
and experience something different work
ok<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:49.269> second<00:02:49.720> part<00:02:49.989> of<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.980> got<00:02:51.130> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
ok the second part of it is you got to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.070 
ok the second part of it is you got to
use<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.519> stuff<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.060> got<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.390> apply<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.810> on<00:02:53.019> a

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
so I go up and just fly the patterns and

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.059 
so I go up and just fly the patterns and
I<00:03:20.079> come<00:03:20.290> back<00:03:20.409> around<00:03:21.689> over<00:03:22.689> the<00:03:22.780> flaps<00:03:23.079> going

I come back around over the flaps going
down<00:03:24.250> toward<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.849> runway<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.530> doesn't

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
down toward the runway and this doesn't

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.399 
down toward the runway and this doesn't
feel<00:03:27.010> right<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.819> go<00:03:28.060> around<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.569> go<00:03:29.200> down

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.470 
the second time just doesn't feel right
again<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.219> I<00:03:33.250> go<00:03:33.489> around<00:03:33.639> again<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.299> know<00:03:34.450> I

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
again so I go around again you know I

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.000 
again so I go around again you know I
noticed<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:34.989> after<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.319> second<00:03:35.680> go<00:03:35.769> around

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
noticed that after the second go around

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.770 
noticed that after the second go around
the<00:03:36.159> implant<00:03:36.639> my<00:03:36.790> breathing<00:03:37.180> had<00:03:37.299> gotten<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
the implant my breathing had gotten a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.140 
the implant my breathing had gotten a
little<00:03:38.079> bit<00:03:38.169> quicker<00:03:38.549> Thompson<00:03:39.549> it's<00:03:39.849> really

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
little bit quicker Thompson it's really

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.229 
little bit quicker Thompson it's really
anxious<00:03:44.400> telling<00:03:45.400> myself<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.909> can<00:03:46.090> do

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
anxious telling myself that I can do

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:46.670

this

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
this

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.280 
this
so<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:48.269> put<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.359> plane<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.689> the<00:03:49.719> ground<00:03:49.810> and

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
so I put the plane on the ground and

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.349 
so I put the plane on the ground and
walked<00:03:50.500> away

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
walked away

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.330 
walked away
if<00:03:52.359> they<00:03:52.599> expect<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:53.169> silver<00:03:53.739> bullet<00:03:54.010> if<00:03:54.250> they

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
if they expect a silver bullet if they

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.649 
if they expect a silver bullet if they
think<00:03:54.400> sitting<00:03:54.849> down<00:03:55.000> with<00:03:55.090> an<00:03:55.209> my<00:03:55.419> it's<00:03:55.540> gonna

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
think sitting down with an my it's gonna

think sitting down with an my it's gonna
change<00:03:55.750> your<00:03:56.079> PTSD<00:03:56.409> they<00:03:56.739> don't<00:03:56.889> understand

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
change your PTSD they don't understand

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.979

what<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.030> saw<00:04:25.240> hard<00:04:25.479> math<00:04:25.659> doing<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.169> heart<00:04:26.560> math

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
what I saw hard math doing is heart math

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.279 
what I saw hard math doing is heart math
was<00:04:26.949> giving<00:04:27.310> me<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.699> venue<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.360> allowed<00:04:28.960> me<00:04:29.260> to
