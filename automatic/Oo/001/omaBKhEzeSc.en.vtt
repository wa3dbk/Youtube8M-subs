00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.830
 how are we evolving as a society generationally how have the 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.679
 things in the last 30 years 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.879
 I think that you can not count on are the achievements that we lack good I think that 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.680
 we have come a long way to start we are here the ones presented and this is 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.010
 a very important thing and a past that does is congratulate 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.140
 the 13 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.660
 is another 45 years old but I have news of women 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.399
 that now I would have 70 80 years that were absolutely so unpopular within 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.070
 certain groups the issue with lesbians is that I was in the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.670
 private sphere for example in the mass well in pieces in their houses and you're in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.290
 the beach and pool 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.600
 and more and more to a nightclub in downtown Lima 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.220
 made much more permeable among social classes everything is a 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.540
 university professor like china 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.130
 st because they are going 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.220
 to the public space and sti his way of courting cc but among other things 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.600
 has advanced a lot now we have nightclub of chinitas cafes for girls 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.200
 espases on the internet there is one believes that we see it sexual that leads 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.570
 necessarily to something 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.880
 the hidden promiscuous 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.860
 efe anyway aba then the story she but between my compound 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.030
 this happened but not chronic because being gay is not because of promiscuity 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.560
 there are all groups we all understand a part of this type 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.760
 of the season espinoza 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.020
 we always do nothing more murderous I have 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.359
 girlfriend after girlfriend but I do not have at once because it comes back to life is inviolable 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.690
 that the old 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.210
 but today I do not think 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.340
 people having arrived as laden reaches the time when they will not return 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.960
 a woman and a man called a girl is more than enough but believe 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.180
 that it's easier for us to accept a lesbian as sexual 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.240
 unfortunately are not real there we have 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.950
 on the subject makes it very domestic the matter we have advantage by 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.700
 about men who are always usually can stay to sleep in 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.980
 the family home has given Saturday 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.640
 but the advancement of the circus, despite that, is not a problem. 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.190
 it affects socially speaking here to see me in hand with sebastián and sebastián 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.649
 hand in hand with Carmen the three of them walking down the street 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:16.459

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.729
 hand in hand with a doctor with a creature not the night until in such a 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:26.709
 time between agrees or not we have advantage but it depends on the place because we are 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.589

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:35.729

 They wait to die to see if you learn the same with the girls they send them 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:02:59.609
 art 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.969
 that's why the session was going 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.599
 the previous thing to the schism things that are important that it appears at this point 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.749
 of the world 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:10.959
 in radial as quality and of a whole sexual that will intervene is important 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.789
 to create the identity and for people to understand 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.089

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.169

 only shadows and people like you showed and yes no 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.510
 I do not understand is that there is no 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.499
 but you have to talk it so you know for yourself 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.679
 there are a lot of people who keep thinking like that and we left the program thank you very much
