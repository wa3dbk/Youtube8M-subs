judit lives in a different surrounding

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.760 
judit lives in a different surrounding
than<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.380> two<00:00:19.560> different

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
than I do so we have two different

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.529 
than I do so we have two different
setups<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.820> both<00:00:21.029> share<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.390> same

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
setups but we both share the same

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.990 
setups but we both share the same
passion<00:00:22.350> for<00:00:22.529> greens<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:22.949> plants<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
passion for greens for plants so the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
passion for greens for plants so the
initial<00:00:24.210> idea<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.660> basically<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.320> show<00:00:25.500> how

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
initial idea was basically to show how

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
initial idea was basically to show how
she<00:00:25.769> interprets<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.029> theme<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.539> how<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
she interprets the theme and how I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900 
she interprets the theme and how I
interpret<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> theme<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.490> two<00:00:29.730> different

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
interpret the theme in two different

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.550 
interpret the theme in two different
citizens<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.689> both<00:00:30.840> located<00:00:31.080> in
