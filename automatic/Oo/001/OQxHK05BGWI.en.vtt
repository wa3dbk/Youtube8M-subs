that looks like they've got a little

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.300 
that looks like they've got a little
example<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.200> I'll<00:01:10.650> show<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.890> where<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.100> goes

example here I'll show you where it goes

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
example here I'll show you where it goes
and<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.240> head<00:01:12.510> section<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> site

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
and see this head section in the site

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
and see this head section in the site
and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.240> other<00:01:15.390> way<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.659> through<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> file

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and then the other way is through a file

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.719 
and then the other way is through a file
now<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.509> FTP<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.610> know

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
now if you if you know FTP and you know

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
now if you if you know FTP and you know
how<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.080> probably

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
how to do that then this is probably

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.810 
how to do that then this is probably
this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> way<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.310> usually<00:01:23.490> will

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this is the way I do it I usually will

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.340 
this is the way I do it I usually will
just<00:01:23.850> upload<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.600> file<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> root

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
just upload this file to the root

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
just upload this file to the root
directory<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.100> site<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:27.030> I'll<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.299> back

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
directory of my site then I'll go back

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.230 
directory of my site then I'll go back
to<00:01:28.189> webmaster<00:01:29.189> central<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.729> verify<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to webmaster central and verify it and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
to webmaster central and verify it and
everything<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> good<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.380> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.590> don't<00:01:31.979> have

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
everything is good but if you don't have

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
everything is good but if you don't have
FTP<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.240> don't<00:01:33.420> know<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
FTP or you don't know what that is and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.960 
FTP or you don't know what that is and
you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.409> always<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.070> meta<00:01:35.340> tag<00:01:35.430> version

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
