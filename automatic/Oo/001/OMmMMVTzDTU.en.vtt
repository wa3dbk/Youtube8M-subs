00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
case I usually like to just install the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.800 
case I usually like to just install the
case<00:03:02.239> like<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.669> and<00:03:04.669> then<00:03:05.000> sliding<00:03:05.419> on<00:03:05.689> the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.920

and then I just slide on the phone like
so<00:03:15.290> one<00:03:16.040> side<00:03:16.430> first<00:03:16.849> and<00:03:20.109> then<00:03:21.109> just<00:03:21.590> check

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
so one side first and then just check

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.719 
so one side first and then just check
around<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.579> see<00:03:22.669> if<00:03:22.849> everything<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:24.459> good<00:03:25.459> as

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
around and see if everything is good as

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.860 
around and see if everything is good as
you<00:03:26.510> can<00:03:26.629> see<00:03:26.900> there<00:03:27.169> is<00:03:27.409> a<00:03:27.799> slight<00:03:28.310> lip<00:03:28.940> for

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
you can see there is a slight lip for

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.189 
you can see there is a slight lip for
the<00:03:30.019> lay<00:03:30.319> on<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.560> table<00:03:30.590> design<00:03:31.400> it's<00:03:32.299> not<00:03:32.479> so

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
the lay on the table design it's not so

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.920 
the lay on the table design it's not so
big<00:03:33.470> but<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:34.760> keep<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.090> mind<00:03:35.299> since<00:03:35.479> it's<00:03:35.720> not

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
big but do keep in mind since it's not

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.640 
big but do keep in mind since it's not
that<00:03:36.260> big<00:03:37.239> certain<00:03:38.239> amount<00:03:38.599> of<00:03:38.690> drops<00:03:38.989> are

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
that big certain amount of drops are

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.770 
that big certain amount of drops are
depending<00:03:40.129> on<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.400> angle<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.239> drop<00:03:41.479> it

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
depending on the angle of the drop it

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.860 
depending on the angle of the drop it
can<00:03:42.109> crack<00:03:42.409> your<00:03:42.560> screen<00:03:42.859> or<00:03:43.449> scratch<00:03:44.449> it<00:03:44.690> at

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
can crack your screen or scratch it at

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.240 
can crack your screen or scratch it at
the<00:03:45.169> minimum<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.250> recommend<00:03:46.609> having<00:03:47.030> a

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
the minimum so I recommend having a

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.920 
the minimum so I recommend having a
screen<00:03:49.250> protector<00:03:49.370> or<00:03:49.909> a<00:03:50.209> tempered<00:03:50.900> glass

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
screen protector or a tempered glass

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.949 
screen protector or a tempered glass
screen<00:03:51.139> protector<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:53.060> let's<00:03:53.239> take<00:03:53.449> a<00:03:53.510> look<00:03:53.780> at

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
screen protector so let's take a look at

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.990 
screen protector so let's take a look at
the<00:03:54.549> device<00:03:55.549> itself<00:03:55.849> with<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.569> case<00:03:56.900> on<00:03:58.000> let

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000
