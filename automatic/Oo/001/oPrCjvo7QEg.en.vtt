00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
validated the lot of guys went down to

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.560 
validated the lot of guys went down to
plate<00:00:53.039> spec<00:00:53.430> ops<00:00:53.670> which<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.090> probably<00:00:54.329> like

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
plate spec ops which is probably like

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.590 
plate spec ops which is probably like
the<00:00:55.020> next<00:00:55.289> closest<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.480> multiplayer<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the next closest thing to multiplayer a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.810 
the next closest thing to multiplayer a
lot<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> guys<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.140> machinima<00:00:58.500> had<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> chance

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

lot of guys from machinima had a chance
to<00:01:00.210> literally<00:01:01.160> play<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.960> spec<00:01:04.199> ops<00:01:04.470> edition

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to literally play the spec ops edition

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.740 
to literally play the spec ops edition
which<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.489> pretty<00:01:05.610> pretty<00:01:06.119> close<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.630> not

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
which is pretty pretty close but not

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.980

him<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.590> was<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.740> map<00:02:21.040> pack<00:02:21.310> from<00:02:21.520> modern

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
him it was a map pack from modern

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.510 
him it was a map pack from modern
warfare<00:02:22.000> 2<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:23.290> he<00:02:23.620> would<00:02:23.770> believe<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.310> that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
warfare 2 that he would believe you that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.460 
warfare 2 that he would believe you that
it<00:02:24.670> was<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.110> majority<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.950> weapons

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it was but the majority of the weapons

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.950 
it was but the majority of the weapons
shoot<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.610> call<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.120> duty<00:02:31.360> for<00:02:31.570> weapons

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
shoot like a call of duty for weapons

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960 
shoot like a call of duty for weapons
now<00:02:32.590> i<00:02:32.620> don't<00:02:32.800> know<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.190> translates

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
now i don't know if that translates

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.810 
now i don't know if that translates
because<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.380> know<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:35.620> i<00:02:35.740> said<00:02:35.770> specs<00:02:36.610> off

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
because you know like i said specs off

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.110 
because you know like i said specs off
although<00:02:37.420> spec<00:02:37.780> ops<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.550> close<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.970> a

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
although spec ops is close to a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.760 
although spec ops is close to a
multiplayer<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.300> not<00:02:43.510> exact<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.170> he<00:02:44.590> did

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
multiplayer it's not exact and he did

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.699 
multiplayer it's not exact and he did
ask<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.160> question<00:02:45.690> from<00:02:46.690> robert<00:02:47.140> bolin<00:02:47.530> as

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
ask this question from robert bolin as

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.090 
ask this question from robert bolin as
to<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.820> effect<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.600> know<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.100> ak-47

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
to the effect that you know the ak-47

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.000 
to the effect that you know the ak-47
really<00:02:51.820> kicks<00:02:52.120> high<00:02:52.390> into<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.780> right<00:02:53.140> now<00:02:53.770> is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
really kicks high into the right now is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.449 
really kicks high into the right now is
that<00:02:54.220> going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.880> translate<00:02:55.330> over<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:56.590> do

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
that going to translate over to do

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.160 
that going to translate over to do
multiplayer<00:02:58.350> we<00:02:59.350> don't<00:02:59.500> know<00:02:59.740> but<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.870> kind

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
multiplayer we don't know but it's kind

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.230 
multiplayer we don't know but it's kind
of<00:03:02.230> crazy<00:03:02.380> because<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.040> sounds<00:03:03.340> like<00:03:03.459> it

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
of crazy because like it sounds like it

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.790 
of crazy because like it sounds like it
sounds<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:04.660> you<00:03:04.900> know<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.380> using<00:03:05.709> the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
sounds like you know the using the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.340 
sounds like you know the using the
engine<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.490> little<00:03:06.580> bit<00:03:07.420> more<00:03:07.660> updated<00:03:08.110> and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
engine a little bit more updated and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.920 
engine a little bit more updated and
optimized<00:03:08.890> for<00:03:09.310> modern<00:03:09.730> warfare<00:03:09.910> 3<00:03:10.090> but

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
optimized for modern warfare 3 but

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.720 
optimized for modern warfare 3 but
they're<00:03:11.080> using<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.530> lot<00:03:11.739> of<00:03:11.769> recoil<00:03:12.180> from<00:03:13.180> a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
they're using a lot of recoil from a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.750 
they're using a lot of recoil from a
call<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.910> duty<00:03:15.940> 4<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.320> your<00:03:17.610> ak-47<00:03:18.610> will

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
call of duty 4 so like your ak-47 will

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.940 
call of duty 4 so like your ak-47 will
have<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.060> unique<00:03:19.330> signature<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.410> you

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
have this unique signature to it you

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.880 
have this unique signature to it you
know<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.130> have<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:22.209> just<00:03:23.200> can't<00:03:23.470> pick<00:03:23.739> up

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
know you have to like just can't pick up

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.380 
know you have to like just can't pick up
and<00:03:24.040> play<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.820> lot<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.000> people<00:03:25.269> get

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
and play it and a lot of people get

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.060 
and play it and a lot of people get
turned<00:03:25.600> off<00:03:25.810> by<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.050> but<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.650> have<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.860> take

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
turned off by it but you have to take

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.610 
turned off by it but you have to take
the<00:03:27.190> time<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:28.060> learn<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.269> kick<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.320> call

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
the time to learn the kick like a call

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.680 
the time to learn the kick like a call
do<00:03:29.800> before<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.220> had<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.519> beautiful<00:03:30.760> kick<00:03:31.239> and

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
do before it had that beautiful kick and

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.330 
do before it had that beautiful kick and
you<00:03:31.810> had<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.050> learn<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.260> kick<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.190> then

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
you had to learn the kick to it and then

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.250 
you had to learn the kick to it and then
that's<00:03:33.550> like<00:03:33.790> only<00:03:34.269> certain<00:03:34.480> few<00:03:34.840> people<00:03:35.140> can

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
that's like only certain few people can

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.440 
that's like only certain few people can
use<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.650> or<00:03:35.830> would<00:03:36.459> take<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> time<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:37.150> use<00:03:37.269> it

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
use it or would take the time to use it

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.810 
use it or would take the time to use it
and<00:03:37.600> when<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.920> lives<00:03:39.130> in<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.280> hut<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.580> said

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
and when I lives in the hut you said

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.140 
and when I lives in the hut you said
that<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:41.230> know<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.440> m16<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.400> call<00:03:42.700> duty<00:03:42.880> for

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
that you know the m16 and call duty for

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.070 
that you know the m16 and call duty for
was<00:03:43.269> like<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.420> laser<00:03:43.860> well<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:45.010> know<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.370> mean<00:03:46.209> so

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
was like a laser well you know I mean so

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.870 
was like a laser well you know I mean so
exam<00:03:47.320> for<00:03:47.620> what<00:03:47.860> they<00:03:47.980> did<00:03:48.459> in<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.670> beta

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
exam for what they did in the beta

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.250 
exam for what they did in the beta
because<00:03:49.180> nobody<00:03:49.420> else<00:03:49.540> tested<00:03:49.930> any<00:03:50.080> other

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
because nobody else tested any other

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.990 
because nobody else tested any other
weapons<00:03:50.650> like<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.190> supposed<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.549> innovative

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
weapons like you supposed to innovative

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.650 
weapons like you supposed to innovative
but<00:03:52.860> if<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.700> know<00:03:54.730> they<00:03:55.269> said<00:03:55.540> that

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
but if that is you know they said that

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.300 
but if that is you know they said that
they<00:03:55.780> change<00:03:56.049> spread<00:03:56.470> pattern<00:03:56.709> where<00:03:57.160> it's<00:03:57.280> a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
they change spread pattern where it's a

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.160 
they change spread pattern where it's a
little<00:03:57.489> bit<00:03:57.610> wider<00:03:57.810> which<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.959> know<00:03:58.989> it's

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
little bit wider which you know it's

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.990 
little bit wider which you know it's
fine<00:03:59.290> by<00:03:59.500> me<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.920> mean<00:04:00.250> if<00:04:00.400> it's<00:04:00.580> still<00:04:00.850> as

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
fine by me I mean if it's still as

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.539 
fine by me I mean if it's still as
strong<00:04:01.180> as<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.780> m16<00:04:02.350> that<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:02.980> every<00:04:03.340> other

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
strong as the m16 that in every other

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.210 
strong as the m16 that in every other
game<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:04.120> mean<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:04.900> would<00:04:05.110> expect<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:06.100> know

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
game I mean I would expect that you know

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.220 
game I mean I would expect that you know
at<00:04:06.370> least<00:04:06.400> one<00:04:07.060> or<00:04:07.360> two<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.900> bullets<00:04:08.019> hit

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
at least one or two of the bullets hit

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.780 
at least one or two of the bullets hit
you<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.650> then<00:04:08.709> maybe<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.160> third<00:04:09.340> one<00:04:09.489> strays

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
you and then maybe the third one strays

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.390 
you and then maybe the third one strays
off<00:04:10.030> which<00:04:10.660> is<00:04:10.780> good<00:04:10.959> I'm<00:04:11.200> least<00:04:11.769> happy<00:04:12.040> the
