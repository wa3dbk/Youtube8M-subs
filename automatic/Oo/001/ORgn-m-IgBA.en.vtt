00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.390
 an air that is a set of dunes 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.610
 and normally it is called asia 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.040
 an area just like a mountainous area of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.670
 mountains or a sierra then summers that 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.700
 It is a set of dunes time control 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.220
 normally there usually is not before the 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.130
 special when we left the bivouac at 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.410
 end of the special and there are some in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 those that we have to enter in the minute 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.460
 exact and there are others where we can 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.210
 they are usually when it's the end of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.470
 day we can enter before schedule 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.800
 marathon stage is a stage where the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.719
 final of the timed special of the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.170
 special of the day you will not have 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.260
 assistance of your team of your mechanics 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.600
 then it is a stage where you have 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.320
 what to serve for yourself or with the help 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.570
 of another pilot or with your things with your 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.570
 closed park material is 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.990
 a park where motorcycles are closed 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.030
 and you can not do anything to them in the rally 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.270
 it is not used as much because it continues when 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.330
 the motorcycles arrive at the end of the stage 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.460
 they are with the mechanics and everything is used 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.890
 more at the end of the rally the last day is 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.710
 where you have to leave your motorcycles 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.930
 hours planned as a precaution or in case 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.910
 they need or believe it convenient that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.570
 they have to do a revision to the motorcycle 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.230
 mus is a system that we carry in the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.370
 wheels that does not carry air 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.590
 it's like a spongy rubber that makes 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.570
 we saw the function of the camera but it is 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.810
 more leads us to go then does not click 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.970
 We usually work a lot in museums 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.820
 about all the marathon days where it 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.220
 they accumulate many miles and 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.740
 can have to arrive can reach 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.980
 have degradation problems but that 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.940
 is what they do every day after 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.400
 just before dinner where they explain 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.200
 and all the details of the special 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.630
 next day the kilometers things 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.450
 the changes the modifications that have 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.209
 been 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.400
 and good in general rule this is the end 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.140
 that we always go unless there is something 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.940
 weird some claim or something and we have 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.940
 to go to a private briefing
