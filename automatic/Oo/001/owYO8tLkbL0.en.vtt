is<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:55.540> possible<00:00:56.050> that<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.590> sleepers<00:00:57.190> have

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
is it possible that the sleepers have

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.119 
is it possible that the sleepers have
found<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:58.000> way<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.149> break<00:00:58.750> away<00:00:59.290> from<00:00:59.530> the

found a way to break away from the

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.950 
found a way to break away from the
construct<00:01:00.790> there's<00:01:01.180> no<00:01:01.300> telling<00:01:01.719> what<00:01:01.809> they

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
construct there's no telling what they

might do at a self-defense
see<00:01:05.230> the<00:01:05.350> sleepers<00:01:05.770> are<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.100> ones<00:01:06.280> needing

see the sleepers are the ones needing

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.790 
see the sleepers are the ones needing
the<00:01:06.910> body<00:01:07.510> parts<00:01:07.900> so<00:01:08.140> they<00:01:08.350> can<00:01:08.530> reconstruct

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
the body parts so they can reconstruct

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.490 
the body parts so they can reconstruct
bodies<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:10.540> their<00:01:10.720> actual<00:01:11.050> bodies<00:01:11.320> have
