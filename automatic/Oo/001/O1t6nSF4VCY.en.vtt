the same time people concern about
quantitative<00:01:07.740> easing<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.180> really

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
quantitative easing so it's really

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.230 
quantitative easing so it's really
important<00:01:10.110> investors<00:01:10.560> identify<00:01:11.220> both<00:01:11.880> sets

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
important investors identify both sets
