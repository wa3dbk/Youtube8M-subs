take less damage when your substitute is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.480 
take less damage when your substitute is
broken<00:01:37.729> because<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.450> can<00:01:38.570> only<00:01:38.659> be<00:01:39.289> taking<00:01:40.189> 25

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
broken because it can only be taking 25

unable to break subs on entei which is

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.919 
unable to break subs on entei which is
extremely<00:01:58.249> awesome<00:01:58.399> for<00:01:59.210> any<00:01:59.359> Pokemon<00:01:59.810> that

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
extremely awesome for any Pokemon that

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.480 
extremely awesome for any Pokemon that
uses<00:02:00.170> sub<00:02:00.380> but<00:02:00.560> especially<00:02:00.740> for<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.159> set<00:02:01.399> like

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
uses sub but especially for a set like

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.980 
uses sub but especially for a set like
this<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.539> means<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.840> could

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
this because that means you could

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.260 
this because that means you could
effectively<00:02:03.409> PP<00:02:03.979> stall<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.939> know<00:02:05.030> those

effectively PP stall you know those

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.060

moves<00:02:05.570> even<00:02:05.840> more<00:02:06.289> effectively<00:02:06.770> than<00:02:06.859> you

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
moves even more effectively than you

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.650

and<00:02:24.590> toxic<00:02:25.430> but<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:25.940> saw<00:02:26.630> from<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.530> know<00:02:27.650> what<00:02:28.070> I

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
and toxic but I saw from you know what I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.920 
and toxic but I saw from you know what I
saw<00:02:28.460> that<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.820> set<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.150> capable<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.600> doing

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
saw that the set is capable of doing

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.660 
saw that the set is capable of doing
that<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.470> best<00:02:30.710> one<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.010> go<00:02:31.040> with<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.310> after

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
that the best one to go with that after

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.550 
that the best one to go with that after
also<00:02:32.060> talking<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.780> submitter<00:02:33.110> about<00:02:33.380> this

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
also talking to the submitter about this

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.770 
also talking to the submitter about this
would<00:02:33.920> be<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.160> go<00:02:34.250> with<00:02:34.370> lava<00:02:34.550> plume<00:02:34.820> it's<00:02:35.510> your

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
would be to go with lava plume it's your

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.750 
would be to go with lava plume it's your
main<00:02:36.110> fire<00:02:36.470> type<00:02:36.770> move<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.190> set<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.580> does

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
main fire type move on the set it does

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.000 
main fire type move on the set it does
good<00:02:37.940> damage<00:02:38.300> in<00:02:38.420> itself<00:02:38.780> also<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.710> does<00:02:39.860> have

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
good damage in itself also it does have

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.740 
good damage in itself also it does have
a<00:02:40.070> thirty<00:02:40.340> percent<00:02:40.670> chance<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.150> burn<00:02:41.360> which<00:02:41.630> is

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
a thirty percent chance to burn which is

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.410 
a thirty percent chance to burn which is
extremely<00:02:42.320> useful<00:02:42.380> for<00:02:42.890> any<00:02:43.070> defensive<00:02:44.030> fire

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
extremely useful for any defensive fire

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.120 
extremely useful for any defensive fire
type<00:02:44.750> because<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.470> means<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.740> physical

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
type because that means the physical

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.410 
type because that means the physical
attackers<00:02:46.580> will<00:02:46.760> have<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> much<00:02:47.210> more

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
attackers will have a much more

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.990 
attackers will have a much more
difficult<00:02:47.630> time<00:02:48.020> breaking<00:02:48.710> antes<00:02:49.340> subs<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
difficult time breaking antes subs and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.910 
difficult time breaking antes subs and
also<00:02:50.210> just<00:02:50.300> dealing<00:02:50.690> damage<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:51.200> general<00:02:51.710> and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
also just dealing damage in general and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.830 
also just dealing damage in general and
for<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.610> last<00:02:52.790> we've<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.240> set<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.660> was

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
for the last we've on the set it was

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.540 
for the last we've on the set it was
recommended<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.350> disco<00:02:54.710> with<00:02:54.830> roar<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.340> had

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
recommended to disco with roar but I had

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.130 
recommended to disco with roar but I had
a<00:02:55.580> thorough<00:02:55.760> toxic<00:02:56.270> on<00:02:56.390> there<00:02:56.570> as<00:02:56.690> well<00:02:56.720> since

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
a thorough toxic on there as well since

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.200 
a thorough toxic on there as well since
it<00:02:57.260> was<00:02:57.410> recommended<00:02:57.830> but<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.670> figured<00:02:59.060> it

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
it was recommended but I figured it

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.660 
it was recommended but I figured it
could<00:02:59.330> work<00:02:59.510> also<00:02:59.960> in<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.260> slot<00:03:00.500> as<00:03:00.710> well<00:03:01.010> so

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
could work also in this slot as well so

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.330 
could work also in this slot as well so
roar<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.090> toxic<00:03:02.540> are<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.900> last<00:03:03.110> two<00:03:03.680> possible

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
roar and toxic are the last two possible

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.670 
roar and toxic are the last two possible
moves<00:03:04.580> for<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.150> set<00:03:05.420> roar<00:03:06.080> obviously<00:03:06.560> is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
moves for the set roar obviously is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.850 
moves for the set roar obviously is
extremely<00:03:07.190> fantastic<00:03:07.400> for<00:03:08.000> phasing<00:03:08.390> out<00:03:08.480> any

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
extremely fantastic for phasing out any

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.760 
extremely fantastic for phasing out any
setup<00:03:09.860> sweepers<00:03:10.430> or<00:03:10.940> any<00:03:11.260> Pokemon<00:03:12.260> that<00:03:12.440> will

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
setup sweepers or any Pokemon that will

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.400

but<00:04:53.500> all<00:04:53.590> in<00:04:53.770> all<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.889> thought<00:04:54.190> this<00:04:54.310> was<00:04:54.490> a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
but all in all I thought this was a

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.040 
but all in all I thought this was a
really<00:04:54.790> creative<00:04:55.120> way<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.450> make<00:04:55.780> use<00:04:55.990> of

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
really creative way to make use of

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.409 
really creative way to make use of
pressure<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:57.490> entei<00:04:57.790> is<00:04:57.970> definitely<00:04:58.389> a

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
pressure and entei is definitely a

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.930 
pressure and entei is definitely a
Pokemon<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.200> effectively<00:04:59.620> do<00:04:59.919> this<00:05:00.100> but

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
Pokemon that can effectively do this but

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.820 
Pokemon that can effectively do this but
that<00:05:01.450> is<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:01.690> for<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.930> set<00:05:02.140> everyone<00:05:02.410> so<00:05:02.800> I
