you're holding your phone up but in

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.729 
you're holding your phone up but in

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
general the best way to do it is to just

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.310 
general the best way to do it is to just
hold<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.339> both<00:01:05.369> hands<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.810> same

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
hold it with both hands now the same

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.929 
hold it with both hands now the same
principles<00:01:07.799> are<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> count<00:01:08.640> for

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
principles are going to count for

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.760 
principles are going to count for
point-and-shoot<00:01:09.750> cameras<00:01:10.170> pointer<00:01:10.560> shoots

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
point-and-shoot cameras pointer shoots

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320 
point-and-shoot cameras pointer shoots
are<00:01:10.920> really<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.580> different<00:01:11.820> than<00:01:12.030> cell

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
are really not that different than cell

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.690 
are really not that different than cell
phone<00:01:12.540> cameras<00:01:12.960> especially<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:13.710> days<00:01:13.770> but

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
phone cameras especially these days but

phone cameras especially these days but
you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> way<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.900> I'm

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
you can see here the way that I'm

photo and so I'm holding it flat and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.520 
photo and so I'm holding it flat and
I've<00:01:21.030> sort<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.330> created<00:01:21.810> again<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> same

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
I've sort of created again the same

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.249 
I've sort of created again the same
tripod<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.640> my<00:01:23.970> arms<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.049> also

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
with my left hand I'm kind of creating a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
with my left hand I'm kind of creating a
base<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> camera<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> sit<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.750> then

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
base for the camera to sit on and then

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.920 
base for the camera to sit on and then
I'm<00:01:30.930> using<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.350> right<00:01:31.530> hand<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:32.070> control<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
I'm using the right hand to control it

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
I'm using the right hand to control it
again<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> same<00:01:34.290> thing<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:35.310> holding<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
again the same thing with holding the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.520 
again the same thing with holding the
camera<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.659> hand<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.350> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
camera with one hand if you do that
