00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.019
 my first home went down therefore 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.389
 us today is a double celebration of victory 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.390
 which we kept on the last can 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.180
 say seconds and despite the fact that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.359
 before this game we were in my opinion 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.710
 very so much complexity with the composition 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 two people missed by 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.420
 disqualification dutov Pavlov right there 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.570
 we got sick at two in the afternoon 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.760
 so everything had to change in the course 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.340
 rebuild on r from what guys on 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.160
 really before showed character and up 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.690
 of the end they tried to win 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.539
 to be due to the fact that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.730
 more wanted maybe better were 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.110
 somewhere ready physically go succeeded 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.820
 squeeze the opponent though principle moments 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.340
 but as we had in the first half at 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.250
 account 10 did not score cubes also hatches me 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.670
 no one after the goal was scored 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.729
 good but this is football in principle 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.659
 who scores more goals wins 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.659
 we network take more 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.740
 the team building lived in another different 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.300
 because of the distance with the guys teams like 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.530
 once played 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:28.500
 Well, you know what we play but rarely 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.560
 brings success after all it's safer 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.790
 for first of all it is for our gate 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.620
 in spite of the fact that we serve the corner 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.210
 still at the top of us guys playing on 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.910
 my mind is not good enough 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.900
 aggressive if you look clogged 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.420
 our gates in our goal year man 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.880
 jumps out freezes rejects like 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.960
 do as we all do if we are there shooting gallery 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.210
 knight and we will shut up this 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.190
 visibility for it worked well all 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.320
 Equally, I think woodchucks have little childhood 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:06.500
 extended this ball and there are already tar 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.500
 framed all leg 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.830
 with long based 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.830
 why are you more accurate 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.610
 well mom look just in the weekly cycle 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.790
 huba looked get physically was 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.110
 ready better teddy in principle 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.069
 played in my opinion not so bright in 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.620
 Ulyanovsk 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.180
 but the replacement came in my opinion 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.250
 I think quite useful at all that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.500
 replacement well maybe somewhere ex 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.280
 Gaps all the same together guys and marmots and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.560
 goats they added movement in the attack as 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.560
 would be better ok 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.580
 started me today 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.940
 started 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.410
 and eyes or ali hide from in general 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.910
 an exception 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.450
 5 half because but there were questions 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.520
 I have to him during the match 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.470
 especially such a moment is unpleasant in 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.510
 second half when i still told him 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.240
 play with these Brazilian 1 St m number 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.740
 it is free received after filing on 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.710
 chest ball is our penalty 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.690
 so the support have it is not only 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.700
 like a ball player in this group before without 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.850
 the ball which is you on that 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.650
 a destroyer player who is from that 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.960
 This zone does not allow the opponent to give 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.180
 sharp gear does not develop attack 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.280
 all the same in my opinion fisherman burenka with 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.800
 this task did not cope today so 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.200
 good as I would like but again 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:45.700
 guys first game in my opinion on cues 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.070
 Better played today , we still 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.320
 ahead as this sharpness was and in 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.270
 principle on the second half the guy twice 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.950
 beat so we almost hit but still 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.320
 it was evident that the focus on the gate 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.590
 present though it can close and two 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.540
 positions you can win for x 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.310
 so here, as it were, in his face 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.360
 we got yes I think enough 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.360
 qualified player 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.370
 we have 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.760
 and so 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.760
 lists 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.120
 rent a golestan team 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.019
 smoke strong bumps collided or 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.860
 elf teams 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.690
 and skate park 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.419
 everything is described to merge 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.830
 not always not always football topics 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.539
 interesting yes agree with you that 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.160
 initially a team that is higher rank 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.699
 can you let some not up 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.620
 settings but on the other hand we like 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.789
 you are their problems how will they prepare 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.669
 Yes, I know that they have a heavy schedule 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:54.130
 but still in the team that plays 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.080
 Premier League in Nezhin 10 people not 11 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.699
 points two the composition should be the one 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.729
 more people knew that they would play and 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:05.169
 sought to this in the league of Europe 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.820
 championship cup so there are people 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.860
 normal salary receive believe me 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.860
 which even at 18 misses 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.590
 he 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.590
 when mining in person 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:28.349
 our chance that the president says that 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:31.099
 make a football player year in this our 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.099
 main chance 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.160
 This is the last personal life 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.890
 and what a gift to you myself raised 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.380
 scored decisive hunger and mood 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.830
 good man the team won itself 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.350
 will take as for something else well here 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.290
 only the game ended so started 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.820
 celebrate with us on a december vacation with us 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.070
 No birthdays and anything that is not 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.150
 we need to think how 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.740
 Novosibirsk play people Krasnodar 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.780
 I think it's not fair to help 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.540
 Novosibirsk team who basically with 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.000
 quite good finances and is now 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.310
 departure area and they have the same situation there 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.900
 uneasy we are lucky in this plan there 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:29.440
 It will also set up a sufficiently 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:31.060
 serious but we also want to win well 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.260
 and here is the beginning that played this 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.950
 the team is allowed long enough 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.950
 gifts sat 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.120
 with myself 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.120
 rod 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:52.970
 know as far as psychology we are still 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.780
 repeatedly said that people who are not 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.820
 subject to 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.860
 or few are subject to this failure they 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.920
 play in other teams they play about 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.920
 the highest level because these people 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.920
 projected 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.790
 antidote very hard believe here 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.090
 how can I find an antidote i'm honest 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.500
 I'll tell you always afraid to wake up 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.940
 the day of the game because maybe during the night 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.250
 someone there God forbid something like 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:20.930
 woke up okay went to dinner 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:24.710
 there is no one cop here so here 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.790
 here they say but from another test people 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.330
 for example which some 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:31.630
 for example, God does not notice we have artemka 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.100
 boots just runs in a circle for two days 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:38.690
 then burns get well he doesn't know 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:41.419
 every other day only after ten 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.130
 guess them now we guess guess 

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:51.520
 then you played did not guess means 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:51.520
 failures thanks for nothing of you
