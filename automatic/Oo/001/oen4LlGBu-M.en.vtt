you want to have the awning extending
this<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.640> guy<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.540> catch<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.290> attaches

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
this and this guy is a catch it attaches

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.200 
this and this guy is a catch it attaches
right<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:23.070> into<00:01:23.220> here

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.430 

so<00:01:27.140> generally<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.620> lot<00:01:27.830> of<00:01:27.980> these<00:01:29.170> have<00:01:30.170> this

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
so generally a lot of these have this

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.010 
so generally a lot of these have this
type<00:01:30.650> of<00:01:30.680> bonding<00:01:31.040> system<00:01:31.280> on<00:01:31.580> there<00:01:31.900> what<00:01:32.900> you

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
type of bonding system on there what you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.210 
type of bonding system on there what you

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
see here is an awning that will

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.980 
see here is an awning that will
definitely<00:01:34.580> need<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.820> be<00:01:34.910> replaced<00:01:35.270> because

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
definitely need to be replaced because

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.390 
definitely need to be replaced because
we<00:01:36.110> have<00:01:36.230> a<00:01:36.260> big<00:01:36.500> tear<00:01:36.770> inside<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.250> awning

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
we have a big tear inside the awning

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.850 
we have a big tear inside the awning
fabric<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:38.960> very<00:01:39.170> common<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.650> lot<00:01:39.680> of

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
fabric this is very common a lot of

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.110 
fabric this is very common a lot of
these<00:01:39.950> awnings<00:01:40.310> wear<00:01:40.490> out<00:01:40.640> because<00:01:40.790> of<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
these awnings wear out because of the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.910 
these awnings wear out because of the
Sun<00:01:41.330> or<00:01:41.540> exposure<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.290> elements<00:01:42.410> and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
Sun or exposure to the elements and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.190 
Sun or exposure to the elements and
although<00:01:43.760> they<00:01:44.060> are<00:01:44.090> typically<00:01:44.600> very<00:01:44.720> good

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
although they are typically very good

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.590 
although they are typically very good
quality<00:01:45.710> fabric<00:01:46.300> once<00:01:47.300> you<00:01:47.420> put<00:01:47.570> something

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
out in the Sun a lot it does tend to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.150 
out in the Sun a lot it does tend to
degrade<00:01:50.050> okay<00:01:51.050> what<00:01:51.229> I'm<00:01:51.320> holding<00:01:51.470> here<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:51.890> an
