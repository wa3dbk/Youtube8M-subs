00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.119
 all 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.930
 encouraging to all who risk it today I'm going 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.259
 you get a very short idea about a stupid app 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.819
 who is really very nice 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:17.900
 in e and available on cydia peace free 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.539
 so percent 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.730
 it is valid 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.759
 in e3 functions for but the 3g and 3gs the iphone 4 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.510
 so what does this app do you allow to do and allow you 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.510
 to change in you see the same 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.480
 the the text in your lock bar 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.970
 so I thought it was really nice 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.030
 so for that you go on cydia 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.870
 and in the search tab you type following the beautiful this war so that's it 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.520
 would be like that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
 you click on it so free trial stp that I say 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.460
 so here's the dic boss so you do installed and confirmed 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.960
 and so you have to settle down you will not have any 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.250
 m icons on the springboard 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.030
 will need the teeth the settings so in the settings you will like ti a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.150
 little tab like that where to go with mark the beautiful evening 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.750
 so we click on it 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.630
 we go first but this rise so here it's just activated or not activated 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.500
 the fact is not activated to activate it 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.790
 so if we said it more like that without question of the beautiful 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.220
 it will not change anything 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.990
 then the loop since the beautiful knows this text that you will be able 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.380
 to put 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.110
 so the form I'm going to put 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.110
 the iphone 4 to 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.890
 and so normally times it changes and so a very nice session 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 allows to customize your your iphone 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.080
 he's just a little problem 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.080
 it's when you have a text too long 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.500
 j the couple he puts the small dots 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.200
 he defies the godfather of what could have been nice is that the text is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.120
 filmed 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.190
 it may be for an upcoming update 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.190
 there you see the cuckoo bound by an oath it remains high enough 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.150
 here it is I found it a little pity better 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.089
 the day application but it is really well thought out 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.139
 it does not have a lot of settings so it's easy to use 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.869
 and after that it's really nice so 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:15.919
 I advise you and free 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.589
 so you just need a jailbroken iphone 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.589
 and it's called the mirka war down so they are friends 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.729
 so here it is a little bit of everything I had to say about this carpet 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:27.689
 so for neither 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.039
 thank's for 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.429

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.359
 subscribe to the channel 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.729
