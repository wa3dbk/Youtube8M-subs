00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.180
 after the bomb attack on the Munich 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:32.450
 Oktoberfest rules over perpetrators and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:36.620
 motives still unclear what happened 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.140
 really on 26 september 1980 in the diet 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.329
 for you yes the investigators come to 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.260
 a comfortable result was cool 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.899
 member of the radical right 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.100
 Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann Rolf Koehler 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.960
 the single title 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.000
 a political motive could not 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.250
 The right-wing terror has been recognized 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.929
 Germany is really achieved now 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.160
 We should react to the situation 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.160
 the fans it was a case 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.869
 He was standing with two other men 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.820
 really there were two men standing there 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.070
 these were to testify corpse feel 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.479
 They completely ignore investigators 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.479
 The hints were looked at 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.830
 now done that sounds like 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.830
 after a single offender psychopath 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.770
 mÃ¼ller was not alone with that 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.770
 incredibly scandalous 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.750
 they accuse our justice of 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.710
 cover-up just have something 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.390
 from the fingers 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.340
 the hand is serbe we know are still 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.920
 megalomaniacally no idea of 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.870
 what we talk about when I'm under kens 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:47.360
 this is what the guys are serious about 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:53.180
 my hello what do you think about how 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.660
 the whole thing has expired, I would not have 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.930
 thought that I would trust something like that 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.930
 that's scary
