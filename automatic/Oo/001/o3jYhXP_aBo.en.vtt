00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:16.230
 hello my name is nobody has not passed a deadline for play-off 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.820
 researchers in the space field 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 when I reach him you hardly call to come to do for this expert 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.120
 in the region for the Napoleonic wars the media does something 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.210
 thing at that address you let pass then you got to 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 the time 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.620
 he dresses the inequalities and additional restrictions but 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.000
 to normal functioning of these major physiological systems 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.370
 and if because of these disordered pathological 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 mix of basic science and science that imitates her she seeks to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.800
 understand and act on diseases such as AIDS cancer disease 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 of Alzheimer's mts where genetic abnormalities 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.100
 because the bias to complete the medical biology program it is now 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.700
 master's student 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 as he has seen everything from the program he can tell us about it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.940
 why I choose stable housing fault on baca too flat 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.880
 first mark for the battles says we will be able to be beneficial 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.200
 it's physiology but debuchy even to study theology well 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.070
 of the roundabout 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 she does that it's a mosque of qom little more 7 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.100
 availability with the teachers these two who will be dedicated to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.990
 program 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.009
 we can tell a few weeks the good news over the phone 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.009
 now nobody can be sure to have answers to your questions 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.570
 e one of the major points 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.580
 a medical biology program mrc that's the space that took us boss 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.640
 of the fnac the last session in this sport a four-month internship 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.370
 that is to say at that moment then in the choice to choose three seconds 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.250
 of alberto of internship in three times 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.120
 usually the first is always retained 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.110
 it's a good way 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.130
 according to the world the research is a little research inserm at the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.760
 pharmaceutical representation 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.060
 but thanks to this blocked internship we are able to place him who is more 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.730
 shade 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.730
 this apparent this competition opportunity 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.760
 University of Quebec at Trois-RiviÃ¨res was the first to 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.730
 quebec estonia after many medical vintages 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.030
 his reputation is second to none and students come from all over 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.289
 register 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.379
 it is also one of the most popular programs of the university 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.739
 the student association play an important role in facilitating 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.689
 integration of program students and allow them to feel 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.279
 its effects quickly 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.629
 good evening I'm getting ready for a technique she has a nice caught tarbes to which 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:37.829
 age r 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.389
 with dindane to four everywhere eric walter fabio leimer and starting to have 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.569
 intercepted on the ground 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.499
 it was not this case because% in real terms yet it in 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.189
 had talked about plan b who won campaigns 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.379
 europe also lead a newspaper 8 in partnership announced it 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.229
 was going to sign if she does not recognize the same lp what stopped he did 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.969
 a point earned 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.429
 professor martinet line by job prospects 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:09.079
 but we come out of this meeting with users and his great experience in 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.039
 different countries the medical biology program of the two accomplices 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.680
 in global and integrated information 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.680
 what are we talking about much less a player here is what to do 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:24.209
 the proof is with the development of this biomedical sector in our 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:24.970
 society 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.550
 graduates of the program easily finds work the jubilation of 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.700
 his at the pharmaceutical show martel pursue 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.610
 graduate studies to devote himself to research patrick for his part 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.450
 headed for forensic analysis he quickly started a hand maybe that 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.780
 deviate in the net of famous researchers icons like mario deschamps 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.720
 general president of a pharmaceutical company
