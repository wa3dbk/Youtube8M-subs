expect<00:05:08.050> flash<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.740> win<00:05:08.860> this<00:05:08.950> game<00:05:09.130> i

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
expect flash to win this game i

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.610 
expect flash to win this game i
basically<00:05:10.240> i<00:05:10.360> expected<00:05:11.050> flash<00:05:11.230> to<00:05:11.410> win<00:05:11.530> the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
basically i expected flash to win the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.500 
basically i expected flash to win the
second<00:05:11.950> game<00:05:11.980> of<00:05:12.130> flash<00:05:12.550> vs<00:05:12.910> luxury<00:05:13.210> but<00:05:13.420> he

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
second game of flash vs luxury but he

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.140 
second game of flash vs luxury but he
didn't<00:05:13.840> um<00:05:14.680> so<00:05:15.130> maybe<00:05:15.280> my<00:05:15.520> expectations<00:05:15.760> were

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
didn't um so maybe my expectations were

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.970 
didn't um so maybe my expectations were
wrong<00:05:16.450> maybe<00:05:16.720> flashes<00:05:17.260> entering<00:05:17.710> a<00:05:17.770> real

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
wrong maybe flashes entering a real

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.520 
wrong maybe flashes entering a real
slump<00:05:18.310> but<00:05:18.490> my<00:05:19.270> guess<00:05:19.330> right<00:05:19.870> now<00:05:19.900> is<00:05:20.080> that

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
slump but my guess right now is that

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.070 
slump but my guess right now is that
flash<00:05:20.830> is<00:05:21.160> just<00:05:21.400> tired<00:05:21.720> he's<00:05:22.720> just<00:05:22.870> been

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
flash is just tired he's just been

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.750 
flash is just tired he's just been
playing<00:05:23.350> too<00:05:23.650> much<00:05:23.770> starcraft<00:05:24.040> recently<00:05:24.640> and

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
playing too much starcraft recently and

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.550 
playing too much starcraft recently and
whoa<00:05:24.940> hydras<00:05:25.480> done<00:05:25.660> going<00:05:25.870> on<00:05:25.990> for<00:05:26.140> minggu<00:05:26.350> so

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
a real psychological slump and you know

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.770 
a real psychological slump and you know
starcraft<00:05:36.490> is<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.640> lot<00:05:36.850> about<00:05:36.970> psychology<00:05:37.390> I

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
starcraft is a lot about psychology I

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.650 
starcraft is a lot about psychology I
mean<00:05:38.020> you<00:05:38.110> look<00:05:38.140> at<00:05:38.380> players<00:05:38.620> like<00:05:39.630> savior<00:05:40.630> of

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
mean you look at players like savior of

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.900 
mean you look at players like savior of
course<00:05:41.100> basically<00:05:42.100> people<00:05:42.190> say<00:05:42.460> he<00:05:42.670> still

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
course basically people say he still

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.520 
course basically people say he still
knows<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.180> mechanics<00:05:43.720> he<00:05:43.840> still<00:05:44.110> does<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.350> lot

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
knows the mechanics he still does a lot

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.500 
knows the mechanics he still does a lot
of<00:05:44.590> practice<00:05:45.010> but<00:05:45.160> his<00:05:45.370> just<00:05:45.670> doesn't<00:05:46.360> have

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
of practice but his just doesn't have

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.870 
of practice but his just doesn't have
the<00:05:46.540> will<00:05:46.840> to<00:05:46.870> win<00:05:47.260> anymore<00:05:47.560> even<00:05:48.400> looking<00:05:48.790> at

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
the will to win anymore even looking at

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.180 
the will to win anymore even looking at
jaedong<00:05:49.270> recently<00:05:49.780> uh<00:05:49.810> he<00:05:50.590> just<00:05:50.620> hasn't<00:05:50.980> been

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
jaedong recently uh he just hasn't been

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.860 
jaedong recently uh he just hasn't been
playing<00:05:51.430> so<00:05:51.640> well<00:05:51.670> and<00:05:52.000> it's<00:05:52.420> not<00:05:52.570> because

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
playing so well and it's not because

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.100 
playing so well and it's not because
he's<00:05:52.900> lost<00:05:53.380> his<00:05:53.620> fingers<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:55.270> his<00:05:55.330> fingers

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
he's lost his fingers and his fingers

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.800 
he's lost his fingers and his fingers
haven't<00:05:56.440> been<00:05:56.560> chopped<00:05:56.890> off<00:05:57.220> his<00:05:57.790> high<00:05:58.060> APM<00:05:58.630> is

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
haven't been chopped off his high APM is

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.420 
haven't been chopped off his high APM is
probably<00:05:59.110> still<00:05:59.350> there<00:05:59.560> just<00:05:59.590> some

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
probably still there just some

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.370 
probably still there just some
psychological<00:06:00.940> block<00:06:01.540> is<00:06:01.750> preventing<00:06:02.260> them

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
psychological block is preventing them

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.690 
psychological block is preventing them
from<00:06:02.410> playing<00:06:02.770> at<00:06:02.920> a<00:06:02.950> hundred<00:06:03.130> percent<00:06:03.340> and

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
from playing at a hundred percent and

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.970 
from playing at a hundred percent and
I'm<00:06:04.600> just<00:06:04.870> wondering<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.260> flash<00:06:05.500> has<00:06:05.770> that

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980

a fireman out he has actually getting a

a fireman out he has actually getting a
second<00:06:27.850> bunker<00:06:28.150> here<00:06:28.300> at<00:06:28.390> the<00:06:28.480> front<00:06:28.630> door<00:06:28.810> i

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
second bunker here at the front door i

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.570 
second bunker here at the front door i
wonder<00:06:29.170> if<00:06:29.260> he<00:06:29.320> scanned<00:06:29.680> the<00:06:29.830> hydro<00:06:30.130> stand<00:06:30.400> and

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
wonder if he scanned the hydro stand and

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.500 
wonder if he scanned the hydro stand and
perhaps<00:06:30.730> he's<00:06:30.970> a<00:06:31.000> little<00:06:31.150> worried<00:06:31.390> about

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
perhaps he's a little worried about

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:32.710 
perhaps he's a little worried about
lurkers<00:06:31.900> I

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
lurkers I

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.120 
lurkers I
assuming<00:06:33.260> that's<00:06:33.410> only<00:06:33.560> reason<00:06:33.860> he'll<00:06:34.010> be

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
assuming that's only reason he'll be

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.500 
assuming that's only reason he'll be
getting<00:06:34.280> the<00:06:34.490> second<00:06:34.820> bunker<00:06:35.120> up<00:06:35.270> if<00:06:35.420> you

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
getting the second bunker up if you

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.390 
getting the second bunker up if you
suspect<00:06:36.050> him<00:06:36.140> Ulis<00:06:36.470> gangoh<00:06:36.980> would<00:06:37.070> be<00:06:37.130> going

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
suspect him Ulis gangoh would be going

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.920 
suspect him Ulis gangoh would be going
he<00:06:37.760> wouldn't<00:06:38.000> be<00:06:38.060> going<00:06:38.090> for<00:06:38.300> that<00:06:38.420> bunker<00:06:38.780> he

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
he wouldn't be going for that bunker he

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.780 
he wouldn't be going for that bunker he
would<00:06:39.020> have<00:06:39.110> saved<00:06:39.260> the<00:06:39.350> minerals<00:06:39.710> for<00:06:39.920> just<00:06:40.730> a

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
would have saved the minerals for just a
