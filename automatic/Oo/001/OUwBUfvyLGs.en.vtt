lives so I'm starting the process right

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.170 
lives so I'm starting the process right
now<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.170> sending<00:02:51.859> energy<00:02:52.099> back<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.489> forth<00:02:52.940> I

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
now of sending energy back and forth I

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.630 
now of sending energy back and forth I
can<00:02:53.720> feel<00:02:53.959> your<00:02:54.170> head<00:02:54.410> between<00:02:54.650> my<00:02:55.010> hands<00:02:55.489> I

can feel your head between my hands I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.030 
can feel your head between my hands I
also<00:02:56.209> want<00:02:56.629> to<00:02:56.690> say<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.200> balancing<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.010> two

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
also want to say that balancing the two

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.759 
also want to say that balancing the two
hemispheres<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.879> your<00:02:59.000> brain<00:02:59.290> can<00:03:00.290> really

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
hemispheres of your brain can really

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.699 
hemispheres of your brain can really
help<00:03:01.010> with<00:03:01.540> sinus<00:03:02.540> issues<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.379> help<00:03:03.590> with

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
help with sinus issues it can help with

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.339 
help with sinus issues it can help with
eyes<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.239> help<00:03:05.450> with<00:03:05.569> headaches<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:06.200> can

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
eyes it can help with headaches it can

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.990 
eyes it can help with headaches it can
help<00:03:06.530> with<00:03:06.620> learning<00:03:07.160> disabilities<00:03:07.970> or

help with learning disabilities or
dyslexia<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.890> certainly<00:03:10.190> can<00:03:10.459> help<00:03:10.579> with

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
dyslexia and it certainly can help with

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.610 
dyslexia and it certainly can help with
helping<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.209> open<00:03:11.359> your<00:03:11.720> intuition<00:03:12.349> and<00:03:12.470> your

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
helping to open your intuition and your

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.119 
helping to open your intuition and your
third<00:03:12.859> eye<00:03:13.099> so<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.930> notice<00:03:15.290> how<00:03:15.319> you<00:03:15.500> feel

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
third eye so just notice how you feel

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.759 
third eye so just notice how you feel
again<00:03:17.000> I'm<00:03:17.209> sending<00:03:17.750> energy<00:03:17.870> back<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.530> forth

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
again I'm sending energy back and forth

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.690 
again I'm sending energy back and forth
often<00:03:19.280> I'll<00:03:19.400> be<00:03:19.549> doing<00:03:20.000> pulling<00:03:20.870> energies<00:03:21.380> out

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
often I'll be doing pulling energies out

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.990 
often I'll be doing pulling energies out
because<00:03:22.700> we're<00:03:22.910> predominantly<00:03:23.750> left<00:03:24.109> brained

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
because we're predominantly left brained

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.240 
because we're predominantly left brained
our<00:03:26.000> right<00:03:26.329> side<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.900> sort<00:03:27.169> of<00:03:27.230> congested<00:03:27.980> lots

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
our right side is sort of congested lots

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.490 
our right side is sort of congested lots
of<00:03:28.459> times<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.480> that's<00:03:29.720> kind<00:03:30.109> of<00:03:30.200> what<00:03:30.349> I'm

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
of times so that's kind of what I'm

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.920 
of times so that's kind of what I'm
doing<00:03:30.530> I'm<00:03:31.010> getting<00:03:31.489> rid<00:03:31.819> of<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:32.120> congestion

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
doing I'm getting rid of the congestion

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.420 
doing I'm getting rid of the congestion
so<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.250> can<00:03:34.959> open<00:03:35.959> and<00:03:36.410> work<00:03:36.620> with<00:03:36.859> your

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
so that it can open and work with your

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.720 
so that it can open and work with your
left<00:03:37.700> brain<00:03:37.970> better<00:03:38.590> now<00:03:39.590> I'm<00:03:39.829> just<00:03:40.069> focusing

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
left brain better now I'm just focusing

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.800 
left brain better now I'm just focusing
now<00:03:40.970> tuning<00:03:41.690> in<00:03:41.930> noticing<00:03:42.859> what<00:03:43.010> I'm<00:03:43.130> feeling

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
now tuning in noticing what I'm feeling

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.240 
now tuning in noticing what I'm feeling
often<00:03:44.810> what<00:03:44.959> happens<00:03:44.989> when<00:03:45.620> I'm<00:03:45.769> sending

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
often what happens when I'm sending

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.849 
often what happens when I'm sending
energy<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:50.139> doing<00:03:51.139> healing<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:53.260> we<00:03:54.260> work<00:03:54.530> and

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
energy and doing healing is we work and

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:55.990 
energy and doing healing is we work and
you<00:03:54.950> know<00:03:55.069> we're<00:03:55.220> running<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.609> energy

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
you know we're running the energy

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.339 
you know we're running the energy
running<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.419> energy<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:56.900> then<00:03:56.989> something

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
running the energy and then something

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.159 
running the energy and then something
kind<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.650> pops<00:03:57.879> so<00:03:58.879> I'm<00:03:59.150> getting<00:03:59.389> a<00:03:59.629> sense<00:03:59.900> of

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
kind of pops so I'm getting a sense of

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.280 
kind of pops so I'm getting a sense of
that<00:04:00.379> opening<00:04:00.980> happening<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.840> right<00:04:03.019> side

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
that opening happening in the right side

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.039 
that opening happening in the right side
of<00:04:03.319> your<00:04:03.500> brain<00:04:03.889> as<00:04:04.730> it's<00:04:05.030> it's<00:04:05.450> just<00:04:05.690> kind<00:04:05.959> of

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
of your brain as it's it's just kind of

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.259 
of your brain as it's it's just kind of
like<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.709> know<00:04:06.739> if<00:04:06.919> a<00:04:06.980> stream<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:07.819> kind<00:04:08.120> of

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
like you know if a stream is kind of

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.650 
like you know if a stream is kind of
blocked<00:04:09.069> with<00:04:10.069> junk<00:04:10.549> in<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.060> we<00:04:11.180> clean<00:04:11.480> out

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
blocked with junk in it and we clean out

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.780 
blocked with junk in it and we clean out
the<00:04:11.840> stream<00:04:12.230> then<00:04:13.010> all<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.340> sudden<00:04:13.370> it

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
the stream then all of a sudden it

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.849 
the stream then all of a sudden it
starts<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.329> flow<00:04:14.569> and<00:04:14.750> once<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.139> just<00:04:15.169> starts

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
starts to flow and once it just starts

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.969 
starts to flow and once it just starts
then<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.519> really<00:04:16.880> gets<00:04:17.120> going<00:04:17.359> there<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.199> often

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
then it really gets going there I often

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.289 
then it really gets going there I often
