00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.609
 or the girls as they are I hope they are 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.390
 very well in this video I bring you a 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:13.730
 review and first impression of this clamp 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.779
 to wish the hair this is from the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:23.300
 carmine brand and this limited edition if 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.730
 the version is pro g3 room and that's how 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.770
 I know of girls I received it in the color 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.900
 black but I understand that they have 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.629
 Three colors available including the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.640
 color rosita and well I tell you that it's going to 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.590
 be first impression because I have not 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.750
 used just the age I got yesterday 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.610
 then this is how it looks is just 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.200
 out of the package and I'm fine but 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.600
 well excited to try it because it says 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.090
 which is professional and good has very 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.960
 good reviews in amazon has four 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.510
 stars and averages of 166 reviews as 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.590
 comes in your bag this is removed from 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.719
 done is Velcro and I'm not sure if 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.910
 here you can put the iron when it is 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.649
 hot as I've seen many that have 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.089
 so your plastic and put it on top of the 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.540
 iron while it 's hot so that 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.120
 Do not burn yourself 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.970
 you are working but it comes with your 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.530
 little bag I did not like much because it happens if 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.650
 you have a study where to put it for 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.310
 that is not scratched and not mistreated and both 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.640
 to treat the doubt that is the clamp ok is 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.560
 very very real and I'm not so sure 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
 that it's going to work for me because 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.490
 as I have too much hair with a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.320
 pinza is that reedita took quite a 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.400
 relationship I am, I prefer the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.650
 clamps that are wider plates but 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.420
 Well, let's see how this works 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.630
 I tell them they have not liked it so here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.790
 you will witness if it works or 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.500
 does not work and the clip comes with a 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.900
 code for you to register in the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.420
 page of carmina puntocom so that 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.979
 get the guarantee for three years for 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 if something happens to him and this is returned by 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.240
 of the repair and also comes with a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.440
 booklet an instructive that tells you how 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.520
 use it and it comes with three hairstyles with 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.640
 instructions for three deer 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.649
 different for a straight silky straight 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.759
 with volume or loop with the tips for 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.549
 outside 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.750
 and this is a ceramic plate what 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.939
 which means that it does not mistreat the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.120
 hair the temperature can you 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:22.829
 adjust up to 460 degrees I'm going to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.590
 put between 360 and 460 as I have 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.150
 very thick hair girls almost always 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.940
 I have to use a temperature 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.000
 quite high because if not, they do not give it to me 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.250
 You feel this is my hair only 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.650
 I love it I know that with the dryer and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.890
 that's how I'm pretty fluffed 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.230
 the tips as well as half curl now 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.290
 yes we are going to start today yes it is 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.790
 pretty hot 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.790
 start doing it 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.470
 to see how 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.470
 it's the first pass 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.120
 it was ready but it was not so ready 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.100
 good depends on how smooth you like it 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.380
 if you like it like it's worth then I 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.920
 I think you have to give several passes 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.960
 but they know one thing what is leaving 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.640
 pretty soft and I think that up 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.070
 shinny 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.440
 I do not think that's how you look this 28 girls 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.810
 What do you think right now that ends 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.540
 loves me well because here is the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.180
 difference hair without hair straightening 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.129
 straight 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.200
 it even seems that we have it healthy in 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.640
 Seriously what is leaving it very bright are 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.590
 very jealous 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.420
 let's deal with another bit of 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.630
 here 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.370
 and I have super-battered ends 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.260
 they can not see on camera 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.470
 and in fact I just cut my hair 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.790
 about three weeks ago that's why 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.739
 you have always seen me with the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.690
 hair of the same length because it 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.060
 mistreats me so much that every time I 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.680
 I have to be cutting dance what does not 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.079
 I'm liking it on the clip is that the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.489
 cable is too short to say 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.620
 right now and I have to do more to 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.170
 here where it is connected to the clamp 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.620
 because I can not reach when doing this 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.550
 side 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.950
 and I have to just unplug this one 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.070
 did not disconnect 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.810
 I think I was lying like that it's long 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.450
 just that it was stuck ok it is a 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.270
 pretty long cable 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.950
 I do not know how many passes from here but 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.950
 let's see if it was already raining 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.730
 something that I'm liking is hair 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.940
 it does not smell burned like with many 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.630
 tweezers the hair smells charred and 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.940
 with this note 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.420
 but maybe if they should be 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.240
 using thinner sections because 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.680
 I feel that the novel points are 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.680
 doing as well as I would like 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.680
 if I'm liking how he's leaving the 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.540
 hair girls but it is leaving well 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.350
 Sorry environment 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.350
 and I like it 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.490
 ah 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.080
 ah 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.979
 ah 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.290
 ah 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.090
 Y 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.219
 Y 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.680
 then in conclusion I do the 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.440
 I recommend I loved it I loved it 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.580
 mentors 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.780
 very happy I did not expect the great thing 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.780
 if it's worth it 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:16.350
 since 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.350
 in the box 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.009
 to curl hair not only in 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.650
 plates 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:28.589
 the hair and it 's the best and you can 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.550
 interest so from a fine for the 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:31.550
 good page 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:40.460
 find them 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.460
 I am 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.839
 at three in the morning 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.060
 I could not
