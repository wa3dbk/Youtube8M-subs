right<00:00:31.710> now<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> Windows<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.180> running

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
right now this is Windows I'm running

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.520 
right now this is Windows I'm running
Windows<00:00:33.780> XP<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.899> it<00:00:36.899> has<00:00:37.079> no<00:00:37.260> file

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
Windows XP here and it has no file

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.139 
Windows XP here and it has no file
Association<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.610> get<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.879> little

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
Association so you get this little

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.160 
Association so you get this little
symbol<00:00:39.329> you're<00:00:39.540> probably<00:00:39.719> familiar<00:00:39.870> with

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
symbol you're probably familiar with

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
symbol you're probably familiar with
that<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.100> first<00:00:41.489> thing<00:00:41.730> we're<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that so first thing we're going to do is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:58.069 
that so first thing we're going to do is
just<00:00:55.129> unexpected<00:00:56.129> all<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> necessary<00:00:57.079> gtk

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
just unexpected all the necessary gtk

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.010 
just unexpected all the necessary gtk
wave<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> DLLs<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.579> need<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.059> run<00:01:00.840> this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
wave and the DLLs that need to run this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.080 
wave and the DLLs that need to run this
version<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.940> file<00:01:04.729> ok<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.030> we

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
version in this one file ok so now we

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.520 
version in this one file ok so now we
have<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:07.260> folder<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> place

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
have this folder and I'm going to place

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.420 
have this folder and I'm going to place
this<00:01:10.799> folder<00:01:11.280> down<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> root<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.500> drive

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this folder down on the root of my drive

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.200 
this folder down on the root of my drive
so<00:01:15.330> I'm<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> cut<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.759> go<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> drive

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so I'm going to cut it here go to drive

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.260 
so I'm going to cut it here go to drive
see<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.860> I'm<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.670> paste<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.240> right

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
see and I'm just going to paste it right

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.440 
see and I'm just going to paste it right
here<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> good<00:01:22.350> enough<00:01:22.470> place<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
here be a good enough place to put it

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.140 
here be a good enough place to put it
ok<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.810> take<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> look<00:01:25.229> inside<00:01:26.150> here

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
ok and if we take a look inside here

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.249 
ok and if we take a look inside here
let's<00:01:27.920> bring<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.579> level<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:30.750> levels

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
let's bring this up one level two levels

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
let's bring this up one level two levels
there<00:01:31.530> paste<00:01:32.360> yes<00:01:33.360> doll<00:01:34.189> ok<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.790> just

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
there paste yes doll ok so now we just

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.800 
there paste yes doll ok so now we just
have<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.600> folder<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.540> gtk<00:01:39.540> wave

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
have one folder with the gtk wave

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.289 
have one folder with the gtk wave
program<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.280> along<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.939> all<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
program in there along with all the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.200 
program in there along with all the
necessary<00:01:42.450> dll's<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.710> windows<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:46.040> now<00:01:47.210> what

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
necessary dll's for windows so now what

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.700 
necessary dll's for windows so now what
I'm<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.810> I'll<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.140> go<00:01:49.439> ahead<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
I'm going to do I'll just go ahead and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.429 
I'm going to do I'll just go ahead and
delete<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:52.280> we<00:01:53.280> will<00:01:53.780> now<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
delete this and we will now just do a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.550 
delete this and we will now just do a
simple<00:01:56.479> open<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:59.689> we'll<00:02:00.689> browse<00:02:01.020> for

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
simple open with and we'll browse for

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.270 
simple open with and we'll browse for
the<00:02:01.619> program<00:02:02.250> which<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.790> down<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
the program which will be down on the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.190 
the program which will be down on the
drive<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:06.770> under<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.060> gtk<00:02:09.060> wave<00:02:09.330> folder<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
drive see under the gtk wave folder and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.330 
drive see under the gtk wave folder and
there's<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.679> program

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
there's that program

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.790 
there's that program
and<00:02:12.849> we'll<00:02:13.360> associate<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.110> with<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.260> and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
and we'll associate it with that and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.650 
and we'll associate it with that and
we'll<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.069> select<00:02:15.580> always<00:02:16.000> here<00:02:18.420> okay<00:02:21.660> so

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
we'll just select always here okay so

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.949 
we'll just select always here okay so
there<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.170> did<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.860> opened<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.430> okay<00:02:25.180> so

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
there I did it and it opened it okay so

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.070 
there I did it and it opened it okay so
in<00:02:26.170> fact<00:02:26.349> let's<00:02:26.590> just<00:02:26.680> close<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.370> again

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
in fact let's just close it again

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.610 
in fact let's just close it again
and<00:02:29.130> say<00:02:30.130> yes<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.910> now<00:02:31.390> had<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> different

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
and say yes and now had a different

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.199 
and say yes and now had a different
symbol<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.640> should<00:02:33.790> be<00:02:33.880> able<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.060> to

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
symbol so you should be able just to

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.660 
symbol so you should be able just to
double<00:02:34.840> click<00:02:35.019> on<00:02:35.140> our<00:02:35.200> VCD<00:02:35.739> file<00:02:35.980> it'll<00:02:36.459> pull

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
double click on our VCD file it'll pull

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.350 
double click on our VCD file it'll pull
up<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:37.000> version<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.800> gtk<00:02:38.800> wave<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.880> you'll

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
up this version of gtk wave and you'll

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.220 
up this version of gtk wave and you'll
see<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.900> over<00:02:41.140> here<00:02:41.170> we<00:02:41.800> have<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:43.230> hierarchy

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
see that over here we have a hierarchy

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.500 
see that over here we have a hierarchy
of<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.980> particular<00:02:45.549> design<00:02:45.910> simulation

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
of this particular design simulation

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.559 
of this particular design simulation
that<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:49.060> can<00:02:49.209> open<00:02:49.330> up

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
that I have and you can open up

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.210 
that I have and you can open up
different<00:02:49.810> levels<00:02:50.319> here<00:02:50.530> I'll<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:50.739> select

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
different levels here I'll just select

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.949 
different levels here I'll just select
all<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.640> brings<00:02:52.060> up<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.390> whole<00:02:52.420> bunch<00:02:52.810> of

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
all of this brings up a whole bunch of

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.500 
all of this brings up a whole bunch of
signals<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:54.040> I'll<00:02:54.370> just<00:02:54.640> select<00:02:54.850> one<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.420> then

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
signals so I'll just select one and then

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.750 
signals so I'll just select one and then
I'll<00:02:55.569> do<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> ctrl<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.650> my<00:02:56.680> keyboard<00:02:57.099> that'll

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
I'll do a ctrl a on my keyboard that'll

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.160 
I'll do a ctrl a on my keyboard that'll
select<00:02:58.030> everything<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.750> then<00:02:58.870> I'm<00:02:58.989> gonna

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
select everything and then I'm gonna

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.860 
select everything and then I'm gonna
click<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.590> insert<00:03:00.420> now<00:03:01.420> all<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> sudden

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
click the insert now all of a sudden

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.140 
click the insert now all of a sudden
we've<00:03:02.260> got<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.500> lot<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:02.860> signals<00:03:03.489> listed<00:03:03.910> here

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
we've got a lot of signals listed here

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:14.330 
we've got a lot of signals listed here
just<00:03:04.660> from<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.989> one<00:03:05.049> thing<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:06.510> little<00:03:07.510> more

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.699 

okay<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.519> now<00:03:16.180> let's<00:03:16.480> do<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> zoom<00:03:17.470> fit<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:20.019> you

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
okay so now let's do a zoom fit and you

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.530 
okay so now let's do a zoom fit and you
start<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.130> see<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> lot<00:03:21.489> more<00:03:21.519> activity<00:03:22.269> in<00:03:22.299> this

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
start to see a lot more activity in this

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.740 
start to see a lot more activity in this
simulation<00:03:22.780> here<00:03:23.910> let's<00:03:24.910> say<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.299> wanted

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
simulation here let's say that I wanted

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.330 
simulation here let's say that I wanted
to<00:03:25.930> take<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.170> look<00:03:26.530> at<00:03:26.650> what's<00:03:26.829> going<00:03:26.920> on<00:03:27.280> right

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
to take a look at what's going on right

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.410 
to take a look at what's going on right
here

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
here

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.759 
here
I<00:03:28.450> wanted<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.810> dial<00:03:29.109> this<00:03:29.290> thing<00:03:29.350> this<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.739> a

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
I wanted a dial this thing this is a

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.229 
I wanted a dial this thing this is a
fairly<00:03:30.100> long<00:03:30.250> simulation<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:33.370> let's<00:03:33.850> do<00:03:34.209> a

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
fairly long simulation and let's do a

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.690 
fairly long simulation and let's do a
plus<00:03:35.230> for<00:03:35.680> zooming<00:03:35.980> in<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.859> we<00:03:39.130> can<00:03:39.310> start<00:03:39.579> to

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
plus for zooming in and we can start to

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.039 
plus for zooming in and we can start to
see<00:03:39.910> more<00:03:40.180> information<00:03:40.359> here<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:43.049> here's

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
see more information here and here's

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.020 
see more information here and here's
some<00:03:44.230> clock<00:03:44.590> signals<00:03:45.130> down<00:03:45.370> here<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:45.880> we're

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
some clock signals down here so we're

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.460 
some clock signals down here so we're
gonna<00:03:46.120> zoom<00:03:46.389> on<00:03:46.569> in<00:03:46.750> till<00:03:46.930> we<00:03:46.959> see<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.260> little

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
gonna zoom on in till we see a little

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.440 
gonna zoom on in till we see a little
more<00:03:47.560> detail<00:03:50.549> now<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.609> can<00:03:51.850> start<00:03:52.120> seeing

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
more detail now you can start seeing

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.559 
more detail now you can start seeing
some<00:03:52.630> detail

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.330 

and<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.680> case<00:03:57.390> there's<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:59.280> there's<00:04:00.280> a

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
and in this case there's a there's a

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.830 
and in this case there's a there's a
state<00:04:00.640> machine<00:04:00.849> that<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.239> have<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.719> this

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
state machine that I have in this

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.360 
state machine that I have in this
particular<00:04:01.989> thing<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.469> can<00:04:02.680> see<00:04:02.829> changing

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
particular thing you can see changing

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.280 
particular thing you can see changing
different<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.730> different<00:04:04.000> states<00:04:04.290> on

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
different to different states on

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.780 
different to different states on
different<00:04:05.739> clocks<00:04:05.950> I<00:04:06.069> should<00:04:06.250> have<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.549> clock

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
different clocks I should have the clock

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.069 
different clocks I should have the clock
here<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.180> then<00:04:07.269> you<00:04:07.359> can<00:04:07.510> see<00:04:07.719> the<00:04:07.959> clock<00:04:10.079> it's

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
here and then you can see the clock it's

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.599 
here and then you can see the clock it's
just<00:04:11.439> a<00:04:12.299> little<00:04:13.299> bit<00:04:13.510> more<00:04:14.099> so<00:04:15.099> anyway<00:04:15.519> you

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
just a little bit more so anyway you

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.909 
just a little bit more so anyway you
have<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.209> just<00:04:16.870> play<00:04:17.019> with<00:04:17.079> this<00:04:17.320> get<00:04:17.530> used<00:04:17.680> to

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
have to just play with this get used to

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.789 
have to just play with this get used to
it<00:04:18.039> using<00:04:18.699> this<00:04:19.000> one<00:04:19.959> test<00:04:20.229> file<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:20.440> gave<00:04:20.709> you

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
it using this one test file I gave you

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.260 
it using this one test file I gave you
you<00:04:20.889> should<00:04:21.100> get<00:04:21.250> bill<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.639> at<00:04:21.729> least<00:04:21.850> get<00:04:22.090> this

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
you should get bill to at least get this

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.629 
you should get bill to at least get this
to<00:04:22.509> come<00:04:22.690> up<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.229> work<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.770> then<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.490> can

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
to come up and work and then you can

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.580 
to come up and work and then you can
start<00:04:24.880> learning<00:04:25.240> how<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.419> use<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.169> way<00:04:26.289> this

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
start learning how to use the way this

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.919 
start learning how to use the way this
waveform<00:04:27.070> viewer<00:04:28.500> that's<00:04:29.500> all<00:04:29.680> for<00:04:29.889> now
