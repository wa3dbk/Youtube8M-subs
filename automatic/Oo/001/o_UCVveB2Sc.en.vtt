00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 we'll start right away so he 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.570
 will have to put your tape on your 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.389
 head it off if you drop it on 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.350
 the forehead as it is done very often 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.050
 right now or so if you have a 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.140
 double agent on the head 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.650
 there we are not in style style 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.980
 pin up 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.599
 we are no longer in the style of the century 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 last the 20s the 30s or 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.980
 so really the antiques side has it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.020
 really offered pinnacle so that's going to be 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 the small place preferably on the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:44.129
 side of the head with the hair well 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.860
 So I rolled up my band course 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.840
 the side and I'm going to drop everything 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.690
 just the headband all around 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.660
 my head matches 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.539
 so right now was pulling well on your 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.809
 hair like these all around 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.110
 your head 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.540
 so that your agent does not go back 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.549
 there is no mushroom effect 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.460
 yachts from the other world besides I 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.140
 yours and I shoot like this so 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.850
 that they that my hair does not go back to 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.070
 From there it is very easy it will 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 simply have to go up each bit 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.950
 and put it in the help sell everything 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 around the head 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.590
 so my little trick always held 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.750
 well your she's boasting on the other side 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.460
 for trampoline 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.560
 the jelly really went down well on 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.729
 ears is at most of what I 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.890
 could do on finally near the front 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.790
 without going to the front so I start 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.540
 I hold on one side and I take the 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:00.920
 locks is just I'm going to them 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.920
 pass in I take another wick 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.750
 and I pass it in 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.230
 here we are going to do that especially around 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.230
 the hair 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.130
 I change hands and I always hold 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.770
 the headband because often when 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.040
 trailer our hair lautour we have 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.990
 tendency to make it go up so I 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.000
 keep on going 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.170
 try to approach me for you see a 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.170
 little bit the gesture it is very simple 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.170
 here 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.270
 we almost got to the end so for 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.700
 those who have long hair 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.140
 Well, there's no problem we continue to 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.120
 those who have hair just right 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.040
 like me and where I give you my 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.860
 little trick simply 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.080
 little tongs and you're going to take your 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.630
 matches behind and grab them well 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.650
 with the headband like that really it does not 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.650
 will not move it 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.150
 this is after it's up to you to adjust a 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.150
 little bit all around the head 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.360
 you can do more or less 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.259
 take out your locks for more or less 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.830
 volume I believe finally I hope 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.830
 Oh that's good 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.470
 here we are determined is a 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.340
 little harder for me than in my 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.590
 bathroom now if you have 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.199
 very very long hair it's simple 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.020
 you make a very loose mat so 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.240
 to tell you a few crossings 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.400
 the rolled over it very loosely 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.500
 again and in the end it's very 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.940
 simple just get in last 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.680
 hair it will be much simpler 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.470
 for you as if you were wicking at 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.840
 wick with very long hair and 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.759
 last little trick if you adore 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.590
 the tapes but that are really too 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.250
 short to roll is good 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.130
 just made the front strands and 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:59.240
 behind I'm going to remove what I have 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:06:06.080
 done behind and behind so you 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:08.440
 pass the hair too short by 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.440
 above 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.070
 because suddenly I have a little mad effect 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.070
 band I place them
