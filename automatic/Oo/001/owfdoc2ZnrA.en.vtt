00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 The new director is confirmed to star 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.250
 trek arnold has a new movie and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.810
 many services of the world gamer 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.630
 they experience operating problems 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.929
 all and more in a new episode of this 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.929
 caps 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.720
 this week they apparently had 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.099
 computers with internet in a garden 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.630
 of children without since many services 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.880
 used by the gamers were 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.230
 supposedly looted or at least that 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.180
 It is what people actually say 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.500
 none of these services was hacked 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.779
 since there is no information compromised 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.090
 rather it was an attack of denial of 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.680
 services better known as dbs that what 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.420
 The only thing it does is prevent a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.879
 service in particular work with 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.290
 normal now because children because 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.640
 this situation is the only thing that they achieve 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.170
 In the end it is bothering 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.730
 user experience what 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.829
 generated that even the mega owner 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.300
 king.com will try to end the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.620
 problem since during the mentioned 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.260
 attack this one could not play 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.700
 quietly in your xbox yourselves 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.320
 they could see that this situation was seen 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.840
 reflected in several services such as 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.430
 access to playstation network xbox live or 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.230
 even on the servers of several 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.270
 games is why the last days 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.880
 they had not been able to play battlefield or 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.229

 was confirmed to mike colter for the role 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.710

 jones series that although so far 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.190
 will be exclusive of the streaming service 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.930
 netflix the character of luke cage has 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.670
 appeared on numerous occasions next to 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.110
 the angers at least in the comics what 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.700
 which suggests that this could happen 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.830
 from the series to the popular saga 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.570
 cinematographic plus scott derrickson 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.490

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.750
 marvel doctor swing from a teaser to 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.400
 through your twitter account about 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.800

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.820
 interpreted by benedict cumberbatch 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.790
 remember that the sway author will be 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.470
 released in November 2016 for another 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.000
 side and passing it from 6 more rumors come 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.800
 about the casting of the movie of his 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.300
 squad view where one of the new 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.250
 characters confirmed for the movie 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.780
 it is dead show that who could have 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.850
 seen in the saga of batman games 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.080
 who would interpret the paper would be no 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.970
 other than the legendary arnold 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.560
 schwarzenegger take into account that this 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.930
 information is not confirmed but by 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.400
 at least I fit with the profile and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.959
 ending with the movie news 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.910
 the director has been confirmed for 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.490
 third installment of star peru follow the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.650
 two previous deliveries were directed 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.270
 hey brands this did not want to participate in 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.250
 the third delivery and one step to the side 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.350
 to focus on star wars episode 7 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.330
 the new director is nothing less than 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.560
 justin lin whom we can remember for 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.690
 your experience with the previous ones 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.220
 deliveries of 'fast and furious' though 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.050
 I have my doubts about the director in 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.880
 As to whether you can actually deliver 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.620
 a faithful representation of star trek 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.660
 as the fans wait if there is something that 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.790
 definitely not lacking it will be much 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.450
 but a lot of action the third installment of 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.920
 star trek will arrive in July 2016 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.900
 indeed this is how it has been this week 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 pretty loose in terms of news and 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.660
 desaseo because it is ending the year 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.610
 everyone prepares for the next or 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.360
 maybe it's just not a week very 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.550
 entertaining 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.020
