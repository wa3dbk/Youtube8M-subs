00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 sony that you chose unfortunately is not 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.360
 It's done, but it does not come back because 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.269
 we only have six games missing good 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.509
 This is if we do not count the jazz fan 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.369
 already klebert can but is a tale of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.740
 way because the dream that has a 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.710
 ground with his face 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:30.510
 or is it a time here and there comes the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.450
 incredible excess inertia again 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.570
 friction there is no good to talk to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.140
 truth is more details ok the home 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.850
 attack does not work it kills camera and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.149
 does weird things 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 Okay, I just have the sonntag in communion. 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.879
 this generation 11 good stock 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.980
 is probably one of my attacks 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.480
 favorites because sony simply has 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.680
 by the fact that you can keep doing 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:04.409
 that it is and we are clear and bushing 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.500
 because that's what we're going to go to now 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.979
 tatin this here looks like it's going to be a 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.220
 immense disaster only one way left that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.920
 dream to move but that is without 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.869
 doubt a way to make interesting 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.070
 cutting the APAE in one way or 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.950
 other 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.430
 I received so far, we did not stay, it's just 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.250
 exclusively from the epa line and we already 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.710
 We are hungry here right at the beginning, I already 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.950
 I tasted but the collision of that platform 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.970
 there it's kind of terrible taking in 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.720
 consideration of one more adaptation of the 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.600
 jeans the niche cet setra sessions and what 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.180
 was a huge shit ju I did 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.909
 that on purpose but it 's sky sessions 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.439
 David, it's good they never made you feel 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.409
 in official matches 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.350
 they do not make sense now I'm 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.640
 I never just went that looks like it is made 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.880
 right title, no matter what 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.550
 Did you always do something 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.590
 thing remotely right and gave a 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.720
 impression that this here has no color purple 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.849
 infinite that had perceived more 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.400
 missing parts is that it seems that he had not 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.920
 infinite holes more 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:28.599
 in fact there are the honestly the most 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.319
 that this here is a bonbon disaster 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:36.880
 happen here to mine based more on 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.519
 stupid eleven in English stupid more 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.239
 based on speed and only sometimes 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.110
 two 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:47.739
 this is frankly more of an effect 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.780
 the phase seems to be adapted and you have 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.959
 an idea of ​​what is in front of you 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.310
 want to punch 32 rush hour in which 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.980
 and you 're going to keep going and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.310
 nothing has a hole and you die is good 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.109
 that kravitz was called because 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.470
 caused exactly the kind of thing I 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:12.690
 I'm doomed but I have one 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.639
 new question to ask because if a 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.639
 samsung that has a similar floor 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:21.160
 with him here and as such has to tighten 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.829
 to ons ó paulo roberto right 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.160
 kind of I 'm not sure if this 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:30.099
 how to navigate or not but the controls 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.959
 eyes in the sections of sergio leone or 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.480
 It's for you and faster if you 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.760
 push down then you want to know me 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.079
 I withdraw from my complaints that I 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.079
 had about the demise of skydrive 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:48.630
 and then the first phase had nothing know 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.640
 Also it would be great if you could the 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.980
 to ignore a good business there 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.940
 middle of the stage because if you could 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.380
 to ignore what that would do is seal 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.910
 things get much better 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.040
 graphic breads the leaves there came felipe 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:14.220
 received think the controls my future 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:19.850
 the sac sound to blame for by know 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.930
 there you give a sense that happened here 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.120
 I 'm not sure what happened. 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.270
 But I know it was absurd. 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 them with 2 populous and inaccurate 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.300
 somehow make it here 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.760
 less bad to play and I approve 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.680
 with this the choice of sports for the 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.590
 animations is very recent including 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.580
 only modern with the super penalty 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.950
 This happened before 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.950
 Well, to tell you the truth, I think 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.830
 I only god or superpipe great / good not 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.300
 super neckline plus running animation with 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.760
 the legs in 8 knot in the thing which is a 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.880
 thing in the soil to the titan 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:08.040
 both versions so I take back that I 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:11.040
 said one word true the sonic 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.669
 Early punishment is different from sonic 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.690
 modern serious actor this thorn has no 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:21.150
 reason to be there and is the sonic 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.240
 advance editing is different from sonic 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.580
 modern and therefore I continue to 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.870
 keeping what I had said 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.050
 previously 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.300
 This is incredibly difficult to see 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.440
 so it 's something else about the stock is 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.950
 that this 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.540
 makes you have more accurately still the 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.420
 movements 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.170
 so it 's was personality very 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.220
 Thank you for doing this to make you stay 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:52.530
 but consistent friend 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.870
 more consistent which is easier for me 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.930
 Did you mean without knocking? 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.930
 I wanted this, it was probably 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.170
 designed in such a way that the physics of 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.870
 water would be thirsty if you 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.550
 I was already in my pocket and you have 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.590
 This feeling of God does not 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.250
 I should have survived that 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.310
 I say that this game has cagen physics 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.750
 so it's my proof of this game here 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:25.410
 it's reminding me a lot of sonic colors 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.390
 takes the design and this I prove it enough 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.070
 I mean, have or forget that the dream is 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:34.380
 the lack of water ups a certain 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.040
 amount of automation there but of 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:42.540
 way or other 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.310
 This is probably the most 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.230
 nice I have had so far not 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.320
 tell if the fla that this was over 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:52.890
 nice than that no more at all 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.690
 these acts were here is also this stage 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.650
 I did not realize I want to know 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.250
 I think this is good 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:02.460
 Wait there is my impression or the 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:05.040
 problem I think this is personal 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.820
 What a wonderful thing we are. 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.590
 having the incredible problem of bloods 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.160
 they are slow 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.870
 I thought we had is if 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.760
 to get rid of the disc in 2012 is honestly 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.980
 I remembered that this was a problem for 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.240
 enough time for more details because you 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.900
 Look at this last golden phase here is a 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:31.320
 test zone 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:35.289
 and I expected or and is a test zone 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.860
 incredibly slow and it's I do not know if 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:43.509
 only this phase is another that is 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:49.560
 causing this but 16 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:52.600
 it's weird strange weird in commerce 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:57.460
 is definitely slower than the 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:01.440
 Again this is the one thing 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.440
 good this game promises
