something<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.050> well<00:00:34.050> you'll<00:00:34.350> find

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
something like that well you'll find

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.729 
something like that well you'll find
this<00:00:35.040> sign<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.960> table<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.440> which<00:00:37.620> if

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
this sign here this table here which if

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.690 
this sign here this table here which if
you<00:00:37.829> interact<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> nice

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
you interact with it you get a nice

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.030 
you interact with it you get a nice
picture<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> Charles<00:00:39.540> Lee<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.590> second<00:00:40.950> one

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
picture of Charles Lee the second one

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.319 
picture of Charles Lee the second one
which<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.219> actually<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.640> third<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> found

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
which is actually the third one I found

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.520 
which is actually the third one I found
but<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> probably<00:00:42.780> makes<00:00:42.989> sense<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.379> go<00:00:43.469> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
but it probably makes sense to go to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.229 
but it probably makes sense to go to
this<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:43.800> first<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.219> all<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> way<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
this one first is all the way to the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.889 
this one first is all the way to the
north<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.309> edge<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.420> river

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
north it's there on the edge of a river

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.319 
north it's there on the edge of a river
bank<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.309> head<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.640> there<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> guess

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
bank and if you head up there I guess

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.600 
bank and if you head up there I guess
this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> old<00:00:52.289> location<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> canyon

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
this is the old location of the canyon

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.689 
this is the old location of the canyon

marker<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> map<00:01:50.880> down<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
marker on the map down here on the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
marker on the map down here on the
bottom<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.979> don't<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.299> was

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
bottom right I don't know if that was

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.700 
bottom right I don't know if that was
there<00:01:54.600> before<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.079> don't<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.590> get

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
there before I don't know if you get

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.020 
there before I don't know if you get
this<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.040> finishing<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> sequence<00:01:56.759> i<00:01:56.850> don't

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
this for finishing the sequence i don't

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
this for finishing the sequence i don't
think<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.509> i<00:01:57.659> think<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.590> memory

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
think so i think it this is memory

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.330 
think so i think it this is memory
fragment<00:01:59.579> related<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.079> were<00:02:01.680> headed<00:02:01.950> off<00:02:02.070> my

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
fragment related so I were headed off my

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.399 
fragment related so I were headed off my
way<00:02:02.549> down<00:02:02.820> there<00:02:03.030> there<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.450> again<00:02:03.570> um

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
way down there there it is again um

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
way down there there it is again um
watch<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.579> camp<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
watch out for that camp just to the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.830 
watch out for that camp just to the
northwest<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.819> but<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:09.149> you'll<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.660> into

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
northwest of it but then you'll go into

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.880 
northwest of it but then you'll go into
a<00:02:09.869> cave<00:02:10.200> here<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.709> its<00:02:10.860> where<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
a cave here in its where if you

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.309 
a cave here in its where if you
finished<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.580> missions<00:02:13.360> it's<00:02:13.870> where<00:02:14.170> the

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
finished the missions it's where the

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.800 
finished the missions it's where the
last<00:02:14.560> mission<00:02:14.860> starts<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:16.420> obviously<00:02:16.690> it's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
last mission starts but obviously it's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.000 
last mission starts but obviously it's
marked<00:02:17.050> on<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.200> map<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.560> not<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.800> hard<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
marked on the map it's not that hard to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.280 
marked on the map it's not that hard to
get<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.340> their<00:02:19.090> head<00:02:19.360> down<00:02:19.390> here<00:02:19.840> through<00:02:20.050> here

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
get to their head down here through here

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.360 
get to their head down here through here
and<00:02:20.470> there's<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.740> little<00:02:20.860> thing<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.220> can

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and there's a little thing you can

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.980 
and there's a little thing you can
interact<00:02:21.700> with<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.540> plays<00:02:22.750> little

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
interact with and it plays little

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.760 
interact with and it plays little
cutscene<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:24.090> Connor<00:02:25.090> just<00:02:25.990> chillin<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.470> the

really<00:02:33.280> paying<00:02:33.459> attention<00:02:33.640> for<00:02:34.090> cutscenes<00:02:34.450> at

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
really paying attention for cutscenes at

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.240 
really paying attention for cutscenes at
the<00:02:34.630> beginning<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.050> DLC<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.830> might<00:02:36.070> be

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
the beginning of the DLC so it might be

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.000 
the beginning of the DLC so it might be
a<00:02:36.280> cutscene<00:02:36.820> from<00:02:37.030> earlier<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.709> will<00:02:38.709> end<00:02:38.890> up

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
a cutscene from earlier I will end up

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.309 
a cutscene from earlier I will end up
uploading<00:02:39.520> probably<00:02:39.850> all<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.510> missions<00:02:41.080> with

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
uploading probably all the missions with

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.990 
uploading probably all the missions with
full<00:02:41.650> cut<00:02:41.920> scenes<00:02:42.190> at<00:02:42.370> some<00:02:42.550> point<00:02:42.760> if<00:02:42.910> you

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
full cut scenes at some point if you

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.420 
full cut scenes at some point if you
want<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.239> watch<00:02:43.360> those<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.830> I'll<00:02:44.950> just<00:02:45.100> tear

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
want to watch those and I'll just tear

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
through the missions over there it is

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.009 
through the missions over there it is
there's<00:02:48.940> washington<00:02:49.180> looking<00:02:49.570> at<00:02:49.810> Connor
