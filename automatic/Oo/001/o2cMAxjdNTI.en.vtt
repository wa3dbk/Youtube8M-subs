00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.899
 good we present you the corpses of electronic data 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.899
 those are novelties that have been presented this year in 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:12.959
 in henán 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.179
 cases are rare quite recent today specifically famous present these two 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.189
 models that is a solution after lack of air 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.969
 and these pear trees have a revolutionary concept that would be 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.619
 it's good that Ferrari calls him as the father prince 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.870
 which is something like 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.390
 I will not pull the tournament 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.390
 then each one the pedals 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.260
 She carries a porqué voser 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 through bushehr ported 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.710
 and with this new application that gets first 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.780
 I think we can do is take and download them from the web page that 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.980
 seem 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.390
 and so 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.340
 based on that present we have lowered or automatically controls the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.210
 pedal 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.310
 they behave even in a different way 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.290
 we can take that pre-Inca tournament that footprint let's say sound finger 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.040
 i store it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.480
 inside the prison 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.290
 going to what rises above the air we obviously share the same 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.490
 characteristics as soon as you function 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.360
 like metal box swords equal 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.190
 and here we would find different types of the ilp we had then the 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.410
 sd mutation tape 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.520
 in this month dynamic with modulation effects of table tennis 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.640
 we even have a function to educate within him within the year 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.660
 wolf apart from the selector of different types of dollars we have 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.350
 the time of 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.680
 the fipa that would be sent petitions and in effect and then we have a small 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.130
 secret of three positions 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.790
 in which we can take different figures like porsche ag, that is, with 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.610
 tera tiptoes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.760
 in terms of the number of repetitions that 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.220
 in one 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.220
 town online 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140
 First 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.529
 number one 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.859
 after a round 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.559
 never 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.559
 ain a no no
