00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.069
 Tell us guys, how is our plan? 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.440
 I'm alexandre esteves and I have to 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 joão picin and do not reinsert the theory 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.440
 delay is a frame with any 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.849
 another channel is not only that, it is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.370
 natural that does not know that it acts 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.350
 good this picture is a picture only made 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.160
 only terrorism and even why not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 I have the theory 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.390
 although not only speaks well of his father 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.140
 To say that I think why 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 I like the old bitch puppy daughter 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.210
 with fire motherfucker and a subject has 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.899
 been very relevant lately in this 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.300
 white pici is the instant stop of the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.030
 This is a question between the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 interest and anami, and how it fits 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.010
 I get to speak immediately and nani 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.559
 type our rocket as well as old 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 in fact that the stop error in the term 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.850
 Immediate here for me to win alone. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.670
 because it made a video that actually 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.070
 in the meaning of the immediate term is 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.140
 Because to me it means something like 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.570
 vice-captain when in some kind 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.439
 The truth is not the immediate term means 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.900
 something like navigational officer as it is a 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.909
 term lay or lay a vice vice 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.140
 this would be the correct word 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.280
 to describe what immediate means 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 seen browser 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 Captain commander there you can not 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.640
 navigate browsing is an addiction 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.869
 browser is an assistant then it is in fact 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.939
 it will not be immediate because it is 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.400
 written there on the date book nelzow is from 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.439
 fight a fighter I do not know and lamy is from 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.409
 I wish it was a netapp 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.299
 thing and from now on it 's pure 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.710
 mia opinion if you find is night 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.689
 wrong, then it's just that in your opinion 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.930
 different does not have wrong that is not fact 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.960
 in logic it's just my opinion I think 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.720
 I think you should consider that the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.310
 immediate term on a lane would have a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.659
 meaning slightly different slightly 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.040
 distorted 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.619
 I'm going to kill this dog, I'm 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.329
 Seriously, I fucking better. 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.579
 You do not mind the fact sheet that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.170
 only because one of the blows is well 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.509
 different from the real world because 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.149
 commander do not capture in real life is 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.430
 among other things it has many other 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.409
 This is the essential focus of the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.709
 stop is what he knows how to sail is not 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.489
 He has to know how to navigate. 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.200
 mainly among some other 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.840
 things for a focus that has to do is 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.879
 know how to make sail sail stop then 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.829
 vice browser would almost like it not 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.459
 came so much since sailing almost everything 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.920
 that makes 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.549
 jaime teaching a surf floor is not 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.739
 essential to this dog's favor 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.540
 Swimming pool is not the focus of the stop 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.280
 Do not you fucking sail she can be? 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.019
 his alone in the village landmarks pine thing 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.389
 will not have a new one in a pool 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.980
 navigate only part of the things for 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.230
 this I think the plans adapted 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.879
 to the world will step a little different 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.260
 Can you think of how I feel? 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.340
 talking maybe I think there's a 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.260
 logic 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.060
 for example when a ship in real life 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.849
 is going through a storm a good 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.340
 so the guy comes cheerleading is for sale 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.370
 and he sees everything good from the whole ball does not capture 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.079
 the captain arrives in humans all over 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.359
 a pizza when it landed in the storm 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:04.120
 who's boss children traveling throughout 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.120
 aircraft then means km to captain 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.519
 capital 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.919
 As I said a floor is very different from 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.750
 You've actually seen one exist 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.849
 commander is a captain who leads a 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.549
 ship and do not know how to navigate 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.799
 because the captain does not know how to navigate 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.419
 I talked about navigating a major focus of 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.290
 commander of the ship 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.729
 in the end does not mean that he is the captain 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.639
 understood the terms are adapted to the 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.440
 physical world so I think or feel in 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.319
 my opinion in a world where the captain 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.049
 navigate and have many freedoms besides 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.560
 but that is the essence of leaving the 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.889
 sea 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.349
 the immediate theme would be more valid as 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.750
 A vice captain of yours I think you have 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.419
 logic since the immediate silves 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.790
 navigator where a captain almost of time 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.439
 make browsing in an unusual a pool 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.389
 again a captain does not even need to know 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.609
 navigating the immediate topic would be more 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.889
 A deputy captain understood I think that if 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.409
 fits better time captain in all 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.939
 do browse the guy who browses on hd no 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.980
 it would be like an addiction not everything 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:07.500
 vice captain in the case of pis and vice 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.049
 the vice all in the name would be the gold is 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.690
 because he also discussed an old man there 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.549
 right image or not enough sandy feet 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.430
 of treasure does that damn 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.340
 blood does not reach my feet today I 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.220
 the image and I do not know who that is then 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.310
 the truth is the fact that my immediate 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.010
 used it's just a good stop fighter 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.479
 I think it's logical to say that he used 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.550
 so it is not totally 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.919
 got it wrong by what I'm saying is 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.300
 so I 'm exposing that Peter spoke 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.560
 so open I'm just saying that 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.510
 for you to think about it 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.580
 'm just saying think about it because all 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.440
 opinion opinion on this I think 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.260
 There's a logic to this. I think so. 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.840
 to say that the immediate master is not like this 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.669
 totally rabelais that fact is up to 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.590
 name is lower because at the end of 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.660
 what really matters is the soul of the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.060
 stop is the soul of the business type what 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.340
 is discussing interrupted time 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.380
 immediate that with the subject of four pounds 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.570
 and is captain but does not have to have much 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.669
 tunnel at the end that sends the new guinea 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.340
 navigating the blood, then cooking 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.820
 inner funds knows this discussion 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.910
 It's all here, it's what 's in the moment. 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.340
 so it's on a Czech floor and I was afraid 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.840
 so I'm just saying that the summary of 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.490
 video I 'm saying I think 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.130
 you consider that the term 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.080
 has a different meaning 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.000
 It's hard as a captain. 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.770
 has a meaning made on a floor because 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.020
 the captain in real life almost everything that 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.090
 do is navigate right beyond releasing all 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.130
 world to navigate a junk amp knows 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.020
 the rapporteur understood then I think 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.820
 this is my opinion then 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.500
 you liked and they were female 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.479
 If you liked and I talked down here 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.220

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.720

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.220
 to inspire 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.470
 I think if you like a 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.240
 floor without obligation of sight I found 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.340
 very interesting this initial business 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.300
 the comments that those he makes 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.220
 so here it is in the description of the video 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.080
 canal bathroom channel flags give a 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.270
 look and along with it is also 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.820
 improve you have seen several pages 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.490
 facebook is supporting me kind nor 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.740
 and if you saw gt here because there are people 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.490
 closed the video anti comments and donkey 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.350

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.500
 so you comment on the donkey when you see yourself 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.500
 the end is worth it
