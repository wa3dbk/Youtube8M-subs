00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.210
 Cheap points between Celtic and real 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.360
 society on the twenty-first day 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.419
 of the league bbva draw one in a 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.390
 party with two very different parts in 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.070
 the first picture celtine got 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.539
 get ahead on the scoreboard even though the 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.539
 first great opportunity of the match 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 the philippe montanier team had it 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.869
 with this shot by mexican carlos 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.949
 Sail with the left leg a ball 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:36.100
 that ends up catching javi varas stretched 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.960
 more the Celtic found more spaces and 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.230
 had more arrivals as we said to the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.680
 rival goal this is an action of 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.680
 august fernandez 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.330
 the expulsion in the second period of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.580
 Argentine player who had in the minute 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.470
 27 this opportunity to put the 1 to 0 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.350
 good intervention of the Chilean claudio 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.359
 Bravo 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.550
 much mobility as we said in the 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 celtine attack 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.340
 in a match that also 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.320
 injured and therefore another setback 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.940
 for paco herrera and abastero 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.160
 until I enter the second half 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.460
 he had time in the first period of 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.460
 do 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.289
 we're going to see it in the repeat one 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.789
 Wonderful delivery krohn dehli for the 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:31.240
 1 to 0 in the 32nd minute combination of 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.749
 Ghanaian footballer with loose blades 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.569
 the ball with the spectacular heel and 

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:40.240
 that well defines the exjugador of the brandy 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.709
 to score his first goal as a celtina 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.020
 the marker was placed ahead of the 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.730
 team that was more coming and that 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.180
 I was trying more 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.660
 there we saw a blow that James received 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.940
 aspas and that no longer allowed him to enter 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.380
 party in the second period finished the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.520
 first half yes 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.540
 but he could not 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.179
 In the second half 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.090
 the Celtic controlled the party 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.269
 and he was looking for the second goal that he gave 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.170
 tranquility blades as we said 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.219
 continued on the pitch this 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 is an action in which mario bermejo 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:24.390
 try to find the Korean park and see 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.530
 the shot 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.530
 41 minute 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.040
 very clear opportunity for the Danish and 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.990
 excellent intervention by claudio bravo 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.400
 how do you get that ball over the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:42.860
 striker the Chilean goalkeeper concluded the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.470
 first period and blades as we said 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.070
 I would leave the field and I would not go back to 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.280
 enter and this is the important play of 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.670
 the second beta 4 minute a hand of 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.670
 august fernandez 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.950
 which is the second yellow card 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.950
 and therefore the red here we see it 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.490
 as the party referee the lord 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.490
 for rosemary he understands 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.980
 that involuntary hand of the football player 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.130
 Argentinian 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.870
 it stayed with well 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.870
 the Celtic but still 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.599
 the Korean park had the opportunity to 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.099
 put the 2 to 0 on the scoreboard in this 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.590
 Act of fact was one of the few that 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.680
 had the team of paco herrera entered 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.000
 for knicks Croatian footballer debuted 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.000
 with the t-shirt celtina 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.480
 and it did not take too long 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.329
 the real society to score the goal of 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.790
 tie did elustondo the central in 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.790
 the 14th minute to put the 1 to 1 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.550
 and in this way match the game only 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.470
 ten minutes after the expulsion of 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.950
 august fernandez is fantastic there in 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.530
 the anticipation and as a header 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.300
 elustondo to mark the one to one you will be 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.210
 he came over 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.090
 to the Celtic an absolute and total siege by 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.800
 part of philippe men 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.320
 montanier made the logical use of being 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.530
 with numerical superiority and see the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.950
 ball to the stick that markel bergara sent 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.830
 the referee also kicked paco herrera 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.960
 of the match 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.960
 expelled the Celtic technician 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.960
 and the real society until the last 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.699
 sigh of the encounter looking for a goal 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.070
 the victory that finally did not come 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.040
 endured well 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.340
 the Celtic in a match that ended in 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.650
 tables with distribution of points and with two 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.110
 very different parts at the end in vigo 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.110
 Celtic 1 real society 1
