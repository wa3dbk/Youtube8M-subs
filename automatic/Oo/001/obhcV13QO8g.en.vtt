00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 very good to all guys girls that such 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.440
 how are you malagasy today and well 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.870
 I bring the video that I told you that I was going to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.259
 leave on the channel this video of how 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.969
 install the 32 720 plus and well no 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.910
 I have the bed for the camera over here 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.539
 because I keep hitting the laptop and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.949
 good 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.230
 you see here I do not know if you will see it well 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.240
 here we have here and here the forms 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.200
 of installing good from the inclusions that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.560
 you come is still here 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.650
 the way it comes to install 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.940
 the helmets or plugged into the computer but 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.100
 what's up there is a little niggle 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.040
 no state form any of these two 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.480
 forms serve at least with my 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.550
 portable and with a lot of laptops 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.960
 that with one is that people have tried 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.239
 so what is the problem and with the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.070
 solution when plugging it in this way 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.740
 it's worth being here 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.320
 well I think so 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.880
 when plugging in this way the speaker does not 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.610
 he recognizes it and we are no 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.010
 controller is valid and in this way if not 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.430
 you have optical cable is useless 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.380
 because good and you will see what is useful but not 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.850
 if not with the optical cable it's worth 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.150
 at least I care if you do not have 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.420
 then serves no good because 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.100
 this I have it here now 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.250
 we have a small problem because I have 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.290
 helmets plugged into the computer but 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.110
 Well the first thing is to have the newts 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.800
 720 okay I take them off for a moment and the 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.800
 I go through the camera 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.840
 those helmets 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.049
 and the second thing is to plug this in here 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 it's worth it to control audio from 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.829
 games and micro 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.549
 and it 's good to have this cable is well 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.549
 plugged in to go to the block 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.890
 the switchboard now I play this because 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.310
 over here we have this we have the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.310
 switchboard 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.470
 this over here 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:24.510
 is the switchboard of the tiger nuts 22 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.510
 months as you see they work perfectly 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.290
 we have here this volume and such and such 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.840
 Now that is the key step as you see 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.920
 here are the two cable entries 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.740
 optical and the usb but the cable 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.350
 optical as I told you my laptop does not 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.060
 It has input for the optical cable as well 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.060
 we have to do this 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.409
 we plug in the usb cable 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.750
 and we tested on our laptop 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.500
 our pc 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.280
 in different ports until we 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.560
 exit the installer for any 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.870
 device does not leave the installer well 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.300
 what good are we going to see for the moment 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.459
 I'm going to move to just one screen and I'm going to 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.530
 show where it comes out and so you can see 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.190
 it's true the tutorial so good 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.860
 until now 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.940
 good cholas well we are back that 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.700
 not a thousandth of a second has passed 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.069
 but we are here and good what was going to 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.640
 to say it goes out for you here it's worth 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.900
 we would see here below and xl to regulate the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.050
 audio right here I have these but we 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.690
 I would leave 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.700
 a kind of how to depend iph or of 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.360
 hard disk or a kind xbox rather 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.960
 with a little wheel turning at least 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.080
 windows 7 and it would put like that installing 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.750
 search or looking for driver we have to 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.340
 unplug the usb and plug it up 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.410
 that there are not four controllers 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.120
 worth one of the 32 usb device and 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.400
 another part I do not remember exactly 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.590
 what was it but we have to leave four 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.750
 controllers or three vouchers three like 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.510
 little then to know to install 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.350
 come here where are the speakers 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.260
 you see us put usb speaker we click 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.150
 right recording devices or of 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.340
 it does not matter 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.440
 and if we did not have anything plugged in 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.000
 we have it completely alone 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.190
 without anything without plugging the drawer and nothing 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.650
 I would leave only this here 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.039
 in my case reality high speakers 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.870
 definition audio but what happens face one 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.470
 once installed this does not come out speakers 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.380
 usb device and I have it we put it 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.440
 as default it's right click and 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.509
 we set it as the default and then 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.729
 we are going to record and we will leave this is 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.280
 that as I'm talking about, the 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.330
 bar around here and we have the microphone 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.090
 of the real 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.240
 good as what is the card 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.919
 sound not what the speakers are and 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.600
 we have here the rest the mixture 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.280
 outside or input which is where 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.740
 was one of the other modes of 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.570
 plug in the computer and here we have 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.720
 our our microphones 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.180
 Strict USB audio devices worth 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.639
 directly again do the same 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.110
 previous step we enabled it and what 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.849
 we set as default and that's it 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.540
 he has no more science simply 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.450
 plug it in 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.800
 because it did not come to me personally 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.300
 to the first I solid the third or 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.490
 fourth time I tried so the trick 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.140
 is to try several times until the 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.200
 own computer recognizes you and 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:41.020
 tristana on the website does not indicate anything 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.370
 how to install it I repeat nothing and the 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.010
 instructions you see that as I told you 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.720
 little indicates so this is the only 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:52.620
 way if you do not have a laptop with 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.830
 against the optical cable is it 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.920
 only way that the laptop and eye does not 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.710
 is in all but at least in some 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.530
 that gold recognizes it then 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.409
 Once this is done I am going to put 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.369
 here 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.369
 so you can see 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.360
 this hard drive let's see how it continues 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.650
 my little things around here are things of 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.650
 age sees you a little now we have this 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:34.630
 it will also make the repression post 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.630
 you see 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:41.890
 at the same time that the music was playing 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.560
 I was here on USB audio devices 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.350
 it looked like it sounded you looked here in the 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.510
 bar you could see the sound and knew that 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.140
 was reproducing the sound in the 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.700
 newts sounds good is speaking is 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.340
 listen well as long as it's worth 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.420
 they got there a little bit there you hear 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:04.020
 better one is worth 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.460
 56 centimeters of what is the mouth and 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.050
 as you see here again again I was 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.160
 listen to me talk listen here is 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:14.740
 the reproduction we go to the last test 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.740
 ok but look here 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.800
 perfect so good that's been the 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:28.010
 Today's video I hope you liked it 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:31.960
 that you do not vote I like favorites and good 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.960
 see you in the next goodbye
