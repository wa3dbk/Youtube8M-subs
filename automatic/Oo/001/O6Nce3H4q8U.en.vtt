00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
hugely iconic and I just think that

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.360 
hugely iconic and I just think that
would<00:00:42.360> work<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.690> there<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.050> iconic<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
would work out there was iconic but it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.940 
would work out there was iconic but it
was<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.300> great<00:00:45.930> bit<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.379> control<00:00:46.680> but

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
was it was a great bit of control but

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.459 
was it was a great bit of control but
it's<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> bit<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.640> control<00:00:48.079> that's<00:00:49.079> what<00:00:49.200> sum

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
it's a bit of control that's what sum

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
it's a bit of control that's what sum
them<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.280> know<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.090> said<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.570> halftime

against Leicester that hat-trick

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.599 
against Leicester that hat-trick
the<00:00:58.109> where<00:00:58.289> he<00:00:58.379> brought<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.710> down<00:00:58.890> he<00:00:59.160> did<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the where he brought it down he did that

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
the where he brought it down he did that
then<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.629> finished<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> off<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.260> that

then and then finished it off with that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.170 
then and then finished it off with that
phenomenal<00:01:02.280> goal<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:02.820> goal<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
phenomenal goal that one goal of the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
phenomenal goal that one goal of the
mantle<00:01:03.510> goal<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> season<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.470> was

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
mantle goal of the season I think it was

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.280 
mantle goal of the season I think it was
and<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.689> maybe<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.229> like

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and you know I think that maybe is like

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
and you know I think that maybe is like
most<00:01:07.619> iconic<00:01:07.920> moment<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.400> understand<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
most iconic moment I understand that the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.580 
most iconic moment I understand that the
goal<00:01:09.390> against<00:01:09.630> New<00:01:09.780> Castle's<00:01:10.229> hard<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
goal against New Castle's hard to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.440 
goal against New Castle's hard to
convert<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> statue<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:12.150> none<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.390> us

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
convert into a statue because none of us

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.899 
convert into a statue because none of us
who<00:01:12.570> want<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.049> Bobby's<00:01:13.380> ass<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
who want because Bobby's ass as the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.219 
who want because Bobby's ass as the
Emirates<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> can't<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:15.990> him<00:01:16.170> in

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
Emirates you know you can't have him in

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.660 
Emirates you know you can't have him in
there<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.530> without<00:01:16.799> him<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> doesn't<00:01:17.310> look<00:01:17.520> as

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there and without him it doesn't look as

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.219 
there and without him it doesn't look as
good<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.110> know

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
good but I just think that you know

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.330 
good but I just think that you know
there<00:01:19.770> could<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.890> been<00:01:19.979> something<00:01:20.189> more

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
there could have been something more

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
there could have been something more
iconic<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:20.729> look<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.720> saying<00:01:21.930> someone<00:01:22.290> just

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
iconic but look as I saying someone just

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.100 
iconic but look as I saying someone just
now<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.159> about<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.030> specifics<00:01:24.630> it's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
now it's not about the specifics it's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.020 
now it's not about the specifics it's
about<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.830> history<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.430> about<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
about the history it's about what it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.850 
about the history it's about what it
actually<00:01:27.210> represents<00:01:27.479> he's<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> legend<00:01:28.740> of

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.000 
stick my neck out and say today's one's
better<00:02:23.970> because<00:02:24.780> today's<00:02:25.410> one<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.800> was<00:02:25.980> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
better because today's one it was the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.920 
better because today's one it was the
speed<00:02:26.550> at<00:02:26.820> which<00:02:26.850> they<00:02:27.180> did<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.480> all<00:02:27.720> right

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
speed at which they did it all right

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.450 
speed at which they did it all right
well<00:02:28.140> if<00:02:28.410> you're<00:02:28.650> gonna<00:02:28.770> do<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.340> gonna

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
well if you're gonna do that I'm gonna

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.090 
well if you're gonna do that I'm gonna
I'm<00:02:30.150> gonna<00:02:30.360> argue<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.810> go<00:02:31.530> with<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.800> I'm<00:02:31.980> gonna

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
I'm gonna argue I go with you I'm gonna

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.070 
I'm gonna argue I go with you I'm gonna
go<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.550> will<00:02:32.910> guess<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.330> other<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:33.840> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
go I will guess the other one because it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.140 
go I will guess the other one because it
was<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.590> them<00:02:35.130> four<00:02:35.430> touches<00:02:35.850> all<00:02:36.000> took

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
was just like them four touches all took

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.600 
was just like them four touches all took
place<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> space<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.680> two<00:02:38.070> seconds

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
place in like the space of two seconds

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.820 
place in like the space of two seconds
it<00:02:38.700> was<00:02:38.820> ridiculous<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.660> today's<00:02:40.650> was

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
it was ridiculous and today's was

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.040 
it was ridiculous and today's was
amazing<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.370> my<00:02:42.090> guess<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.930> all

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
amazing but I my guess is that that all

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.630 
amazing but I my guess is that that all
would<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.230> slightly<00:02:43.680> better<00:02:43.830> but<00:02:44.280> who<00:02:44.370> cares

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
would be slightly better but who cares

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.420 
would be slightly better but who cares
we<00:02:45.300> arguing<00:02:45.810> about<00:02:45.900> which<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:47.160> touch

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
phenomenal team goal is better so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.430 
phenomenal team goal is better so
