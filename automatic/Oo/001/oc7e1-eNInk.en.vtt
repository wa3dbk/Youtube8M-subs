00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.230
 well we are already inside the store 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.940
 we are inside the colonial and we are 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.589
 about to buy a battery but they 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.650
 I will put a brake before there is a brake 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.570
 because he makes a difficult decision that 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.210
 if we are going to buy an acoustic drum 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.189
 or an electronic always ask me 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.670
 that we are going to define that question of a 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.130
 once for all 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.099
 the answer is the one they can touch the most 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.480
 time in the house that's the answer if 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.400
 you in your house are going to buy this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.250
 acoustic battery and can not make noise 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.570
 but 15 minutes 10 minutes if it turns out 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.739
 who have had the electronics and who do not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.120
 they make noise in love is in a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.210
 family and this whole thing and they can 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.180
 rehearse two hours then fantastic 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.280
 obviously the optimum for me would be 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.989
 have an acoustic that's a question 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.820
 that they do to me all the time that's a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.040
 question already different that I should buy 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.629
 will not buy is not the answer 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.820
 the question of what is best to have 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.949
 an acoustic or an electronic one seems 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.989
 which are more optimal to start with 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.339
 acoustic because because I've noticed 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.409
 with students who start with a 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.030
 electronic that after time later 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.180
 or they will soon have to adjust 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.770
 little bit to acoustics because to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.210
 hit a saucer a saucer by 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.130
 example has many colors stick 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.140
 here we beat her she is going to have many 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.790
 different things how one behaves 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.619
 drum if we hit a patch hard 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.510
 It is very different if we hit it well 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.130
 soft or if we hit the edge of the 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.869
 drum that kind of things are not going to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.970
 happen in an electronic battery but 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.430
 What if they could not touch it anyway? 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.630
 principle but ten minutes go with 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.390
 the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.890
 that is the answer now late or 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.770
 early also the drummer that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.450
 begins with an acoustic one is passed to a 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.490
 electronics will also have to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.380
 adjust a little bit the adjustment is a 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 bit harder is longer for 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 who has not played an acoustic and started 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.069
 for an electronics but for now that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.130
 is the answer is the battery that can 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.869
 play more time for me as a teacher what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.179
 more important is that they can touch 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.090
 battery for a long time this is like 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.090
 to be a pilot is to have flight hours
