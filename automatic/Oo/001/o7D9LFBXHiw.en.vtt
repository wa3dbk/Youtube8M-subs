 rocky is fine the legend that you 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.699
 prepare will be the one in the play this store 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.040
 was used to direct missiles 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.350
 when the ps2 came out 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.450
 its processor was classified as super 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.700
 computer and for this reason had a few 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.220
 how many problems are and since the law 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.680
 Japanese did not allow export this type 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.750
 of processors because they could be used 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.390
 by people of the third world to be able 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.729
 perform large mathematical calculations and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.790
 implement them in military weaponry as 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.190
 missiles the export law changed what 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.050
 that made the ps2 could be sold 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.820
 in the rest of the world 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.220
 Saddam Hussein imported large 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.070
 amounts of videoconsoles of this type 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.410
 for military purposes what 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.200
 really interested him saddam was not the 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.450
 console processor but the coltan 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.759
 a mineral nicknamed gray gold and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.430
 which will only be in some areas of the 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.850
 Sub - Saharan Africa even today 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.950
 australia is the main supplier the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.890
 80% of the world's reserves are in 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.990
 the ancient zaire for this reason they said 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.110
 who are and lost money with the console 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.289
 when he started selling it, well that was 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.569
 my legend ok now the one that although the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.760
 Following is so man 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.640
 yes 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.310
 and well my legend is about young 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.810
 boys arg and ankles most 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.239
 the games that have gone down in history 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.920
 they have done it thanks to their graphics to their 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.500
 fun or to the creation of a concept 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.489
 something revolutionary never seen but 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.890
 this is not the case 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.930
 the 01 will always be remembered by 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.870
 show the dubious honor of being the game 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.819
 but translated from all time this one 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.739
 side scrolling matamarcianos was 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.599
 developed by every plan and launched at 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.500
 Japanese market in the form of a machine 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.420
 of the year 1989 in the country of 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.579
 rising sun would harvest a relative 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.620
 success enough to be 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.230
 decided to port to turbografx without denying 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.299
 the ibex and launch it in europe 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.940
 well that was all my time sell ok now 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.940
 what's still good now the one that follows is 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.150
 But what the hell is wrong with you, Miguel, do not tell me 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.819
 you're going to believe but I think I just 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.970
 access the channel of the devil come all 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.970
 to 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.540
 but good miguel imagine that already 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.600
 you told your legend ok now follow angel 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:47.400
 clear angel list that yes is legend is 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.190
 about the hotel 626 decide if this is a 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.740
 Very scary game remembers accident 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.650
 with clock tower where we are 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.380
 totally alone in this hotel in the dark 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.200
 and we see strange menacing figures in 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.180
 the darkness our only ally is a 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.370
 digital camera with which we will have 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.340
 scare off the cuckoos before we 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.830
 kill very terrifying beings 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.560
 ghostly psychopaths of truth 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.890
 fire is terrific game in the dark 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.010
 alone in the night safe more than a scare 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.770
 I brought you good that was my legend and 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.920
 multidimensional forgiveness 17 scared 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.990
 the images good apparently I have 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.230
 the last legend and it will be the legend of 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.600
 the shadow people of super mario galaxy in 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.790
 super mario galaxy when you observe the 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.370
 edge of the universe you can see shadows 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.220
 waiting mysteriously and observing 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.590
 action is certainly a scary clip 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.139
 but what the hell did I find another legend 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.110

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.000
 wifi is dead if one stops 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.889
 determined time against a part 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.410
 particular in the game luigi's mansion 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.139
 The shadow of Luigi's body is reflected 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.150
 hung is luigi a more ghost in that 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:03.169
