00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.019
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.179
 new video of me i am here im 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.660
 studio with an attractive boy 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.830
 model and I want you today the three 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.080
 most common beginner mistakes 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.439
 explain something in studio photography 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.930
 And that's about us 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.210
 want to work with lightning and lightning 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.130
 that our wild only from the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.840
 to be flashed 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 that means the ambient light will not be 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.430
 play and there is hoping that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 made mistakes that just not for it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.399
 At the beginning, a black is taken care of 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.219
 to have a basic picture 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.270
 that is important in that we 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.710
 really all ambient light 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.190
 hide and then we can safely 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.230
 that's really the look of that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.510
 incidence of light really exclusively from 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 will be determined and therefore go 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.469
 Let's go and have a look 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.129
 first that we have a black picture 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.190
 to get 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 I am here now on iso 100 because like 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.010
 I want to be as dark as possible 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.420
 so I turn the iso so far 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.340
 down as it possible on my camera 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.830
 is that the iso 100 with me and go 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.509
 now just here on aperture 8 and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.630
 Just take a test photo and see 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.490
 I have a bit of brightness there 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.130
 in the picture that's just because of me 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.950
 that I work with video light here 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 and the young lady also directly 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.610
 stands in front of it 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.509
 so far I have here at aperture 8 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:37.170
 still brightness on my model 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.909
 with you when you are normal in the studio 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.290
 works without video light you will 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.079
 certainly already black picture I have 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.220
 just go here on aperture 16 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.540
 to be sure that it really is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.399
 have a black picture and behold 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.100
 Now we really have one 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.649
 very nice black photo if we 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.560
 now the radio trigger on the camera 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:01.290
 set and photograph with flash 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.299
 it will work then we can 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.640
 be sure that our picture really 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.750
 was reported exclusively by lightning 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.750
 and not from the ambient light 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.960
 we come even to point number 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.070
 two of the most common mistakes because of what i do 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.110
 not mentioned yet 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.250
 Exposure time and why do I have the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.630
 not mentioned because the exposure time 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.910
 actually does not matter at all 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.280
 and that is also a common mistake 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.440
 many believe in the time of exposure 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.090
 the brightness of the picture in the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.050
 to influence studio photography 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.820
 but that does not work because the 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.760
 Brightness is just from the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.170
 Lightning affects that means when I'm in 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.940
 studio photography brightness 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.010
 then I want to change that 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.020
 on the one hand, of course, too 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.560
 the aperture and the iso but first 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.240
 line not the lightning power and that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 means the exposure time plays as long 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.510
 no role as long as I still have one 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.190
 have black basic picture if I have 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.690
 Of course the exposure time is 30 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.790
 seconds set and a bright basic picture 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 Of course, the rest also helps me 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.810
 not so long as I'm a black one 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.330
 basic picture is the exposure time 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.700
 only times completely irrelevant and the 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.470
 motion blur et cetera is concerned 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.330
 plays the exposure time at all 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.140
 no role because lightning so short 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.320
 burning times have partially catch 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.660
 most flashes at 800,000 seconds 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.540
 but many mushrooms also flash at one 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.850
 10,000 or 15,000 seconds so that there 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.290
 really every movement is frozen 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.850
 and that absolutely no role more 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.730
 I'm playing here now 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.180
 Compare a picture with a 30 10 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.180
 second 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.750
 and as we can see, this has become the predecessor 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.980
 picture is not a little brighter and 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.870
 not a bit different so we have here 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.900
 really an identical picture though we are 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.050
 now a thirtieth instead of 125 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.519
 have illuminated and really have stopped 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.550
 found that there is no 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.390
 role plays if not point number 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.980
 three would be 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.200
 and that comes now point number 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.910
 three is the same again 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.180
 exposure time and that is it 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.920
 now at the lightning synchronous time each 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.989
 every camera has one from the manufacturer 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.810
 specified lightning synchronous time is the 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.430
 camera dependent but also from the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.730
 triggering method i have to go here 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.340
 for example my pentax k-5 and a jong 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.430
 mu triggers and here is my lightning 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.280
 synchronous time at 125 resp 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.930
 some also report 960 but me 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.470
 I have to say that I show you now 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:33.120
 same time at 160 I make time briefly 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.389
 photo at 160 we are right if you 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.570
 in comparison already looks one 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.870
 Dimming in the picture and that is that the 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.039
 closure priority 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:50.250
 the shorter the exposure time becomes 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.840
 the less the sensor is free 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.000
 or there are more than one 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.949
 there is no exposure time 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.800
 moment more where the sensor completely free 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.440
 lies that is a slot curtain or 1 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.050
 a kind of folding mechanism and at 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.639
 It is a very short closure time 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.400
 only a narrow slit on the 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.560
 sensor passes and the sensor is 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.090
 all the time at any one 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.490
 Covered and what we then 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.590
 Shutdown is in the principle of 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.150
 Encryption of the already in the picture too 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.770
 see is that means during the 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.660
 Lightning triggers is easy on this 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.620
 already put the shutter curtain 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.139
 again above the sensor and 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.510
 accordingly gets at this point 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.340
 just the picture less or no 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.570
 light off that is even shorter 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.400
 We really have exposure times 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.169
 a thick black two in it can 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.050
 I do not show you here now 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.449
 because the camera or the lightning trigger 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.770
 then not at all triggers in the 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.870
 moment where I now with 200 or 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.960
 That would be enough 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.259
 no longer trigger on more 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:54.570
 yes these were the three most common mistakes 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:57.180
 and try to avoid them 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.320
 then you too will be in the 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.620
 studio photography will make you great 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.580
 succeed in pictures and post likes times and 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.740
 in the comments 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.060
 as i should call the young lady me 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.250
 I have no name at the moment 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.000
 for this young lady goes on mine 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.710
 Facebook site 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.090
 subscribe to my youtube channel and me 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.920
 now falls just not a I wish 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.100
 Have a nice day and much 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.100
 fun 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.320
 what do you think 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.320
 you could 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.320
 hey
