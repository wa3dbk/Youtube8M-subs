I don't want to mess about with weighing
and<00:00:23.130> measuring<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> we've<00:00:45.989> already<00:00:46.260> decided

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and measuring so we've already decided

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.250 
and measuring so we've already decided
and<00:00:47.160> said<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:48.149> goal<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.719> lose

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
weight to tone up shape up or get more

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.110 
weight to tone up shape up or get more
ribs<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.800> fact<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> gain<00:00:53.489> weight<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
ribs are in fact to gain weight and to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
ribs are in fact to gain weight and to
get<00:00:54.270> more<00:00:54.300> mass<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.989> build<00:00:55.230> muscle<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
get more mass and build muscle then you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.910 
get more mass and build muscle then you
should<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.210> both<00:00:57.480> cases<00:00:57.870> eating<00:00:58.410> five<00:00:58.710> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
said that the key was that in order to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
said that the key was that in order to
keep<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> simple<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.689> gain<00:01:12.990> weight<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.380> wanted

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
then remains is for us to work out

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.460 
then remains is for us to work out
exactly<00:01:21.000> what<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.200> need

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
exactly what it is that we need

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.649 
exactly what it is that we need
somewhere<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> middle<00:01:23.970> or<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
somewhere in the middle or what is the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.020 
somewhere in the middle or what is the
correct<00:01:24.869> portion<00:01:25.350> size<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.369> basically<00:01:26.759> gauge

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
correct portion size to basically gauge

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819 
correct portion size to basically gauge
whether<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.960> down<00:01:28.140> from<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
whether to go up and down from to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.429 
whether to go up and down from to
achieve<00:01:29.100> each<00:01:29.280> individual<00:01:30.000> goal<00:01:30.290> now<00:01:31.290> I've

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
achieve each individual goal now I've

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.920 
achieve each individual goal now I've
got<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> guy<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.100> we<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.549> use<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.420> just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
got a guy that we can use to do just

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.620 
got a guy that we can use to do just
that<00:01:34.049> now<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.009> by<00:01:35.340> no<00:01:35.790> means<00:01:35.820> dip<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> if

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that now this is by no means dip it if

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.260 
that now this is by no means dip it if
it's<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.439> scientific<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.640> technical

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's not scientific not technical

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.080 
it's not scientific not technical
doesn't<00:01:40.140> involve<00:01:40.439> way<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.009> measuring<00:01:41.790> or

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
doesn't involve way in measuring or

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
doesn't involve way in measuring or
counting<00:01:43.049> calories<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.560> anything<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
counting calories or anything like that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.490 
counting calories or anything like that
what<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.299> basically<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.049> we'll<00:01:46.290> put

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
what it will basically do is we'll put

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.830 
what it will basically do is we'll put
you<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> around<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.670> ballpark<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
you in and around the right ballpark to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.139 
you in and around the right ballpark to
know<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.439> he<00:01:49.590> should<00:01:49.799> roughly<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.399> eating<00:01:50.790> in

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
