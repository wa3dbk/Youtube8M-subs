00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.460
 of this channel we are in a box sing of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.139
 galaxy is 7 and we have a little 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.599
 different format let's see how 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 it turns out this way then we're going to 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.449
 start to uncover what and how you see here what 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.850
 we have galaxy is 7 is one of the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.130
 devices that you have asked me and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.410
 over here we have it ready in the channel 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.840
 let's start to take all this 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.410
 plastic that brings here in the part of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 back and it's a design obviously very 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.270
 similar to 5 but with one more screen 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.969
 big over here we have more plastics and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.680
 finally the plastic that brings the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.440
 screen let's see if we can 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.399
 remove it in a simple way here after your 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.430
 perfect tab ready then here what 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.550
 we have galaxy is 7 is a very design 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.350
 pretty slim obviously unibody not 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.120
 you can remove the lid if you do not 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.340
 you knew around here we have more plastics 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.070
 still 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.040
 everything around here and here we still have 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.050
 another then I told you it's a body 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.910
 unibody you can not remove the lid 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.770
 but what can be done is 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.220
 expand your memory with microsd cards 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.930
 something that is very much appreciated then 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.119
 it's a very thin design we're going to 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.970
 turn it on and while it goes on 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.540
 let's see what else the box brings what 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.760
 we already have it removed and we will see what 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.369
 more come here in the box your guides 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.050
 fast and manual and I do not know what else its 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.860
 tool to remove the sim card 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.800
 It is very simple as we always have 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.540
 also its 5 volt charging adapter 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.200
 at 1.55 anpert and we have the hearing aids 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.509
 of course with your spare parts 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.570
 samsung or its adapters also for 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.039
 different ear sizes are very 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.930
 well these hearing aids have always 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.840
 liked the samsung headphones and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.060
 we have here your usb cable is not so 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.310
 long as the high ranges it brings 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.410
 samsung a very very very long cable this one 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.790
 it's not that long but it's still 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.550
 pretty good 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.020
 It's everything we found in the box 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.820
 now as you see we have here the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.880
 initial configuration let's jump 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.680
 all ready here we have the galaxy is 7 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.020
 the truth of the galaxy is 5 I liked it 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.450
 very much and let's see if what happens 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.950
 same with this galaxy edition is 7 that 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.930
 they are practically the same but this is 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.570
 a little bigger to have a 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.490
 a little wider screen I hope that 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.830

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.180

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.890
 you think about this new format I'm 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.170
 experiencing the truth I do not know if this 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.340
 thing is recording correctly as 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.110
 should record but we're 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.060
 experimenting to bring also 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.610

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.950

 located the 8 megapixel camera to the 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.000
 left has its flash led and the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.100
 right has its speaker below the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.110
 brand logo again and since 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.100
 the lid can not be removed below 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.100
