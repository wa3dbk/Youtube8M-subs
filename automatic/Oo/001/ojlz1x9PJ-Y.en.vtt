00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
now this is my second attempt at the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.679 
now this is my second attempt at the
first<00:00:59.010> level<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.610> don't<00:01:00.059> obviously<00:01:00.269> had

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:00.689 
first level I don't obviously had

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:01.910 
first level I don't obviously had
already<00:01:00.839> played<00:01:01.260> through<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.619> entire

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
already played through the entire

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.170 
already played through the entire
campaign<00:01:02.339> which<00:01:02.909> is<00:01:03.089> really<00:01:03.360> good<00:01:03.689> um<00:01:05.030> but<00:01:06.030> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
campaign which is really good um but you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.910 
campaign which is really good um but you
know<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.840> wanted<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.650> straightforward

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
know you I wanted a more straightforward

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
know you I wanted a more straightforward
approach<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.880> campaign<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.479> there's<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
approach the campaign because there's a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.899 
approach the campaign because there's a
lot<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:09.990> cutscenes<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.490> nice<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
lot of cutscenes and so it's nice to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.410 
lot of cutscenes and so it's nice to
have<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.210> game<00:01:12.450> mode<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
have this game mode because you get to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
have this game mode because you get to
go<00:01:15.869> through<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> whole<00:01:16.350> story<00:01:16.710> mode<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> it's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
go through the whole story mode and it's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
go through the whole story mode and it's
got<00:01:17.970> as<00:01:18.210> minimal<00:01:18.840> cutscenes<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.560> possible

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
got as minimal cutscenes as possible

minutes<00:02:22.670> but<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.050> takes<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.290> don't<00:02:25.440> know<00:02:25.530> like

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
minutes but this takes I don't know like

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.309 
minutes but this takes I don't know like
five<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.250> ten<00:02:26.459> minutes<00:02:26.490> depending<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:28.050> you

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
five to ten minutes depending on if you

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.490 
five to ten minutes depending on if you
die<00:02:28.560> or<00:02:28.590> not

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
die or not

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.200 
die or not
so<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.970> really<00:02:31.150> cool<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:32.820> if<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:34.090> guys

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
so it's really cool and if you guys

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.640 
so it's really cool and if you guys
haven't<00:02:34.480> realized<00:02:34.960> how<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:35.260> game<00:02:35.410> mode

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
haven't realized how this game mode

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.560 
haven't realized how this game mode
works<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.190> pretty<00:02:36.400> simple<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.210> start<00:02:37.480> with

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
works it's pretty simple you start with

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.410 
works it's pretty simple you start with
a<00:02:37.630> minute<00:02:37.990> on<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.230> clock<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:39.520> then<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.210> just

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
a minute on the clock and then you just

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.400 
a minute on the clock and then you just
kill<00:02:40.930> people<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:43.600> build<00:02:43.840> up<00:02:44.200> time<00:02:45.180> so

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
kill people to build up time so

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.810 
kill people to build up time so
headshots<00:02:47.410> are<00:02:47.620> like<00:02:47.770> six<00:02:48.130> seconds<00:02:48.670> on<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
headshots are like six seconds on the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.840 
headshots are like six seconds on the
clock<00:02:49.740> just<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.830> regular<00:02:51.010> kills<00:02:51.430> like<00:02:51.580> five

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
clock just a regular kills like five

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.640 
clock just a regular kills like five
seconds<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.510> melee<00:02:52.810> kills<00:02:53.080> worth<00:02:53.290> ten

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
seconds and melee kills worth ten

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.830 
seconds and melee kills worth ten
seconds<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.400> know<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.270> on<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:55.720> forth

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
seconds you know and so on and so forth

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.740 
seconds you know and so on and so forth
but<00:02:58.840> your<00:02:59.050> goal<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.560> have<00:02:59.770> the<00:02:59.980> most<00:03:00.190> time

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
but your goal is to have the most time

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.920 
but your goal is to have the most time
once<00:03:01.750> you're<00:03:01.989> done<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> mission<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.000> so

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
once you're done with the mission and so

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.260 
once you're done with the mission and so
like<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.739> King<00:03:06.070> raucous<00:03:06.489> guy<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.700> think<00:03:06.940> he's

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
like that King raucous guy I think he's

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.090 
like that King raucous guy I think he's
like<00:03:07.480> number<00:03:07.840> one<00:03:08.080> on<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> leaderboard<00:03:08.920> or

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
like number one on the leaderboard or

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.920 
like number one on the leaderboard or
something<00:03:09.430> with<00:03:09.610> four<00:03:09.940> minutes<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.750> have

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
something with four minutes and I have

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.229 
something with four minutes and I have
no<00:03:11.140> idea<00:03:11.320> how<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.739> hell<00:03:11.980> he<00:03:12.130> did<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.550> but

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
no idea how the hell he did that but

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.540 
no idea how the hell he did that but
that's<00:03:13.450> pretty<00:03:14.070> it's<00:03:15.070> pretty<00:03:15.130> hard<00:03:15.459> to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
that's pretty it's pretty hard to

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.000 
that's pretty it's pretty hard to
achieve<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:16.150> think<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:17.140> like<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.470> got<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.680> minute

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
achieve I think that like I got a minute

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.650 
achieve I think that like I got a minute
and<00:03:18.220> 23<00:03:18.580> seconds<00:03:19.270> on<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:19.660> one<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.550> oh<00:03:21.660> and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
and 23 seconds on this one and oh and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.070 
and 23 seconds on this one and oh and
you<00:03:22.780> can't<00:03:23.140> if<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.770> die<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:25.239> have<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.720> start

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
you can't if you die you have to start

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.320 
you can't if you die you have to start
the<00:03:26.260> whole<00:03:26.440> thing<00:03:26.800> over<00:03:27.730> again<00:03:28.000> so<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:31.090> really

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
the whole thing over again so it really

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.240 
the whole thing over again so it really
takes<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.690> lot<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.900> skill<00:03:32.260> um<00:03:33.510> takes<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.690> lot<00:03:34.989> of

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.229 

management<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.370> guess<00:03:39.580> like<00:03:39.850> you<00:03:39.940> have<00:03:40.060> to

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
management I guess like you have to

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.120 
management I guess like you have to
figure<00:03:40.840> out<00:03:41.019> what<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.440> best<00:03:41.590> way<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.860> manage

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
figure out what the best way to manage

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.979 
figure out what the best way to manage
your<00:03:42.370> pain<00:03:42.610> killers<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.330> because<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.840> don't

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
your pain killers is because you don't

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.750 
your pain killers is because you don't
