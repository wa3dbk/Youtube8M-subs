00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.740
 Place the thighs in a baking dish 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.809
 Make sure the skin is up 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.000
 lies and then surpassed as the whole 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.349
 with some olive oil and then we go 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.349
 even our spices added 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.820
 then something for the sharpness 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.910
 character chilli flakes 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.260
 some paprika powder in the beginning was salt 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.439
 and pepper is still allowed to play 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.250
 of course not missing for the reason 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.600
 and then we have all the nice one 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.460
 Of course you can take two hands 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.809
 I took one here since I was with 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.239
 the other still use the camera 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.620
 But had to make sure that the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.100
 bottom school with rubbed 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.629
 is and in the next step takes 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.930
 Just one key is this 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.420
 then lemon juice and olive oil 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.460
 still the rest of the salt so one to two 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.129
 Teaspoon does the best 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.969
 Whisk and shortens the whole thing 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.250
 well connected 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.379
 companies like half of the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.990
 lemon juice and drizzle with it 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.060
 ever the thighs 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.530
 The customers also wing beside you 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.149
 I'm left to thigh 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.190
 decided and as a side dish are suitable 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.929
 of course, just great potatoes 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.530
 Serve short , relatively small 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.149
 potatoes 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.570
 They will then be put into a casserole dish 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.860
 cooked and then still need that 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.439
 I have garlic cloves before 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.720
 halved and he lies with the shell 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.869
 all around so you can go up 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.369
 submit 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.990
 The potato I just put it 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.729
 around that looks like a small one 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.170
 campfire 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.880
 They will then be the same with the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 sprinkled with remaining lemon juice 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.320
 The rest is about the potatoes though 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.030
 Of course, he also has something left over 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.160
 the thighs are rubbed with it 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.680
 take care that all the potatoes too 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.420
 beautifully coated with the juice are there 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.150
 can not burn anything and it 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.530
 everything tastes evenly the same 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.680
 Of course, rosemary 2 is still missing 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.630
 he is now in the middle and then 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.690
 has the oven ever on 200 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.470

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.360
 the whole thing then look like these after 40 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.740
 minutes it may already be 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.860
 not ready from the oven again 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.690
 Now a few cloves of garlic 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.380
 as I have about eight to ten ten in 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.320

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.320

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.320
 lemon slices 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.390
