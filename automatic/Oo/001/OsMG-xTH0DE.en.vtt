disk<00:01:10.050> awesome<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.570> dispenser<00:01:14.140> there<00:01:14.320> to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
disk awesome put that dispenser there to

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.520 
disk awesome put that dispenser there to
injure<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.860> creepers<00:01:15.280> but<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:15.789> think<00:01:16.530> punching

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
injure the creepers but I think punching

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.180 
injure the creepers but I think punching
them<00:01:17.680> is<00:01:17.830> more<00:01:18.729> efficient<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:23.039> I've<00:01:24.039> already

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
them is more efficient so I've already

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.139 
them is more efficient so I've already
gotten<00:01:24.490> this<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.880> work<00:01:25.060> once<00:01:25.360> oh<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:28.000> know

drop zone for spiders now I made a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.240 
drop zone for spiders now I made a
channel<00:01:56.300> that<00:01:57.700> takes<00:01:58.700> spiders<00:01:59.180> along<00:02:00.250> takes

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
this is really frustrating and planned

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.800 
this is really frustrating and planned
out<00:03:15.049> this<00:03:15.080> part<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.620> video<00:03:15.970> anyway<00:03:16.970> that's

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
out this part of the video anyway that's

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.949 
out this part of the video anyway that's
where<00:03:18.049> they're<00:03:18.200> killed<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:19.519> spiders<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.330> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
where they're killed the spiders and the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.210 
where they're killed the spiders and the
filter<00:03:21.319> takes<00:03:21.590> monsters<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.519> are<00:03:24.220> two

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
filter takes monsters that are two

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.979 
filter takes monsters that are two
blocks<00:03:25.370> high<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.000> one<00:03:26.150> block<00:03:26.390> wide<00:03:26.660> and

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
blocks high and one block wide and

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.509 
blocks high and one block wide and
brings<00:03:27.230> them<00:03:27.349> down<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.590> channel<00:03:28.010> here<00:03:28.280> into

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
brings them down a channel here into

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.479 
brings them down a channel here into
here<00:03:28.549> where<00:03:29.000> they<00:03:29.120> sit<00:03:29.450> on<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:30.230> trap<00:03:30.590> door<00:03:30.830> which

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
here where they sit on a trap door which
