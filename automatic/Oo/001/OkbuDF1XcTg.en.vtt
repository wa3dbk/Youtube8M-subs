and<00:05:17.030> then<00:05:17.180> this<00:05:17.270> was<00:05:17.479> greg<00:05:17.630> nice<00:05:18.460> if<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:19.610> have

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
and then this was greg nice if you have

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.279 
and then this was greg nice if you have
controller<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:20.300> some<00:05:20.509> of<00:05:20.600> this<00:05:20.690> I<00:05:20.870> use<00:05:21.110> it<00:05:21.229> in

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
controller you some of this I use it in

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.510 
controller you some of this I use it in
my<00:05:21.350> future<00:05:21.500> match<00:05:21.740> but<00:05:21.889> I'd<00:05:21.979> skilled<00:05:22.250> read<00:05:22.370> but

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
my future match but I'd skilled read but

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.680 
my future match but I'd skilled read but
is<00:05:22.550> still<00:05:22.759> still<00:05:23.180> really<00:05:23.330> really<00:05:23.479> good

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
is still still really really good

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.570 
is still still really really good
because<00:05:23.860> 3000-4000<00:05:24.860> if<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.400> haven't

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
indefensible it's really hard for them

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.089 
indefensible it's really hard for them
to<00:05:26.720> get<00:05:26.840> rid<00:05:26.990> of<00:05:27.050> it<00:05:27.139> without<00:05:27.620> fiendish<00:05:27.979> and
