00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
design the handle slabs are quite
interesting<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.310> at<00:01:59.430> first<00:01:59.580> I<00:01:59.760> thought<00:01:59.880> was

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
interesting and at first I thought was

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.120 
interesting and at first I thought was
just<00:02:00.120> your<00:02:00.270> typical<00:02:00.390> sort<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.350> natural

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
just your typical sort of natural

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.500 
just your typical sort of natural
materials<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.790> sides<00:02:03.030> figure<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.480> other

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
materials at one sides figure the other

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.660 
materials at one sides figure the other
you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.050> see<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.440> doesn't<00:02:05.190> bold<00:02:05.490> yet

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you can see there that doesn't bold yet

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
you can see there that doesn't bold yet
it's<00:02:05.880> fought<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.270> much<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.290> side<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.590> dies

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
it's fought so much on this side it dies

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.139 
it's fought so much on this side it dies
it<00:02:07.920> turns<00:02:08.129> out<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.429> bokor<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.910> actually

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it turns out that bokor have actually

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.910 
it turns out that bokor have actually
done<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.390> quite<00:02:09.599> deliberately<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
done this quite deliberately so that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.369 
done this quite deliberately so that
when<00:02:11.190> you're<00:02:11.340> holding<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.120> hand<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:13.200> you're

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
when you're holding it in hand if you're

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
left-hander and I have to say that it's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.199 
left-hander and I have to say that it's
probably<00:02:20.190> not<00:02:20.250> quite<00:02:20.519> as<00:02:20.700> good<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.030> left

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
it's got very nice lines one of the

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.830 
it's got very nice lines one of the
great<00:03:00.700> things<00:03:00.970> about<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.330> design<00:03:01.660> as<00:03:01.810> you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
great things about this design as you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.180 
great things about this design as you
can<00:03:01.959> see<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.319> they've<00:03:02.440> designed<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.890> handle

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
can see that they've designed the handle

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.729 
can see that they've designed the handle
it<00:03:03.280> flies<00:03:03.580> up<00:03:03.790> up<00:03:04.510> onto<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.930> blade<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.560> then

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
it flies up up onto the blade and then

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.009 
it flies up up onto the blade and then
curves<00:03:06.130> yeah<00:03:06.220> nice<00:03:06.400> sort<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.120> think<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.780> speech

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
curves yeah nice sort of think of speech

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.570 
curves yeah nice sort of think of speech
says<00:03:08.230> they<00:03:08.410> didn't<00:03:08.650> mean<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.799> take<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.069> tang

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
says they didn't mean to take that tang

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.449 
says they didn't mean to take that tang
hidden<00:03:09.880> away<00:03:09.970> but<00:03:10.630> obviously<00:03:10.959> that's<00:03:11.170> not<00:03:11.620> a

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
hidden away but obviously that's not a

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.680 
hidden away but obviously that's not a
big<00:03:12.640> deal<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.970> they<00:03:13.090> obviously<00:03:13.180> need<00:03:13.510> that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
big deal and they obviously need that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.150 
big deal and they obviously need that
tang<00:03:13.900> therefore<00:03:14.349> they<00:03:14.470> lock<00:03:14.680> back<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.010> work

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
tang therefore they lock back to work

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.030 
tang therefore they lock back to work
but<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.150> flies<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:17.049> it's<00:03:17.470> arriving<00:03:17.769> soon

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
but it flies and it's arriving soon

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.530 
but it flies and it's arriving soon
looking<00:03:18.280> nod<00:03:18.580> I<00:03:18.700> do<00:03:18.760> like<00:03:19.030> designed<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.390> very

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
looking nod I do like designed it very

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.870 
looking nod I do like designed it very
much<00:03:19.890> whilst<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.099> handle<00:03:21.400> slabs<00:03:21.640> are

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
much whilst the handle slabs are

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.580 
much whilst the handle slabs are
designed<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.870> suit<00:03:23.140> right-handed

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
designed really to suit right-handed

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.770 
designed really to suit right-handed

four answers so I don't know where it
said<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.329> weight<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:01.660> certainly<00:04:01.989> that's

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
said that weight but certainly that's

the<00:04:02.319> weight<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.620> got<00:04:02.799> on<00:04:02.889> my<00:04:03.010> scales<00:04:03.370> so

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
the weight that I got on my scales so

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.870 
the weight that I got on my scales so
I'm<00:04:04.000> going<00:04:04.239> if<00:04:04.359> that<00:04:04.510> 3.7<00:04:05.200> ounces

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.770 
lockups good on it no movement it's
probably<00:04:08.859> a<00:04:08.889> little<00:04:09.370> hint<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.209> side<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.600> side

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780

probably a little hint of side to side
but<00:04:10.900> that's<00:04:11.079> I<00:04:11.350> dare<00:04:12.010> say<00:04:12.190> a<00:04:12.220> little<00:04:12.340> bit<00:04:12.519> of

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
but that's I dare say a little bit of

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.940

utility<00:06:25.930> tasks<00:06:26.380> EDC<00:06:26.860> is<00:06:27.039> that<00:06:27.220> sort<00:06:27.430> of<00:06:27.460> thing

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
utility tasks EDC is that sort of thing

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.020 
utility tasks EDC is that sort of thing
skinning<00:06:28.979> use<00:06:29.979> absolutely<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:30.580> could<00:06:30.699> use<00:06:30.880> it

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
skinning use absolutely you could use it

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.879 
skinning use absolutely you could use it
but<00:06:31.240> of<00:06:31.419> course<00:06:31.659> you're<00:06:32.050> gonna<00:06:32.139> have<00:06:32.590> to<00:06:32.710> find

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
but of course you're gonna have to find

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.170 
but of course you're gonna have to find
cleaner<00:06:33.159> that<00:06:33.340> later<00:06:33.580> fixed<00:06:33.880> by<00:06:34.030> it's

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
cleaner that later fixed by it's

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.430 
cleaner that later fixed by it's
probably<00:06:34.780> better<00:06:34.900> for<00:06:34.960> skinning

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
probably better for skinning

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.469 
probably better for skinning
again<00:06:35.830> that's<00:06:36.220> just<00:06:36.430> me<00:06:36.610> I'm<00:06:36.759> not<00:06:36.909> about<00:06:37.210> the

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
again that's just me I'm not about the

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.570 
again that's just me I'm not about the
skinning<00:06:37.750> animals<00:06:37.900> but<00:06:38.289> certainly<00:06:39.009> that

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
skinning animals but certainly that

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.550 
skinning animals but certainly that
would<00:06:39.699> be<00:06:39.759> a<00:06:39.880> reasonable<00:06:40.270> proposition

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
would be a reasonable proposition

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.379 
would be a reasonable proposition
however<00:06:41.560> an<00:06:41.710> EDC<00:06:41.979> is<00:06:42.340> the<00:06:42.610> bike<00:06:42.820> shake<00:06:43.120> weird

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
however an EDC is the bike shake weird

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:44.700 
however an EDC is the bike shake weird
though<00:06:43.599> it<00:06:43.659> looks<00:06:43.870> is<00:06:44.020> really<00:06:44.349> great<00:06:44.530> because

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
though it looks is really great because

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.170 
though it looks is really great because
you<00:06:44.740> can<00:06:44.860> get<00:06:44.949> your<00:06:45.099> thumb<00:06:45.340> up<00:06:45.490> on<00:06:45.639> that<00:06:45.820> back

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
you can get your thumb up on that back

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.420 
you can get your thumb up on that back
of<00:06:46.300> that<00:06:46.389> ramp<00:06:46.659> and<00:06:47.380> I<00:06:47.500> find<00:06:47.770> it's<00:06:47.979> really<00:06:48.039> good

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
of that ramp and I find it's really good

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.740 
of that ramp and I find it's really good
for<00:06:48.580> detail<00:06:48.909> work<00:06:49.060> it<00:06:49.180> gives<00:06:49.389> excellent

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
for detail work it gives excellent

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.649 
for detail work it gives excellent
control<00:06:50.200> that<00:06:50.440> little<00:06:50.680> blade<00:06:50.889> so<00:06:51.880> really

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:52.659 
control that little blade so really

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:53.640 
control that little blade so really
quite<00:06:52.870> impressed<00:06:53.260> if<00:06:53.409> it<00:06:53.500> was

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
quite impressed if it was

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.140 
quite impressed if it was
it's<00:06:53.830> a<00:06:54.009> great<00:06:54.250> little<00:06:54.400> life<00:06:54.699> insurance

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
it's a great little life insurance

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.270 
it's a great little life insurance
unusual-looking<00:06:55.900> but<00:06:56.470> I<00:06:56.500> do<00:06:56.620> like<00:06:56.919> the<00:06:57.070> lines

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
unusual-looking but I do like the lines

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.950 
unusual-looking but I do like the lines
both<00:06:57.490> open<00:06:57.880> and<00:06:57.940> closed<00:06:58.180> if<00:06:58.360> you<00:06:58.389> look<00:06:58.750> at<00:06:58.870> it

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
both open and closed if you look at it

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.360 
both open and closed if you look at it
we<00:06:59.080> talked<00:06:59.290> about<00:06:59.410> the<00:06:59.680> lines<00:06:59.860> closed<00:07:00.130> before

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
we talked about the lines closed before

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.439 
we talked about the lines closed before
but<00:07:00.639> if<00:07:00.699> you<00:07:00.729> have<00:07:00.910> a<00:07:00.940> look<00:07:01.120> at<00:07:01.180> here<00:07:01.330> in<00:07:01.389> the

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
but if you have a look at here in the

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.800 
but if you have a look at here in the
outside<00:07:01.780> burn<00:07:01.960> it's<00:07:02.620> got<00:07:02.770> this<00:07:02.889> nice<00:07:03.240> flow<00:07:04.240> and

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
outside burn it's got this nice flow and

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.499 
outside burn it's got this nice flow and
curves<00:07:05.199> and<00:07:05.680> I<00:07:06.580> really<00:07:06.880> like<00:07:07.060> the<00:07:07.180> look<00:07:07.330> of<00:07:07.419> it

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509 
curves and I really like the look of it

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.719 
curves and I really like the look of it
so<00:07:07.800> if<00:07:08.800> you<00:07:08.889> leave<00:07:09.039> the<00:07:09.190> market<00:07:09.520> for<00:07:09.699> a

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
so if you leave the market for a

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.939 
so if you leave the market for a
pocketknife<00:07:10.090> that's<00:07:10.570> not<00:07:11.259> kind<00:07:11.470> of<00:07:11.650> the<00:07:11.710> usual

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:11.949 
pocketknife that's not kind of the usual

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:14.520 
pocketknife that's not kind of the usual
something<00:07:12.639> it's<00:07:12.789> a<00:07:12.850> little<00:07:13.090> bit<00:07:13.270> a<00:07:13.720> little<00:07:14.410> bit

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
something it's a little bit a little bit

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.770 
something it's a little bit a little bit
different<00:07:14.919> I<00:07:14.979> guess<00:07:15.449> maybe<00:07:16.449> something<00:07:16.750> a

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780 
different I guess maybe something a

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.450 
different I guess maybe something a
little<00:07:16.810> bit<00:07:17.050> of<00:07:17.110> old-world<00:07:17.320> charm<00:07:17.979> and<00:07:18.430> I

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
little bit of old-world charm and I

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.879 
little bit of old-world charm and I
think<00:07:18.639> this<00:07:18.759> exudes<00:07:19.180> charm<00:07:19.600> in<00:07:20.380> all<00:07:20.500> sorts<00:07:20.830> of

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 
think this exudes charm in all sorts of

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.550 
think this exudes charm in all sorts of
ways<00:07:21.070> I<00:07:21.570> think<00:07:22.570> these<00:07:22.720> are<00:07:22.780> great<00:07:22.960> value<00:07:23.350> but<00:07:23.470> I

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
ways I think these are great value but I

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.770 
ways I think these are great value but I
like<00:07:23.740> to<00:07:23.889> pick<00:07:24.039> up<00:07:24.160> and<00:07:24.570> it's<00:07:25.570> not<00:07:25.750> a

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
like to pick up and it's not a

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.810 
like to pick up and it's not a
scary-looking<00:07:26.229> knife<00:07:26.620> it's<00:07:26.889> it's<00:07:27.340> just<00:07:27.550> a<00:07:27.639> lot

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:27.820 
scary-looking knife it's it's just a lot

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.029 
scary-looking knife it's it's just a lot
of<00:07:27.850> fun<00:07:28.060> to<00:07:28.210> have<00:07:28.389> and<00:07:28.660> I<00:07:29.050> think<00:07:29.410> if<00:07:29.770> you<00:07:29.919> just

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 
of fun to have and I think if you just

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:31.879 
of fun to have and I think if you just
suddenly<00:07:30.430> this<00:07:30.639> you'd<00:07:30.760> probably<00:07:30.940> enjoy<00:07:31.090> it

suddenly this you'd probably enjoy it

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:33.750 
suddenly this you'd probably enjoy it
