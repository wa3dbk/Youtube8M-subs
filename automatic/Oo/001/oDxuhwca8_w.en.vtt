00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
just the tablet itself just gonna move

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.030 
just the tablet itself just gonna move
the<00:03:18.180> box<00:03:18.420> out<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.750> way<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.989> it's<00:03:22.709> just

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the box out of the way and it's just

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.860 
the box out of the way and it's just
kind<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.370> packed<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.090> then<00:03:24.209> shrink-wrapped

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
kind of packed and then shrink-wrapped

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.570 
kind of packed and then shrink-wrapped
looks<00:03:25.410> like

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:40.729 

it's<00:03:32.580> dressed<00:03:32.879> in<00:03:33.090> there<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.409> first

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
it's dressed in there and the first

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.300 
it's dressed in there and the first
appearance<00:03:41.159> is<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.640> actually<00:03:42.030> looks

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
appearance is it actually looks

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.670 
appearance is it actually looks
amazingly<00:03:44.310> good

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.199 

those<00:03:47.069> aren't<00:03:47.250> actual<00:03:47.430> fingerprints<00:03:48.060> it's

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
those aren't actual fingerprints it's

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.240 
those aren't actual fingerprints it's
just<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.450> bit<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:48.629> condensation<00:03:49.409> because<00:03:50.099> like

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
just a bit of condensation because like

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.610 
just a bit of condensation because like
I<00:03:50.370> said<00:03:50.579> it's<00:03:50.760> very<00:03:50.819> cold<00:03:51.299> if<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.170> like<00:03:52.379> same

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
I said it's very cold if you like same

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.780 
I said it's very cold if you like same
with<00:03:52.769> on<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:52.980> back<00:03:53.159> that<00:03:53.400> wherever<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.700> touch

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
with on the back that wherever I touch

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.449 
with on the back that wherever I touch
it<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.360> get<00:03:54.989> some<00:03:55.170> condensation<00:03:55.530> mark<00:03:56.099> showing

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
it I get some condensation mark showing

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.250 
it I get some condensation mark showing
up<00:03:56.840> fade<00:03:57.840> away<00:03:58.049> pretty<00:03:58.290> quick<00:03:58.530> as<00:03:58.680> they<00:03:58.799> dry<00:03:59.040> up

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
up fade away pretty quick as they dry up

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.520 
up fade away pretty quick as they dry up
and<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.409> really<00:04:01.560> does<00:04:01.769> look<00:04:03.079> essentially<00:04:04.079> in

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
and it really does look essentially in

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.970 
and it really does look essentially in
like<00:04:05.129> new<00:04:05.340> condition<00:04:06.049> no<00:04:07.049> scuffs<00:04:07.440> or<00:04:07.620> scrapes

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
like new condition no scuffs or scrapes

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.819 
like new condition no scuffs or scrapes
that<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:08.250> can<00:04:08.430> see<00:04:08.670> around<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:09.060> edges<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.599> the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
that I can see around the edges of the

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:26.700 
that I can see around the edges of the
case<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:13.459> note<00:04:17.060> buttons<00:04:18.060> feel<00:04:18.329> good

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.600 

so<00:04:27.310> overall<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:28.889> think<00:04:29.889> I'm<00:04:30.070> pretty<00:04:30.190> happy<00:04:30.460> with

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
so overall I think I'm pretty happy with

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.800 
so overall I think I'm pretty happy with
I<00:04:30.699> don't<00:04:30.759> really<00:04:31.000> want<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.180> turn<00:04:31.360> on<00:04:31.539> yet

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
I don't really want to turn on yet

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.969 
I don't really want to turn on yet
because<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.080> want<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.259> let<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:32.530> actually<00:04:32.800> warm

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
because I want to let it actually warm

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.879 
because I want to let it actually warm
up<00:04:33.160> for<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.400> while<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:34.620> assuming<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.680> it

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
up for a while but assuming that it

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.990 
up for a while but assuming that it
works<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.789> it<00:04:37.000> supposed<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.700 

I'll<00:04:43.000> get<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.300> just<00:04:43.479> turn<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.780> on<00:04:43.840> oh<00:04:44.169> we<00:04:44.590> got<00:04:44.680> a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
I'll get it just turn it on oh we got a

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.930 
I'll get it just turn it on oh we got a
little<00:04:44.949> battery<00:04:45.190> warning<00:04:45.400> so<00:04:45.610> I'm<00:04:45.669> gonna<00:04:45.759> have

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
little battery warning so I'm gonna have

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.120 
little battery warning so I'm gonna have
to<00:04:46.030> charge<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:46.470> but<00:04:47.470> we'll<00:04:47.620> let<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.800> warm<00:04:47.979> up

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
to charge it but we'll let it warm up

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.560 
to charge it but we'll let it warm up
for<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.340> while<00:04:48.460> first<00:04:48.669> before<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:49.150> plug<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.479> in

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
for a while first before I plug it in

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.110 
for a while first before I plug it in
and<00:04:49.780> charge<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:50.169> well<00:04:50.949> than<00:04:51.160> that<00:04:51.310> assuming

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
and charge it well than that assuming

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.460 
and charge it well than that assuming
like<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.389> said<00:04:52.570> that<00:04:52.720> it<00:04:52.810> works<00:04:53.020> well<00:04:53.229> I'm

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.469 
like I said that it works well I'm
pretty<00:04:54.220> happy<00:04:54.520> with<00:04:54.759> it<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.300> for<00:04:55.990> $180<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:58.330> in

here's Canada so uh very happy with it I
might<00:05:25.690> do<00:05:25.810> an<00:05:25.930> update<00:05:26.289> and<00:05:26.860> if<00:05:27.160> I<00:05:27.250> charge<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:27.669> up

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
might do an update and if I charge it up

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.279 
might do an update and if I charge it up
and<00:05:28.120> it<00:05:28.300> doesn't<00:05:28.570> work<00:05:28.660> right<00:05:28.720> or<00:05:29.050> something
