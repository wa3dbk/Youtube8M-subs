00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.710
 welcome to the untimely death 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.959
 so 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.289

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.919

 Circuits control or configure their telephone system 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 Switch 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.570
 The app supports the setting up of multiple telephone systems allowing them to 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.300
 Example of their private telephone system and their offices can control facilities 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.250
 To make their selection phone system accessible to the app are a few 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.210
 Preparations necessary 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.680
 The telephone system must be integrated into your network 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.840
 and it will need an internal 2 Niemeyer their facility for them one 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.680
 Children have set up 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.890
 to enable the data connection 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 the telephone system must be accessible via the Internet 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.850
 For this you need either a fixed meal for your dsl connection 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.580
 I explain fair 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.580
 or you set up the dns account 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.860
 a good one is for the incoming internet connection no further on 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.480
 Line to the telephone system necessary 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.850
 In our example, APG uses Import 8099 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 this is forwarded in the router to the Essl port of the telephone system 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.090
 If the app is called the first time we first need the settings 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.499
 for the connection to the telephone system 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.669
 in a pap test of the AP, this data is retained 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.289
 about more and the settings button 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.449
 we arrive at the connection facility of the AP to the minute 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:28.559
 the connection data are entered under Add Attachment 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.709
 the description 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.080
 facilitates the targeted selection of a telephone system for 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.420
 Example if the connections to several systems have been established 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:45.089
 the username and password will be the participant and their child 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.319
 under which the app should log on to the telephone system 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:58.309
 the post in the facility is either the public address or their address 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.879
 the doors DNS had cracks under which the system is reachable 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.790
 due to continue portraying her, Linsi said on the portrait change 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.790
 used by the f 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.499
 For our example, we use the SSW 4 of the telephone system 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.260
 Kassel but the answer to the successful work in the router 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.889
 after the safe, the app is ready set up 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.769
 and we have access to the attachments phonebook 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.879
 System memory information of the telephone system 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:46.079
 which can change the current configuration from questions and switching

 Via the page redirection it is possible to forward the call in the 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.999
 external numbers to taxes

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.709

 whose data the app has registered with the telephone system 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.290
