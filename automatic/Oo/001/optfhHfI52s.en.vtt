true<00:01:49.470> luminous<00:01:49.890> display<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.369> i<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
true luminous display so i think that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.690 
true luminous display so i think that
will<00:01:51.600> solve<00:01:51.990> an<00:01:52.320> issue<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.520> really

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
will solve an issue that's it's really

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.940 
will solve an issue that's it's really
busy<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.570> sony<00:01:55.020> grizzly<00:01:55.439> phones<00:01:55.680> have

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
busy one and sony grizzly phones have

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
busy one and sony grizzly phones have
with<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> viewing<00:01:56.610> angles<00:01:56.909> i<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.329> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
with the viewing angles i think this is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.330 
with the viewing angles i think this is
the<00:01:57.450> same<00:01:57.719> as<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> Sun<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.259> very<00:01:58.350> Z<00:01:58.799> ultra

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the same as the Sun is very Z ultra

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.969 
the same as the Sun is very Z ultra
phone<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.780> that's<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.409> very

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
phone so that's that that's very

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.950 
phone so that's that that's very
exciting<00:02:02.159> i'm<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.579> sure<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:03.659> when<00:02:03.810> i'm

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
exciting i'm not sure and but when i'm

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.300 
exciting i'm not sure and but when i'm
getting<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.439> I'm<00:02:04.649> probably<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
getting it I'm probably gonna get a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
getting it I'm probably gonna get a
pretty<00:02:05.579> soon<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.600> i<00:02:06.719> could<00:02:06.899> check<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
pretty soon and then i could check that

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.889 
pretty soon and then i could check that
stuff<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.619> mmm<00:02:08.220> another<00:02:09.119> key<00:02:09.420> thing<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
stuff out mmm another key thing here is

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.600 
stuff out mmm another key thing here is
that<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.289> comes

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
that it comes

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.580 
that it comes
16<00:02:10.940> gigabytes<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.300> internal<00:02:11.450> storage<00:02:11.750> instead

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
16 gigabytes of internal storage instead

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.800 
16 gigabytes of internal storage instead
of<00:02:12.740> atl<00:02:13.130> but<00:02:13.250> that's<00:02:13.490> like<00:02:13.610> big<00:02:13.910> big<00:02:14.270> big<00:02:14.480> thing

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
of atl but that's like big big big thing

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.630 
of atl but that's like big big big thing
there<00:02:14.990> because<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.100> means<00:02:16.190> you'll<00:02:16.400> be<00:02:16.580> able

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
there because that means you'll be able

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.050 
there because that means you'll be able
to<00:02:16.790> install<00:02:17.060> tons<00:02:17.570> more<00:02:17.840> games<00:02:18.730> which<00:02:19.730> which

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
to install tons more games which which

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.210 
to install tons more games which which
is<00:02:20.090> nice<00:02:20.420> which<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.930> very<00:02:21.170> very<00:02:21.350> nice<00:02:21.440> another

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
is nice which is very very nice another

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.250 
is nice which is very very nice another
key<00:02:22.490> thing<00:02:22.520> here<00:02:22.820> why<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:23.930> much<00:02:24.080> more

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
key thing here why it's so much more

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.380 
key thing here why it's so much more
expensive<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.980> because<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.790> get<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.940> 20

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
expensive is because you get a 20

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.780 
expensive is because you get a 20

GPU<00:03:20.090> very<00:03:20.360> interior<00:03:20.840> 330<00:03:21.739> vs.<00:03:22.160> Andrew<00:03:22.370> 305<00:03:23.030> and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
GPU very interior 330 vs. Andrew 305 and

GPU very interior 330 vs. Andrew 305 and
s4<00:03:23.450> mini<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.930> there's<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.590> lot<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.739> big<00:03:25.100> things

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
s4 mini so there's a lot of big things

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.979 
s4 mini so there's a lot of big things
you<00:03:25.640> have<00:03:25.730> white<00:03:25.970> more<00:03:26.390> expensive<00:03:26.780> but<00:03:26.840> then

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
you have white more expensive but then

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.470 
you have white more expensive but then
again<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.440> can<00:03:27.890> talk<00:03:28.190> about<00:03:28.340> like<00:03:28.640> we<00:03:28.940> see<00:03:29.239> it

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
again you can talk about like we see it

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.170 
again you can talk about like we see it
like<00:03:30.140> for<00:03:30.590> average<00:03:30.920> pictures<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.459> really<00:03:32.060> got<00:03:32.150> a

could<00:03:37.580> be<00:03:37.670> nice<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.209> is<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.360> big<00:03:38.510> deal

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
could be nice but this is the big deal

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.289 
could be nice but this is the big deal
well<00:03:39.470> we'll<00:03:39.860> see<00:03:40.100> when<00:03:40.370> i<00:03:40.400> get<00:03:40.610> my<00:03:40.640> handsome<00:03:41.090> on

this<00:03:41.480> device<00:03:41.660> which<00:03:41.900> i'm<00:03:42.049> probably<00:03:42.470> going<00:03:42.680> to

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
this device which i'm probably going to

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.550 
this device which i'm probably going to
get<00:03:42.890> very<00:03:42.920> soon<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:44.420> also<00:03:44.540> get<00:03:44.989> 400<00:03:45.470> more

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
get very soon and you also get 400 more

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.380 
get very soon and you also get 400 more
milliamps<00:03:46.010> in<00:03:46.100> terms<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.370> battery<00:03:46.549> life<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.180> a

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
milliamps in terms of battery life so a

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.060 
milliamps in terms of battery life so a
little<00:03:47.900> bit<00:03:48.019> better<00:03:48.200> battery<00:03:48.590> life<00:03:48.620> but<00:03:48.950> then

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
little bit better battery life but then

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.820 
little bit better battery life but then
again<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.459> display<00:03:49.820> probably<00:03:50.390> in<00:03:50.630> it<00:03:51.380> takes<00:03:51.769> a

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
again the display probably in it takes a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.960 
again the display probably in it takes a
little<00:03:51.920> bit<00:03:52.040> more<00:03:52.160> battery<00:03:52.459> life<00:03:52.519> a<00:03:52.790> still

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
little bit more battery life a still

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.560 
little bit more battery life a still
clearly<00:03:53.570> interesting<00:03:53.930> stuff<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:55.209> we<00:03:56.209> sup<00:03:56.420> to

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
clearly interesting stuff and we sup to

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.199 
clearly interesting stuff and we sup to
see<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.500> mean<00:03:57.769> it's<00:03:58.220> going<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.610> come<00:03:58.730> ver<00:03:59.000> very

like hind phone in terms of pricing and
stuff<00:04:11.110> but<00:04:12.110> it's<00:04:12.350> compact<00:04:12.950> which<00:04:13.310> is

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
stuff but it's compact which is

stuff but it's compact which is
something<00:04:14.120> that's<00:04:14.209> very<00:04:14.329> very<00:04:14.810> cool<00:04:15.049> because

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
something that's very very cool because

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.099 
something that's very very cool because
