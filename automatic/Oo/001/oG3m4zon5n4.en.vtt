00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.099
 and I was wondering for liliana I wanted 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.450
 know how you set your pace for the 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.230
 jail because I imagine it has been a 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.420
 brand recontra important in your life 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.070
 definitely strong things like 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.320
 an experience of entering a place 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.630
 where not belonging is a place where 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.760
 despite screaming that you are innocent not 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.640
 you can do anything like they put you where 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.279
 you do not belong to me personally and because 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.289
 my way to lead life I have opted for 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.659
 take it the most beautiful thing that gave me that 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.359
 and being those three years locked in 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:40.370
 a jail unjustly gave me a 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:42.410
 amazing family an admirable father and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.969
 and showed me that all the people who 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.730
 they were around with my friends they were 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.579
 Real friends to know that each visit 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.550
 I had 30 people waiting to see me was 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.589
 rewarding and I knew that God put me 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.290
 that proves on the road and I knew 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.000
 face it with them for those 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.550
 people who always trusted me in 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.290
 the funny goal that lily is the person 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.030
 most visited in the history of maximum 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.259
 security for all have week 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.610
 had 30 or more people the entire criminal 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.950
 one way or another communicated with her 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.230
 to tell her that they support her is really 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.970
 amazing that people 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.730
 in things and is one of the reasons why 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.320
 which the jail was not so hard not 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.300
 I imagine that for you tatiana too 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.940
 it may have been complicated not only 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.100
 for being sister to intervene if not for 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.570
 be twin she could have been 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 inside but somehow suffered 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.530
 so his sister could have 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000
 I was suffering and I had to live 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.340
 in play out or heal 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.890
 she was inside and I lived outside to me 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.890
 I was shouted ironically murderous in the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.140
 I was thrown out of my job 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.360
 they threw me in my house the saw that 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.950
 ventilated the department told me no longer 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.979
 it was tatiana was the mannarelli that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.540
 go and I had to retire and I did not have 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.250
 where to live because I did not want to rent 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.619
 nobody rent me an apartment 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.050
 nobody wanted not that there is much problem 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.369
 even for a moment I paid the initial and 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.190
 They gave me back nothing, they did not tell me 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.610
 the problem and what problem do I have and 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.530
 nothing that was one they threw me out of work 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.890
 they looked at me horribly down the street in 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.709
 truth I am very depressed I even went up 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.110
 a lot of weight and I had to go to the psychologist 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.940
 and it was ugly but I imagine that your relationship 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.570
 with your sister strengthened me until 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.550
 much strengthened us since 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.080
 we went out in the belly my mom did not 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.370
 cut me the cordoba made in truth 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.180
 she is everything that I have in my 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.519
 family my life and my best friend my 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.010
 sister is all that I have in this 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.600
 world and truth all better and bye bye 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.790
 send me to this world with 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.790
 applause for that and I'm going to ask you 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.870
 the other side because if it's true there 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.540
 many people who supported you 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.870
 but imagine that you also knew that 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.629
 by having an identical twin sister 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.310
 she was going to pay in some way for 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.599
 consequences of the situation whereby 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.599
 it was happening at that moment 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.549
 believe me, for I know it is 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.849
 inside a place that somehow 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.280
 it protected me from the society of 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.790
 gossip even from day to day 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.860
 that is, it was in a careful way and 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.780
 I knew that my sister by wearing my 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.690
 face or to wear by means of my face 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.940
 because my last name Mass and everyone knew 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.629
 that she was singing along with all 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.090
 my family because it has been half- vetoed and 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.250
 I think I think society should not 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.650
 be so prejudiced and I feel that if 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.250
 someone is guilty that he would say that what 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.859
 pay 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.260
 and everything is fine, but if he is innocent, 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.970
 you can put the cross as the cross 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.190
 because now I feel after these 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.560
 three years in a prison nobody is going to 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.079
 return that lost time and I did not 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.730
 nothing remains but to recover things 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.790
 good of them but nevertheless they are 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.230
 three years of my life that I do not enjoy that 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.760
 my family was labeled everything and 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.739
 harmed I feel that I want to be a 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.849
 little bit more aware and that this 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.370
 it can happen to anyone 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.319
 also played it and I think we want 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.689
 be a little more aware of 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.700
 the damage they can do seems that all 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.769
 the people who point out feel oblivious to 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.199
 these problems 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.690
 that nobody can imagine how easy it 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.430
 is to be able to enter a prison my sister 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.289
 hired a lawyer one month before entering 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.759
 the jail 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.470
 we were saying bad people are going 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.599
 to jail because you have to go to the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.009
 jail if the day I had to fire 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.349
 my sister because if she goes in to the 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.849
 justice was like seriously you're going to 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.910
 the prison or I'll have to go to 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.910
 visiting with a certain time was 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.650
 like no one is free and these 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.509
 problems really not even from 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.120
 justice or injustice nobody is free 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.250
 that they accuse you of something and for being someone 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.340
 with a known middle name or what 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.599
 be or by being with as you were put 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.610
 in jail because it draws attention and 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.770
 because the press likes me I imagine 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.840
 well I imagine that's how there are many people 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.000
 deserves to be inside and is and as well as 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.139
 people who are for negative things that 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.539
 may have committed there are people who 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.650
 unjustly is inside and that 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.210
 is suddenly uploaded does not have the 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.099
 possibilities and it gets very complicated 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.130
 You can also solve those problems 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.810
 of accuse them in some way and there 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.570
 people why 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.669
 I had the opportunity to listen with read 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.919
 but to listen to comments on the radio 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:27.430
 that talked about maybe it was not the 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.630
 moment and what I would say to those 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.190
 people who think that maybe they do not 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.889
 it's time is two things number 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.060
 one for those who do not know these two 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.710
 ladies are on television does 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.840
 a very long time many years ago 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.300
 they started on television since 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.550
 they were some girls they have been part 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.169
 of children's programs what happens that 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.810
 that is not known is information that is not 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.550
 has to say on television 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.610
 they have already taken time and the other one is 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.830
 where exactly end idea nothing else 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.860
 because the second part is in what 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.440
 at the moment they want them to have the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.979
 ability to rebuild your life if you have already 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.690
 been six years stuck in a problem 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.479
 which did not correspond to them is not such 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.639
 This time is the right time to 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.620
 say enough already because I do not get the 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.050
 ability to get ahead by myself 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.370
 and why not say hey I had nothing to 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.050
 see in the matter see if there is a 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.400
 opportunity and there is a sudden start 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.710
 This is just the beginning and 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.080
 suddenly combat was the opportunity to 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.669
 be able to have that possibility 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.819
 again we must enter a 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.289
 thing and it is that light was already coming 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.419
 before the combat bringing guys 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:35.819
 working doing social work which 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.819
 in mercy extremely important but
