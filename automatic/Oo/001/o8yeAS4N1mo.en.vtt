personally feel like when I come in for
variations<00:00:50.339> class<00:00:50.580> then<00:00:51.150> I'm<00:00:51.269> a<00:00:51.299> much<00:00:51.809> better

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
variations class then I'm a much better

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.990 
variations class then I'm a much better
dancer<00:00:52.229> I<00:00:52.409> was<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> came<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
dancer I was when I came in I think that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.579 
dancer I was when I came in I think that
when<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.269> was<00:00:54.479> younger<00:00:54.900> I<00:00:55.140> used<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.409> take

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
when I was younger I used to take

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.939 
when I was younger I used to take
Corrections<00:00:56.159> as<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.820> bad<00:00:57.089> thing<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.949> every

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
Corrections as a bad thing but every

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
Corrections as a bad thing but every
time<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.369> I<00:00:59.400> get<00:00:59.549> a<00:00:59.610> correction<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.449> I

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
time that I get a correction now I

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.320 
time that I get a correction now I
realized<00:01:01.409> that<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.040> for<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.430> best<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
realized that it's for the best and it's

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.789 
realized that it's for the best and it's
going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.720> make<00:01:03.809> me<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> better<00:01:04.170> dancer<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
going to make me a better dancer in the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.250 
going to make me a better dancer in the
end<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.630> teacher<00:01:06.810> gives<00:01:07.080> me<00:01:07.230> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
end so when a teacher gives me a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
end so when a teacher gives me a
correction<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.100> think<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.120> gotten<00:01:09.390> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
correction I think have I gotten this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.320 
correction I think have I gotten this
correction<00:01:09.750> before<00:01:10.640> what<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.210> make

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
correction before what can I do and make

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.750 
correction before what can I do and make
this<00:01:12.450> better<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.980> to<00:01:14.190> just<00:01:14.400> keep

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
this better and I have to just keep

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.810 
this better and I have to just keep
trying<00:01:15.450> my<00:01:15.660> hardest<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.230> guys<00:01:16.500> eventually<00:01:16.820> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
trying my hardest to guys eventually it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:32.460 
trying my hardest to guys eventually it
will<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.180> better

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.560 

Susi's<00:01:33.470> variations<00:01:34.040> class<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.730> really

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
Susi's variations class is really

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.020 
Susi's variations class is really
beneficial<00:01:36.020> it's<00:01:36.530> really<00:01:37.100> fun<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.430> take<00:01:37.640> she's

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
beneficial it's really fun to take she's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.270

always laughing and making jokes with us

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.660 
always laughing and making jokes with us
so<00:01:40.790> I'm<00:01:41.630> not<00:01:41.780> really<00:01:42.290> scared<00:01:42.560> at<00:01:42.920> all<00:01:43.010> but<00:01:43.070> I

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670

technique but it's it's really fun Suzie

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.830 
technique but it's it's really fun Suzie
variations<00:02:04.130> class<00:02:04.430> is<00:02:04.759> different<00:02:05.330> from<00:02:05.479> other

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
variations class is different from other

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.109 
variations class is different from other
variations<00:02:06.410> classes<00:02:06.740> I've<00:02:06.890> taken<00:02:07.130> because

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
variations classes I've taken because

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.770 
variations classes I've taken because
it's<00:02:09.040> not<00:02:10.040> so<00:02:10.220> much<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:11.090> learned<00:02:11.390> all

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
it's not so much that you learned all

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.199 
it's not so much that you learned all
the<00:02:12.080> steps<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.650> then<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.100> just<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.610> she

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the steps and then you just do it she

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.000 
the steps and then you just do it she
goes<00:02:14.390> piece<00:02:14.750> by<00:02:14.930> piece<00:02:14.959> because<00:02:15.650> she<00:02:15.770> really

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
goes piece by piece because she really

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.400 
goes piece by piece because she really
wants<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:17.030> exactly<00:02:17.510> how<00:02:17.750> she<00:02:18.200> learned

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
wants it to be exactly how she learned

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.800 
wants it to be exactly how she learned
the<00:02:18.530> variation<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:19.700> some<00:02:20.209> teachers<00:02:20.510> might<00:02:20.690> do

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
the variation so some teachers might do

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.210 
the variation so some teachers might do
it<00:02:20.900> differently<00:02:20.930> than<00:02:21.410> she<00:02:21.470> does<00:02:21.709> but<00:02:22.010> she

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
it differently than she does but she

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.890 
it differently than she does but she
really<00:02:22.430> wants<00:02:22.670> us<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.790> do<00:02:23.030> exactly<00:02:23.330> what<00:02:23.540> she

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
really wants us to do exactly what she

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.890 
really wants us to do exactly what she
learned<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.800> we<00:02:25.760> really<00:02:26.060> know<00:02:26.270> exactly<00:02:26.690> what

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
learned so we really know exactly what

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.930 
learned so we really know exactly what
we're<00:02:27.020> doing<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.590> by<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.459> time<00:02:28.640> we<00:02:28.700> put<00:02:28.850> it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
we're doing and by the time we put it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.970 
we're doing and by the time we put it
