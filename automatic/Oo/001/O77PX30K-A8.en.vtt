00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.390
 what else incorporates incorporate the 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.920
 more elements to the dance you have to have 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.220
 a variety of everything just in the bottle 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.090
 and the glass knows I do this I do it with 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.650
 My daughter, now 24 years old, who will make me more 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.440
 with whom I move doing the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.960
 dancing as a couple although the bottle 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.090
 there's more there's more that was floating 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.490
 because what you did extraordinary there is 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.810
 much more but I say good and it happens and that 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:00.180
 He will come back to do what you always

 we want this side of the hearing 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.680
 without people go to the next 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.990
 stage will be something better because he did not win this 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.530
 month but worried me because what 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.530
 it's extraordinary
