00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.470 
so what I've been hearing from farmers
mostly<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:43.280> course<00:00:43.520> it<00:00:43.670> all<00:00:43.790> depends<00:00:44.180> on<00:00:44.300> where

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
mostly of course it all depends on where

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.960 
mostly of course it all depends on where
you<00:00:44.570> go<00:00:44.600> most<00:00:45.560> I<00:00:45.680> hear<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:45.980> lot<00:00:46.190> about<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.610> their

you go most I hear a lot about the their
rising<00:00:47.360> costs<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:48.290> even<00:00:48.560> while<00:00:48.800> we're<00:00:49.010> having

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
rising costs so even while we're having

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.830 
rising costs so even while we're having
the<00:00:49.370> discussion<00:00:49.460> about<00:00:50.060> why<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.300> should<00:00:50.690> pay

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
the discussion about why I should pay

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.090 
the discussion about why I should pay
them<00:00:51.050> more<00:00:51.290> we're<00:00:51.560> also<00:00:51.680> having<00:00:51.950> the

them more we're also having the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.650 
them more we're also having the
discussion<00:00:52.580> about<00:00:52.760> how<00:00:52.940> their<00:00:53.120> costs<00:00:53.540> have

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
discussion about how their costs have

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.370 
discussion about how their costs have
increased<00:00:53.810> and<00:00:54.470> a<00:00:54.890> significant<00:00:55.930> component<00:00:56.930> of

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
increased and a significant component of

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.990 
increased and a significant component of
their<00:00:57.530> cost<00:00:57.860> structure<00:00:58.220> has<00:00:58.490> revolved<00:00:58.790> around

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
their cost structure has revolved around

the cost of food and the cost of living
overall<00:01:31.070> is<00:01:31.280> one<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.060> drivers<00:01:32.360> for<00:01:32.900> people

overall is one of the drivers for people

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.859

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.750 

I<00:01:44.600> think<00:01:45.110> another<00:01:45.320> challenge<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:46.370> have<00:01:46.610> at

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
I think another challenge that I have at

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.580 
I think another challenge that I have at
least<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.120> my<00:01:47.240> job<00:01:47.510> or<00:01:47.780> what<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.080> see<00:01:48.410> with<00:01:48.530> our

further up the mountain it creates a

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.290 
further up the mountain it creates a

and<00:03:32.630> what<00:03:32.840> we<00:03:32.959> need<00:03:32.989> is<00:03:33.260> farmers<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.830> invest

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
and what we need is farmers to invest

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.620 
and what we need is farmers to invest
more<00:03:34.400> in<00:03:34.580> their<00:03:34.700> farms<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.239> need<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.450> help

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
more in their farms and we need to help

more in their farms and we need to help
them<00:03:35.810> invest<00:03:36.170> in<00:03:36.320> those<00:03:36.410> farms<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:36.950> something

them invest in those farms and something

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.650 
them invest in those farms and something
we've<00:03:37.370> been<00:03:37.400> working<00:03:37.519> on<00:03:37.970> but<00:03:38.330> if<00:03:38.480> they're<00:03:38.630> not

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
we've been working on but if they're not

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.970 
we've been working on but if they're not
sure<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.350> they're<00:03:39.470> going<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.650> be<00:03:39.739> able<00:03:39.830> to

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
sure that they're going to be able to

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.940 
sure that they're going to be able to
grow<00:03:40.130> coffee<00:03:40.370> there<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.989> becomes<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.769> just

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
grow coffee there it becomes it just

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.470 
grow coffee there it becomes it just
makes<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.220> even<00:03:43.430> more<00:03:43.610> riskier<00:03:44.300> of<00:03:44.420> a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
makes it even more riskier of a

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:53.210 
makes it even more riskier of a
proposition

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.720 

I<00:03:54.380> think<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:55.560> thing<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.770> I<00:03:55.890> know<00:03:56.010> for<00:03:56.160> sure

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
I think one thing that I know for sure

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.090 
I think one thing that I know for sure
is<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.390> we<00:03:57.660> have<00:03:57.900> strong<00:03:58.440> partnerships

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
is that we have strong partnerships

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.000 
is that we have strong partnerships
that's<00:03:59.610> how<00:03:59.850> we've<00:04:00.260> lasted<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.650> where<00:04:01.800> we<00:04:01.980> are

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
that's how we've lasted to where we are

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.070 
that's how we've lasted to where we are
today<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:03.030> even<00:04:03.330> if<00:04:03.450> some<00:04:03.660> johnny-come-lately

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
today so even if some johnny-come-lately

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.740 
today so even if some johnny-come-lately
coffee<00:04:04.800> buyer<00:04:05.100> shows<00:04:05.430> up<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.240> know<00:04:06.330> forks

over relatively good prices our partners

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.420 
over relatively good prices our partners

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
will still pick us over them when

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.360 
will still pick us over them when
deciding<00:04:11.760> who<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.150> give<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.450> coffee<00:04:12.780> too<00:04:13.370> and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
deciding who to give the coffee too and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.830 
deciding who to give the coffee too and
that's<00:04:14.580> that's<00:04:14.940> based<00:04:15.240> on<00:04:15.420> out<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.690> history

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
that's that's based on out the history

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.319 
that's that's based on out the history
of<00:04:16.079> our<00:04:16.230> relationship<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:17.130> it's<00:04:17.640> not<00:04:17.790> just<00:04:18.090> on

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
of our relationship and it's not just on

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
analyze when they decide to give us

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.630 
analyze when they decide to give us
coffee<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.600> believe<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:29.220> cycle

coffee and I believe that this cycle
