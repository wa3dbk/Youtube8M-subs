00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:03.260 
okay here's a little bit of an update I

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.840 
okay here's a little bit of an update I
know<00:00:03.379> I<00:00:03.500> haven't<00:00:03.649> done<00:00:03.800> a<00:00:03.860> video<00:00:04.069> in<00:00:04.279> forever

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
know I haven't done a video in forever

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.840 
know I haven't done a video in forever
but<00:00:05.299> I<00:00:05.740> just<00:00:06.740> came<00:00:06.859> across<00:00:07.009> this<00:00:07.400> and<00:00:07.640> wanted

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
but I just came across this and wanted

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.779 
but I just came across this and wanted
to<00:00:07.879> share<00:00:08.179> it<00:00:08.419> plus<00:00:09.110> I<00:00:09.259> got<00:00:09.409> a<00:00:09.440> new<00:00:09.589> phone<00:00:09.829> so<00:00:10.429> I

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:10.789 
to share it plus I got a new phone so I

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.220 
to share it plus I got a new phone so I
think<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:11.360> videos<00:00:11.599> are<00:00:11.780> a<00:00:11.809> little<00:00:11.989> bit<00:00:12.110> better

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
think the videos are a little bit better

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.769 
think the videos are a little bit better
quality<00:00:12.440> so<00:00:13.039> maybe<00:00:13.249> that'll<00:00:13.429> help<00:00:13.610> me<00:00:13.849> make

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:14.779 
quality so maybe that'll help me make

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.980 
quality so maybe that'll help me make

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
can clean that up maybe put a little

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.520 
can clean that up maybe put a little
plate<00:01:33.860> on<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.100> inside<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:35.200> then<00:01:36.200> come<00:01:36.500> down

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
plate on the inside and then come down

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
plate on the inside and then come down
and<00:01:37.480> match<00:01:38.480> that<00:01:38.690> angle<00:01:39.050> right<00:01:39.080> there<00:01:39.550> well

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
and match that angle right there well

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.070 
and match that angle right there well
then<00:01:40.700> another<00:01:40.910> plate<00:01:41.240> there<00:01:41.480> and<00:01:41.510> strengthen

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
then another plate there and strengthen

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.020 
then another plate there and strengthen
it<00:01:42.170> up<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.590> do<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.280> best<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.730> can

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
it up and do the best I can

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.920 
it up and do the best I can

I may just strip this thing down hook up
that<00:02:51.760> engine<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.420> transmission<00:02:53.230> might<00:02:54.160> have

that engine and transmission might have

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.740 
that engine and transmission might have
to<00:02:54.430> fab<00:02:54.640> up<00:02:54.820> some<00:02:55.030> kind<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.240> mounting<00:02:55.750> because

to fab up some kind of mounting because

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.510 
to fab up some kind of mounting because
there's<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.900> bracket<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.380> one<00:02:59.830> side<00:03:00.220> if<00:03:00.430> I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
there's the bracket on the one side if I

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.550 
there's the bracket on the one side if I
can<00:03:00.640> get<00:03:00.760> down<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.060> there<00:03:01.240> for<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.780> transaxle

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
can get down in there for the transaxle

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.080 
can get down in there for the transaxle
in<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.680> other<00:03:02.830> coin<00:03:03.040> kind<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.790> has<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.910> little

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
in the other coin kind of has a little

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.110 
in the other coin kind of has a little
bit<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.210> an<00:03:04.300> angle<00:03:04.660> bracket<00:03:04.870> on<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:06.060> see<00:03:07.060> if

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
bit of an angle bracket on it and see if

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.210 
bit of an angle bracket on it and see if
I<00:03:07.210> can<00:03:07.330> get<00:03:07.450> under<00:03:07.660> there<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.620> bolts<00:03:08.980> holding

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
I can get under there you bolts holding

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.420 
I can get under there you bolts holding
it<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.460> so<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.530> may<00:03:11.530> have<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.770> fab<00:03:12.040> up<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.310> new

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
it on so I may have to fab up a new

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.280 
it on so I may have to fab up a new
transmission<00:03:13.890> kind<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:15.040> mounting<00:03:16.260> plate<00:03:17.260> for

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
transmission kind of mounting plate for

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.800 
transmission kind of mounting plate for
that<00:03:17.800> but<00:03:18.330> yeah<00:03:19.330> I<00:03:19.360> think<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.660> would<00:03:19.780> be

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
that but yeah I think this would be

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.650 
that but yeah I think this would be
pretty<00:03:19.959> cool<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.800> know<00:03:21.360> those<00:03:22.360> fenders

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
pretty cool and you know those fenders

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.640 
pretty cool and you know those fenders
look<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:22.989> they've<00:03:23.140> got<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.320> little<00:03:23.500> bit<00:03:23.590> of

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
look like they've got a little bit of

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.020 
look like they've got a little bit of
clearance<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.160> could<00:03:24.310> put<00:03:24.430> some<00:03:24.580> nice<00:03:24.730> tires

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
clearance you could put some nice tires

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.479 
clearance you could put some nice tires
on<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.480> if<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.260> figure<00:03:26.590> out<00:03:26.650> what<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.010> I'm<00:03:27.340> not

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489
