00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
basketball you know I said the one guy

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.130 
basketball you know I said the one guy
he<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.450> was<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> foul<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:19.020> no

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
wouldn't wouldn't have fell no oh man
I'm<00:01:21.180> argue<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.470> does<00:01:22.770> occur<00:01:23.189> at<00:01:23.340> times

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I'm argue that that does occur at times

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.929 
I'm argue that that does occur at times
everything<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> judgement<00:01:25.110> after<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
everything is a judgement after all and

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.010 
everything is a judgement after all and
that's<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> way<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> game<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.900> played

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that's just the way the game is played

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's just the way the game is played
though<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> consider<00:01:29.369> ourselves<00:01:29.460> too

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
