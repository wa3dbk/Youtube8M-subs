00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.730
 I am ready to speak to the world to celebrate the maastricht one 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.050
 icon with the rest and the note that they celebrate more than trendy outfit the parties 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.149
 and live at 100 per hour at least so it seems better off 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.970
 Here too, the dream of a Jewish 32 is Belgian 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.699
 advertising agencies 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.749
 new york is an i can rust it too antwerp is an i have 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:24.380
 never 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.470
 the final-year commercial communication students who shave and are 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.900
 got off my clothes hoping to get an internship at the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.050
 well-known antwerp advertising agency ldv this seems to be it and that is not 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.060
 passed unnoticed 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.960
 this is an anp people capable sponsorship obligation the first makes sense 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.729
 stand out 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.610
 I find some typical students and I treated myself 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.540
 to a 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.830
 and it is important that you enter the other part of your target group 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.930
 In this case, however, it is a wonderful literal translation of yourself 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.949
 expose 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.219
 Credit quality first came up with a number of other ideas but those 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.180
 were no longer financially viable 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.220
 and 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.479
 a poster was the most obvious 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.690
 what i like when they are a student company 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.330
 but then it must be what is on paper also rightly stuck and well if you 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.320
 has been doing it since it was allowed to meet everything at ltvz on Monday 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 and he also has almost 750 of Facebooks 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.359
 Kanis won the first half dictated the game delivered sold tickets 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.340
 but i have been drinking there for years then we see a government that they don't or or 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.420
 that is of course not the abbreviation of ldv on the business front made on it 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.170
 a bit that was held I am still a bit 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.930
 we strive that is maybe a chance it seems that the movie is a profit 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.500
 tote 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.050
 but like always like it and I'm glad we stay 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.160
 to laugh 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.290
 a 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 I think I got beaten up 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.810
 and now the exciting moment 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.300
 what do you think 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.230
 there is always something the first time a day 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.149
 that says something 7 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.519
 real 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.519
 and god is a bit of a wink 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.029
 Many Greeks are not thinking about that 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.519
 but yes we will see 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.519
 or do you want further starting places already appointed 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.029
 club 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.259
 what had 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.139
 9 works 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.359
 the final battle 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.359
 yes then a hundred years that writing 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.919
 Yes Yes 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.419
 I can already do the national policy and when selling 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.789
 upon which 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 I think that means the website is the first time humanity 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.399
 This has got me involved 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:57.340
 the viewer places is the first team you ask me it has me 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.489
 I noticed that I advise a first step for the children too 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.019
 playing it came in the first place 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.659
 people with trey times 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.609
 emmen i am curious to make 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.139
 make clear to the protests the finisher 4 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:16.479
 yeah right 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:17.659
 we have then 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.659
 there he became a bit late November 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.009
 it was the second time 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.799
 it was a means of proclaiming a name in the target audience 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.219
 for weeks 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.749
 it stays that way 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:39.429
 it is not known what reason I see in a one-off items to 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.979
 experienced in the collision 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.559
