00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
here and land on either that block or

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.149 
here and land on either that block or
that<00:01:00.179> block<00:01:00.389> so<00:01:00.600> let's<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:00.960> Oh<00:01:01.139> didn't<00:01:02.039> make

that block so let's see Oh didn't make
it<00:01:05.299> first<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:07.200> I'll<00:01:07.440> get<00:01:07.740> out<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it first up here and then I'll get out a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.970 
it first up here and then I'll get out a
pair<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.310> now<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.640> run<00:01:08.909> around<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
pair so now we can just run around and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.620 
pair so now we can just run around and
you're<00:01:10.980> up<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> want<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.480> higher

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
up you can just jump on these leaves and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.170 
up you can just jump on these leaves and
that's<00:01:15.240> basically<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.730> yes<00:01:17.730> you<00:01:17.760> can<00:01:17.970> also

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.640 
to its first stage first when I release
it<00:01:56.580> but<00:01:56.940> i'll<00:01:57.660> let<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> guys<00:01:58.050> know<00:01:58.260> when<00:01:58.470> it's

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
it but i'll let you guys know when it's

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.550 
it but i'll let you guys know when it's
released<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.820> yeah<00:02:00.660> I<00:02:00.690> think<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.080> next<00:02:01.320> glitch

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
released so yeah I think the next glitch

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.960 
released so yeah I think the next glitch
will<00:02:01.980> be<00:02:03.170> either<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.980> map<00:02:05.180> on<00:02:06.980> on<00:02:07.980> one

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
will be either and out of map on on one

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.290 
will be either and out of map on on one
in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> chamber<00:02:09.360> or<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:11.280> can't<00:02:11.879> remember<00:02:12.180> if

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
in the chamber or I can't remember if

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.420 
in the chamber or I can't remember if
there's<00:02:12.510> more<00:02:12.659> hindsight<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.230> think<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.710> think

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
there's more hindsight I think I think

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.130 
there's more hindsight I think I think
there's<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.850> more<00:02:15.030> glitch<00:02:15.720> i<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:16.020> an

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
there's one more glitch i have an

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.470 
there's one more glitch i have an
hide-and-seek<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:17.280> an<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.610> map<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.210> we<00:02:18.240> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
hide-and-seek like an out of map so we a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.900 
hide-and-seek like an out of map so we a
stay<00:02:18.720> tuned<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.110> those<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.530> i<00:02:20.130> hope<00:02:20.760> you
