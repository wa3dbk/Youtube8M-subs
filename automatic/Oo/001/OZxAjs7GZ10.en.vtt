00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
but these guys were scared and they were

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.220 
but these guys were scared and they were
running<00:03:34.710> and<00:03:34.920> they<00:03:35.550> did<00:03:35.850> not<00:03:36.150> care<00:03:36.600> about<00:03:36.630> me

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230
