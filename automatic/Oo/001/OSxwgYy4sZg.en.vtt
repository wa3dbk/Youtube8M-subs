00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.450 

let's<00:00:06.420> go<00:00:06.629> pretty<00:00:07.170> low<00:00:07.470> pressure<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.130> most<00:00:08.309> of

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
let's go pretty low pressure in most of

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.850 
let's go pretty low pressure in most of
qg<00:00:08.849> Slade's<00:00:09.090> which<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.450> weird<00:00:09.809> given<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:10.830> much

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
qg Slade's which is weird given how much

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.950 
qg Slade's which is weird given how much
fresher<00:00:11.370> they<00:00:11.580> had<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.000> last<00:00:12.179> game<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.780> I

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
fresher they had in the last game so I

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.419 
fresher they had in the last game so I
think<00:00:13.559> not<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.920> take<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.130> graph

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
think not to take the graph

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.770 
think not to take the graph
there<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.790> well<00:00:14.940> there's<00:00:15.150> actually<00:00:15.420> got<00:00:15.509> bound

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
there as well there's actually got bound

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.300 
there as well there's actually got bound
as<00:00:15.929> well<00:00:16.080> great<00:00:16.350> condemn<00:00:16.710> coming<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.190> from

gonna<00:00:43.290> come<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.770> Swift<00:00:44.100> hiding<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
gonna come back in Swift hiding in the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.119 
gonna come back in Swift hiding in the
brush<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.660> gets<00:00:45.840> himself<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.379> kill<00:00:46.620> tough<00:00:46.890> safe

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
brush and gets himself a kill tough safe

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.350 
brush and gets himself a kill tough safe
for<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.370> wild<00:00:47.670> growth<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> tower<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
for the wild growth but the tower and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.150 
for the wild growth but the tower and
bottom<00:00:48.809> goes<00:00:48.930> down<00:00:49.200> Swift<00:00:49.530> could<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.070> in

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
bottom goes down Swift could be in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.470 
bottom goes down Swift could be in
trouble<00:00:50.250> Uzis<00:00:50.730> Papa's<00:00:51.059> all<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.300> they're<00:00:51.420> gonna

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
trouble Uzis Papa's all do they're gonna

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.209 
trouble Uzis Papa's all do they're gonna
try<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.809> kill<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.079> edge<00:00:52.260> Ronnie<00:00:52.530> where<00:00:53.070> we

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
try and kill this edge Ronnie where we

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.529 
try and kill this edge Ronnie where we
need<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> line<00:00:53.640> something<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.030> good<00:00:54.239> all<00:00:54.390> T

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
need to line something up good all T

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
need to line something up good all T
therefore<00:00:54.719> amazing<00:00:55.230> Swift<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.129> down

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
therefore amazing Swift will go down

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
therefore amazing Swift will go down
massive<00:00:57.030> new<00:00:57.210> no<00:00:57.329> LT<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:57.989> well<00:00:58.199> maybe<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
massive new no LT there as well maybe a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.439 
massive new no LT there as well maybe a
bit<00:00:58.980> too<00:00:59.010> much<00:00:59.340> chart<00:00:59.640> damage<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> flash

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
bit too much chart damage that's a flash

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
bit too much chart damage that's a flash
