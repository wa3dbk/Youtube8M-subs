00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.090
 a cake super rich a cake strudel 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.029
 which you can fill with cream 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.059
 pastry with chocolate truffle with 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:31.270
 cream to beat the antillo feathers or 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:34.930
 cream with meringue with whatever you want 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:39.100
 well this dough is a puff pastry dough 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.719
 that I have prepared I am homemade I leave you the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.659
 link in the information box so that 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.699
 you see how I did it is super easy super 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.159
 simple and safe that you can make it 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.190
 if you do not want to do it, you must 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.100
 buy if you want to make this recipe 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.480
 good me 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 in this case I'm going to do it stretch to 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.650
 cut it and stretch it to take out two 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.540
 squares more or less term and already 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.270
 I have stretched 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.100
 there he is speaking already then now for 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.649
 leave the couple more than obviously look 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.580
 how is this with the knife we ​​are going to 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.580
 match 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.940
 more or less to leave two squares 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.080
 same so that they make us equal 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.830
 I cut a square and a 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.150
 rectangle I'm better than 26 x 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.700
 for 30 I think that is 22 squares 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.970
 so now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.430
 put sugar above the dough 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.530
 to granulated sugar and a little 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.820
 sugar flower or sugar 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.909
 impalpable 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.720
 Y 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.680
 let's spend a little bit 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.680
 the roller 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.909
 so sugar but soft because the 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.829
 sugar is 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.829
 stick well to the dough 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.310
 also what we are going to do is 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.820
 make him eyes because the idea is that no 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.000
 upload that does not inflate then with my 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.570
 super roller that I have already seen in 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.570
 several videos 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.000
 what are I going to do with my little eyes and this 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.250
 let's take one preheated oven 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.480
 200 degree strong oven 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.040
 1 so that they are well browned by both 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.760
 Let's go to 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.349
 to put the 10 minutes on one side and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.090
 when we see that you are more doraditos 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.819
 we turn the other side about 10-15 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.659
 minutes maximum 25 minutes in total good 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.849
 here is here are the two pieces 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.829
 look at her so it was golden brown to tell you that 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.379
 I did not need to turn it around and 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.069
 in 20 minutes they were 20 minutes each 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.470
 one were ready and well this is 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.359
 super simple super easy now the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.750
 filling inside is to taste of each 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:16.060
 person because the meringue can be 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.880
 a chocolate truffle can be cream 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.830
 pastry with pastry cream 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.170
 home if he can not make you leave the 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.130
 link in the video information box 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.580
 how I do it super super 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.580
 easy 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.980
 how do you put this this does not matter 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.560
 because then to the other plate over 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.260
 simply comfort of putting it in a 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.390
 pastry bag but you can do it 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.830
 directly without any problem and I already 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.810
 I put the pastry cream then now 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.280
 I will place it on the side that is 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.100
 more lawful 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.060
 today 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.060
 on that side 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:06.790
 and here I'm going to put the chocolate 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.790
 the chocolate that melted in a bain-marie 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.400
 and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.960
 now I 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.960
 white chocolate I'm going to make some lines 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.690
 now with a little thing like that in this case a 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.690
 skewer stick will go down 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.910
 and so we will give the touch 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.910
 characteristic of the bee 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.150
 good and the millefeuille are already finished 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.090
 of chocolate custard I have 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.700
 cut but has not shown how I've 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.960
 cut but good is simply tucked 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.520
 a little while to the refrigerator so that 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.280
 harden the chocolate and power 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.170
 cut it even better so I was under 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.120
 one that another but good those are 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.150
 details 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.490
 if you do it with icing sugar that does not 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.229
 Note that it does not break the party this 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.139
 of chocolate the chocolate that 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:56.460
 tends to break and well I got 10 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:59.620
 pieces but the days are not there because 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.930
 they took a few 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.889
