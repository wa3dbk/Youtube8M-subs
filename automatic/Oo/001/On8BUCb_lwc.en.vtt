00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.400
 video we have in the last video once 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.719
 shown as ours here 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.070
 Christmas lights looks today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.469
 Let's have a secret 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.410
 I betray how the whole thing works 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.170
 have this radio switch with the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.949
 Radio switch, I can use the light source 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.310
 head for 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.099
 here on the letter i can see the here 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.750
 door frame lighting on and off 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 the whole thing actually works 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.300
 simply that is the one remote control 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.219
 here our transmitter and here we see the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.120
 receiver if I like it now often 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.670
 Press the driven switches 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 turns off and now no longer leaves electricity 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.219
 from the socket to the plug through the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.530
 the switch is turned off 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.780
 consumer is still on it but it 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.820
 there is no power left 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 If I now turn the switch again 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.230
 switch over the remote control can the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.890
 electricity back from the socket in the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.670
 consumers are running rows and then 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 shines again the whole is here 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:20.150
 programmed via a do that now 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.150
 that is so here you can adjust 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.180
 and is important that this code to you 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.560
 adjusts then finds itself again and again 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.780
 at the reception at the receiver so I like 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.829
 the mouse and shows you here on the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.420
 another page programming again 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:46.979
 receiver if we again 123456 exactly 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.250
 like here on the station is the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.329
 the same code speaks therefore the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.340
 switch on here too if I'm on it 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.210
 pushes and I can do so many now 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.899
 parties would have room like me here except 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.299
 possibilities have a total of 1 2345 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.579
 I can distribute switches in the room and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.810
 always from the remote here 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.810
 drive everything in the room 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.660
 that's how easy it works
