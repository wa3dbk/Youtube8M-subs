it's<00:01:22.740> gone<00:01:22.890> away<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it's gone away just because it's and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
it's gone away just because it's and
some<00:01:24.630> people<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> stays<00:01:25.229> some<00:01:25.500> people<00:01:25.710> go

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
some people that stays some people go

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.050 
some people that stays some people go
that<00:01:25.950> goes<00:01:26.130> away<00:01:26.280> some<00:01:26.729> people<00:01:26.970> would

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
that goes away some people would

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.960 
that goes away some people would
slightly<00:01:28.020> flip<00:01:28.409> fades<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.670> been<00:01:29.820> like

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
slightly flip fades but it's been like

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.819 
slightly flip fades but it's been like
almost<00:01:30.210> ten<00:01:30.509> years<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:31.140> me<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.619> not

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
almost ten years for me and it's not

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.899 
almost ten years for me and it's not
even<00:01:31.890> faded<00:01:32.460> at<00:01:32.579> all<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:34.159> guess<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.189> skin

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
even faded at all so I guess my skin

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.999 
even faded at all so I guess my skin
just<00:01:35.939> holds<00:01:36.299> Inc<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.689> well<00:01:38.299> have<00:01:39.299> these

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
just holds Inc really well have these

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.730 
just holds Inc really well have these
say<00:01:41.009> Jesus<00:01:41.460> lives<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.899> sides<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:43.380> hands

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
