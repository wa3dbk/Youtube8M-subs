00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
caster is but I think it could be like

caster is but I think it could be like
books<00:05:52.680> this<00:05:52.860> or<00:05:53.040> something<00:05:53.340> because<00:05:53.430> it's<00:05:53.550> a

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
books this or something because it's a

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.160 
books this or something because it's a
number<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.090> legs<00:05:54.240> or<00:05:54.480> casters<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:54.960> in<00:05:55.110> the

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
number of legs or casters and in the

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.690 
number of legs or casters and in the
lead<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:56.550> your<00:05:56.580> hands<00:05:58.970> it's<00:05:59.970> talking<00:06:00.570> about<00:06:00.960> a

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
lead to your hands it's talking about a

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.670

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
height of the bed and everything I think

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.960
