00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.490
 Now Matías is going to tell us in detail 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.170
 how a pos terminal works and how 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.960
 we must do the installation 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.750
 from the zero minute that is from since 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.560
 the box reaches the merchant with the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.270
 terminal by Matías tell me how should 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.400
 do the merchant with all these 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.010
 cables and laws alejandro 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.550
 the first important thing to mention is that 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.440
 as they had indicated previously or 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.019
 2000 offers three types of POS terminals 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.400
 with an ayala terminal that uses the 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.860
 telephone line which is the state of 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.900
 terminal saga mood that looks or 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.760
 wireless and in exceptional cases 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.589
 Internet terminals used by the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.530
 internet but let's now show them 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.720
 the other daia other consideration is 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.370
 that I com offers for what it is 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.150
 montevideo the already metropolitan and 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.970
 maldonado 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.400
 On-site installation terminals 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.290
 by technicians of ge com 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.120
 so what we're going to focus on 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.950
 would be what would be a trade of the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.290
 interior of the country to which you will get 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.300
 the box per order and must do 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.290
 that the initial installation of the terminal 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.780
 perfect now contame 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.160
 that should that is the first thing that should 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.170
 do the commercial 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.030
 the merchant basically to take out the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.860
 terminal of the box and connect in a 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 first instance feeding 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.210
 electrical equipment for which for a 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.090
 side have what is the transformer 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.520
 connect the cable that goes from the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.190
 transformer I did with plugging in the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.770
 220 volts power socket 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.370
 and on the other side connect it to the pointer 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.410
 of the terminal that pos is important 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.900
 mention Alejandro to you at all 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.880
 merchants that these terminals are 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.080
 designed to work in a way 7 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.910
 by 24 for which it is not necessary and we 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.800
 advises unplugged during the weekends 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.080
 week or night and do not leave it 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.880
 always connected to the electricity network 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.590
 on the other hand and as a second step a 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.860
 time I already have the terminal post 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.140
 connected is to place it to the network 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.900
 antel phone that is what happens 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.240
 If I already have a good telephone line 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.380
 if you already have a telephone line and 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.300
 you have a phone in that line 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.550
 telephone what you're going to have to do 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.280
 is buying at a hardware store in a house 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.210
 of electronics a signal enjoyer 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.500
 a telephone signal marker which 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.790
 connected in the box is going to have two 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.530
 outputs on a based connect 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.870
 again the phone and in the other 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.150
 just connect the cable that comes inside 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.270
 from the box the telephone cord and in 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.620
 the other pointer will go to the same pointer 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.930
 what are we talking about the terminal post 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.850
 perfect would be a dual tab that is going 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.980
 to allow having both lines 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.510
 phone calls let's say the two teams 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.420
 connected the same telephone line 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.540
 it's worth another question I have 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.760
 use the pos terminal and the phone 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.420
 At the same time I have to choose between 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.680
 either there around was Alejandro 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.750
 you can have the two computers connected 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.250
 to the same telephone line but not 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.170
 they can work at the same 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.420
 what does that mean and if in some 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.980
 moment the merchant is talking 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.120
 phone is occupying the line through 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.710
 of the telephone 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.540
 the terminal is not going to work 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.130
 will be able to connect to the host to 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.350
 authorize a credit transaction of 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.480
 debit the same to the setback in the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.209
 case that he owns is connected to a 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.770
 authorized to process a transaction 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.940
 of credit or debit is not going to be able 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.350
 use the phone at that time 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.900
 because the line is going to be busy 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.180
 perfect let's see now how it's done 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.950
 a transaction first if you want to 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.739
 I show how the paper is loaded the seems 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.680
 it seems fine you inside the box go 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.900
 to receive a roll of paper say go 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.510
 paper is a thermal paper within the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.459
 manual together with the terminal 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.870
 comes an installation manual that 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.080
 basically it shows how are you 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.080
 connections
