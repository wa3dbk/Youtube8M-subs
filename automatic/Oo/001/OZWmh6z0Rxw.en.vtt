00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.630 

then<00:02:12.209> I'd<00:02:13.209> recommend<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:14.040> FX<00:02:15.040> pipeline<00:02:15.250> it's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
then I'd recommend this FX pipeline it's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.880 
then I'd recommend this FX pipeline it's
optional<00:02:16.209> but<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.390> really<00:02:16.900> really<00:02:17.230> hope<00:02:17.650> you

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
optional but I really really hope you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.970 
optional but I really really hope you
use<00:02:18.129> it<00:02:18.159> low<00:02:19.060> end<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.900> if<00:02:20.170> your<00:02:20.319> system<00:02:20.799> is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
use it low end that is if your system is

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.110 
use it low end that is if your system is
terrible<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.560> really<00:02:23.560> need<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:24.610> lowest

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
terrible and you really need the lowest

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.650 
terrible and you really need the lowest
possible<00:02:25.299> settings<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:28.299> I'm<00:02:28.390> going<00:02:28.599> to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
possible settings so I'm going to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.360 
possible settings so I'm going to
reorder<00:02:29.019> them<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:31.560> now<00:02:32.560> once<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.250> do

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
reorder them like that now once you do

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.190 
reorder them like that now once you do
that<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.910> you've<00:02:34.269> checked<00:02:34.599> FX<00:02:35.019> pipeline

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
that and you've checked FX pipeline

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.550 
that and you've checked FX pipeline
you're<00:02:35.680> going<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:35.860> have<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.040> check<00:02:36.250> HERE<00:02:36.610> and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
you're going to have to check HERE and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.750 
you're going to have to check HERE and
create<00:02:38.560> an<00:02:38.680> alternate<00:02:39.099> executable<00:02:39.819> that<00:02:41.760> will

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
create an alternate executable that will

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.229 
create an alternate executable that will
create<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.390> FX<00:02:43.659> pipeline<00:02:43.769> application<00:02:45.239> next

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
create the FX pipeline application next

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.910 
create the FX pipeline application next
to<00:02:46.329> your<00:02:46.480> Nomo<00:02:46.720> Sonic<00:02:46.959> Generations<00:02:46.989> Exe<00:02:47.799> there
