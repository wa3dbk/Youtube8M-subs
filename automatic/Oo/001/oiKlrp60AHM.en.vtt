00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
have nice hyper white headlights very

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
have nice hyper white headlights very
bright<00:01:50.450> all<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> rear<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
bright all right and in the rear when I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.289 
bright all right and in the rear when I
did<00:01:54.210> tail<00:01:54.540> light<00:01:55.820> all<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:57.119> across

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
did tail light all the way across

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.740 
did tail light all the way across
there's<00:01:58.229> three<00:01:58.469> LEDs<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.070> each<00:01:59.189> side<00:01:59.750> drill

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
there's three LEDs on each side drill

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.389 
there's three LEDs on each side drill
goes<00:02:00.930> out<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.290> cut<00:02:01.469> those<00:02:01.649> away<00:02:01.920> really<00:02:02.130> nice

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
goes out and cut those away really nice

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.120 
goes out and cut those away really nice
inside<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:04.170> stalled<00:02:04.530> three<00:02:04.770> LED

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
inside there and then stalled three LED

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.740 
inside there and then stalled three LED
so<00:02:05.369> I'd<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.759> tail<00:02:05.969> light<00:02:06.149> evenly<00:02:06.570> huh

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
so I'd like to tail light evenly huh

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.609 
so I'd like to tail light evenly huh
there's<00:02:06.990> an<00:02:07.049> orange<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.409> while<00:02:07.590> back

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
there's an orange one a while back

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.609 
there's an orange one a while back
probably<00:02:08.520> year<00:02:08.910> or<00:02:09.000> two<00:02:09.179> ago<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.690> there

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
probably year or two ago and there

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.210 
probably year or two ago and there
wasn't<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.459> used<00:02:11.730> one

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
wasn't that was used one

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.370 
wasn't that was used one
ad<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.610> there<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.300> looked<00:02:13.510> okay<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.320> the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
ad in there it looked okay and for the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.340 
ad in there it looked okay and for the
price<00:02:14.500> i<00:02:14.740> sold<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.070> for<00:02:15.130> high<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.580> was<00:02:15.760> fine

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
price i sold it for high it was fine

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.090 
price i sold it for high it was fine
again<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:17.500> one<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:17.770> i<00:02:17.800> went<00:02:17.950> ahead<00:02:18.010> and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
again this one here i went ahead and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.160 
again this one here i went ahead and
completely<00:02:18.970> cut<00:02:19.270> away<00:02:19.450> all<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.780> tail<00:02:19.960> light

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
completely cut away all the tail light

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.830 
completely cut away all the tail light
metal<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.910> whole<00:02:22.060> entire<00:02:22.420> taillight

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
metal so you the whole entire taillight

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.380 
metal so you the whole entire taillight
would<00:02:22.960> light<00:02:23.560> up<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.730> also<00:02:24.880> on<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.240> one

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
would light up and also on this one

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.670 
would light up and also on this one
since<00:02:25.510> this<00:02:25.630> one's<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:27.010> gift<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.620> went<00:02:29.620> ahead

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
since this one's a gift and went ahead

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.530 
since this one's a gift and went ahead
and<00:02:29.860> added<00:02:30.040> an<00:02:30.370> interior<00:02:30.850> light<00:02:31.030> as<00:02:31.180> well<00:02:31.360> it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and added an interior light as well it

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.720 
and added an interior light as well it
comes<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:31.930> once<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.010> switch<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.400> turned<00:02:33.430> on

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
comes on once the switch is turned on

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.750 
comes on once the switch is turned on
lights<00:02:34.450> interior<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:35.200> really<00:02:35.410> nice<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:36.640> can

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
lights interior up really nice you can

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.220 
lights interior up really nice you can
see<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:38.550> maybe<00:02:39.550> hamsters<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:40.270> way<00:02:40.420> there<00:02:41.080> we

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
see so maybe hamsters this way there we

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.990 
see so maybe hamsters this way there we
go<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.620> thought<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.220> interior<00:02:42.550> pretty<00:02:42.790> nicely

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
go I thought the interior pretty nicely

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.900 
go I thought the interior pretty nicely
have<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.740> little<00:02:45.010> bit<00:02:45.130> more<00:02:45.310> realistic<00:02:45.880> look

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
have is a little bit more realistic look

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.330 
have is a little bit more realistic look
I<00:02:46.180> guess<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.660> wanted<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.380> fix<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.770> when<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.130> open

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
I guess I wanted to fix it when you open

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.470 
I guess I wanted to fix it when you open
and<00:02:48.430> close<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.730> doors<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.120> would<00:02:49.209> turn<00:02:49.330> them

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
and close the doors it would turn them

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.420 
and close the doors it would turn them
off<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:49.930> but<00:02:49.959> too<00:02:50.709> small<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.100> car<00:02:51.280> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
off and on but too small of a car to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.830 
off and on but too small of a car to
install<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.790> switch<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.240> this<00:02:52.390> goal<00:02:52.600> wing

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
install the switch in this goal wing

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.660 
install the switch in this goal wing
doors<00:02:53.020> are<00:02:53.380> probably<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:54.430> going<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:56.670> accept

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
doors are probably not going to accept

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.520 
doors are probably not going to accept
the<00:02:57.850> switch<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.630> do<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.959> like<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.260> needed<00:02:59.440> to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
the switch to do that like it needed to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.590 
the switch to do that like it needed to
be<00:02:59.590> done<00:02:59.800> so<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.640> know<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.300> we<00:03:01.390> have<00:03:01.480> it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
be done so you know and we have it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.680 
be done so you know and we have it
Lamborghini<00:03:02.530> I<00:03:02.650> think<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.640> door<00:03:03.880> or<00:03:04.180> forgive
