00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:11.570
 recycling and eco-compatibility are a 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.300
 sometimes associated with sadness and poverty 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.960
 away from the ag and security of the 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.089
 consumerism good in this service 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.310
 we want you to know complements 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.800
 furnishings that take up recycling as 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.079
 starting point to then offer us some 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.110
 very practical and functional solutions e 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:35.900
 especially with very colorful ideas are 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.330
 sitting on furniture made with cardboard in 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.700
 part use a recycled cardboard 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:48.110
 which is then copied instead with a 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:50.780
 traditional plain cardboard while being 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.850
 made of cardboard are very durable facts 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.380
 you see I'm sitting normally on one 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.720
 cardboard chair I lean on a 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.930
 cardboard table this table 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.570
 weighs only 6 kg and can be 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.519
 also used by six people for the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.560
 its size is therefore thought 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.720
 especially for young people for singles 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.030
 therefore for a furnishing that does not cost 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.030
 excessively but extremely 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.030
 functional 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.990
 it is sent when a minimum volume 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 because all are removable and therefore 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.969
 they are easily assembled when given 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.450
 using plastic screws e 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:32.390
 therefore with a minimum expense it can be had 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.780
 a house also personalized because 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.689
 we can see that this table has a 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.850
 drawing that status is printed on this 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.619
 cardboard sheet directly so there 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.009
 they are machines that print up to 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.319
 three meters of cardboard sheets without 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.489
 interruption for which it can be 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.489
 customized with a required design 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.409
 and the same for these chairs that between 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.289
 the other then instead of the table 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.560
 they are made in decorative terms on 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.049
 printed pvc which is then glued with 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.649
 of ecological glues to the support of 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.649
 cardboard 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.230
 so we have a decor 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.960
 extremely functional economic 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.970
 ecological and therefore has all the 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.760
 features weighs little so it has 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.990
 all the features to be 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.950
 actually an answer to 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:36.040
 this modern furnishing needs 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.160
 material is made using gods 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.500
 in fact, normal cartons for packaging 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.530
 the company that produces them is a company 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.870
 which produced in traditional dances that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.060
 she found herself in trouble because the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.010
 Chinese market provides in dances of 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.900
 cardboard is extremely expensive 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.850
 lower then that you are 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.800
 reconverting through the 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.830
 collaboration with the designer roberto 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.400
 giacomucci in making this furniture 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.400
 extremely simple 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.680
 is a traditional corrugated cardboard that 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.170
 only through folds does it come 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.360
 made structural and possibly duties 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.720
 must bear more weight comes 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.879
 glued to another layer of cardboard 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.390
 so they are only gluing and 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.390
 folds
