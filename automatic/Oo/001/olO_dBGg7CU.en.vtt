so when the real flu comes along you'll

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.940 
so when the real flu comes along you'll
already<00:02:39.420> have<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> antibodies<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.590> fight<00:02:40.620> it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950

like<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:43.480> said<00:02:43.540> for<00:02:44.200> most<00:02:44.409> of<00:02:44.560> us<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.980> flu<00:02:45.220> is

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
like I said for most of us the flu is

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280 
like I said for most of us the flu is
more<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.760> nuisance<00:02:45.939> than<00:02:46.209> anything<00:02:46.510> else<00:02:46.780> we

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
more of a nuisance than anything else we

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.490 
more of a nuisance than anything else we
get<00:02:47.470> sick<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.920> then<00:02:48.189> we<00:02:48.280> get<00:02:48.370> better<00:02:49.319> but<00:02:50.319> for

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
get sick and then we get better but for

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.559 
get sick and then we get better but for
people<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.920> weakened<00:02:51.340> immune<00:02:51.670> systems<00:02:52.120> the

people with weakened immune systems the

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.979 
people with weakened immune systems the
flu<00:02:52.810> can<00:02:53.019> be<00:02:53.079> really<00:02:53.530> serious<00:02:54.720> that's<00:02:55.720> why

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
flu can be really serious that's why

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.929 
flu can be really serious that's why
doctors<00:02:56.470> usually<00:02:56.860> recommend<00:02:57.310> vaccinating

anticipate which strain of flu is going
to<00:03:27.120> be<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:27.390> one<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.780> rears<00:03:28.050> its<00:03:28.260> ugly<00:03:28.350> head

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
to be the one that rears its ugly head

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.820 
to be the one that rears its ugly head
the<00:03:30.120> flu<00:03:30.390> vaccine<00:03:30.630> that's<00:03:31.110> developed<00:03:31.590> for<00:03:31.800> a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
the flu vaccine that's developed for a

the flu vaccine that's developed for a
particular<00:03:32.130> year<00:03:32.610> immunizes<00:03:33.480> people<00:03:34.050> against

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
particular year immunizes people against

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.430 
particular year immunizes people against
that<00:03:34.560> one<00:03:34.800> flu<00:03:35.130> strain<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.840> if<00:03:36.990> you<00:03:37.110> get<00:03:37.260> hit

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
that one flu strain so if you get hit

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.390 
that one flu strain so if you get hit
with<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.620> different<00:03:38.040> strain<00:03:39.920> well<00:03:40.920> they

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
with a different strain well they

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.860 
with a different strain well they
usually<00:03:41.580> do<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:41.880> pretty<00:03:41.940> accurate<00:03:42.360> job<00:03:42.720> of

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
usually do a pretty accurate job of

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.350 
usually do a pretty accurate job of
guessing

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.370 

yeah<00:03:46.360> who<00:03:46.690> does

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
yeah who does

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.170 
yeah who does
if<00:03:48.740> you're<00:03:49.340> one<00:03:49.490> of<00:03:49.520> those<00:03:49.700> people<00:03:50.060> who

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
if you're one of those people who

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.150 
if you're one of those people who
doesn't<00:03:50.390> like<00:03:50.660> needles<00:03:51.200> doctors<00:03:51.980> have

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
doesn't like needles doctors have

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.010 
doesn't like needles doctors have
developed<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.670> way<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:52.850> offer<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.420> vaccine<00:03:53.840> as

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
developed a way to offer the vaccine as

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:03.390 
developed a way to offer the vaccine as
a<00:03:54.080> nasal<00:03:54.590> spray

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.959 

oh<00:04:03.959> right
