 in the sense of what he sings to you 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:53.230
 immediate but what makes you think 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.230
 for having quality 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.759

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.229
 classical Indian dance together 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.620
 contemporary and has created a very 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.870
 very fast dynamics of the directed 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.750
 by the radio choreographer narrate in 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.229
 he created a language of his own 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.270
 gaga is very interesting because it is 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.500
 a new style dance language 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.369
 cavaliers is currently the great lady of the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.400
 dance 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.550
 she is bringing to the festival the 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.130
 solos or blu and at some point he 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.979
 it ceases to be a solo, it becomes 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.440
 almost a priest and that he even 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.560
 Chinese company they have a quality 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.130
 only special one way to 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.790
 moving when it was identified that 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.739
 that is possible but the will to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.760
 trying to make the black swan is a 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:29.180
 company that was formed from the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.360
 athletes with dancers 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.750
 so she has always followed a line 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.330
 very vigorous athlete there are foci is 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.420
 the company alex neoral is the choreographer 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.959
 but one merges with the other they 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.620
 this festival will come back presenting two 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.980
 impose parts they show a side 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.739
 quite geared towards dancing 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.230
 contemporary and another show is 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.730
 based on the songs of roberto carlos 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.459
 in the situations that the songs are speak 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.220
 on the first act was born from a 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.190
 meeting of friends returning from a 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.220
 of a presentation that went to her was 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.829
 fundamentally it was necessary to be 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.820
 stage he was born with this vocation 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.489
 to be on stage all the time 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.380
 researching being more and more 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:28.040
 Brazilian and a show that they 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.550
 are in the 300 can cloud is the meeting 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.790
 in between 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.590
 the miners carlos drumond de andrade and 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.230
 milton birth 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.680
 hence we have also said that 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.740
 characterized by being a company that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.480
 works the classic and contemporary of 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.480
 a very interesting way 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.840
 to set up the international dance festival 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.610
 can fall in the dance in my opinion is 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.430
 that there are two fundamental things 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.890
 a technical team prepared for 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.340
 receive these companies and meet all 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.330
 the specificities of dance and a 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.580
 quite deep casting a 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.280
 importance of a dance festival as 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.940
 The apothecary in the dance for Brazil I 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.370
 I think it is precisely to present to the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.710
 public and national talent 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.470
 has been made today behind a 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.240
 international dance festival exists 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.530
 a galley is a huge team 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.660
 conducting this work in 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.020
 people can have total control of the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.020
 situation 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.629
 the apothecary festival in dance happens 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:51.539
 from April 29 to May 8 in cities 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.959
 from SÃ£o Paulo rio de janeiro curitiba 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.959
 Recife
