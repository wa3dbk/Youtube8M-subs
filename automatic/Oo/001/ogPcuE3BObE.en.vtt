00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
for potato chips so let's get started

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390 
for potato chips so let's get started
okay<00:00:21.820> so<00:00:21.880> here's<00:00:22.240> my<00:00:22.300> jicama<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.130> jicama<00:00:24.130> is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
okay so here's my jicama and jicama is

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.950 
okay so here's my jicama and jicama is
actually<00:00:24.759> a<00:00:24.790> root<00:00:25.029> vegetable<00:00:25.240> it's<00:00:25.660> kind<00:00:25.900> of

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
actually a root vegetable it's kind of

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.319 
actually a root vegetable it's kind of
considered<00:00:26.320> like<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:26.829> Mexican<00:00:27.279> potato<00:00:27.640> what

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
considered like the Mexican potato what

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.569 
considered like the Mexican potato what
I'm<00:00:28.390> going<00:00:28.540> to<00:00:28.570> do<00:00:28.689> is<00:00:28.960> just<00:00:29.110> cut<00:00:29.380> off<00:00:29.579> either

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
I'm going to do is just cut off either

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:37.139 
I'm going to do is just cut off either
side<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:34.239> so<00:00:34.390> it<00:00:34.660> makes<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:35.050> flat<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:37.030> it's

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
side just so it makes it flat so it's

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:45.090 
side just so it makes it flat so it's
easier<00:00:37.450> to<00:00:37.570> peel<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.620> then<00:00:44.710> we're<00:00:44.859> just<00:00:44.980> going

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
easier to peel and then we're just going

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.419 
easier to peel and then we're just going
to<00:00:45.129> use<00:00:45.309> a<00:00:45.340> regular<00:00:45.609> potato<00:00:46.090> peel<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:47.429> start

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
to use a regular potato peel and start

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:55.799 
to use a regular potato peel and start
slowly<00:00:48.989> peeling<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.199> jicama<00:00:54.539> okay<00:00:55.539> this<00:00:55.690> is

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
slowly peeling the jicama okay this is

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.689 
slowly peeling the jicama okay this is
all<00:00:56.019> peeled<00:00:56.410> I'm<00:00:56.769> going<00:00:56.949> to<00:00:57.039> go<00:00:57.160> ahead<00:00:57.219> and<00:00:57.550> do

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
all peeled I'm going to go ahead and do

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.250 
all peeled I'm going to go ahead and do
is<00:00:57.850> just<00:00:58.000> cut<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:58.510> up<00:00:58.660> into<00:00:58.809> smaller<00:00:59.170> chunks

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
is just cut this up into smaller chunks

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.500 
is just cut this up into smaller chunks
so<00:00:59.649> it's<00:00:59.829> easier<00:01:00.129> for<00:01:00.309> me<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.399> handle<00:01:00.789> I<00:01:03.510> have

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
so it's easier for me to handle I have

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.810 
so it's easier for me to handle I have
my<00:01:04.629> jicama<00:01:05.019> cut<00:01:05.199> down<00:01:05.379> into<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:05.860> little<00:01:05.950> hue<00:01:06.640> so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
my jicama cut down into a little hue so

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.130 
my jicama cut down into a little hue so
it's<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:06.970> little<00:01:07.090> easier<00:01:07.510> for<00:01:07.659> me<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:07.750> handle

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
it's a little easier for me to handle

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.780 
it's a little easier for me to handle
and<00:01:08.710> now<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:08.890> think<00:01:09.040> I'm<00:01:09.250> just<00:01:09.280> going<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.520> use<00:01:09.760> a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
and now I think I'm just going to use a

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.880 
and now I think I'm just going to use a
potato<00:01:10.300> peeler<00:01:10.570> on<00:01:10.990> because<00:01:11.440> I<00:01:11.470> want<00:01:11.620> these

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
my little spring yeah I'm gonna start

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.250 
my little spring yeah I'm gonna start
laying<00:01:33.800> down<00:01:34.010> my<00:01:34.970> jicama<00:01:35.330> chips<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:36.050> this

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
laying down my jicama chips in this

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.360 
laying down my jicama chips in this
thinner<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.860> smaller<00:01:38.260> your<00:01:39.260> chips<00:01:39.560> are<00:01:39.770> the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
thinner and smaller your chips are the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.680 
thinner and smaller your chips are the
better<00:01:40.580> results<00:01:41.030> you're<00:01:41.120> going<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.360> get<00:01:41.479> a

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
better results you're going to get a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.880 
better results you're going to get a
sphere<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.110> jicama<00:01:42.350> chips<00:01:42.620> are<00:01:42.710> going<00:01:42.800> to

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
sphere the jicama chips are going to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:02:16.530 
sphere the jicama chips are going to
come<00:01:43.010> out

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.970 

I'm<00:02:17.540> gonna<00:02:17.719> spray<00:02:18.019> down<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.379> top<00:02:18.650> so<00:02:18.859> it's

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
I'm gonna spray down the top so it's

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:32.770 
I'm gonna spray down the top so it's
malleable<00:02:19.400> spray<00:02:31.359> and<00:02:32.359> then<00:02:32.480> I'm<00:02:32.599> going<00:02:32.719> to

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
malleable spray and then I'm going to

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:52.680 
malleable spray and then I'm going to
dust<00:02:32.959> them<00:02:33.170> down<00:02:33.379> with<00:02:33.620> some<00:02:33.920> sea<00:02:34.489> salt

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.770 

so<00:02:53.690> they're<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.410> oven<00:02:54.850> 450<00:02:55.850> degrees<00:02:55.970> for

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
so they're in the oven 450 degrees for

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.170 
so they're in the oven 450 degrees for
about<00:02:57.080> 10<00:02:57.590> minutes<00:02:57.800> or<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.040> maybe<00:02:58.460> 10<00:02:58.700> or<00:02:58.850> 15

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
about 10 minutes or so maybe 10 or 15

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.630 
about 10 minutes or so maybe 10 or 15
minutes<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.450> rotated<00:02:59.870> them<00:03:00.280> twice

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
minutes I rotated them twice

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.760 
minutes I rotated them twice
during<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:01.940> time<00:03:02.140> I'm<00:03:03.140> gonna<00:03:03.260> let<00:03:03.440> them<00:03:03.560> cool

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
during that time I'm gonna let them cool

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:20.220 
during that time I'm gonna let them cool
down<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.340> then<00:03:04.730> we<00:03:04.790> back<00:03:05.210> for<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.540> taste<00:03:05.780> test

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.240 

and<00:03:21.230> really<00:03:21.500> like<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.740> way<00:03:21.830> these<00:03:21.950> came<00:03:22.160> out

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
and really like the way these came out

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.910 
and really like the way these came out
they're<00:03:23.000> crunchy<00:03:23.330> they're<00:03:24.110> salty<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.800> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
they're crunchy they're salty and it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.000 
they're crunchy they're salty and it
taste<00:03:28.130> very<00:03:28.250> similar<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:30.500> potato<00:03:30.800> chip<00:03:31.300> but

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
taste very similar to potato chip but

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.050 
taste very similar to potato chip but
you're<00:03:34.010> not<00:03:34.130> going<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:34.459> all<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.760> carbs

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
you're not going to have all the carbs

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.080 
you're not going to have all the carbs
that<00:03:35.209> potato<00:03:35.540> has<00:03:37.840> hmm<00:03:39.400> nothing<00:03:40.400> good<00:03:40.550> they

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
that potato has hmm nothing good they

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.910 
that potato has hmm nothing good they
really<00:03:41.360> think<00:03:41.630> just<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.200> trick<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.590> cut

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
really think just the trick is to cut

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.270 
really think just the trick is to cut
the<00:03:43.040> very<00:03:43.310> thin<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:44.120> very<00:03:44.209> small<00:03:45.130> so<00:03:46.130> they

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
the very thin and very small so they
