some nice details on the front and had

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470 
some nice details on the front and had
some<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> back<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.730> there<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> actually

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
some on the back and there is actually

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.170 
some on the back and there is actually
instruction<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.829> leaflet<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
instruction little leaflet but there is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
instruction little leaflet but there is
no<00:00:42.390> advertisement<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.649> nothing<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
no advertisement in it so nothing is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.520 
no advertisement in it so nothing is
seen<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.450> here's<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> minifigure<00:00:46.350> this

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
seen there so here's the minifigure this

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.380 
seen there so here's the minifigure this
set<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> he<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> pretty<00:00:47.820> cool<00:00:48.030> figure<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
set and he is a pretty cool figure I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.389 
set and he is a pretty cool figure I
like<00:00:48.660> his<00:00:48.809> face<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.320> his<00:00:49.500> face<00:00:49.770> does<00:00:50.070> come<00:00:50.309> in

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
like his face but his face does come in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
like his face but his face does come in
that<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.120> seven<00:00:51.660> dollars<00:00:51.960> city<00:00:52.350> set<00:00:52.559> or

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that I think seven dollars city set or

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
that I think seven dollars city set or
six<00:00:52.890> dollars<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.309> he<00:00:53.370> said<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:54.210> earlier

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
six dollars that he said from earlier

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240 
six dollars that he said from earlier
this<00:00:54.840> year<00:00:54.899> we're<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.860> kinda<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
this year we're just kinda like the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.639 
this year we're just kinda like the
police<00:00:56.489> chase<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.379> really

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
police chase and so it's not really

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.520 
police chase and so it's not really
particularly<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.460> rare<00:01:00.000> face<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.109> isn't<00:01:01.440> she

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
particularly a rare face but isn't she

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500 
particularly a rare face but isn't she

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
just way to get up and she does have

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060

basically it's a new piece and it makes

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
basically it's a new piece and it makes
the<00:01:15.900> next<00:01:16.290> show<00:01:16.470> which<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:17.820> like

finger<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.590> there's<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.400> nice<00:01:41.520> seats<00:01:41.820> on

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
finger and there's some nice seats on

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.160 
finger and there's some nice seats on
right<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.509> those<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:42.930> cheese

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
right here with those little cheese

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.010 
right here with those little cheese
slips<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> front<00:01:45.210> where's<00:01:45.869> that

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
slips and here is the front where's that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.340 
slips and here is the front where's that
gun<00:01:46.229> right<00:01:46.380> there<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> could<00:01:46.979> lower<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
gun right there but you could lower and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.510 
gun right there but you could lower and
position<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.590> any<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> want<00:01:50.220> because

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
position in any way you want because

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249 
position in any way you want because
it's<00:01:50.670> kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> moose<00:01:51.210> tear<00:01:51.479> which<00:01:52.110> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
it's kind of like a moose tear which is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
it's kind of like a moose tear which is
a<00:01:52.290> pretty<00:01:52.560> quad<00:01:52.829> x-play<00:01:53.220> feature<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:54.180> here's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
a pretty quad x-play feature then here's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
a pretty quad x-play feature then here's
a<00:01:54.570> side<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.170> here's<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> back<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> back

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
a side and here's the back and the back

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
a side and here's the back and the back
comes<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.909> really<00:01:57.119> cool<00:01:57.360> motor<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.689> like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
comes with a really cool motor I like

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.260 
comes with a really cool motor I like
this<00:01:58.560> detail<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> particular<00:01:59.850> detail

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
this detail it's a particular detail

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.109 
this detail it's a particular detail
from<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.899> fire<00:02:01.729> speedboat<00:02:02.729> rescue

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
from actually the fire speedboat rescue

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.860 
from actually the fire speedboat rescue
set<00:02:03.329> which

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
set which

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.840 
set which
kind<00:02:04.050> of<00:02:04.080> like<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.230> hard-to-find<00:02:04.890> set<00:02:05.220> which

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
kind of like a hard-to-find set which

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.060 
kind of like a hard-to-find set which
came<00:02:06.060> out<00:02:06.150> earlier<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.540> year<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.860> also

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
came out earlier this year and they also

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.490 
came out earlier this year and they also
have<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.000> similar<00:02:09.260> little<00:02:10.260> motor

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
have kind of a similar little motor

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.320 
have kind of a similar little motor
right<00:02:10.770> there<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.430> think<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.820> really

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
right there and I think it's just really

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.450 
right there and I think it's just really
a<00:02:12.690> cool<00:02:13.050> detail<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.190> could<00:02:14.340> position

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
a cool detail and you could position

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.340 
a cool detail and you could position
that<00:02:14.940> any<00:02:15.090> way<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.330> want<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.750> course<00:02:16.020> and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
that any way you want of course and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.980 
that any way you want of course and
here's<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> other<00:02:17.250> side<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.600> bottom

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
here's the other side and on the bottom

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.360 
here's the other side and on the bottom
there<00:02:19.170> are<00:02:19.200> these<00:02:19.410> two<00:02:19.680> things<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.100> make<00:02:20.220> it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
there are these two things to make it

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.370 
there are these two things to make it
home<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.820> guess

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
home I guess

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.530 
home I guess
a<00:02:22.440> little<00:02:23.280> bit<00:02:23.370> better<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:24.030> position<00:02:24.480> of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
a little bit better or position of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.880 
a little bit better or position of
better<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:25.080> not<00:02:25.110> sure<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.620> floats

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
better and I'm not sure if this floats

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.500 
better and I'm not sure if this floats
Bob<00:02:26.190> guessing<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.700> does<00:02:26.910> even<00:02:27.180> though<00:02:27.360> there

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
Bob guessing it does even though there

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.170 
Bob guessing it does even though there
are<00:02:27.540> holes<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> because<00:02:29.100> um<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.760> weight<00:02:29.940> on

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
are holes in it because um the weight on

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.360 
are holes in it because um the weight on
this<00:02:30.390> side<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> little<00:02:31.020> bit<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.380> steeper

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
this side is a little bit like steeper

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.280 
this side is a little bit like steeper
and<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.240> back<00:02:33.450> weight<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:34.020> make<00:02:34.170> it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
and the back weight you can make it

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.980 
and the back weight you can make it
heavier<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.250> holes<00:02:35.490> don't<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:35.940> sink<00:02:36.870> if

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
heavier so the holes don't like sink if

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.600 
heavier so the holes don't like sink if
I'm<00:02:37.200> not<00:02:37.410> really<00:02:37.530> good<00:02:37.770> with<00:02:37.800> boats<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
I'm not really good with boats on that

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.020 
I'm not really good with boats on that
but<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.240> really<00:02:39.360> sure<00:02:39.980> but<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.400> could<00:02:41.670> actually

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
but I really sure but you could actually

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.280 
but I really sure but you could actually
stay<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:42.720> guy<00:02:42.930> right<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:45.080> he<00:02:46.080> fits

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
stay for this guy right here and he fits

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.660 
stay for this guy right here and he fits
in<00:02:46.410> pretty<00:02:46.560> well<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.130> that's<00:02:47.280> really<00:02:47.370> it

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
in pretty well and then that's really it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.290 
in pretty well and then that's really it
for<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.910> set

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
for the set

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.910 
for the set
kind<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> small<00:02:48.750> set<00:02:48.990> but<00:02:49.230> really<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:49.650> a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
kind of a small set but really just a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.700 
kind of a small set but really just a
nice<00:02:50.100> detail<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.500> boat

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
nice detail and I just like it the boat

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.560 
nice detail and I just like it the boat
altogether<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.880> probably<00:02:54.180> one<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> best

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
altogether so probably one of the best

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.140 
altogether so probably one of the best
vehicles<00:02:55.200> from<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.830> polybag<00:02:56.160> set<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.730> year<00:02:56.910> so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
vehicles from a polybag set this year so

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.850 
vehicles from a polybag set this year so
that's<00:02:57.330> cool<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.720> now<00:02:58.020> let's<00:02:58.200> take<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.470> look<00:02:58.650> at

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
that's cool and now let's take a look at

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.070 
that's cool and now let's take a look at
fun<00:02:59.100> words<00:02:59.370> overall<00:03:00.360> actually<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.020> is

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
fun words overall actually think this is

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.200 
fun words overall actually think this is
a<00:03:01.200> very<00:03:01.470> cute<00:03:01.800> poly<00:03:02.070> bag<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
a very cute poly bag I like the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.850 
a very cute poly bag I like the
simplistic<00:03:03.630> style<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.350> boat<00:03:04.500> because<00:03:04.650> it

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
simplistic style of the boat because it

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.520 
simplistic style of the boat because it
reminds<00:03:05.100> me<00:03:05.250> kind<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.460> like<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.760> old<00:03:06.530> talent

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
reminds me kind of like the old talent

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.890 
reminds me kind of like the old talent
sets<00:03:07.740> from<00:03:08.040> like<00:03:08.250> denying<00:03:08.940> use<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> 80s

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
sets from like denying use in the 80s

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.290 
sets from like denying use in the 80s
and<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.980> minifigures<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.640> be<00:03:11.730> cool<00:03:11.970> even

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
and the minifigures to be cool even

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.940 
and the minifigures to be cool even
though<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.050> cheapest<00:03:13.470> way<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.590> get<00:03:13.800> him

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
though it is the cheapest way to get him
