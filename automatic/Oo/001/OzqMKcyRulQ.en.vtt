00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.910
 We report today from Bad Pyrmont from the game Spielpepe Pepe and went ahead 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.229
 on the AMI Chosen 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.399
 the Commander are included with the SSG Halvestorf one of the 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.399
 Over the team more district league and were therefore clearly favored 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.260
 Right from the beginning, the hosts took over the command and worked out 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260
 chance for opportunity 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.470
 Florian books with a great solo Torfrau box especially briefly shows up 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.470
 but unfortunately can not make this opportunity anymore 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.090
 the professional a Causen did not manage to break free 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 at the midline was always the last stop 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.420
 Christopher Loges is also Niebel now 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 and a super cougar 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.630
 and the hosts continued to steam 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 Marko i like also Florian Büchler 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.740
 it goes over on the left 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 that was close 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 Dennis postulates on Marko et al 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.350
 the flanks perfectly in the middle 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
 namely by Nico van Stegen could 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.700
 here comes a Causen then before the gate of Pusan ​​ensures that 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.250
 this one does not freeze 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.250
 otherwise he had almost nothing to do 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.860
 the hosts had a clear grip on the game 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.799
 in Blaumann you could really tell about the joy of playing 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.189
 During the week split from coach Wollitz and now is in Dreams 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.459
 Concentrate on the loose on the bench 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 April 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.449
 because of this magnificent free kick by Christopher Loges and he 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.779
 the VfB a break found no means against the PLO months 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:39.369
 Meanwhile, Brown got up like this 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.169
 over and over again books thrive over left OK 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.459
 even if the guests were literally invited by the host to dream 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.939
 did not take the chance 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.939
 Stephen Kirscht fails here 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.449
 Margrethe II on Florian Büchler 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.449
 he is followed by a free-kick from a promising position 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.079
 switched off for all nuclear power plants 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.639
 again Christopher Loges 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.639
 and this time just off 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.919
 because this scene somehow comes to tinker 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.389
 under 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.389
 four to zero for the 85 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.010
 We already know that Florian books on the left and will be back 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.089
 dangerous 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.999
 In the penalty loop, the parliament abolishes this flank and transforms into a cripple hype 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.999
 you 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.199
 at halftime two the Commander continue the better team however not 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.639
 more as compelling as at half-time one and from VfB stand at Backhausen 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.859
 listen better now 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.149
 You do not have that much room for the flowers 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.149
 the guests remained harmless 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.389
 The traveling buggers took his account with humor 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.389
 the host was also from the outset the favorite for this encounter 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.069
 the tour of controlled the game w 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.779
 Oetker 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.259
 fighting in one and a bandage 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.719
 the other one is on his way to the gate again 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.759
 but nothing came of it remained the 5 0 for the Commander 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.590
 here are some statistics and a few interesting games 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.330
 in the district league it remains exciting nature and stays on top and 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.150
 continue to fight with and exit 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.210
 We will continue to keep an eye on these two of the league and report it 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.259
 Next week's hype is on a game 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.199
 a key is a good week 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.559
