shooter looks like I hope they do this
but<00:02:50.189> it<00:02:50.280> might<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.489> part<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.909> TV<00:02:51.060> show<00:02:51.180> just

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
but it might be part of the TV show just

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.409 
but it might be part of the TV show just
a<00:02:51.569> cutscene<00:02:51.959> but<00:02:52.829> this<00:02:53.760> could<00:02:54.000> either<00:02:54.120> be<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
a cutscene but this could either be the

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.220 
a cutscene but this could either be the
evo<00:02:54.900> walker<00:02:55.650> or<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.639> surge<00:02:56.970> walker<00:02:57.359> as<00:02:57.719> it<00:02:58.019> has

be seeing a bulk and if you look you can

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.360 
be seeing a bulk and if you look you can
actually<00:03:24.840> make<00:03:25.109> these<00:03:25.290> characters<00:03:25.829> like<00:03:26.129> if

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
actually make these characters like if

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.619 
actually make these characters like if
you<00:03:26.699> don't<00:03:26.849> want<00:03:27.090> them<00:03:27.239> just<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.510> be

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
you don't want them just to be

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.089 
you don't want them just to be
minifigure<00:03:28.079> these<00:03:28.260> look<00:03:28.439> fairly<00:03:28.739> easy<00:03:29.010> to

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
minifigure these look fairly easy to

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.920 
minifigure these look fairly easy to
make<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.639> like<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.849> regular<00:03:30.150> 2<00:03:30.419> point<00:03:30.629> 0<00:03:30.720> style

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
make just like a regular 2 point 0 style

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.219 
make just like a regular 2 point 0 style
build<00:03:31.260> with<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.400> one<00:03:32.519> final<00:03:32.819> heads<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.229> then

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
build with the one final heads and then

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.689 
build with the one final heads and then
says<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.620> defeat<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.889> Queen<00:03:35.280> now<00:03:35.519> there<00:03:35.639> was

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.219 
says and defeat the Queen now there was
some<00:03:35.879> speculation<00:03:36.090> going<00:03:36.629> around<00:03:36.870> like<00:03:37.049> it's

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
some speculation going around like it's

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.140 
some speculation going around like it's
just<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.470> king<00:03:37.739> or<00:03:37.949> queen<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.639> these<00:03:38.790> invaders

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
just a king or queen of these invaders

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.809 
just a king or queen of these invaders
it<00:03:40.139> turns<00:03:40.409> out<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.889> is<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.489> queen<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:43.099> on<00:03:44.099> to

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
it turns out it is the queen so on to

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.729 
it turns out it is the queen so on to
the<00:03:44.909> next<00:03:45.090> set<00:03:45.389> of<00:03:45.419> pictures<00:03:45.689> this<00:03:46.470> will<00:03:46.620> be

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
the next set of pictures this will be

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.159 
the next set of pictures this will be
kind<00:03:46.919> of<00:03:46.949> quick<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.340> shows<00:03:47.579> breeze<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.659> I

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
kind of quick it shows breeze and I

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.159 
kind of quick it shows breeze and I
can't<00:03:49.829> quite<00:03:50.129> is<00:03:50.909> that<00:03:51.120> evo<00:03:51.659> I<00:03:51.689> think<00:03:52.049> it's

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
can't quite is that evo I think it's

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.759 
can't quite is that evo I think it's
evil<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:53.459> new<00:03:53.989> reimagined<00:03:54.989> evil<00:03:55.470> Walker
