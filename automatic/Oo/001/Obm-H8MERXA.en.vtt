because<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:24.500> a<00:00:24.830> pretty<00:00:25.369> killer<00:00:25.610> feature<00:00:26.500> one

thing<00:00:27.650> involves<00:00:27.980> me<00:00:28.130> is<00:00:28.190> when<00:00:28.369> it<00:00:28.490> loads<00:00:28.670> it

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
thing involves me is when it loads it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.240 
thing involves me is when it loads it
quickly<00:00:29.119> checks<00:00:29.449> your<00:00:29.570> twitter<00:00:29.930> feed<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.130> it

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
quickly checks your twitter feed so it

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.529 
quickly checks your twitter feed so it
actually<00:00:31.340> prevents<00:00:31.730> you<00:00:31.820> from<00:00:31.880> using<00:00:32.029> it<00:00:32.360> for

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
a few seconds it's not too bad but it's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.439 
a few seconds it's not too bad but it's
kind<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.579> annoying<00:00:34.789> i'll<00:00:35.030> show<00:00:35.210> you<00:00:35.300> what<00:00:35.390> i

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
listening this is a test i'm trying to

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.160 
listening this is a test i'm trying to
leave<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:10.789> message<00:01:11.210> let's<00:01:11.479> see<00:01:11.630> how<00:01:11.750> well<00:01:11.990> this

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
leave a message let's see how well this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.670 
leave a message let's see how well this
works

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.600 

and<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.130> went<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> landscape<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:23.280> actually

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and it went to landscape and actually

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.710 
and it went to landscape and actually
was<00:01:23.730> pretty<00:01:23.910> accurate<00:01:24.270> considering<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
was pretty accurate considering a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
was pretty accurate considering a
mountain<00:01:25.050> speaking<00:01:25.410> right<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
mountain speaking right at the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.710 
mountain speaking right at the
microphone<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.760> bit<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> distance

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
microphone a little bit of a distance

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.990 
microphone a little bit of a distance
here<00:01:28.490> I'll<00:01:29.490> zoom<00:01:29.550> in<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.910> little<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:32.000> but

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
here I'll zoom in a little bit there but

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
here I'll zoom in a little bit there but
I<00:01:33.270> mean<00:01:33.480> overall<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:34.020> accuracy<00:01:34.440> is<00:01:34.470> extremely

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
I mean overall the accuracy is extremely

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.400 
I mean overall the accuracy is extremely
high<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.730> over<00:01:35.970> 3g<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.600> night<00:01:37.020> using<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
high that is over 3g at night using the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.830 
high that is over 3g at night using the
silver<00:01:37.650> Wi-Fi<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:39.300> goes<00:01:39.480> to<00:01:39.570> show<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.750> you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
silver Wi-Fi and it goes to show you you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
silver Wi-Fi and it goes to show you you
know<00:01:40.050> real-life<00:01:41.180> instances<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.630> quickly<00:01:43.820> you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
know real-life instances how quickly you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.420 
know real-life instances how quickly you
can<00:01:44.850> go<00:01:45.090> let<00:01:45.330> me<00:01:45.420> switch<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.840> screen<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.290> but

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.010 

now<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.580> you're<00:01:50.700> done<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.510> you<00:01:51.900> can

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
now when you're done you just you can

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.680 
now when you're done you just you can

either rerecord and add more to it or

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.060 
either rerecord and add more to it or
you<00:01:54.900> hit<00:01:55.080> check<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:57.300> actually<00:01:58.070> posting

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
you hit check and it's actually posting

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.130 

remember<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.910> go<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.450> dentist<00:02:55.630> later
