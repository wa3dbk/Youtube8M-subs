00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
of the deaths aren't gonna be as good as

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.740 
of the deaths aren't gonna be as good as
a<00:02:37.530> top<00:02:37.950> 5<00:02:38.220> would<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.209> just<00:02:39.239> don't<00:02:39.600> want

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750
