absolutely fantastic world cup and with

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
absolutely fantastic world cup and with
that<00:01:11.729> 88<00:01:12.060> defense<00:01:12.510> looks<00:01:12.869> phenomenal<00:01:13.229> i<00:01:13.500> know

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that 88 defense looks phenomenal i know

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
that 88 defense looks phenomenal i know
the<00:01:13.830> 78<00:01:14.400> physical<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.049> has<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the 78 physical but that i think has to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.830 
the 78 physical but that i think has to
do<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.799> some<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> few<00:01:18.240> different<00:01:18.600> stats

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
do with some like a few different stats

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.090 
do with some like a few different stats
so<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.259> heading<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.619> probably<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> be

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so it's heading is probably going to be

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
so it's heading is probably going to be
a<00:01:20.130> lot<00:01:20.250> eighty<00:01:20.430> six<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:20.880> eight<00:01:20.939> seven<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.360> game

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
a lot eighty six or eight seven in game

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.870 
a lot eighty six or eight seven in game
but<00:01:22.110> i<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:22.860> preferred<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.640> EA

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
but i would have preferred that if EA

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.179 
but i would have preferred that if EA
kept<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> heading<00:01:25.049> rate<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.409> or<00:01:25.500> whatever<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
kept the heading rate in or whatever the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590 
kept the heading rate in or whatever the
way<00:01:26.460> he<00:01:26.700> looks<00:01:26.880> absolutely<00:01:27.150> phenomenal

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
way he looks absolutely phenomenal

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.390 
way he looks absolutely phenomenal

world-class player keeping the basically
the<00:01:45.180> same<00:01:45.329> stats<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.399> notice

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the same stats and if you if you notice

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.100 
the same stats and if you if you notice
I<00:01:48.000> certainly<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> defense<00:01:48.899> has<00:01:49.079> been

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I certainly have the defense has been

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
I certainly have the defense has been
knocked<00:01:50.009> down<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.280> lot<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.060> might<00:01:51.180> have

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
knocked down a lot I think it might have

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
knocked down a lot I think it might have
something<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.810> physical<00:01:52.170> stats<00:01:52.439> similar

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
something to the physical stats similar

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
something to the physical stats similar
like<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.360> fences<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
like it's not just to do the fences to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630 
like it's not just to do the fences to
do<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> blast<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.409> tackle<00:01:55.799> attack<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.399> all<00:01:56.490> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
do a blast and tackle attack on all that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.490 
do a blast and tackle attack on all that
so<00:01:57.180> am<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.659> why<00:01:57.810> defensive<00:01:58.290> players

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so am that's why defensive players

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
so am that's why defensive players
really<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.250> think<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.969> others

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
really that's what I think but others

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.240 
really that's what I think but others

next time guys his demaria for
Manchester<00:03:02.090> United<00:03:02.150> obviously<00:03:02.930> he's<00:03:03.379> had<00:03:03.560> a

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
Manchester United obviously he's had a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.500 
Manchester United obviously he's had a
position<00:03:04.129> change<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.549> a<00:03:04.699> center<00:03:05.060> attacking

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
position change to a center attacking

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.599 
position change to a center attacking
mid<00:03:05.659> which<00:03:06.139> is<00:03:06.349> kind<00:03:06.709> of<00:03:06.919> good<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.250> kind<00:03:07.489> of

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
mid which is kind of good it's kind of

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.059 
mid which is kind of good it's kind of
bad<00:03:07.790> because<00:03:08.299> he's<00:03:08.540> got<00:03:08.689> 90<00:03:09.019> pace<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.530> central

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
bad because he's got 90 pace and central

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.800 
bad because he's got 90 pace and central
it's<00:03:10.519> kind<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.819> a<00:03:10.909> waste<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.269> would<00:03:11.389> hoping<00:03:11.689> he'd

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
it's kind of a waste I would hoping he'd

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.929 
it's kind of a waste I would hoping he'd
be<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.989> right<00:03:12.230> wing<00:03:12.439> but<00:03:12.650> either<00:03:12.739> way<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.760> could

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
be a right wing but either way you could

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.610 
be a right wing but either way you could
probably<00:03:14.180> get<00:03:14.510> away<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.780> playing<00:03:15.139> him<00:03:15.319> striker

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
probably get away of playing him striker

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.110 
probably get away of playing him striker
even<00:03:16.040> though<00:03:16.129> he's<00:03:16.250> got<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.489> high<00:03:16.639> high<00:03:16.879> work

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
even though he's got the high high work

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.550 
even though he's got the high high work
rate<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.629> you'll<00:03:17.780> probably<00:03:17.840> sit<00:03:18.169> him<00:03:18.259> sent<00:03:18.470> of

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
rate so you'll probably sit him sent of

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.530 
rate so you'll probably sit him sent of
auto<00:03:18.739> cam<00:03:19.040> or<00:03:19.220> something<00:03:19.489> like<00:03:19.579> that<00:03:19.639> but<00:03:20.150> 90

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
auto cam or something like that but 90

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.530 
auto cam or something like that but 90

dribbling I'm just going to check on the

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.789 
dribbling I'm just going to check on the
console<00:03:46.870> what<00:03:47.870> his<00:03:48.019> shot<00:03:48.259> is<00:03:48.290> whether<00:03:48.620> it's

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
console what his shot is whether it's

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.559 
console what his shot is whether it's
been<00:03:48.889> upgraded<00:03:49.310> or<00:03:49.370> not<00:03:49.519> Beatty<00:03:50.000> six<00:03:50.389> shot

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
been upgraded or not Beatty six shot

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.449 
been upgraded or not Beatty six shot
he's<00:03:50.659> got<00:03:50.780> four<00:03:51.019> star<00:03:51.319> force<00:03:51.620> star<00:03:51.739> looks

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
he's got four star force star looks

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.009 
he's got four star force star looks
pretty<00:03:52.759> decent<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.359> certainly<00:03:53.750> seven

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
pretty decent and certainly seven

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.229 
pretty decent and certainly seven
passing<00:03:54.500> but<00:03:54.739> i'm<00:03:54.859> i<00:03:55.250> still<00:03:55.639> think<00:03:55.939> he'll<00:03:56.120> be

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
passing but i'm i still think he'll be

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.879 
passing but i'm i still think he'll be
probably<00:03:56.479> the<00:03:56.599> most<00:03:56.780> expensive<00:03:57.139> BPL<00:03:57.620> strike

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
probably the most expensive BPL strike

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.860 
probably the most expensive BPL strike
with<00:03:58.099> Falcao<00:03:58.549> but<00:03:59.090> his<00:03:59.269> dribbling<00:03:59.599> has<00:03:59.750> gone

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
with Falcao but his dribbling has gone

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.809 
with Falcao but his dribbling has gone
down<00:04:00.109> by<00:04:00.349> two<00:04:00.409> but<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:00.859> shots<00:04:01.040> gone<00:04:01.250> off<00:04:01.370> by<00:04:01.549> one

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
down by two but it shots gone off by one

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.379 
down by two but it shots gone off by one
so<00:04:02.419> I'm<00:04:02.569> over<00:04:02.870> always<00:04:03.049> had<00:04:03.229> a<00:04:03.259> pretty<00:04:03.829> decent

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
so I'm over always had a pretty decent

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.209 
so I'm over always had a pretty decent

strong and that card stock that 87
physical<00:04:28.009> is<00:04:28.099> going<00:04:28.280> to<00:04:28.370> probably<00:04:28.490> be<00:04:28.789> the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
physical is going to probably be the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.390 
physical is going to probably be the
difference<00:04:30.139> between<00:04:30.169> him<00:04:30.620> being<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.009> prices

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
difference between him being the prices

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.860

this<00:04:31.550> year<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:31.970> price<00:04:32.180> is<00:04:32.210> nectar<00:04:32.599> so<00:04:32.810> I

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
this year and the price is nectar so I

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.270 
this year and the price is nectar so I
think<00:04:32.930> I'll<00:04:33.139> be<00:04:33.199> more<00:04:33.409> expensive<00:04:33.740> next<00:04:34.159> year

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280
