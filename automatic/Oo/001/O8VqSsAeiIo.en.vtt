like this and the redness totally
disappears<00:04:37.350> well<00:04:38.010> then<00:04:38.220> there's<00:04:38.520> nothing<00:04:38.670> to

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
disappears well then there's nothing to

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.420 
disappears well then there's nothing to
counteract<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.410> greenness<00:04:40.890> if<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.250> don't<00:04:41.400> I

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
counteract the greenness if you don't I

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.100 
counteract the greenness if you don't I
mean<00:04:41.580> so<00:04:42.000> like<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.360> green<00:04:42.570> counteracts<00:04:43.020> the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
mean so like the green counteracts the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.570 
mean so like the green counteracts the
red<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.620> red<00:04:43.740> also<00:04:44.040> counteracts<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
red but the red also counteracts the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.970 
red but the red also counteracts the
green<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.210> they<00:04:45.660> balance<00:04:46.620> each<00:04:46.710> other<00:04:46.860> out

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
green and they balance each other out

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.590 
green and they balance each other out
but<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.460> if<00:04:47.520> there's<00:04:47.700> no<00:04:47.790> reg<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.300> put<00:04:48.450> on

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
but so if there's no reg to put on

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.110 
but so if there's no reg to put on
underneath<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.080> green<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.610> your<00:04:50.610> skin<00:04:50.850> can

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410

00:07:59.600 --> 00:07:59.610 
just so you can have that to refer to as

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.420 
just so you can have that to refer to as
well<00:07:59.760> if<00:08:00.000> we<00:08:00.150> are<00:08:00.390> sorting<00:08:01.290> out<00:08:01.410> drunkish<00:08:01.800> but

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:02.430 
well if we are sorting out drunkish but

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:09.279 
well if we are sorting out drunkish but
um

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:09.289
