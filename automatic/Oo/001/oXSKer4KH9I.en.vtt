00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
technical stats with a the main issue to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.380 
technical stats with a the main issue to
why<00:00:17.010> his<00:00:17.190> overall<00:00:17.550> essentially<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.240> it

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
why his overall essentially is what it

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.210 
why his overall essentially is what it
is<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> say<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:19.109> his<00:00:19.320> mental<00:00:19.680> stats<00:00:19.949> so

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
is I have to say is his mental stats so

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.590 
is I have to say is his mental stats so
we'll<00:00:20.369> see<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.670> they<00:00:20.850> grow<00:00:20.970> over<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> years

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
we'll see how they grow over the years

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.109 
we'll see how they grow over the years
but<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.140> see<00:00:22.289> left<00:00:22.500> footed<00:00:22.769> high<00:00:23.189> work<00:00:23.460> high

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
but you see left footed high work high

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.849 
but you see left footed high work high
work<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:24.600> medium<00:00:24.900> defensive<00:00:25.500> work<00:00:25.619> rates

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
work right medium defensive work rates

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
work right medium defensive work rates

five<00:00:27.900> foot<00:00:28.050> seven<00:00:28.289> again<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:28.980> uh<00:00:29.010> definitely

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
five foot seven again but uh definitely

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299 
five foot seven again but uh definitely
is<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> very<00:00:30.539> attacking<00:00:31.170> minded<00:00:31.619> fullback<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
is a very attacking minded fullback a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.620 
is a very attacking minded fullback a
very<00:00:32.850> attacking<00:00:33.210> mine

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
very attacking mine

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
very attacking mine
attacking<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.530> left<00:00:34.829> back<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.219> you'll<00:00:35.640> see

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
attacking my left back and you'll see

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.430 
attacking my left back and you'll see
over<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> years<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.510> how<00:00:36.630> he<00:00:36.690> grows<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.230> well

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
over the years with how he grows as well

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
over the years with how he grows as well
of<00:00:37.680> course<00:00:38.100> very<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:38.820> techno<00:00:39.239> stats<00:00:39.510> but

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of course very good techno stats but

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
of course very good techno stats but
again<00:00:39.930> his<00:00:40.410> defensive<00:00:40.950> stats<00:00:41.160> mentally

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
again his defensive stats mentally

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280 
again his defensive stats mentally
aren't<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.030> great<00:00:42.239> which<00:00:42.690> kind<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> hinders

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
aren't that great which kind of hinders

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
aren't that great which kind of hinders
his<00:00:43.469> uh<00:00:43.710> growth<00:00:44.610> essentially<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
his uh growth essentially because you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
his uh growth essentially because you
can<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.140> attack<00:00:46.379> position<00:00:46.770> actually

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
can see the attack position actually

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.200 
can see the attack position actually
goes<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.370> very<00:00:47.579> well<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.120> see

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
goes up very well but you can see

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.119 
goes up very well but you can see
physical<00:00:48.570> stat<00:00:48.750> growth<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:49.829> techno

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
physical stat growth as well as techno

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.380 
physical stat growth as well as techno
stat<00:00:50.340> growth<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> end<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.239> first

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
stat growth at the end of that first

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.900 
stat growth at the end of that first
season<00:00:51.600> crossings<00:00:52.410> already<00:00:52.739> at<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> 70<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.550> a

season crossings already at a 70 and a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.100 
season crossings already at a 70 and a
free-kick<00:00:54.120> accuracy<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.629> pretty<00:00:54.809> high<00:00:54.989> as

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
free-kick accuracy is pretty high as

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.600 
free-kick accuracy is pretty high as
well<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.860> pretty<00:00:56.070> good<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.489> know

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
well and which is pretty good you know

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.939 
well and which is pretty good you know
for<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> very<00:00:56.940> young<00:00:57.449> left<00:00:57.809> back<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.140> only<00:00:58.379> now

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
for a very young left back was only now

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
stamp type of curve actually in the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.960 
stamp type of curve actually in the
green<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:04.589> attack<00:01:05.250> position<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.729> great

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
green as well attack position is great

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.300 
green as well attack position is great
but<00:01:06.150> again<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.659> aggression<00:01:07.470> interceptions

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
but again on aggression interceptions

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
but again on aggression interceptions
are<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> what's<00:01:09.540> hindering<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.960> overall

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
are kind of what's hindering is overall

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.830 
are kind of what's hindering is overall
and<00:01:10.439> you'll<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.710> again<00:01:10.920> over<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> years<00:01:11.840> more

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and you'll see again over the years more

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.510 
and you'll see again over the years more
conditions<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.500> techno<00:01:13.740> studies<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.280> very

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
conditions to techno studies just a very

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.630 
conditions to techno studies just a very
technical<00:01:15.830> left<00:01:16.830> back<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.189> you'll<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.490> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
technical left back as you'll see that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
technical left back as you'll see that
crossing<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.630> basically<00:01:19.080> being<00:01:19.170> 69<00:01:19.650> overall

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
crossing for basically being 69 overall

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.160 
crossing for basically being 69 overall
but<00:01:20.340> eighty<00:01:20.549> crossing<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.450> absolutely

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
but eighty crossing is absolutely

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
but eighty crossing is absolutely
tremendous<00:01:22.380> their<00:01:22.979> tremendous<00:01:23.670> growth<00:01:24.060> from

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
tremendous their tremendous growth from

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.240 
tremendous their tremendous growth from
him<00:01:24.479> his<00:01:24.630> marking<00:01:24.930> he's<00:01:25.049> actually<00:01:25.200> good<00:01:25.500> as

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
him his marking he's actually good as

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
him his marking he's actually good as
well<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.790> some<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.150> his<00:01:27.270> tackling<00:01:27.630> attributes

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
well as some of his tackling attributes

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.109 
well as some of his tackling attributes
but<00:01:28.110> will<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.470> jump<00:01:28.710> forward<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
but will actually jump forward all the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.510 
but will actually jump forward all the
way<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.409> he<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.799> 78<00:01:32.220> overall

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
way to here to when he is 78 overall

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.370

over an 80 in this player growth test
but<00:01:57.240> again<00:01:57.509> I've<00:01:57.780> mentioned<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.469> plenty<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
but again I've mentioned it plenty of

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.950 
but again I've mentioned it plenty of
times<00:01:59.009> my<00:01:59.189> other<00:01:59.340> girl<00:01:59.520> test<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.360> why<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
times my other girl test that is why you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.330 
times my other girl test that is why you
don't<00:02:01.290> exactly<00:02:01.649> need<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> look<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
don't exactly need to look at the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.950 
don't exactly need to look at the
overall<00:02:02.610> level<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.360> mental<00:02:03.630> sets<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
overall level because mental sets have a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080 
overall level because mental sets have a
huge<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:04.710> part<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.640> certainly

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
huge you know part of it I certainly

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.380 
huge you know part of it I certainly
can't<00:02:06.390> affect<00:02:06.689> players<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> game<00:02:07.560> but

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
can't affect players in the game but

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.550 
can't affect players in the game but
mental<00:02:09.390> stats<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.690> affect<00:02:10.200> their<00:02:10.349> overall

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
mental stats just affect their overall

mental stats just affect their overall
completely<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:12.090> why<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.360> may<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.750> some

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
completely and is why you may see some

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
completely and is why you may see some
players<00:02:13.410> who<00:02:13.560> have

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
players who have

players who have
great<00:02:14.040> stats<00:02:14.340> overall<00:02:15.320> be<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.350> bit<00:02:16.620> lower<00:02:16.860> than

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
great stats overall be a bit lower than

great stats overall be a bit lower than
others<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.820> because<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.720> those<00:02:18.810> mental

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
others just because of those mental
