00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:07.130
 guys welcome to atv ok today I'm going 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.740
 to talk a little about how to break 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.629
 the food addiction first of all 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.940
 I want to tell you that it does not matter because 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.100
 this is past no matter your disorder 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.330
 food does not matter your bulimia 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.670
 anorexia you eat compulsively eating 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.520
 everything has a solution if you want to 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.400
 we can heal and I was super bad 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.220
 years with a really chronic disorder 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.030
 that I thought I was going to die with him and 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.800
 I did not have 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.289
 way to fix it and if you like and the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.789
 I found and the purpose of all these 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.350
 videos I feel what I do is 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.079
 share with you all the tools 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.149
 that will help me get ahead 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.239
 tell you that it does not matter if you have not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.399
 you're a broken person, you're not - not 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.739
 is defective is not simple and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.780
 you are simply our disorder 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.489
 nutritional was like we learn 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.799
 to handle all our frustrations 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.280
 our pain lastras wounds of the past 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:05.070
 and then other people will use 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.800
 alcohol others will use the work 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.159
 others will use a thousand substances ok 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.490
 we the happened to be full and 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.050
 ok nothing happens the thing is ok let's go 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.770
 take responsibility and let's do 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.200
 something about it ok then 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.979
 Usually if you take an inventory 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.869
 inventory of your story with food 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.840
 that I would like you to do 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.050
 you will begin to write your first memory 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 with food or your whole history of 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.510
 what when she has been small with 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.700
 rather 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.130
 start well because you realize that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.980
 It was not great since you started with 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.950
 a compulsive cause all 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.659
 we usually bring a story 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.700
 since we are children 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.110
 complicated with a meal for example 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.330
 I 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.160
 I became addicted to sugar at 5 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.790
 years without knowing it because he was in a 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.790
 activity and I was with my way of 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.790
 intuitively 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.590
 make me feel better because sugar is 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.390
 a drug that acts in the part of the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.330
 brain where drugs like the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.050
 morphine and we're going to be in this 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.210
 feeling of well-being then it is 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.430
 important nothing else you understand and 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.950
 that you see in a living your problem and 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.320
 that yes you realize that not everything is 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.420
 vanity that not everything is that you want to be 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.650
 skinny and you die for being skinny because 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.920
 although if a little bit is not really what 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.420
 behind your eating disorder but 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.270
 that simply and simply this 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.880
 desperation to feel better and is 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.710
 well I do not want you to judge yourself by 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.400
 that I want you to understand 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.710
 and I want you to start with love 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.320
 transformation and healing process 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:57.610
 because this disorder can kill us 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.380
 ok so here I want to tell you how 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.140
 begin to break addiction 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.750
 food one is abstaining altogether 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.760
 of the foods that detonate sugar 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.370
 refined carbohydrates that are the ones 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.520
 they usually detonate everyone who 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.590
 abstain completely 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.020
 here I'm going to spend very 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.800
 superficially by two points and the 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.620
 I'm going to go deeper and look at a lot 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.900
 more structured is everything on my blog 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.489
 that I'm going to put down this video I'm going 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.720
 to put the link to my page so that you 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.590
 subscribe you are arriving 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.680
 constantly written and already much better 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.450
 raised everything I put here for you 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.909
 example number one that you do not have to cut 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.519
 with physical addiction our body 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.829
 body already has an addiction to certain 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.989
 certain substances like sugar like 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.610
 the carbohydrate because all of them in 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.830
 our brain in general 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.200
 and they help generate some chemicals that we 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.300
 make you feel better ok do not judge yourself 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.400
 because you like cookies do not you 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.960
 you judge because you get stuck with candy what 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.120
 only you are looking for and feel 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.540
 better and it's okay now let's look 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.250
 other ways ok then to start 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.140
 this would cut answer to clean the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.370
 physical body and I am doing it myself 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.000
 I started doing it and I do it 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.400
 constantly with green juices be 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.090
 I the first time that I cut with my 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.040
 that I was going to recover from my 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.080
 bulimia 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.780
 I literally abstained from the compliment 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.180
 for 10 days and all my food was 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.770
 liquid to start cutting with the 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.460
 physical addiction of my body to the 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.490
 food then it is a look good 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.699
 kind 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.120
 and do it which also cut with 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:46.330
 mental addiction we do not get used to 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.380
 to make our brains like a 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.270
 computer 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.280
 then it is customary that if I eat a 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.960
 cookie is going to eat the package these 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.759
 they're like schedules because that's what 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.979
 we do and we do it for so long 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.259
 already it stays in automatic then 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.580
 when you no longer want to share all the 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.620
 package plus it's like a 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.539
 you can not because you are already pushing 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.520
 your programming to eat all the 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.610
 package then it's not that you're weak and 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.409
 that you do not have willpower and do not 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.700
 be simple you essentially have a 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.670
 programming and in your mind 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.500
 which is very difficult to cut and that 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.210
 pushes that many times it is stronger 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.060
 that if we push us you have to 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.610
 cut with the consell that I recommend 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.160
 that you tell someone your best 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.800
 friend 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.170
 whoever you have a lot 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.970
 trust that you have the problem for 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.160
 when you want to binge 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.300
 vomit or not eat and jump out of a 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.530
 food talk on the phone and say it 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.180
 because because that is going to help that 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.500
 binge head companies are going to 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.750
 talk on the phone because you're already 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.790
 doing something that will replace the 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.160
 that you go to bingeing ok 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.050
 then we are going to cut 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.060
 interrupting by electrons 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.160
 with those customs it becomes customary 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.790
 that break with the customs also 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.970
 then ok you 're not weak ok 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.040
 you have a schedule you have created 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.930
 because you have done it and you have done it and 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.760
 repeated the cycle so many times already 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.710
 it's in your mind and there are schedules 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.380
 of your body you have the addiction to 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.130
 food everywhere like I had it 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.860
 and you have to cut back then if 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.660
 Now you can do those two things and the 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.660
 with a nutritionist with a person 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.670
 holistic 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.200
 that can give you a good diet of 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.320
 detoxification to start 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:36.610
 detoxify your perfect body if not 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:39.340
 they sell www.goarmy.com and then the water 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.830
 with the work of this video 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.410
 subscribe and I'll send you the one 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.199
 I did what I do so that the 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.750
 can continue to do it and the other 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.150
 is that you get someone more trust 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.820
 that you know you will not judge and 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.160
 that will only listen to you so you can 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.810
 speak the exact juanin so that someone 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.430
 which you can talk to him at the moment 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.690
 you want to binge at the moment 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.010
 that you want to try a meal in the 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.530
 moment you want to throw up because 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.540
 we need to start cutting with that 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.160
 automatic programming that we have 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.330
 in the brain and that we have in our 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.389
 body to do those rituals ok 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:19.260
 any place write me in my can 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:22.100
