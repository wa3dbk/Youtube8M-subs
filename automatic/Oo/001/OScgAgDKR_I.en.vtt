right back here at the bottom let's see
what<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.170> say<00:00:28.189> it's<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.599> box<00:00:43.070> this<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
what we can say it's like a box this is

what we can say it's like a box this is
supposed<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:50.989> well<00:00:51.989> let<00:00:52.289> me<00:00:52.410> build<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
supposed to be well let me build it and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
supposed to be well let me build it and
then<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.489> any<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.000> guys<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
then if any of you guys know what it is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.220 
then if any of you guys know what it is
you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.039> share<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.879> me<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you can share that with me because I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.840 
you can share that with me because I
don't<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.859> so<00:01:00.530> anyway<00:01:01.530> we'll<00:01:02.309> find<00:01:02.670> out

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
don't know so anyway we'll find out

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.200 
don't know so anyway we'll find out
together<00:01:03.120> maybe<00:01:04.640> there's<00:01:05.640> actually<00:01:06.030> two

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
together maybe there's actually two

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
together maybe there's actually two
little<00:01:06.540> things<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.960> build<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
little things to build in this so I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.710 
little things to build in this so I
guess<00:01:08.790> we'll<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.240> what<00:01:09.390> both<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> them<00:01:10.080> are

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
guess we'll see what both of them are

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.789 
guess we'll see what both of them are
together

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.510 

that's<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.070> pink<00:01:17.990> pieces<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.520> so

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that's a little pink pieces in this so

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.179 
that's a little pink pieces in this so
that's<00:01:20.729> kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.060> cool

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
that's kind of cool

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.630 
that's kind of cool
wait<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> minute<00:01:23.610> ah<00:01:24.590> well<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> course<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.220> had<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
wait a minute ah well of course I had it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:38.890

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.950 
you could see what the way the door was
turned<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:56.030> looks<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.180> we're<00:01:57.360> creating<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
turned there looks like we're creating a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.429 
turned there looks like we're creating a
box<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.530> top<00:01:59.570> but<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.659> doesn't<00:02:00.960> look<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.259> any

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
box on top but it doesn't look like any

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.740 
box on top but it doesn't look like any
kind<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.860> chair<00:02:02.369> or<00:02:02.670> anything<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:05.450> kind<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.540> feel
