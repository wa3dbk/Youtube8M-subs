00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello everyone today, I want you 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.450
 suggest to tie here such 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.410
 simple and original at the same time 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.770
 relief pattern such here relief 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.590
 pigtails fit he is very simple and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.359
 formed by 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:27.539
 broaches taken off the loop and due to broaches 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:30.990
 from the seamy side it looks like this 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.760
 front and back and from the front 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.440
 here comes such a kind of relief braid 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 and now we will tie such a pattern to us 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.620
 will need to dial 2 quantity 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.420
 loops is a multiple of four because we have 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.050
 there will be patterns through those 4 loops and so 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.350
 I scored 22 loops with regard to the edge 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.519
 and we start knitting the first row 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:11.090
 my pro knit 4 facial and 4 purl 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.090
 knit the entire series of 4 face and 4 purl 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.979
 to end of row 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 next row knit edging remove and 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:54.210
 knit 4 purl on we will 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.990
 knit this one this one 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.740
 pigtail 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.250
 it will consist of 4 loops 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.479
 we remove the first loop without proving 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.560
 next we do the facial 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:14.250
 nakid and stretch nakid and facial 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.870
 through the first loop taken, yet two loops 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.310
 stretch loop not shoot again 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:28.680
 knitting the following 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:33.050
 do a cape and these two loops are facial and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.720
 nakid stretch through the first shot 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:43.500
 like this further knit 4 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:48.260
 purl 4 purl and again 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.489
 repeat loop remove 1 front nakid 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:57.840
 and stretch through these two shot 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:03.860
 loops and again remove the loop 1 front 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:08.810
 put on and stretch through the shot and 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.810
 then again 4 purl 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:22.320
 the next row we knit according to figure 4 face 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:24.440
 and 4 purl all even rows we knit on 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.440
 pattern 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.220
 next row we knit 4 purl and 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.780
 here we will throw these 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.600
 alternate this broach that is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.910
 last row we did it here on the edges 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.520
 Now we are tying the first loop 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.640
 facial 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.540
 second we remove the third we knit 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.410
 facial 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:24.300
 we do nakid and we stretch through the removed 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:28.580
 loop and knit one face that is 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:37.230
 we broach is in the middle 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:41.870
 further 4 purl and again 1 under 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.870
 we knit the front we remove 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.050
 we knit the third one ; 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.240
 and stretch through the shot 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:59.240
 wrap up and face and stretch through 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.240
 shot and 1 facial on 4 purls 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.510
 and it turns out that we have such a relief 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.340
 pattern 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:18.140
 here are such here as pigtails further we 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:22.960
 we repeat from 1 row very original 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.960
 Looks when knitting poluver in blouses 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.020
