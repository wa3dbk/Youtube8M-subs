that<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.530> measure<00:00:46.739> progesterone<00:00:47.309> levels

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that if we measure progesterone levels

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.970 
that if we measure progesterone levels
and<00:00:47.969> through<00:00:48.329> pregnancy<00:00:48.540> in<00:00:49.230> fact<00:00:49.800> the

and through pregnancy in fact the

and through pregnancy in fact the
progesterone<00:00:50.280> levels<00:00:50.790> which<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.120> very<00:00:51.300> high

drop about three to five days before
birth<00:00:56.760> occurs<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.260> that's<00:00:58.469> become<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.860> very

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
birth occurs and so that's become a very

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.209 
birth occurs and so that's become a very
very<00:00:59.370> useful<00:00:59.750> indicator<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:01.020> us<00:01:01.140> however<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
very useful indicator for us however in

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.109 
the research into elephant progesterone
levels<00:01:05.009> we<00:01:05.100> found<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.489> their<00:01:05.640> levels<00:01:05.970> are

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
levels we found that their levels are

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.969 
levels we found that their levels are
actually<00:01:06.509> a<00:01:06.660> lot<00:01:06.899> lower<00:01:07.200> than<00:01:07.350> many<00:01:07.740> many

when the elephant calf would be born

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.480 
when the elephant calf would be born
because<00:01:48.079> there<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.560> many<00:01:49.590> complications

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
because there are so many complications

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.289 
because there are so many complications

that can occur with a calf delivery and

that can occur with a calf delivery and
obviously<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.840> needed<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.710> hands

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
progesterone I think on a Monday and we

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.069 
progesterone I think on a Monday and we
confirmed<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.430> she<00:02:31.640> was<00:02:31.670> at<00:02:31.909> baseline<00:02:32.269> over

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079

the<00:02:33.170> next<00:02:33.349> two<00:02:33.620> days<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:34.129> then<00:02:34.640> he<00:02:34.819> was<00:02:34.939> born

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the next two days and then he was born

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.460 
the next two days and then he was born
on<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.359> Friday<00:02:35.629> so<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:36.019> was<00:02:36.109> sort<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.319> four

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
on the Friday so it was sort of four

on the Friday so it was sort of four
days<00:02:36.650> between<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.459> drop<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.180> progesterone

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
and the calf being born so it's very

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.809 
and the calf being born so it's very
