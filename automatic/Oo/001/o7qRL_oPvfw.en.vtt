00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
run I needed a gap between us on the 17
and<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.810> didn't<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.229> gap<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.799> may

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and we just didn't have that gap I may

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.010 
and we just didn't have that gap I may
be<00:01:32.009> needed<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.430> drag<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> break<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.420> try<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
be needed to drag the break and try and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.950 
be needed to drag the break and try and
push<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.409> 88<00:01:34.829> back<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.490> slow<00:01:36.060> him<00:01:36.299> down<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.780> we

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
push the 88 back and slow him down so we

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
push the 88 back and slow him down so we
could<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.320> run<00:01:37.560> at<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.040> um<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
could get a run at it but um you know I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
could get a run at it but um you know I
just<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.659> thought<00:01:39.840> jr.<00:01:40.110> had<00:01:40.290> pushed<00:01:40.470> me<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
just I thought jr. had pushed me up to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
just I thought jr. had pushed me up to
the<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.070> bumper<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.460> him<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.790> I'd<00:01:41.850> side

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the back bumper of him and I'd side

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.120 
the back bumper of him and I'd side
draft<00:01:42.450> him<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.720> go<00:01:42.810> by<00:01:42.990> him<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.860> there

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
draft him and go by him but and there

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.289 
draft him and go by him but and there
would<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.280> me<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.579> junior<00:01:44.880> over<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
would be me and junior over here at the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.469 
would be me and junior over here at the
line<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.409> wasn't<00:01:47.189> meant<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.640> learned

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
line but it wasn't meant to be I learned

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.030 
line but it wasn't meant to be I learned
a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.720> bit<00:01:48.840> there<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:49.740> juniors

checkered<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.049> but<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.319> did<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.799> so<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.160> was

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
checkered in but we did and so it was

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.890 
checkered in but we did and so it was

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
beginning of the race could have been a

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.640 
beginning of the race could have been a
nice<00:02:51.000> single<00:02:51.209> file<00:02:51.540> line<00:02:51.810> like<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.230> was<00:02:52.379> when<00:02:52.530> i

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
nice single file line like it was when i

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.380
