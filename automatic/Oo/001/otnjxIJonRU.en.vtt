00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.479 
MEMS drive much are the h HD service i
didn't<00:02:33.700> drive<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:36.100> supposed<00:02:36.400> to

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
didn't drive that for it's supposed to

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.620 
didn't drive that for it's supposed to
be<00:02:36.580> something<00:02:36.820> like<00:02:36.910> independent<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:37.480> they

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
be something like independent but they

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.940 
be something like independent but they

shrimper very much so this is new for me

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.449 
shrimper very much so this is new for me
too<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.870> don't<00:02:41.170> think<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.470> know<00:02:41.530> his<00:02:41.770> answers<00:02:42.190> and

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
too I don't think I know his answers and

and there you saw that was inside a

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.050 
and there you saw that was inside a
sugar<00:04:11.170> cabinet<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.190> this<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.460> decently<00:04:12.850> she

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
sugar cabinet and this is decently she

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.880 
sugar cabinet and this is decently she
saying<00:04:13.270> I<00:04:13.590> all
