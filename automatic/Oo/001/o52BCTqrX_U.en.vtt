00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
cook Indian tacos but instead of frying

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.470 
cook Indian tacos but instead of frying
them<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.230> use<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.800> pizza<00:03:50.400> stone<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> oven

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
and get it as hot as hot as I can and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.870 
and get it as hot as hot as I can and
it's<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.840> like<00:03:55.140> within<00:03:55.530> two<00:03:55.950> minutes<00:03:56.580> it

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880

puffs<00:03:57.630> up<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.200> know<00:03:58.290> because<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.650> heat<00:03:58.860> so

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
puffs up you know because of the heat so

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.059
