00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.309
3D printing is the process of making a three-dimensional
solid object from a digital model.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.820
3D printing, or additive manufacture, is where
layer

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.180
upon layer of material is built up to make
an object.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.130
The beauty of this technique is that almost
any

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.060
shape can be created in this way.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.230
So, how do you actually print something in
3D?

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.110
There’s a few stages that a project will
need to go through.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.379
First, a design for the object needs to be
completed.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.460
This computer generated model is sliced into
cross-sections for the printer to use as a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.960
guideline.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.610
The next step is printing the object.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.600
The 3D printer reads the blueprint and lays
down

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.739
successive layers of material to build the
model.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.220
A diverse range of materials can be used such
as

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.360
plastics, metal, paper and ceramic.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.800
As each layer is printed, it sticks to the
previous

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.629
one to create a cohesive final shape.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.140
3D printers are capable of printing complex
layers that can

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.740
form moving parts, like hinges and wheels,
as part of the same object.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.600
You could build a bicycle - with handlebars,
frame,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.549
wheels - readily assembled, without the need
for any tools.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.000
You just have to leave gaps in the right spots.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.960
3D printing is used across a variety of industries
such as

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.630
high-end manufacture, where it’s used for
rapid prototyping and research.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.899
This allows designers and concept developers
the flexibility

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.590
to produce parts and models on demand.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.509
They are then able to modify these as required.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.140
And finally, 3D printing is pushing healthcare
into new areas.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.240
It’s being used to make medical parts such
as custom hearing

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.490
aids and braces and even to reproduce body
parts like customised

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:05.129
hip implants or prosthetic hands in exact
proportions to fit the patient.
