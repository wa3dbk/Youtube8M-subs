 this is the usual sales package 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.359
 htc kaka pack already entered many 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.239
 terminals here sideways we have many 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.850
 device information as well 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.020
 in the back however we can the tower

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.210
 entirely of recycled material 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.350
 so let's open the package 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.969
 where we have the terminal here right away 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 we will see more more 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.780
 deepened after we remember the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.520
 dual sim terminal we have the varies 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.520
 we launch analysts and you can see it 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:04.260
 we have the power supply vs 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 Micro USB socket from USB wall outlets

 we have the micro usb usb cable and we have 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.770
 even the earphones I am 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.530
 the usual htc earphones for i 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.570
 cheap terminals that already had the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.549
 chance to try for others 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 terminals that are of a quality 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.770
 we say appropriate to the price of the terminal 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.120
 that we remember and is sold to a 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.000
 price of 199 euros 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.040
 so many have immediately taken the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.560
 telephone phone with dimensions 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.920
 important to be a phone of 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.030
 this price because high 140 x 72 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 us is the 7mm thick for 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.030
 160 grams a little pesantino to be a 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.660
 terminal with a 5 to 5 display 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.250
 inch 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.990
 then let's go a little bit then a 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.180
 remove the protective film 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.090
 the plastic film in front of the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:06.230
 display without destroying everything here 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.470
 done then display as already mentioned 5 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.950
 inches with a recitation of pixels i 220 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.570
 pixels per inch that have 960 x 540 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.760
 pixel and it is a tft display then we have 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.340
 as a processor like this terminal is 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.380
 a snapdragon 200 processor from the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.170
 qualcomm quad core with a gpu adreno 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.070
 302 and as the processor frequency from 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.600
 1.2 gigahertz gigabytes of ram 4 gb of 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.760
 Integrated memory expandable through 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.530
 microsd then we go to open the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.330
 terminal here from the door in the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.310
 back where we can see that we have 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.900
 double sim management with the two sims 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.540
 normal informed we have here 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.030
 micro sd e memory expansion 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.360
 let's go to the 1950 milian battery for 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.620
 now let's go we don't have and I did like it 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.950
 you can see below we have 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.630
 the black system speaker we find 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.780
 a 5 megapixel camera with 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.100
 autofocus and led flash that records video 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.170
 at 720p 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.330
 we have the 2 megapixel camera which 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.250
 the part at the front 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.100
 as you can see beyond the fact that 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.660
 here we have the three foreign keys to the 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.040
 display back home and settings 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.410
 let's go for a while and then turn on 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.900
 the terminal here sideways from this 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.830
 from this button here sideways 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.870
 on the other hand we have 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.580
 volume rocker below we have the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.440
 microphone the possibility of opening the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.030
 rest of the terminal 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.010
 we have the microusb port for the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.230
 Reload 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.569
 the terminal and we have the audio jack from 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.180
 three and a half 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.900
 furthermore we can note that only the sim 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.079
 one is enabled in umts racine two no 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.730
 is the network on sim 1 and at the speed hs 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:04:01.150
 upi has therefore 21 megabits per second 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:03.159
 we also have bluetooth 4.0 and hers 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.750
 interior now we have only quickly 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.920
 to show then everything we will see 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.209
 together in the complete review of the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.890

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.330
 automatic brightness does not have the sensor 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.870
 of brightness however you can see that 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.669
 this is the display and we have the 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.000
 same carroccio interface seen on 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.460
