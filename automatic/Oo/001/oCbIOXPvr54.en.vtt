00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
beta 15 rundown of the sniper abilities

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.919 
beta 15 rundown of the sniper abilities
now<00:00:12.420> your<00:00:12.960> sniper<00:00:13.200> has<00:00:13.710> two<00:00:14.250> main<00:00:14.910> builds<00:00:15.630> that

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
now your sniper has two main builds that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.769 
now your sniper has two main builds that
I<00:00:15.960> can<00:00:16.260> see<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.820> snapshot<00:00:18.300> where<00:00:18.600> they

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
I can see one is for snapshot where they

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.050 
I can see one is for snapshot where they
can<00:00:19.020> move<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.470> fire<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.580> other<00:00:20.760> is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
can move and fire and the other is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.779 
can move and fire and the other is
disabling<00:00:21.990> shot<00:00:22.260> where<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.220> cannot<00:00:23.519> move

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
disabling shot where they cannot move

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.189 
disabling shot where they cannot move
and<00:00:24.119> fire<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> same<00:00:25.859> turn<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> first

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
and fire on the same turn so the first

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.689 
and fire on the same turn so the first
thing<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.410> course<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:28.980> squad<00:00:29.250> site<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
thing of course they have squad site the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.359 
thing of course they have squad site the
next<00:00:30.029> level<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:30.900> Lance<00:00:31.199> Corporal<00:00:31.529> they

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
next level we have Lance Corporal they

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220 
next level we have Lance Corporal they
can<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.669> low<00:00:32.850> profile<00:00:33.239> gun<00:00:33.510> sling<00:00:33.809> or<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> lone

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
can have low profile gun sling or a lone

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
can have low profile gun sling or a lone
wolf<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:35.070> typically<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.910> more<00:00:36.090> than<00:00:36.210> one

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
wolf now typically I have more than one

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.860 
wolf now typically I have more than one
sniper<00:00:36.660> they're<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:38.239> set<00:00:39.239> up<00:00:39.360> seven<00:00:39.690> tiles

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
sniper they're not set up seven tiles

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.540 
sniper they're not set up seven tiles
away<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.379> each<00:00:40.469> other<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.309> good

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
away from each other so that's not good

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
away from each other so that's not good
they<00:00:42.480> usually<00:00:42.780> don't<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.200> resort<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
they usually don't have to resort to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
they usually don't have to resort to
their<00:00:44.040> fire<00:00:44.760> sidearm<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.559> go

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
their fire sidearm so I'm going to go

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.670 
their fire sidearm so I'm going to go
low<00:00:46.829> profile<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.110> now<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
low profile with that now here is the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
low profile with that now here is the
one<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> choice<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.600> precision

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
one that we have the choice of precision

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
one that we have the choice of precision
shot<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.530> basically<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:52.980> headshot<00:00:53.489> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
shot is basically your headshot that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
shot is basically your headshot that
used<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.079> plus<00:00:55.320> 30<00:00:55.620> crit<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
used to be you get plus 30 crit and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.990 
used to be you get plus 30 crit and
extra<00:00:56.789> damage<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> don't<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.730> one

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
extra damage but I don't like that one

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
extra damage but I don't like that one
compared<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.600> disabling<00:01:01.199> shot<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:02.489> you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
compared to disabling shot which you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.050 
compared to disabling shot which you
really<00:01:03.030> need<00:01:03.239> against<00:01:03.480> sector<00:01:03.780> pods<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really need against sector pods so that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490 
really need against sector pods so that
you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.240> disable<00:01:06.510> them<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.020> turn<00:01:07.229> also

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you can disable them for that turn also

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.670 
you can disable them for that turn also
Metroid's<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:09.210> good<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.680> snapshot

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
Metroid's is really good or snapshot

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130 
Metroid's is really good or snapshot
where<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> move<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.640> fire<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
where you can move and fire and the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.710 
where you can move and fire and the
penalty<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.119> high<00:01:15.509> what

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
penalty is not very not very high what

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.679 
penalty is not very not very high what
is<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> let's<00:01:16.650> c<00:01:16.740> minus<00:01:16.950> 10<00:01:17.270> right<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
is it let's c minus 10 right so the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.060 
is it let's c minus 10 right so the
first<00:01:18.869> build<00:01:19.080> i'm<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> show<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.860> for

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
to go and lock and load because I'm

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.390 
to go and lock and load because I'm
going<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.819> taking<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.360> zone<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> his

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
going to be taking in the zone and his

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.880 
going to be taking in the zone and his
at<00:02:29.670> his<00:02:29.880> top<00:02:30.120> level<00:02:30.480> versus<00:02:31.260> mayhem<00:02:31.680> mayhem

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
at his top level versus mayhem mayhem

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.699 
at his top level versus mayhem mayhem
does<00:02:32.310> give<00:02:32.519> him<00:02:32.670> plus<00:02:32.910> 4<00:02:33.239> damage<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.590> he's

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
does give him plus 4 damage but he's

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.500 
does give him plus 4 damage but he's
only<00:02:34.920> going<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.250> still<00:02:35.430> get<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:36.060> shot

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
only going to still get that one shot

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.020 
only going to still get that one shot
and<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.950> got<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.220> lock<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.549> load<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.819> he<00:02:38.910> has

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
and so I got the lock and load so he has

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.809 
and so I got the lock and load so he has
more<00:02:39.209> rounds<00:02:39.720> for<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.080> zone<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.730> could

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
more rounds for in the zone you could

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.520 
more rounds for in the zone you could
also<00:02:41.970> go<00:02:42.209> with<00:02:42.239> double<00:02:42.630> tap<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.170> prefer

the sniper okay now for this sniper

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.530

build<00:02:54.959> we're<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.739> concentrate<00:02:55.980> on

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
build we're going to concentrate on

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.490 
build we're going to concentrate on
disabling<00:02:57.540> shot<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:57.989> he's<00:02:58.110> not<00:02:58.230> going<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.440> be

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
disabling shot so he's not going to be

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.780 
disabling shot so he's not going to be
able<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.739> move<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.010> shoot<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> same<00:02:59.519> turn

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
able to move and shoot on the same turn

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.470 
able to move and shoot on the same turn
so<00:03:00.690> for<00:03:01.170> our<00:03:01.200> first<00:03:01.579> level<00:03:02.579> we<00:03:02.790> want<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.150> always

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
so for our first level we want to always

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.710 
so for our first level we want to always
have<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:04.049> low<00:03:04.349> profile<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.890> still<00:03:05.130> prefer<00:03:05.370> that

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
now we're going to have disabling shot

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.250 
now we're going to have disabling shot
that<00:03:08.640> allows<00:03:08.910> me<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.269> take<00:03:09.630> out<00:03:09.750> those<00:03:09.900> sector

straight up + 10 + 10 crit the same as

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.990 
straight up + 10 + 10 crit the same as
having<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.620> free<00:03:35.069> scope<00:03:35.459> basically<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:38.519> add<00:03:38.670> to

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
having a free scope basically to add to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.390 
having a free scope basically to add to
add<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.750> our<00:03:39.780> aim<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.260> really<00:03:40.590> really<00:03:40.709> hit<00:03:41.069> and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
add to our aim so really really hit and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.620 
add to our aim so really really hit and
we're<00:03:41.519> giving<00:03:41.639> up<00:03:41.850> two<00:03:42.000> points<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.299> damage<00:03:42.480> for

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
we're giving up two points of damage for

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.440 
we're giving up two points of damage for
that<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.470> in<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.459> case<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.850> think<00:03:44.880> it's<00:03:45.209> worth

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
that but in this case I think it's worth

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.030 
that but in this case I think it's worth
it<00:03:45.600> because<00:03:45.660> we<00:03:46.019> know<00:03:46.049> we're<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.560> moving<00:03:46.889> and

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it because we know we're not moving and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.190 
it because we know we're not moving and
shooting<00:03:47.190> we<00:03:48.000> all<00:03:48.180> we<00:03:48.359> know<00:03:48.510> that's<00:03:48.690> always

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
shooting we all we know that's always

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.199 
shooting we all we know that's always
going<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.440> take<00:03:49.590> effect<00:03:49.889> so<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.370> synergizes

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
going to take effect so that synergizes

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.199 
going to take effect so that synergizes
together<00:03:52.220> then<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.400> next<00:03:53.519> one<00:03:53.760> tactical

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
together then on the next one tactical

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.539 
together then on the next one tactical
sense<00:03:54.480> bring<00:03:55.200> them<00:03:55.380> on<00:03:55.500> or<00:03:55.739> lock<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.130> load<00:03:56.310> if

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
sense bring them on or lock and load if

point<00:04:09.509> targeting<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.259> does<00:04:10.500> only<00:04:10.680> give<00:04:10.979> us

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
point targeting it does only give us

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.780 
point targeting it does only give us
bonuses<00:04:13.320> too<00:04:13.470> damaged<00:04:13.770> for<00:04:13.800> people<00:04:14.550> for

bonuses too damaged for people for

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.180 
bonuses too damaged for people for
enemies<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.570> view<00:04:15.990> and<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.650> don't<00:04:16.890> think<00:04:17.130> that

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
enemies in view and I don't think that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.090 
enemies in view and I don't think that
takes<00:04:17.700> effect<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.150> squad<00:04:18.510> site<00:04:18.860> but<00:04:19.860> if

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
takes effect with squad site but if

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.710 
takes effect with squad site but if
there<00:04:20.280> are<00:04:20.310> some<00:04:20.670> in<00:04:20.790> view<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.329> will<00:04:21.540> really

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
there are some in view that will really

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.160 
there are some in view that will really
help<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.840> will<00:04:25.020> hopefully

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
help and that that will hopefully

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.740 
help and that that will hopefully
compensate<00:04:25.800> for<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:25.980> now<00:04:26.700> down<00:04:26.940> here<00:04:26.970> we

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
compensate for that now down here we

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.840 
compensate for that now down here we
could<00:04:27.930> take<00:04:28.110> in<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.410> zone<00:04:28.590> but<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.310> deal<00:04:29.550> is

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
could take in the zone but the deal is

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.820 
could take in the zone but the deal is
that<00:04:29.910> you're<00:04:30.330> not<00:04:30.570> moving<00:04:31.200> into<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.620> good

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
that you're not moving into a good

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.950 
that you're not moving into a good
position<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.310> see<00:04:32.640> everyone<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.600> might<00:04:33.780> only

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
position to see everyone you might only

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.770 
position to see everyone you might only
see<00:04:34.170> one<00:04:34.350> or<00:04:34.470> two<00:04:34.590> guys<00:04:34.940> so<00:04:35.940> for<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:36.720> reason

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
see one or two guys so for that reason

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.750 
see one or two guys so for that reason
plus<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.650> fact<00:04:37.800> that<00:04:37.980> we<00:04:38.100> didn't<00:04:38.370> take<00:04:38.580> the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
plus the fact that we didn't take the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.310 
plus the fact that we didn't take the
extra<00:04:39.000> damage<00:04:39.240> we<00:04:39.540> met<00:04:39.690> like<00:04:39.840> kill<00:04:40.140> them<00:04:40.260> on

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
extra damage we met like kill them on

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.290 
extra damage we met like kill them on
the<00:04:40.410> first<00:04:40.590> shot<00:04:40.800> I'm<00:04:41.580> going<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.820> take<00:04:41.940> double

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
the first shot I'm going to take double

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.300 
the first shot I'm going to take double
tap<00:04:42.510> this<00:04:42.750> would<00:04:42.930> give<00:04:43.140> plus<00:04:43.380> 4<00:04:43.620> damage<00:04:43.800> but

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
tap this would give plus 4 damage but

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.130 
tap this would give plus 4 damage but
here<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.580> could<00:04:44.730> take<00:04:44.940> out<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.390> light<00:04:45.750> two

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
here you could take out to light two

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.070 
here you could take out to light two
small<00:04:46.440> guys<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:47.180> instead<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.300> only<00:04:48.840> being

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
small guys and instead of only being

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.450 
small guys and instead of only being
restricted<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.620> one<00:04:49.710> big<00:04:49.890> guy<00:04:50.010> so<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.310> would

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
restricted to one big guy so I would

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.280 
restricted to one big guy so I would
take<00:04:50.580> double<00:04:50.910> tap<00:04:51.090> or<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.810> sort<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.110> sniper

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290
