how to correct the back shoulder
neckline<00:00:05.810> many<00:00:06.810> times<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.740> back<00:00:07.980> neck<00:00:08.370> and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
neckline many times the back neck and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.290 
neckline many times the back neck and
shoulder<00:00:09.540> are<00:00:09.719> too<00:00:09.960> short<00:00:10.519> this<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.759> really

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
shoulder are too short this is really

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.959 
shoulder are too short this is really
done<00:00:12.540> because<00:00:13.200> patterns<00:00:14.130> again<00:00:14.519> have<00:00:14.790> not

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
done because patterns again have not

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.150 
done because patterns again have not
been<00:00:15.179> balanced<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> armhole<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.560> they

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
been balanced in the armhole and they

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.980 
been balanced in the armhole and they
may<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.580> made<00:00:17.820> divot<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.750> have

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
may have made divot and they have

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.890 
may have made divot and they have
developed<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> pattern<00:00:20.270> so<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.660> back

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
developed the pattern so that the back

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.279 
developed the pattern so that the back
and<00:00:22.230> front<00:00:23.010> shoulder<00:00:23.970> armhole<00:00:24.570> are<00:00:24.750> exactly

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
and front shoulder armhole are exactly

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.400 
and front shoulder armhole are exactly
the<00:00:25.560> same<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:26.099> length<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.599> not<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the same in length and they are not the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.030 
the same in length and they are not the
back<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.949> always<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.369> half<00:00:29.880> inch<00:00:30.119> longer<00:00:30.480> than<00:00:31.050> a

back is always a half inch longer than a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.180 
back is always a half inch longer than a
front<00:00:32.460> armhole<00:00:32.969> distance<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:34.980> they've

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
front armhole distance so when they've

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.830 
front armhole distance so when they've
been<00:00:35.399> made<00:00:35.670> too<00:00:36.000> short

take a pattern which has been shown to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.550 
take a pattern which has been shown to
me<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.860> past<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.850> size<00:02:27.150> slice<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.230> here

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
me in the past is to size slice it here

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.920 
me in the past is to size slice it here
two<00:02:29.040> three<00:02:29.520> times<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.440> pivot<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.530> up<00:02:31.770> into

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
two three times and pivot it up into

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.020 
two three times and pivot it up into
Fanning<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> up<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.950> ends<00:02:35.430> up<00:02:35.550> giving<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
Fanning it up that ends up giving you a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.770 
Fanning it up that ends up giving you a
curved<00:02:36.600> center<00:02:37.200> back<00:02:37.440> seam<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.390> never<00:02:39.390> give

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
curved center back seam and never give

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.320 
curved center back seam and never give
you<00:02:39.960> exactly<00:02:40.530> what<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.830> need<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.060> want

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
you exactly what you need and you want

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.290 
you exactly what you need and you want
it<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.200> exact<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.060> how<00:02:45.240> you

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
it to be the exact so this is how you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.640 
it to be the exact so this is how you
determine<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.440> back<00:02:46.680> shoulder<00:02:47.310> neckline<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
determine the back shoulder neckline and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.470 
determine the back shoulder neckline and
we're<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.800> see<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.220> similar<00:02:50.490> process<00:02:50.970> on

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
we're going to see a similar process on

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.270 
we're going to see a similar process on
the<00:02:51.720> next<00:02:51.750> one<00:02:52.170> too<00:02:54.470> at<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.830> time<00:02:56.100> we're

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the next one too at this time we're

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920 
the next one too at this time we're
going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> show<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.760> how<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.270> correct<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
going to show you how to correct a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.530 
going to show you how to correct a
Dowager<00:02:58.470> hump<00:02:58.740> we're<00:02:59.730> going<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.090> Claudia

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
Dowager hump we're going to have Claudia

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.380 
Dowager hump we're going to have Claudia
bend<00:03:00.870> over<00:03:01.230> as<00:03:01.350> if<00:03:01.530> she's<00:03:01.739> got<00:03:01.920> bad

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
bend over as if she's got bad

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.199 
bend over as if she's got bad
osteoporosis<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:04.040> you'll<00:03:05.040> see<00:03:05.310> immediately

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
osteoporosis and you'll see immediately

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.540 
osteoporosis and you'll see immediately
as<00:03:06.450> she<00:03:06.660> bent<00:03:06.870> over<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:08.100> showing<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
as she bent over that is showing the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.400 
as she bent over that is showing the
pattern<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.300> definitely<00:03:09.690> need<00:03:10.020> more

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
pattern that you definitely need more

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.220 
pattern that you definitely need more
distance<00:03:10.709> at<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.130> shoulder<00:03:11.610> neck<00:03:11.880> area<00:03:12.330> so

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
distance at the shoulder neck area so

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.810 
distance at the shoulder neck area so
this<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.500> really<00:03:13.920> easy<00:03:13.950> you're<00:03:14.430> just<00:03:14.459> taking

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
this is really easy you're just taking

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.759 
this is really easy you're just taking
this<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.420> blending<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.019> back<00:03:16.320> up<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
this and blending it back up to the

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.490 
this and blending it back up to the
shoulder<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.630> back<00:03:18.630> up<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.110> shoulder

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
shoulder and back up to the shoulder

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.680 
shoulder and back up to the shoulder
here<00:03:19.830> she's<00:03:20.100> bending<00:03:20.610> over<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.910> little<00:03:21.090> more

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
here she's bending over a little more

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.780 
here she's bending over a little more
than<00:03:21.900> she<00:03:22.019> needs<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.350> but<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.160> never<00:03:23.340> know<00:03:23.550> how

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
than she needs to but you never know how

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.060 
than she needs to but you never know how
much<00:03:23.910> these<00:03:24.180> people<00:03:24.540> are<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.959> then<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.739> again

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
much these people are and then you again

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.970 
much these people are and then you again
just<00:03:26.730> fit<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.510> shoulder<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.080> draw<00:03:28.860> on

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
just fit to the shoulder and draw on

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.949 
just fit to the shoulder and draw on
your<00:03:29.130> new<00:03:29.280> neckline<00:03:29.760> it's<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.450> same<00:03:30.660> process

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
your new neckline it's the same process

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.670 
your new neckline it's the same process
as<00:03:31.670> correcting<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.760> shoulder<00:03:33.209> once<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.500> while

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
as correcting a shoulder once in a while

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.190 
as correcting a shoulder once in a while
though<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.880> will<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.540> have<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.810> take

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
though you will have to have to take

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.130 
though you will have to have to take
care<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.860> curvature<00:03:38.580> here<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.720> will<00:03:39.870> have

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
care of the curvature here you will have

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.009 
care of the curvature here you will have
to<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.860> little<00:03:41.190> dart<00:03:41.730> put<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.300> at<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.780> neck

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
to have a little dart put in at the neck

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.699 
to have a little dart put in at the neck
which<00:03:43.650> creates<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.340> nice<00:03:45.140> rounding<00:03:46.140> for<00:03:46.530> that

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
which creates a nice rounding for that

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.600 
which creates a nice rounding for that
shoulder<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.090> actually<00:03:48.690> pin<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.709> little

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
shoulder so you actually pin in a little

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.759 
shoulder so you actually pin in a little
Dart<00:03:50.880> what<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.269> mean<00:03:51.570> by<00:03:51.720> little<00:03:52.019> dart<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.500> it's

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
Dart what I mean by little dart is it's

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.009 
Dart what I mean by little dart is it's
a<00:03:52.890> quarter<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.580> an<00:03:53.700> inch<00:03:53.820> pinch<00:03:54.830> here<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.070> then

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
a quarter of an inch pinch here and then

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.740 
a quarter of an inch pinch here and then
sometimes<00:03:58.019> also<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.970> if<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.390> really

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
sometimes also you can if you really

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.229 
sometimes also you can if you really
have<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.110> bad<00:04:01.350> you'll<00:04:01.709> have<00:04:01.800> one<00:04:02.310> more<00:04:02.580> Dart<00:04:02.940> in

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
have it bad you'll have one more Dart in

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.699 
have it bad you'll have one more Dart in
the<00:04:04.080> middle<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.980> shoulder<00:04:05.609> also<00:04:06.389> and<00:04:07.170> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
the middle of the shoulder also and that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.910 
the middle of the shoulder also and that
again<00:04:08.100> is<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.790> quarter<00:04:09.359> quarter<00:04:09.780> pinch

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
again is a quarter quarter pinch

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.650 
again is a quarter quarter pinch
in<00:04:11.220> other<00:04:11.340> words<00:04:11.520> when<00:04:11.670> it's<00:04:11.820> open<00:04:12.240> it's<00:04:12.450> only

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
in other words when it's open it's only

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.530 
in other words when it's open it's only
1/2<00:04:13.200> inch<00:04:13.440> wide<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.760> creates<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.390> nice

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
1/2 inch wide and that creates a nice

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.740 
1/2 inch wide and that creates a nice
cupping<00:04:16.110> I<00:04:16.340> have<00:04:17.340> never<00:04:17.640> had<00:04:17.940> anybody<00:04:18.239> that

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
cupping I have never had anybody that

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.690 
cupping I have never had anybody that
would<00:04:18.870> need<00:04:19.019> anything<00:04:19.470> more<00:04:19.980> than<00:04:20.459> those<00:04:20.640> two

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
would need anything more than those two

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.240 
would need anything more than those two
darts<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.570> I've<00:04:21.720> had<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> lot<00:04:22.290> of<00:04:22.320> dowager

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250

because the going up create your
distance

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
distance

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.360 
distance
the<00:04:33.690> little<00:04:34.050> darting<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:34.710> create<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.130> little

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
the little darting is create a little

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.630 
the little darting is create a little
topping<00:04:35.790> for<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:37.050> whole<00:04:37.380> shoulder<00:04:37.890> distance

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640
