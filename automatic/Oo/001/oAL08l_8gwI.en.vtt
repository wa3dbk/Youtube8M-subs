00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
which was in a drought is now suddenly

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
which was in a drought is now suddenly
out<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> their<00:01:32.640> drought<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.960> an<00:01:34.140> El

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
out of their drought and we have an El

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.370 
out of their drought and we have an El
Nino<00:01:34.369> coming<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.030> California<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.020> we're

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
Nino coming here in California and we're

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.050 
Nino coming here in California and we're
already<00:01:37.590> having<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.310> kinds<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> weird

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
already having all kinds of weird

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.510 
already having all kinds of weird
weather<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:40.020> precipitation<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.040> an<00:01:41.159> almost

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
weather with precipitation on an almost

weather with precipitation on an almost
daily<00:01:41.610> basis<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.649> pretty<00:01:44.009> sure<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
daily basis so I'm pretty sure this is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.090 
daily basis so I'm pretty sure this is
going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> totally<00:01:46.020> different<00:01:46.049> story<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
going to be a totally different story in

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.340 
going to be a totally different story in
just<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.729> few<00:01:48.000> months<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.869> look<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.170> how<00:01:49.259> these

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
just a few months but look at how these

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.770 
just a few months but look at how these
people<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:49.829> freaking<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.490> how<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> state<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
people are freaking out how the state is
cutting<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.320> water<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.670> have

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
cutting the water and as I have

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.490 
cutting the water and as I have
predicted<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> keep<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.320> if

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
predicted I'm going to keep with it if

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.490 
predicted I'm going to keep with it if
we<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.610> El<00:01:56.820> Nino<00:01:57.170> similar<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.350> what

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500

we do have this El Nino similar to what
Texas<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.070> having<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.610> we<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.719> end<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
Texas is having and we have the end of
