 At first from explanation of this room set 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.360
 This is referred to as an 8-year-old girl was asked to make for the first time children's room enrolled in primary school 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.190

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.450
 It was made in the setting of 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.450
 Her hobby is making beaded accessories

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.030
 [musics] 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.600
 Let's explain the five points First, the first point 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:34.200
 Cherish that child 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:40.229
 This room set uses that white wall unlike other room sets 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:46.140
 Although the general of the Japanese home I think that box your house of white walls was almost 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.590
 Have originality by using a lot of accent colors and motifs 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.090
 Create a wonderful space 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:56.229
 I can 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.490
 For example, in the case of her she likes red , so after that red and animal motifs are used as an accent 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.500
 Was 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.790
 A nice space by using curtains, pet covers and wall stickers 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.790
 Please try 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.680
 [musics] 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.660
 [musics] 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.420
 The point of is safety first 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.840
 It is safe for cat's child to be able to spend relaxing relaxation of room in your room 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.150
 But cafe is also important 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:39.420
 When choosing furniture, it would be nice if you could choose something with rounded corners 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.440
 Also choose those light bulbs, etc. is difficult thing and ballet hard to to get hot which is within reach 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.650
 Give me 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.860
 Saying 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:58.330
 You might want to prevent such leakage through cable cover in the cable 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:58.330
 [musics] 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:10.130
 The third point of storage is firmly's plenty 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:15.710
 If there is a firm storage space, it will also lead to a tidying habit 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:22.569
 How much of what you have things first, let's write the belongings in paper 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:25.880
 We will plan farming by the quantity of itself and the frequency of using itself 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:30.550
 The thing that your child is not used very often and a 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.510
 Such as those that do not frequently used Ya housed on the flower 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.000
 Saying 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.000
 It would be better to use pet storage etc. 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:59.060
 The fourth point of is making a free space 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.870
 When the friends came this reading while Nekorogari in noisily everyone to play games with or sometimes one person 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.840
 Follow 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:11.010
 Let's create an open space that can be used freely in accordance with the imagination of that time 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.479
 In that case, you might want in this way draw a fluffy rug 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.479
 [musics] 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.790
 wh 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.639
 [musics] 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:37.319
 Subsequent point five eye point of is to change in accordance with the growth 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:40.529
 Can not use One anymore children Poku is the first time aligned furniture is after 5 years after 10 years enrolled in elementary school 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:43.460
 That's a very shameful story 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:47.919
 Let's choose the furniture that can be used for a long time 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.919
 But in the example here of the room set 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:05:00.129
 I use a bed that can be adjusted in length to suit my child's growth 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:03.710
 And sometimes it increased because here study desk also design is simple 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:06.610
 As part of PC desk to take part of decoration 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.610
 You can use it 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.500
 Let's check again 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:22.200
 The first respects the childhood 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:25.080
 What is your child's favorite color What is your favorite motif 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.560
 Please use it to create a room 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.270
 The second is safety first 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.729
 Let's check if it is safe 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.009
 The third one is enough for storage 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:40.610
 Please make a firm storage plan 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:45.080
 The fourth makes free space 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:49.120
 A free and open space allows children to grow freely 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:54.570
 The fifth is changed in accordance with the growth 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:57.590
 Let's choose the furniture that can be used along with the growth of Lanark your child like 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.120
