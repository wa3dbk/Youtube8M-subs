in<00:04:45.680> general<00:04:46.220> well<00:04:46.790> what<00:04:47.660> we<00:04:47.750> know<00:04:47.870> about<00:04:47.990> AI<00:04:48.320> is

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
in general well what we know about AI is

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.370 
in general well what we know about AI is
that<00:04:49.220> they<00:04:49.820> are<00:04:50.620> usually<00:04:51.790> representations<00:04:52.790> of
