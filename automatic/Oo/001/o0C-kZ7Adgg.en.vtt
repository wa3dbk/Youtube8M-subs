00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.690
 then I would start by giving a speech 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.189
 a bit global considering the two insects 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 main ones that interest but that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.620
 we fish fly and are in the order of the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.770
 tricoptera is to define things 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.650
 a lot we say passepartout that go 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.570
 well a little everywhere 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.480
 so considering that we fish 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.570
 fly using limitations 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 of the insect and in a certain stage 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.290
 vital I would start from the three hectares 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.030
 showing the various states invited 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.320
 therefore inevitably we start from 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.360
 background 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.610
 where the insect originates from as it develops 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.730
 where no more time passes and therefore 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.329
 I would begin with the larva of three forces one 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.739
 very simple thing and we join group without 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.920
 barb a small ball and of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:03.330
 we immediately add a little lead that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:09.549
 it never hurts at a tad bit right 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:13.420
 just to give him some weight in 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.670
 plus this with the adhesive strip between 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.340
 sells adhesive strip that does not hold 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.340
 never so much must always then give it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:39.750
 and I put it only in the center north of di 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:49.990
 a bit of mess - tin then let's try the trust the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:52.479
 Swiss aid inevitably has us 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.440
 they will be steps of the steps but not 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:00.369
 there is a bit then make races that much but 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.880
 never goes to everything as perfect 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.880
 back down 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.820
 at this point I take it off for a moment 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.600
 and then I take a strip of latex 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.470
 natural 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.310
 fixed 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.310
 how it comes 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.870
 how yes 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.430
 let's take it with strips of lattex 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.730
 but let's start a goiter 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.660
 when we arrive near the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.900
 schooner we did to clarify a 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.900
 little more 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.879
 this take I had guarantee and of 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:20.650
 that cabbage 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:27.800
 who is looking for communication 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:32.210
 indeed, to get to know a first race 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.650
 facts to make these friends use i 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.650
 condoms for other things 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.740
 among other things, I don't know if you see it 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.060
 inside lake beta in transparency yes 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.040
 sees the balloon or the black marchetti 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.700
 maybe you would have taken it in the future look 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:59.210
 which was given a little bit was seen 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:06.590
 confirmed we fix it we get in 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:08.650
 post and score so we pay we will use it 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.400
 after 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.400
 for sure 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:29.280
 we close we can add a 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:32.280
 thread of but little stuff is really a tad bit 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 so 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.759
 dear silvio 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.680
 coast very imitative 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.409
 not true 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.129
 it seems to me so 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.880
 really simple here and there 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.500
 you want to matter of chains we see second 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:19.100
 so firm and this is how this ended 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.680
 part of simple fishing nitra 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.560
 wanting according to the stage of 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.400
 insect maturation because they are there 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.890
 of the sick who raise them who raise i 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.410
 stones and look below and concern a 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.960
 little bit of maturation 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.030
 if it is more mature what happens is yes 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.270
 also transforms as colors and now what 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:46.430
 you can do that because of a thread of 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.870
 so back if nothing is done 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.280
 anyway , give yourself a thread off 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:54.740
 covered with color on the marker ok ok 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.490
 and this quota is made so we have it 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.640
 done 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.640
 the live insect that is the birth
