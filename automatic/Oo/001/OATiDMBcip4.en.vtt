other<00:02:53.239> one<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.480> guess<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:55.280> not<00:02:55.459> as<00:02:55.610> good<00:02:55.790> this

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
other one I guess it's not as good this

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.150 
other one I guess it's not as good this
one<00:02:56.299> has<00:02:56.420> surround<00:02:56.810> sound<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.260> pork<00:02:57.590> audio<00:02:57.950> is
