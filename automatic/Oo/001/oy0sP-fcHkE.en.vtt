00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.210
 ladies and gentlemen hello today 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.969
 in the news a shock for the 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.260
 locals and the police of los santos 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.689
 following a video broadcast ago 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.210
 a few days on the net where we see 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.279
 a policeman shot in cold blood on 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.289
 people so during this entire episode 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.130
 we will go back to what happened 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.470
 actually spent that day there on 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.760
 these images sergeant ramirez filmed by 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.059
 our cameras a few hours before the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.670
 drama 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.290
 the air relaxed and serene they patrol 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.629
 like every night in the city and 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.890
 neighborhoods los los Santos but we do not 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.899
 do not understand at all 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.219
 past 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.860
 It is 3:58 when an altercation 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.660
 happens right in front of the eyes of the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.219
 sergeant ramirez his first gesture is 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.379
 to intervene try to calm the 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.969
 socapalm by diversifying dispersion 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.399
 the army the thugs do not hear him from 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.590
 the way he decides to go after 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.500
 sergeant who tries to defend himself as 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.110
 he can with his fists but there is no 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:12.490
 do not know why he takes out his weapon and 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:14.920
 pulls we stay really shocked 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.440
 and we are expanding to understand for that 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.950
 we interviewed the sheriff smith of 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.510
 san andreas county and cost some 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.920
 thing I do not understand the county 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.530
 of san andreas and los police 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.520
 santos are equipped with taser since 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.870
 a few laps now we 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.350
 do not really understand this gesture of this 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.560
 police officer 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.210
 what went to his head 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.770
 why does not the Sergeant Ramirez have 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 pulled out his teaser to try to calm down 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 the crowd 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.990
 also why there no tablecloths 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.660
 call reinforcement to have locked in 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.950
 a nearby business 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.960
 people were not armed we have 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 wanted to investigate the sergeant 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.330
 ramirez to find out where they are from 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.830
 came 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.990
 why was he shooting at these people 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.640
 why are you killing and these people for blow 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.790
 and made them suffer like that 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.400
 why so many questions remain without 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.340
 reply 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.980
 but thanks to the video he was posted 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.060
 some time ago and messages from 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.880
 Internet users 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.120
 we could understand a little bit and 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.860
 yes especially in this message 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.490
 did not see any cops but just a 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.320
 criminal in cop uniform as he 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.670
 is indicated in this message it's just 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.800
 a criminal in uniform 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.570
 so what brings us to the conclusion 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.880
 who is part of a gang 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.520
 but what language exactly is she going 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.100
 we learned that the so-called sergeant 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.530
 ramirez own a motorcycle that has us 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.870
 made it clear that he was a member 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.010
 sounds of anarchy is so we 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.459
 say no more because we 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.459
 do not want to die
