00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
out a place like like our Basel Miami

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.860 
out a place like like our Basel Miami
you<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.609> lot<00:00:35.789> of<00:00:35.910> visibility<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.719> new

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
you get a lot of visibility you get new

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.260 
you get a lot of visibility you get new
eyes<00:00:37.109> that's<00:00:37.829> obviously<00:00:38.460> consciously<00:00:39.000> there

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
eyes that's obviously consciously there

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
eyes that's obviously consciously there
but<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:39.989> again<00:00:40.109> you<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.410> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> paint

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
but then again you just want to paint

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
but then again you just want to paint
what<00:00:40.980> you're<00:00:41.100> gonna<00:00:41.219> paint<00:00:41.519> and<00:00:41.969> knowing<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
what you're gonna paint and knowing this

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.509 
what you're gonna paint and knowing this
year<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.469> gonna<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> larger<00:00:44.280> wall

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
year I was gonna have a larger wall

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.139 
year I was gonna have a larger wall
taking<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.539> little<00:00:45.930> bit<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.340> of<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.489> plate<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
taking a little bit more of a plate I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.720 
taking a little bit more of a plate I
kind<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> wanted<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.309> challenge

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
kind of wanted to you know challenge

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720 
kind of wanted to you know challenge
myself<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.649> shift<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> work<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.219> an<00:00:53.370> angle

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
myself and shift in the work on an angle

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.619 
myself and shift in the work on an angle
was<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.239> overall<00:00:54.629> goal<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.890> maintain<00:00:56.629> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
was my overall goal and to maintain that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.169 
was my overall goal and to maintain that
angle<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.289> use<00:00:58.920> any<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> tools<00:00:59.879> necessary

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
angle and use any of the tools necessary

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.150 
angle and use any of the tools necessary
whether<00:01:00.749> that<00:01:01.019> be<00:01:01.170> my<00:01:01.379> natural<00:01:03.710> body<00:01:04.710> movement

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
whether that be my natural body movement

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160 
whether that be my natural body movement
to<00:01:05.250> create<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.580> lines<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.329> if<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.780> any<00:01:06.930> other

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
to create the lines or if it's any other

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.780 
to create the lines or if it's any other
tool<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:07.680> element<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.130> incorporate<00:01:08.549> into<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
tool or element to incorporate into the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.330 
tool or element to incorporate into the
work<00:01:09.290> I'm<00:01:10.290> gonna<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.009> because<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
work I'm gonna have to do it because I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.530 
work I'm gonna have to do it because I
need<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:12.470> it's<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.979> it's

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
need to it's you know it's

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.460 
need to it's you know it's
problem/solution<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> end<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> day

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
problem/solution at the end of the day

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.830 
problem/solution at the end of the day
so<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.310> had<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.909> problem<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:18.659> we're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
so I had this problem which we're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.120 
so I had this problem which we're
getting<00:01:19.079> these<00:01:19.170> angles<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> these<00:01:19.860> turns

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
getting these angles and these turns

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.670 
getting these angles and these turns
right<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.360> solution<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.140> apply<00:01:22.409> any

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
right and the solution is to apply any

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.830 
right and the solution is to apply any
of<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> mediums<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.610> need<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.390> execute

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of the mediums I need to do to execute

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.740 
of the mediums I need to do to execute
what<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> need<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.619> bottom<00:01:26.250> line<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.240> that's

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
what I need to do bottom line so that's

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.270 
what I need to do bottom line so that's
kind<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.799> again<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
kind of what this is and again this is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.030 
kind of what this is and again this is
just<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.640> continuation<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:31.040> exploration

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
just a continuation of my exploration

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.039 
just a continuation of my exploration
and<00:01:32.189> shape<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> form<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.060> line<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.600> balance

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and shape and form and line and balance

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.080 
and shape and form and line and balance
