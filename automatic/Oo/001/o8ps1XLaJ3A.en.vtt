00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
one and the neck is what sold me on it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.220 
one and the neck is what sold me on it
as<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> very<00:00:32.279> thin<00:00:32.640> neck

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
as you can see it's a very thin neck

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.940 
as you can see it's a very thin neck
thin<00:00:34.230> meaning<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.309> direction<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.649> it's<00:00:37.649> not

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
thin meaning this direction and it's not

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
thin meaning this direction and it's not
it's<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.360> way<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it's all like that all the way to the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
it's all like that all the way to the
top<00:00:39.750> after<00:00:39.930> sold<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.410> these<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.579> think<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
top after sold me on these I think it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.490 
top after sold me on these I think it
plays<00:00:42.420> better<00:00:42.719> than<00:00:42.840> any<00:00:43.050> guitar<00:00:43.290> I've<00:00:43.379> ever

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
plays better than any guitar I've ever

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.610 
plays better than any guitar I've ever
had<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:47.899> I've<00:00:48.899> been<00:00:48.989> playing<00:00:49.140> guitar<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
long time 26 years and I just thought it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.420 
long time 26 years and I just thought it
was<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> good<00:00:56.160> opportunity

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
was you know this is a good opportunity

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.760 
was you know this is a good opportunity
to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.969> something<00:00:57.270> new<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.289> don't

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to do something new you know I don't

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.299 
to do something new you know I don't
know<00:00:58.829> why<00:00:58.949> not

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
know why not

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.500 
know why not
you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.579> why<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.730> seems<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.390> seemed

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you know why not seems like it seemed

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.609 
you know why not seems like it seemed
good<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.850> Kevin<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.170> nice<00:01:04.170> enough<00:01:04.379> guy<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
good and Kevin was a nice enough guy to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
good and Kevin was a nice enough guy to
agree<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.519> build<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> guitar<00:01:06.180> however<00:01:06.510> I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
agree to build the guitar however I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.320 
agree to build the guitar however I
wanted<00:01:06.930> which<00:01:07.170> was<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.590> nice<00:01:07.979> plus<00:01:08.460> two<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.180> well

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
wanted which was a nice plus two as well

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
wanted which was a nice plus two as well
so<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:10.020> basically<00:01:10.320> set<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> Les<00:01:11.070> Paul

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so it's basically set up like a Les Paul

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.719 
so it's basically set up like a Les Paul
sign<00:01:11.549> arch<00:01:11.760> top<00:01:12.030> though<00:01:12.210> flat<00:01:13.189> flat<00:01:14.189> flat<00:01:14.460> flat

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
sign arch top though flat flat flat flat

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.350 
sign arch top though flat flat flat flat
it's<00:01:14.939> got<00:01:15.060> Les<00:01:15.180> Paul<00:01:15.390> pickups<00:01:17.210> with<00:01:18.210> my

it's got Les Paul pickups with my

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120 
it's got Les Paul pickups with my
sideways<00:01:18.990> switch<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> Les<00:01:19.650> Paul<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.890> always

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
sideways switch on the Les Paul I always

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
sideways switch on the Les Paul I always
have<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.340> switch<00:01:20.549> sideways<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.659> got

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
have my switch sideways because I got

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
have my switch sideways because I got
used<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> playing<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.560> way<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.340> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
used to playing it that way because of a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.399 
used to playing it that way because of a
turning<00:01:24.270> off<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.869> way<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.229> just

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
turning off and on this way so I just

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.950 
turning off and on this way so I just
turned<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.450> points

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
turned it and so this is actually points

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.330 
turned it and so this is actually points
towards<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.350> pick<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.250> know

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
towards what pick up it's on you know

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.940 
towards what pick up it's on you know
middles<00:01:30.299> both<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.280> volume<00:01:33.210> control<00:01:33.950> toggle

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
middles both the volume control toggle

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
middles both the volume control toggle
switch<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.880> way<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> use<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.960> have

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
switch is the way I use it so you have

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
switch is the way I use it so you have
gives<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.290> three<00:01:37.530> volume<00:01:37.979> controls<00:01:38.340> there

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
gives you three volume controls there

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
gives you three volume controls there
three<00:01:39.180> set<00:01:39.600> controls<00:01:39.900> while<00:01:40.409> you're<00:01:40.590> playing

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
three set controls while you're playing

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.460 
three set controls while you're playing
guitar<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.240> live<00:01:42.390> situation<00:01:42.930> which<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
guitar and a live situation which is

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.139 
guitar and a live situation which is
full<00:01:43.799> blast<00:01:44.689> or<00:01:45.689> half

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
full blast or half

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.120 
full blast or half
which<00:01:47.600> essentially<00:01:48.109> would<00:01:48.259> it's<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:48.920> loud

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
which essentially would it's it's loud

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.919 
which essentially would it's it's loud
rock<00:01:49.759> guitar<00:01:50.060> without<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.390> feedback<00:01:50.539> or

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
rock guitar without the feedback or

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.599 
rock guitar without the feedback or
quiet<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:53.960> that's<00:01:54.140> really<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.070> way<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.280> get

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
quiet so and that's really the way I get

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.880 
quiet so and that's really the way I get
all<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.880> tones<00:01:56.119> onstage<00:01:56.600> basically<00:01:57.200> for

all the tones onstage basically for

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.469 
all the tones onstage basically for
anything<00:01:58.159> we're<00:01:58.280> doing<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:59.000> all<00:01:59.149> with<00:01:59.359> the

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
anything we're doing it's all with the

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.789 
anything we're doing it's all with the
switch<00:01:59.689> and<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.049> less<00:02:00.200> pulse<00:02:00.409> which<00:02:00.560> has<00:02:00.679> to

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
switch and the less pulse which has to

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.809 
switch and the less pulse which has to
be<00:02:00.829> here<00:02:01.009> I'm<00:02:01.100> really<00:02:01.250> used<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.520> playing<00:02:01.700> it
