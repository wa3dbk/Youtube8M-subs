it<00:01:38.790> doesn't<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.450> stolen<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.409> looks

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it doesn't get stolen because it looks

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
it doesn't get stolen because it looks
of<00:01:40.770> course<00:01:40.979> quite<00:01:41.250> nice<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.729> example<00:01:42.299> in

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of course quite nice for example in

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
of course quite nice for example in
universities<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.110> usually<00:01:43.439> quite<00:01:43.649> handy<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
universities is usually quite handy and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.280 
universities is usually quite handy and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
a full SD card reader so you can also

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.260 
a full SD card reader so you can also
even<00:01:46.590> expand<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.189> memory<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
even expand your memory there if you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.600 
even expand your memory there if you
want<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.590> open<00:01:49.920> up<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> screen<00:01:50.340> like

want and you can open up the screen like

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.460 
want and you can open up the screen like
this<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.630> maximum<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.110> the

this or this is the maximum that the
hinge<00:01:52.649> goals<00:01:52.920> which<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.430> usually<00:01:53.909> enough<00:01:54.180> for

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
hinge goals which is usually enough for

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.240 
hinge goals which is usually enough for
most<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> group<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.619> close<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:56.070> from

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
most of the group if I close it up from

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.249 
most of the group if I close it up from
the<00:01:56.340> outside<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.210> matte<00:01:57.450> plastic<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the outside it's a matte plastic and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.080 
the outside it's a matte plastic and
feels<00:01:58.829> quite<00:01:59.250> good<00:01:59.490> doesn't<00:01:59.790> leave<00:01:59.909> any

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
feels quite good doesn't leave any

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.800 
feels quite good doesn't leave any
fingerprints<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.320> also<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.210> likings

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
fingerprints here so also to my likings

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.270 
fingerprints here so also to my likings
and<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> bottom<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.890> here<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> few

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and on the bottom we have here a few

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.700 
and on the bottom we have here a few
screws<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.689> take<00:02:06.899> off<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.350> bottom

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
screws but you can take off the bottom

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.980 
screws but you can take off the bottom
maybe<00:02:07.979> change<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
maybe change the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.450 
maybe change the
and<00:02:09.080> SSD<00:02:09.590> or<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.750> two<00:02:11.750> gig<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.140> ram<00:02:12.410> i<00:02:13.040> think

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
and SSD or and two gig of ram i think

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.160 
and SSD or and two gig of ram i think
that's<00:02:13.670> inside<00:02:14.090> here<00:02:14.420> yet<00:02:14.630> there's<00:02:14.810> two<00:02:14.990> years

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
that's inside here yet there's two years

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.620 
that's inside here yet there's two years
of<00:02:15.290> ramen<00:02:15.620> here<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.400> was<00:02:16.550> 1.4<00:02:17.390> kilograms

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
of ramen here and it was 1.4 kilograms

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.770 
of ramen here and it was 1.4 kilograms
so<00:02:18.200> that's<00:02:18.380> about<00:02:18.650> three<00:02:19.460> pounds<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.090> he<00:02:20.660> had

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
so that's about three pounds and he had

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.020 
so that's about three pounds and he had
a<00:02:20.810> price<00:02:21.080> for<00:02:21.290> 299<00:02:21.680> really<00:02:22.070> quite<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.640> I

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
a price for 299 really quite and I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.640 
a price for 299 really quite and I
serious<00:02:23.420> actually<00:02:23.540> speakers<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.320> bottom

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
serious actually speakers on the bottom

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.890 
serious actually speakers on the bottom
and<00:02:24.830> two<00:02:25.310> status<00:02:25.640> LEDs<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.210> front<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.690> on

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
and two status LEDs on the front and on

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.660 
and two status LEDs on the front and on
the<00:02:26.960> back<00:02:27.050> there<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.710> little<00:02:28.010> bit<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.400> fan

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
the back there is a little bit of a fan

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.580 
the back there is a little bit of a fan
here<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.210> I<00:02:29.450> don't<00:02:29.690> even<00:02:29.870> know<00:02:30.110> what<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.440> is

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
here and I don't even know what this is

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.800 
here and I don't even know what this is
for<00:02:30.830> but<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.010> don't<00:02:31.580> think<00:02:31.820> this<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:31.970> there<00:02:32.570> for

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
for but I don't think this is there for

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.220 
for but I don't think this is there for
taking<00:02:33.350> off<00:02:33.560> or<00:02:34.310> maybe<00:02:34.520> even<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:35.210> don't<00:02:35.960> know<00:02:36.140> if

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
taking off or maybe even I don't know if

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.780 
taking off or maybe even I don't know if
there's<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.530> 3g<00:02:36.980> available<00:02:37.370> with<00:02:37.520> this<00:02:37.610> one

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
there's a 3g available with this one

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.610 
there's a 3g available with this one
that<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:37.970> don't<00:02:38.210> think<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.630> for<00:02:38.840> 299<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.470> would

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
that I don't think so for 299 that would

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.300 
that I don't think so for 299 that would
be<00:02:39.710> really<00:02:39.860> way<00:02:40.490> too<00:02:40.520> cheap<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.390> was<00:02:41.540> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
be really way too cheap so this was the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.160 
be really way too cheap so this was the
c720p<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.790> can<00:02:43.970> see<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.240> turns<00:02:44.450> on<00:02:44.540> all<00:02:44.780> also

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
c720p you can see it turns on all also

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.590 
c720p you can see it turns on all also
quite<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.620> fast<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.400> can<00:02:46.550> turn<00:02:46.700> on<00:02:46.910> also<00:02:47.510> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
quite and fast I can turn on also the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.060 
quite and fast I can turn on also the
camera<00:02:47.930> here<00:02:48.140> then<00:02:48.650> we<00:02:48.770> have<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> student

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
camera here then we have a student

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.770 
camera here then we have a student
status<00:02:49.400> LED<00:02:49.820> on<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:49.970> top<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.420> don't<00:02:50.630> know<00:02:50.690> if

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
status LED on the top I don't know if

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.480 
status LED on the top I don't know if
you<00:02:50.840> can<00:02:50.990> see<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.260> right<00:02:51.650> there<00:02:51.710> is<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.160> camera

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
you can see it right there is the camera

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.190 
you can see it right there is the camera
and<00:02:52.970> that<00:02:53.330> actually<00:02:53.630> was<00:02:53.720> more<00:02:53.870> important

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and that actually was more important

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.600 
and that actually was more important
that<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.320> can<00:02:54.530> see<00:02:54.800> here<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> screen<00:02:55.400> and

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
that you can see here the screen and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.450 
that you can see here the screen and
where<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.140> fool<00:02:57.710> around<00:02:57.740> now<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.220> little

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
where I can and fool around now a little

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.270 
where I can and fool around now a little
bit<00:02:58.670> i'm<00:02:58.820> not<00:02:59.450> only<00:02:59.630> using<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:01.100> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
bit i'm not only using here and the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.270 
bit i'm not only using here and the
standard<00:03:01.610> camera<00:03:01.850> but<00:03:02.180> i<00:03:02.210> can<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:03.100> do<00:03:04.100> for

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
standard camera but i can and do for

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.340 
standard camera but i can and do for
example<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.820> big<00:03:05.060> draw<00:03:05.270> here<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:05.810> my<00:03:05.930> mouth<00:03:06.170> is

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
example a big draw here so my mouth is

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.300 
example a big draw here so my mouth is
looking<00:03:06.650> ha<00:03:06.880> great<00:03:07.880> quite<00:03:08.090> huge<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:10.010> can<00:03:10.190> do<00:03:10.280> a

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
looking ha great quite huge you can do a

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.540 
looking ha great quite huge you can do a
bunny<00:03:10.580> head<00:03:11.530> looks<00:03:12.530> also<00:03:12.740> quite<00:03:13.070> strange<00:03:13.400> so

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
bunny head looks also quite strange so

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.060 
bunny head looks also quite strange so
there's<00:03:13.760> really<00:03:14.000> quite<00:03:14.390> here<00:03:14.750> cool<00:03:15.290> features
