 Talk to the world here. 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.980
 I came to make a video for you today. 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.890
 plus a special video in case it 's a 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.380
 video about the mugen a lot of people have 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.080
 asked new people on the channel what 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.060
 change your game this is a program that 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.579
 and I'm going to tell you one today. 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.040
 bit of what I change in general 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.920
 good staff mugen is a graphics engine 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.670
 developed by the company called elek 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.399
 byte in 1999 and treats of an engine 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.420
 graphics for you to play fighting games in 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.090
 2d 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.579
 we have here my very well is of 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.829
 characters as you can 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.960
 see the characters are really 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.690
 evaluated for example and today from the king 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.079
 of fighters and the luidi of the super series 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.890
 we have homer simpson and we have fred 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.269
 krueger 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.700
 we have a solid metal snake guide 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.790
 so it goes to those who do not know me personally 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.220
 I will leave in the description of the video the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.580
 download to mugen this version that is 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.520
 most recent is 1.0 and for you to put the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.530
 character I ever did as a tutorial 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.010
 put the character in the world on how 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.380
 put zé the arenas then my friend 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.420
 channel partner or he who has done more 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.460
 I can do another one for you guys. 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.380
 That's it. I'll show you how it is. 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.720
 that works here we have the skeleton 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.700
 against the city ​​fortune mission one 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.590
 in that game that more voltage phases of the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.409
 document that was the game 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.929
 You can see we have the cac 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.829
 the commands works so are six 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.750
 buttons 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:02:00.770
 to sd x and c enter also works 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.289
 I usually buy as a provocation and such 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.380
 hence generally its museum weg wrong 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.649
 exception in pit homs and when it arrives 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.549
 screen here a question f1 will open this 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.340
 here o 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.310
 is to adjust the commands that this is 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.209
 framework set config fancy a 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.420
 new 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:25.700
 The sequence is this low down brings 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.430
 in front of xc s and then press enter 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.069
 will be safe and correct and will never 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.190
 load bars they will put on save go 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.200
 I used it for example that will save 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.220
 commands because usually the mooing 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.209
 it only comes with 15 motorcycles 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.090
 running working for your 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.810
 character is the other buttons you have and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.430
 have to configure and such because 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.239
 usually he stayed away for example 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.459
 it is not that win is my put the sdc x 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.130
 and there are six buttons on top of one another 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:02.420
 It 's easier, now, you can move it now. 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.400
 if you had the is the punch button in the air and 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.220
 another button on the p you would have to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.109
 simply and with your hand until the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.540
 Pepe still pressed the set button 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.299
 and forward to back up or be 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.459
 it would be very bad to play another 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.370
 I hope you like it too. 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.400
 buttons on the right side of the keyboard 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.159
 that the hi of the numerals with a lock o in 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.890
 Such a treat also works 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.900
 personal way here we have as we already 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.879

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.700

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.819
 serve yourself xp also works and such is good 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.769
