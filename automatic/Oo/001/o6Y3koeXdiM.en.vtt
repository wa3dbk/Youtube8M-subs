00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.209
 make ham rolls with chicken 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.240
 and the ingredients are the cooked ham 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:16.600

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.939
 tray for the oven 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.550
 let's start the first thing we're going to 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.630
 to do is put the cream on the tray 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.630
 milk for cooking 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.600
 Now let's take out the breast 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.840
 breast you have to ask the support 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.330
 which is the give it so for as if it were 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.250
 to coat finite well 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.250
 Now let's put the salt 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.210
 and now in a salty and what you have 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.060
 what to do is the following, take a 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:04.070
 piece you put it like this you get 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.210
 half sabanita the game 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.170
 you put them here 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.320
 You take half a half piece of sweet ham 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.140
 and I've split in two you put it that way 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.979
 party and now what you have to do 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.979
 is to roll 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.149
 but you have to roll up and go through 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.149
 the flour 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.289
 well passed through flour and then what 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.110
 you are putting on the tray and now take 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.149
 another piece we already have them all 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.500
 twisted, look, I have not been doing 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:47.649
 the you have to go so welcoming and cream 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.649
 you go down the rolls 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.100
 we already have all together no longer 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.100
 let's take the grated cheese 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.580
 we have already put the grated cheese and now 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.229
 let's put some pieces of 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.229
 butter for grating 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.370
 we have already put the pieces of 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.040
 butter and now we're going to put it 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.989
 oven the oven in principle we're going to 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.989
 put 15 minutes 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.610
 to 180 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.989
 the 15 minutes have already passed and you will see 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.629
 I still need a little bit and the oven I have 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.909
 put without preheating it's worth it because 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.959
 because what we are cooking is 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.180
 raw 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.579
 then as it is taking the heat 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.579
 the oven is cooking the raw 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.700
 Well, now we're going to leave it 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.810
 I think 10 more minutes 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.810
 and it will be 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.060
 the 10 minutes that we are going to have already passed 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.060
 watch 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.810
 perfect 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.540
 Here he presented us the ration look how 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.450
 it's really true to do it because it 's fast 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.400
 simple and it's great I hope that what 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.400
 do you like it and until next time
