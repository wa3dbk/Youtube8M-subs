 fox there are for this week and at the end 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.540
 This video I'm going to talk about 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.250
 the participation of the people there 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.019
 towards this series since they have happened 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.220
 several things but well that's up to 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.220
 end so let's start 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.520
 for the number 10 it comes to give ryser 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.010
 where he is driving his goal if he gets 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.530
 very the guide of the game here we see that 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.210
 ran over that guy but the truth is not 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.070
 I know well if it has run over this 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.690
 is the things you already know the things that 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.150
 do people in the games of now 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.580
 no but in if the fÃ©ile is here that 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.220
 I hit nothing else with this room that was going 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.340
 passing there of flown and killed epic 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.340
 fail 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.760
 for 9 it arrives at mrc graphs 343 where 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.070
 is here with his partner in capturing 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.660
 the flag and again in the phase of the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.480
 I think that in this everything we will see 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.950
 a lot to lag but well then we see that 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.870
 here are many mistakes happening 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.990
 they are loading the game and it appears 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.000
 graphs with the flag is to say no no 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.580
 we know what happened to his partner 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.070
 nothing else we see that he had the flag at 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.170
 final after this error here 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.790
 we already see how he will capture the flag and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.940
 here is shown in more detail 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.710
 what happened here we see that then 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.780
 He was with his partner and he was going 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.820
 escorting with the flag and everything and here 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.759
 we see that his partner is like 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.140
 lowering the shields and at the end it appears 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.450
 dead there thrown the companion if what 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.830
 they come to see and there we see how graph goes out 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.990
 there with the flag in a very 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.130
 strange but good would be a guateque 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.130
 peak gwynn jr 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.990
 in 8 we have to bring me 18 where is 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.630
 here appearing and boom it runs over her 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.400
 partner in lakes here we see how it is 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.230
 that appeared only there had they 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.610
 killed again appeared immediately 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.610
 his partner betrays him 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.320
 in 7 it reaches chin and it is part 95 where 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.299
 actually this game was 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.590
 also very guided here we see how 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.440
 is trying to make a few 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.970
 ninjas so to speak in this guy in 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 this kind of ladder then we see 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.180
 that begin to climb the enemies here 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.069
 he gives a slap to the first one after 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.900
 make a perfect line to the other and 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.120
 then the third one arrives like this 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.349
 crossing the word in and for the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.860
 piloncillo leads to annihilation 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.170
 with ninjas and well then I liked it 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.489
 more see this annihilation since the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.799
 departure was very the guide here we see 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.410
 as the enemies are showing up tele 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.840
 transporting and all that and then the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.940
 really yes it was all very good that there 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.950
 fact is annihilation with like and though 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.510
 do not believe it if it was for me to look very 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.510
 pro and good there is your time pick win 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.400
 in 6 he comes to Pope 77 where we see that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.110
 get the mother out that's that about the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.000
 promised I do not remember what it's called 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.650
 but the bear her first shot and at 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.450
 get a double death and in the end 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.430
 you make a triple death with the second 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.860
 shot and good is playing in what 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.140
 is regicide by teams and you get the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.510
 magnanimous then good here follows 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.940
 advancing is with all the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.940
 red team we see how it doubled here 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.980
 death with his shot and good here for 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.870
 the for all the team gets the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.060
 extermino with only two bullets 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.050
 that thing and good get your well 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.050
 deserved extermination 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.690
 in the 5 it arrives again without esparta 95 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.580
 but this time with some grenades from the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.260
 fury of fragmentation we see that the 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.720
 spears and all random and get a 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.730
 double death together with a Hail Mary 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.190
 to see what happened here we see that 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.930
 the single grenade and here two 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.880
 enemies that were killing each other 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.160
 then nothing else comes as a scavenger to 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.660
 kill the two with the grenade and good 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.660
 here he takes his uncle 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.850
 for number 4 arrives at pony line 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.830
 where he pulls out his sniper here is he 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.260
 with a kind of try 3 sixty does not give 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.260
 try me again like a super 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.780
 exercise of this type with a 360 here 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.209
 we see how it spins shoots and puts 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.730
 give a fact from here we see that this was 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.200
 a shot the very useful truth a good shot 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.200
 of luck for ninja pony 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.660
 for 3 he is late, where we see that he 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.820
 push here on the ragnarok map 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.310
 then he throws his grenades of fury 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.700
 this time they are plasma then go to what 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.100
 far wait is expected and by the pillara 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.680
 miraculous let's see what happened here 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.530
 we see that he throws his grenade and good at 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.630
 far away we see that it was a now yes that the 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.610
 farthest grenade that has come out at 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.150
 less here in this top and good then there 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.320
 managed to fall into the momentum that 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.880
 immediately behind an enemy was going 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.880
 going up and good got caught 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.270
 we have mucus 76 in number 2 but in 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.370
 this occasion itself is an epic watford 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.100
 but combined with win here we see that 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.080
 is playing regicide immediately what 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.540
 I kill the king but in the end they killed him 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.820
 but we see that there are two kings if 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.880
 we see that there are two emblems of kings 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.710
 even as ccoo stays with then of 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.990
 a very strange way 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.850
 because there are two kings asked in this 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.040
 heading here we see that you are trying to 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.490
 kill one and now go for the other that 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.440
 he sees it on the other side and because in itself this 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.270
 it was actually a good fuck but 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.280
 what I liked was that he did some 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.320
 things like this look here has been done 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.540
 a good ninja here in the momentum 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.820
 even of the entire game he sent me 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.710
 has several several scenes where if you 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.770
 he said immediately look here that 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.139
 another and well and especially they were 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.139
 to the two kings and well then here we see 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.030
 that in itself the game became very rare 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.200
 with two princesses in this game but 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.200
 good for number 2 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.980
 and finally we have to give tags again 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.170
 but at number 1 since here it is 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.810
 killing a few enemies they catch him 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.310
 and he saves by getting the first place 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.510
 here they say that he stayed in post but 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.730
 actually not in the first place 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.830
 we see that here they threw the grenade and 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.230
 because out of nowhere it could be saved I think 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.330
 that I had the backpack propelled that way 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.830
 that I do not know what he did to the jobbik he did 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.870
 hack but I do not know for some reason 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.020
 He dodged his grenade but well there he is 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.180
 your epic win and do not forget to send me your 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.100
 plays for the next week and here 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.650
 is where I wanted to talk to you from a 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.120
 beginning last week let's say that 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.830
 there were several problems in what 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.370
 were the comments from the previous top 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.490
 since many people complain that they do not 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.980
 in a top always appear mrc graphs 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.450
 papasote seven types like those that 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.940
 they always appear in the top and I want 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.650
 clarify that I when at the time of 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.690
 download subscribed download all 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.220
 clips and I watch them all and at the moment of 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.380
 see the games I make a list of 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.740
 the best there is and those that do not go 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.380
 disqualifying then if yes you have not 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.020
 could I leave then I ask you because I do not know 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.840
 that you keep trying I do not know maybe 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.330
 well the clip you sent me was not so 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.819
 good as the previous ones to me to me 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.159
 criterion then good nothing else that they 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:11.169
 I wanted to clarify if you like in 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:13.569
 keep sending your tips well then there 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.879
 is already open to itself is a good kilo
