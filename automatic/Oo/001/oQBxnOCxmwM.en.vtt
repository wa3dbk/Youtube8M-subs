00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.509
 hi to all youtube friends here is the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.910
 duo 97 I'm here with a video for 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.340
 talk about a few things then 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.220
 first I bring the deco file of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.140
 volume 2 of the reform lab they have 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.980
 last brought to the tournament with which 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.980
 I found it very well 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.750
 and nothing I wanted to tell you that this one of 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.610
 one last video and why not last 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.410
 of the last because for a month and a half 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.290
 I will go to a house to the sea and so here 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.920
 here in the last video for a month and a half 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.620
 in short, a little break and then notice to the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.290
 let's start with the udc or file 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:54.040
 then we have two distress communes 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:58.440
 these apple and 3 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:04.750
 helium too much as targets of the rabbit 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:12.610
 then we find three very strong mandrakes 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:15.130
 do it cyber drive 3 very strong standards 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.170
 renewals when they are found 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:24.160
 the 3 cast effect that makes you do a 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.380
 additional and depart the same of sails e 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.810
 then the strongest card in the second deck 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.189
 me which are the three charges are 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.920
 very big in my opinion had three 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.680
 spin 3 very well and finish the monsters 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.540
 in dead which is very strong local almost 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.799
 always weeks in hand then a dai 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:52.450
 Monster parts were 17 or 18 magic staples 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:02:00.880
 black hole and reinforcements a lot and aroused e 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.869
 there storm then triple pandemic and double 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.899
 typhoon 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.410
 these are the magic I don't play clothes 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:13.540
 prohibited because it will see why 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.780
 double bottoms for double traps 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.730
 prison I am thinking of playing a m3 a 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.780
 shot poolside that is really loud it 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.510
 you almost always give double flexed strength 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.730
 fair double save area according to me is 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.350
 very strong because the eye is thrown down and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.630
 versus 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.140
 elemental dragon no one knows it is 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:45.980
 really hard to get double 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:51.170
 finish the untiti prejudice is a star 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:58.370

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.740

 last beautiful papillo then ninja co 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.140
 mature of blades that many will ask 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.040
 because I play because it's a tech because 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.160
 with two casts he becomes the already mature of blades 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:30.080
 which is simply very strong because 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:35.380
