00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.660
 in the second part of my manual for 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.920
 This braided care should be taken 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.630
 the tails are seamless with each other 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.630
 connects and ends the work 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.650
 I have about an hour now 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.130
 knitted and would like to join the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.540
 length stop now 45 cm 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.910
 Of course, her headband always tries 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.590
 again while you are strict and before 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.070
 we now have the 21 pieces together 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.869
 can connect that looks the last 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.880
 row which have just knitted one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.700
 injury free was that you and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.350
 westphal on the left side so here 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 in the second half of the stitches 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.390
 The salesmen have done if you have it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.559
 on the right half so in the first 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.070
 it is also in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.890
 order 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.840
 that's why it's so important 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.670
 pattern as seamlessly as possible 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.219
 passes 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.219
 and since we are here at the beginning 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.469
 first made three rows break 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.170
 should here the last row a ver 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.899
 thus be the junction 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.370
 just goes well together and we 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.110
 At the beginning you have the first one for crossing 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.600
 on the right side because of that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.730
 it would be good too but is not bad 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 if not works if the saleswoman 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.479
 on the left is so then 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.990
 Let's hear about it now 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.360
 strictly on the left side so that the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.060
 needle with the stitches on top of it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.430
 right hand stitch comes the work phase 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.049
 out now cuts the work phase 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.619
 from generous and that is too much 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.479
 as too little left 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.810
 then you need your blunt stock 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.810
 needle 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.660
 so how hold such a piece then folds 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.460
 the tail high and now we will 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.020
 equal in a particular fashion style 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.120
 pierce through the stitches and here 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.800
 pierce under the right stitches 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.540
 if you are a bit heavy 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.060
 can recognize and they are still too 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.000
 on the head could here the piece 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.399
 pull and there where those in from the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.470
 Knit here the right stitches 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.740
 come out 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.990
 that's the right wash once you 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.530
 found out where you got your first 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.240
 she is a bit like that 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.410
 I here she is is a series here 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.060
 a row and this the very outside 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.570
 my first row is right 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.550
 mesh 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.989
 that means under this right mesh 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.360
 I'll pierce right now 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.540
 I go with my needle through the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.800
 top from the inside through the mesh 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.800
 but still remains on the needle 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.980
 storks here under this right mesh 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.980
 on 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.220
 and now I have the first off and on 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.140
 put by the next again from 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.319
 inside the inlet but still on the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:11.760
 needle her tight search my next 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.970
 right mesh that is probably the here 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.970
 his 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.650
 Take off and run through the nights 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.650
 back from them by 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.840
 to mesh in the next right is in 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.840
 you here 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.510
 and so it is now the whole series 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.220
 along this way and here you can now completely 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.630
 Good to see how we get a bunch of right 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.340
 meshes have formed after 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.870
 you can actually do it within the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.470
 I almost did not have to get stuck 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.810
 make where the beginning and the end was 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.660
 if now here at this twist 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.090
 Of course you have to be nice 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.040
 always pay attention to each other 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.990
 the next row so you have it 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.030
 work that you will not somehow 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.520
 accidentally here in front of a row 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.070
 takes or so nice but unfold 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.200
 and really always the next and the 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.460
 next and the next and even if 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.080
 I come here so slowly 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.790
 i just pursued the principle 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.660
 stand by the last of still 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.450
 inside a 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.790
 and here is my very last row 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.850
 is a right stitch stitches below 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.850
 through and pick them up 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.540
 and that's it and now it looks 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.810
 pretty much as if it were one 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.810
 molding 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.000
 Now we still have the tails 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:45.110
 I miss the needle 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.590
 right in and on the left side 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.340
 of course, and I would turn now 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.140
 just a knot somewhere here 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.030
 reinmachen 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.450
 my head is not snowing outside 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.450
 beautiful 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:08.520
 klocke 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.390
 and I'm really into spring 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.660
 adjusted 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.400
 it is not really the right way 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:20.100
 snow action even if you are now 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.870
 So it really is, I would now 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.970
 here simply in some mesh 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:31.920
 knot rheinnÃ¤he now in the loop 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.330
 purely that is my knot in the I think 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.200
 one is also not enough 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.410
 rise and work the rest of the thread 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.220
 I'm here in the laces of left 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.730
 mesh purely 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.830
 I'll just wrap that around her 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.560
 can also like in the thread a 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.560
 then the damage will still sting 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.630
 anchored more firmly and wait the final 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.980
 becomes even more firmly anchored and opens 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:02.090
 no case at all so there 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.090
 can you work properly and cleanly 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.940
 that is enough to cut off with the 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.530
 Another conclusion with the beginning 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.690
 you drive river so to speak you do exactly 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.470
 the same if you want and if you want 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.240
 that is too three-dimensional here 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.250
 gently iron it too 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.830
 Just put it on a smooth 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.770
 surface is a slightly damp cloth 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.420
 or cotton cloth you put on it and 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.310
 then goes to the iron about 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.410
 Keep it gentle in one not too hot 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.830
 do not starch too high so do not 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.330
 Anyway, and then it will be the whole 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.940
 a bit flatter but I like it 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.210
 it likes to be so fluffy and 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.280
 three-dimensional 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.920
 Here is the tail so you can 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:54.090
 guess that it is here but actually 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.570
 not really different than that 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.570
 finished 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.500
 Good luck and have fun afterwards 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.570
 I hope today my guide case 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.690
 and if so then subscribe me
