things altered or whatnot for me

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.560 
things altered or whatnot for me
especially<00:01:16.430> I<00:01:16.760> have<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.880> really<00:01:17.330> hard<00:01:17.510> time

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
especially I have a really hard time

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.770 
especially I have a really hard time
finding<00:01:17.870> pants<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.530> fit<00:01:18.560> because<00:01:19.460> my<00:01:19.780> waist

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
finding pants that fit because my waist

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.560 
finding pants that fit because my waist
is<00:01:21.020> one<00:01:21.200> size<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.830> my<00:01:22.340> butt<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:22.729> hips<00:01:22.940> are<00:01:23.240> two

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
is one size and my butt and hips are two

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.030 
is one size and my butt and hips are two
completely<00:01:24.020> different<00:01:24.110> sizes<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:24.920> it's

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
completely different sizes so it's

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.070 
completely different sizes so it's
really<00:01:25.190> hard<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.580> find<00:01:25.760> jeans<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.570> pants<00:01:26.930> that

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
really hard to find jeans and pants that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.560 
really hard to find jeans and pants that
fit<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.680> go<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.040> tailor<00:01:28.310> spending<00:01:29.270> between

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570
