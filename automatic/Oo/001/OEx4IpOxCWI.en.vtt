a number of features that most blogs
would<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.280> missing<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:55.050> doesn't<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.740> a

number of things which many of you would

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.410

say make a blogger blog and in some ways

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
say make a blogger blog and in some ways
I'm<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> bit<00:01:00.930> hesitant<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.440> call<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:01.950> blog

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I'm a bit hesitant to call it a blog

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.609 
I'm a bit hesitant to call it a blog
because<00:01:02.610> of<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:04.019> first<00:01:04.229> thing<00:01:04.439> you'll

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
because of that the first thing you'll

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
because of that the first thing you'll
notice<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.489> blog<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
notice with this blog if you want to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.779 
notice with this blog if you want to
call<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:08.039> it<00:01:08.159> doesn't<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.520> any

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
call it that is that it doesn't have any

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.569 
call it that is that it doesn't have any
comments<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.990> has<00:01:10.170> no<00:01:10.350> trackback<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.159> comments

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
comments it has no trackback or comments

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.359 
comments it has no trackback or comments
facilities<00:01:12.179> and<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.200> way<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:14.100> not

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
facilities and so in that way it's not

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.179 
facilities and so in that way it's not
an<00:01:14.609> interactive<00:01:15.329> space<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.710> reason<00:01:17.070> I'm

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
an interactive space and the reason I'm

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.969 
an interactive space and the reason I'm
doing<00:01:17.219> that<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.969> because<00:01:18.409> I'm<00:01:19.409> testing<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
doing that is because I'm testing a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.279 
doing that is because I'm testing a
theory<00:01:20.249> that<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.579> read<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.149> from<00:01:21.420> Seth<00:01:21.719> Godin

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
theory that I read about from Seth Godin

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.010 
theory that I read about from Seth Godin
who<00:01:22.950> doesn't<00:01:23.579> have<00:01:23.729> comments<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.329> his<00:01:24.659> blog

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
who doesn't have comments on his blog

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.919 
who doesn't have comments on his blog
and<00:01:25.320> he's<00:01:26.189> actually<00:01:26.789> noticed<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.450> by<00:01:27.630> not

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
and he's actually noticed that by not

and he's actually noticed that by not
having<00:01:27.990> comments<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.130> he<00:01:29.280> gets<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.640> lot<00:01:29.670> more

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
having comments that he gets a lot more

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.980 
having comments that he gets a lot more
people<00:01:30.329> linking<00:01:30.899> to<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.859> he<00:01:32.070> writes<00:01:32.310> about

though if they want to continue a
conversation<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:36.149> he<00:01:36.329> starts<00:01:36.749> they<00:01:36.899> do<00:01:36.960> that

conversation that he starts they do that

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.739 
conversation that he starts they do that
by<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:37.679> writing<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.399> post<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.090> linking

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
by actually writing a post and linking

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.230 
by actually writing a post and linking
to<00:01:40.020> his<00:01:40.229> content<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.520> obviously<00:01:41.850> has

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to his content which obviously has

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.090 
to his content which obviously has
benefits<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.929> terms<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.380> search<00:01:43.649> engine

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
benefits in terms of search engine

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.489 
benefits in terms of search engine
optimization<00:01:44.999> but<00:01:45.179> also<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.719> terms<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.140> direct

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
optimization but also in terms of direct

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.410 
optimization but also in terms of direct
traffic<00:01:46.950> flow<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.850> that's<00:01:48.030> something<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
traffic flow so that's something that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.239 
traffic flow so that's something that
I'm<00:01:48.630> testing<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.229> also<00:01:49.380> means<00:01:49.770> there's<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.100> lot

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
I'm testing it also means there's a lot

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
fashion too quickly so no dates on this

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.040 
fashion too quickly so no dates on this
which<00:03:39.000> declutter

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
which declutter

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.830 
which declutter
slightly<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.640> again<00:03:42.570> it's<00:03:42.690> another

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
slightly and again it's another

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.050 
slightly and again it's another
experiment<00:03:43.770> and<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.550> guess<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.850> last

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
experiment and I guess the last

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.060 
experiment and I guess the last
experiment<00:03:45.480> I'm<00:03:45.810> doing<00:03:46.140> on<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.560> blog<00:03:46.830> is

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
experiment I'm doing on this blog is

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.979 
experiment I'm doing on this blog is
actually<00:03:47.310> having<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.910> blog<00:03:48.090> that's<00:03:48.270> purely

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
actually having a blog that's purely

original content a lot of my blogs I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.170 
original content a lot of my blogs I
linked<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.290> what<00:03:53.160> other<00:03:53.340> people<00:03:53.730> are<00:03:53.850> writing

linked to what other people are writing

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.479 
linked to what other people are writing
and<00:03:54.360> use<00:03:54.480> quotes<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.230> add<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.890> quotes

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
and use quotes and add to the quotes

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.400 
and use quotes and add to the quotes
with<00:03:56.700> my<00:03:56.880> own<00:03:57.030> thoughts<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.720> collect<00:03:58.170> that

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
with my own thoughts and collect that

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.199 
with my own thoughts and collect that
the<00:03:58.800> quotes<00:03:59.070> together<00:03:59.489> with<00:03:59.670> other<00:03:59.880> quotes

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
the quotes together with other quotes

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.260 
the quotes together with other quotes
and<00:04:01.050> really<00:04:01.830> I<00:04:02.010> have<00:04:02.459> never<00:04:02.700> had<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:02.970> blog<00:04:03.239> that

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
and really I have never had a blog that

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.300 
and really I have never had a blog that
is<00:04:03.540> purely<00:04:04.200> original<00:04:04.800> content<00:04:05.190> even

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
is purely original content even

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.030 
is purely original content even
problogger<00:04:05.910> uses<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> lot<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.110> outbound<00:04:07.530> links

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
problogger uses a lot of outbound links

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.160 
problogger uses a lot of outbound links
to<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.580> uses<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.120> what<00:04:09.690> other<00:04:09.780> people

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
to it and uses that what other people

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.020 
to it and uses that what other people
are<00:04:10.260> writing<00:04:10.410> as<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.830> basis<00:04:11.280> for<00:04:11.310> what<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.760> write

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
are writing as a basis for what I write

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.210 
are writing as a basis for what I write
and<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:13.080> say<00:04:13.260> I'm<00:04:13.320> wanting<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.620> test

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
and I say I'm wanting to test

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.120 
and I say I'm wanting to test
I<00:04:14.310> guess<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.390> ability<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.410> have<00:04:16.859> to

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
I guess the ability that I have to

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.610 
I guess the ability that I have to
sustain<00:04:17.700> myself<00:04:17.940> on<00:04:18.480> an<00:04:18.630> original<00:04:18.870> content

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
sustain myself on an original content

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.920 
sustain myself on an original content
blog<00:04:19.830> for<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> long<00:04:20.310> haul<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:21.419> strategy<00:04:21.900> that

blog for the long haul the strategy that
I'm<00:04:22.230> using<00:04:22.470> on<00:04:22.710> this<00:04:22.830> blog<00:04:23.130> there's<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.430> number

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
I'm using on this blog there's a number

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.390 
I'm using on this blog there's a number
of<00:04:23.880> them<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.240> I'll<00:04:24.360> briefly<00:04:24.750> mention

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
of them that I'll briefly mention

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.280 
of them that I'll briefly mention
firstly<00:04:25.910> I'm<00:04:26.150> trying<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.690> collect<00:04:26.870> as<00:04:27.169> many

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
firstly I'm trying to collect as many

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.850 
firstly I'm trying to collect as many
email<00:04:27.800> addresses<00:04:28.310> as<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.820> from<00:04:29.060> my<00:04:29.090> readers

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
email addresses as I can from my readers

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.820 
email addresses as I can from my readers
so<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.040> I<00:04:31.070> can<00:04:31.310> create<00:04:31.580> some<00:04:32.320> loyalty<00:04:33.320> over

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
so that I can create some loyalty over

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.700 
so that I can create some loyalty over
time<00:04:34.430> through<00:04:34.759> a<00:04:34.789> newsletter<00:04:35.259> and<00:04:36.259> so<00:04:36.530> far

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
time through a newsletter and so far

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.020 
time through a newsletter and so far
that's<00:04:36.830> working<00:04:37.280> pretty<00:04:37.430> well<00:04:37.550> I'm<00:04:37.850> also

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
that's working pretty well I'm also

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.300 
that's working pretty well I'm also
trying<00:04:38.539> to<00:04:38.720> get<00:04:39.169> people<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.470> subscribe<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:40.039> my

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
trying to get people to subscribe to my

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.090 
trying to get people to subscribe to my
RSS<00:04:40.340> feed<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.210> promoting<00:04:41.750> that<00:04:41.930> around<00:04:42.889> my

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
RSS feed and promoting that around my

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.129 
RSS feed and promoting that around my
blog<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.639> again<00:04:44.030> that's<00:04:44.270> working<00:04:44.690> reasonably

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
blog and again that's working reasonably

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.100 
blog and again that's working reasonably
well<00:04:45.229> so<00:04:45.590> far<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:46.460> guess<00:04:47.330> another<00:04:47.660> thing<00:04:47.840> that

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
well so far I guess another thing that

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.860 
well so far I guess another thing that
I'm<00:04:48.229> experimenting<00:04:48.919> with<00:04:49.220> is<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:50.449> idea<00:04:50.479> of

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
I'm experimenting with is the idea of

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.020 
I'm experimenting with is the idea of
leveraging<00:04:51.590> traffic<00:04:52.009> from<00:04:52.160> one<00:04:52.460> blog<00:04:52.759> which

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
leveraging traffic from one blog which

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.330 
leveraging traffic from one blog which
is<00:04:53.210> established<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.139> another<00:04:54.710> one<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:54.949> newer

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
is established to another one a newer

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.430 
is established to another one a newer
one<00:04:55.610> those<00:04:56.479> of<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.780> who've<00:04:56.930> been<00:04:56.960> following

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
one those of you who've been following

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.350 
one those of you who've been following
problogger<00:04:58.070> for<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.430> while<00:04:58.639> will<00:04:58.880> know<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.330> I

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
problogger for a while will know that I

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.300 
problogger for a while will know that I
write<00:04:59.660> on<00:04:59.870> digital<00:05:00.320> photography<00:05:00.830> blog<00:05:01.070> also

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
write on digital photography blog also

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.240 
write on digital photography blog also
it's<00:05:02.000> one<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.240> my<00:05:02.330> bigger<00:05:02.600> blogs<00:05:02.930> about<00:05:03.260> 10,000

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
it's one of my bigger blogs about 10,000

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.760 
it's one of my bigger blogs about 10,000
to<00:05:04.310> 15,000<00:05:05.150> readers<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:05.510> day<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.470> guess<00:05:06.650> the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
to 15,000 readers a day and I guess the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.560 
to 15,000 readers a day and I guess the
experiment<00:05:07.370> is<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.639> see<00:05:07.820> whether<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.150> can<00:05:08.270> get

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
experiment is to see whether I can get

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.629 
experiment is to see whether I can get
some<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.900> those<00:05:08.990> readers<00:05:09.530> to<00:05:09.800> not<00:05:10.160> only<00:05:10.310> read

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
some of those readers to not only read

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.000 
some of those readers to not only read
my<00:05:10.910> first<00:05:11.120> blog<00:05:11.449> but<00:05:11.660> my<00:05:11.840> second<00:05:12.229> one<00:05:12.380> also<00:05:12.590> and

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
my first blog but my second one also and

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.650 
my first blog but my second one also and
so<00:05:13.550> I'm<00:05:13.610> doing<00:05:13.760> a<00:05:13.940> bit<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.120> cross<00:05:14.449> promotion

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
so I'm doing a bit of cross promotion

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.290 
so I'm doing a bit of cross promotion
between<00:05:15.380> them<00:05:15.620> both<00:05:16.160> in<00:05:16.370> posts<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.180> I'm

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
between them both in posts that I'm

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.600 
between them both in posts that I'm
writing<00:05:17.690> but<00:05:17.780> also<00:05:17.960> in<00:05:18.199> my<00:05:18.349> newsletter<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:19.370> so

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
writing but also in my newsletter and so

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.250 
writing but also in my newsletter and so
far<00:05:19.820> that's<00:05:20.000> having<00:05:20.300> quite<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.570> significant

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
far that's having quite a significant

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.249 
far that's having quite a significant
impact<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:22.360> in<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.419> sense<00:05:23.690> what<00:05:23.870> I'm<00:05:23.990> doing

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
impact and in a sense what I'm doing

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.960 
impact and in a sense what I'm doing
there<00:05:24.410> is<00:05:24.440> diversifying<00:05:25.430> my<00:05:25.669> blogging

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
there is diversifying my blogging

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.810 
there is diversifying my blogging
interests<00:05:26.750> but<00:05:27.470> doing<00:05:27.949> it<00:05:28.070> within<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.610> niche

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
interests but doing it within the niche

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.670 
interests but doing it within the niche
that<00:05:28.849> I'm<00:05:29.240> already<00:05:29.510> established<00:05:30.229> in<00:05:30.440> and

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
that I'm already established in and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.460 
that I'm already established in and
going<00:05:31.190> deeper<00:05:31.699> within<00:05:31.970> in<00:05:32.270> that<00:05:32.570> niche<00:05:32.840> and<00:05:33.169> I

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
going deeper within in that niche and I

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.439 
going deeper within in that niche and I
am<00:05:33.860> testing<00:05:34.729> the<00:05:34.820> theory<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.120> that's

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
am testing the theory that that's

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.080 
am testing the theory that that's
probably<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.810> smarter<00:05:36.289> way<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.500> diversify<00:05:37.090> then

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
probably a smarter way to diversify then

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.909 
probably a smarter way to diversify then
diversifying<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.960> lots<00:05:39.169> of<00:05:39.289> topics<00:05:39.680> that

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
diversifying the lots of topics that

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.129 
diversifying the lots of topics that
don't<00:05:39.949> relate<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:40.580> one<00:05:40.849> another<00:05:41.150> so<00:05:41.960> there's

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
don't relate to one another so there's

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.070 
don't relate to one another so there's
some<00:05:42.289> of<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.440> things<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.740> I'm<00:05:42.949> testing<00:05:43.669> with

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
some of the things that I'm testing with

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.750 
some of the things that I'm testing with
there<00:05:45.080> I'll<00:05:45.500> continue<00:05:46.039> to<00:05:46.250> give<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:46.520> feedback
