UFO<00:01:45.140> some<00:01:46.140> kind<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:47.570> technology<00:01:48.570> some<00:01:49.530> kind<00:01:49.710> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
UFO some kind of technology some kind of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.090 
UFO some kind of technology some kind of
drone<00:01:50.040> technology<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:51.509> wasn't<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> past

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
drone technology it wasn't just the past

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
drone technology it wasn't just the past
couple<00:01:53.310> days<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.850> seen<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.329> drone<00:01:54.720> almost

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
couple days we seen more drone almost

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
couple days we seen more drone almost
hit<00:01:55.560> an<00:01:55.799> airliner<00:01:56.750> okay

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
hit an airliner okay

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
hit an airliner okay
so<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.259> could<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.590> been<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.579> we'll<00:01:59.759> dubbed

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so it could have been so we'll dubbed

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.359 
so it could have been so we'll dubbed
this<00:02:00.149> an<00:02:00.329> unknown<00:02:00.810> object<00:02:01.110> instead<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> UFO

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
this an unknown object instead of a UFO

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.770 
this an unknown object instead of a UFO
because<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.060> could<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.270> been<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> drone

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because it could have been a drone

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.990 
because it could have been a drone
possibly<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:04.530> some<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.070> technology<00:02:05.759> from
