00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.060
 and its end 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.650
 two 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.930
 very good guys that as you are my 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.450
 name is kenya and if today you play black or 2 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.300
 today it's broken broken bombed because I hurt 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.130
 because basically I hope that this 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.930
 video you can because I'm thinking of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.150
 you know you will be mega saturated 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.540
 of green of all youtubers in plan 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.060
 serious alphaes night airsoft I do not know 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.460
 ruminate all the youtubers so more or 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.470
 less big of that rise of little things 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.020
 of green and you will be up to the cock of 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.270
 see everywhere the same thing because I in 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.539
 this case I will bring you something different 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.120
 not something different in plan something different 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.949
 of ccoo but something different from what 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.289
 that is going to rise today the people that the rock 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.629
 is going to focus on the quiet dlc 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.289
 because I will bring you videos from the dlc but 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.120
 will be later as I do not know to me 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.640
 personally or already youtube for example 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.440
 I will not surely enter at least 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.659
 see other videos because I do not like to see 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.210
 on all channels the same 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.370
 honestly some guys said this 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.650
 I'm going to ask you what I like and a 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.210
 comment on this series help 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.860
 very much you already know that in the previous 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.270
 we reached 1600 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.030
 I liked it because I would love to get there 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.040
 to that number and nothing we go there eyes 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.230
 guys because you're normal against 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.600
 all not what what is a forgiveness 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.700
 I hate it because it's a map that 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.479
 has some odious responses for this 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.800
 game mode but if we play with this 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.920
 scorpion beast evo charger expanded and 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.870
 cannon long the weapon no doubt that more 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.720
 exploits exploits forgiveness people 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.670
 up close one on one no doubt the weapon 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.910
 What is the most cadence of all 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.390
 colloquies as I understand 1200 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.040
 bullets per minute a fucking bestiality me 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.250
 I do not know what happens if this puts a fire 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.880
 fast but I will not try it because and eye 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.780
 eye that we are the host and we can kill 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.060
 not very much with this weapon 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.400
 so the goal will be to get into 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.400
 the house to have short distances 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.050
 but not mine, my mother, you saw those 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.360
 Boys 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.110
 You have seen that as I killed the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.180
 second 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.010
 and it reminded me that this weapon killed if 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.010
 really 30 go 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.100
 and luck has had air with the gene 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.100
 market 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.370
 okay 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.490
 This weapon kills many guys this weapon 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.450
 kill too much let's throw this and this 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.800
 have been careful not to do someone 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.800
 scheme is too uncle 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.720
 the subject is too much I'm armed 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.739
 too 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.739
 that my eyes can see 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.790
 amazing how this weapon explodes 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.650
 I did not remember this really 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.170
 two casualties for whatever it is 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.990
 let's have the v sad I promise 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.600
 and in the absence of a bullet I promise you that 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:25.410
 we play a little bit more like saying it 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.410
 up to paper 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.909
 it was the play and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.730
 do not go down more guys it's not so much to think about it 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.040
 we have done nine because we can not 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.879
 make us one 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.879
 and it's there it's like that, sir 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.030
 or because we have the weapon with more 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.550
 cadence of the game 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.550
 together with the host 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.440
 I 'm leaving I'm going yes or no 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.810

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.440

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.440

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.419
 I'm a little more relaxed 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.659
 we are 17 careful that the first one has 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.659
 24 we must hurry 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:47.980
 to hurry because they can not mess it up 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.360
 we have another kiss relentless eye eye 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.360

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.360
 all ready and they kill me one more time 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.720
 leave the game I'm still on point 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.720
 soft 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:31.719

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:40.330

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:43.839
 and I could not totally incredible wow 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:47.510
 wow wow a streak of 21 I think that has 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:50.100
 been totally very fast 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.800
 with the excursion 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.330
 I swear I'm freaking out but also 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.800
 I'm flipping in the way that kills the most 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
 the one that kills more with quick is that I'm 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.910
 subnormal I have not seen it either 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.100

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.640

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.990
 It deserves a like, you know, I told you 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.330
