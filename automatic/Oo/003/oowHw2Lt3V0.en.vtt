00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.070 
burn through what is the fuel comprise
them<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> 20<00:01:23.520> gallon<00:01:23.640> tank<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> we

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
them it's like a 20 gallon tank and we

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
them it's like a 20 gallon tank and we
actually<00:01:25.259> run<00:01:25.560> methanol<00:01:26.040> which<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.400> alcohol

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
actually run methanol which is alcohol

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.140 
actually run methanol which is alcohol
and<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.500> mean<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.310> night<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.880> probably

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and and I mean in one night we probably

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.530 
and and I mean in one night we probably
go<00:01:30.390> through<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.079> would<00:01:31.380> say<00:01:31.590> roughly<00:01:32.250> 30<00:01:32.880> 40

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
go through I would say roughly 30 40

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.690 
go through I would say roughly 30 40
gallons<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.990> fuel<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.290> mean<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:35.280> much<00:01:35.400> does<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
gallons of fuel I mean how much does the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310 
gallons of fuel I mean how much does the
methanol<00:01:36.060> cost<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> gallon<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.110> mean<00:01:37.229> how

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
methanol cost like a gallon I mean how

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.080 
methanol cost like a gallon I mean how
much<00:01:37.409> does<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.590> stuff<00:01:37.890> well<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.579> don't<00:01:39.000> really

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
much does that stuff well I don't really

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
much does that stuff well I don't really
know<00:01:39.240> bossman<00:01:39.509> pays<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.320> stuff<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
know bossman pays for that stuff it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.010 
know bossman pays for that stuff it
comes<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.040> comes<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.430> 55-gallon<00:01:42.150> drums<00:01:42.720> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
comes it comes in 55-gallon drums but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.710 
comes it comes in 55-gallon drums but
I'm<00:01:43.320> thinking<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.860> around<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.689> $130<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
I'm thinking it's around like $130 a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.789 
I'm thinking it's around like $130 a
barrel

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
barrel

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.440 
barrel
alright<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.100> was<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.520> wondering<00:01:47.759> about

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
alright I was kind of wondering about

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
alright I was kind of wondering about
there<00:01:48.960> behind<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> rigs<00:01:49.649> when<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.890> guys

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
there behind all the rigs when you guys

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.170 
there behind all the rigs when you guys
are<00:01:50.189> back<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.460> they've<00:01:50.640> got<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> truck<00:01:51.030> all

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
are back there they've got the truck all

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.789 
are back there they've got the truck all
pulled<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.479> before<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.780> go<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.079> pits<00:01:52.290> so

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
pulled out before you go in the pits so

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.810 
pulled out before you go in the pits so
I<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:52.979> always<00:01:53.070> wonder<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:53.790> I

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.249 
I was always wonder what was in there I
figured<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.149> was<00:01:54.210> probably<00:01:54.270> fuel<00:01:54.750> he<00:01:55.110> didn't

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
figured it was probably fuel he didn't

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.690 
figured it was probably fuel he didn't
