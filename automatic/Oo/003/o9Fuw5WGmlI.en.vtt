we're going to be talking about food
timing<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.240> very<00:00:12.570> very<00:00:12.839> important<00:00:13.259> issue

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
timing so very very important issue

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.709 
timing so very very important issue
especially<00:00:14.280> when<00:00:14.969> you're<00:00:15.150> after<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.540> weight

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
especially when you're after the weight

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.930 
especially when you're after the weight
loss<00:00:15.750> or<00:00:16.230> weight<00:00:16.470> gain<00:00:16.530> okay<00:00:17.280> so<00:00:17.730> we're<00:00:17.850> going

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
loss or weight gain okay so we're going

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
loss or weight gain okay so we're going
to<00:00:18.030> go<00:00:18.120> over<00:00:18.150> some<00:00:18.360> general<00:00:18.900> principles<00:00:18.990> that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
to go over some general principles that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.110 
to go over some general principles that
everybody<00:00:20.040> can<00:00:20.220> apply<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.760> general

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.120 
everybody can apply to the general

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.910 
everybody can apply to the general
eating<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.290> we're<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.560> talk<00:00:22.680> more

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
eating and then we're going to talk more

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.560 
eating and then we're going to talk more
about<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.280> goal<00:00:23.490> based<00:00:23.730> stuff<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.300> weight

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
about the goal based stuff for weight

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.960 
about the goal based stuff for weight
loss<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.990> for<00:00:25.650> weight<00:00:25.830> gain<00:00:25.970> predominantly

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
loss and for weight gain predominantly

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.900 
loss and for weight gain predominantly
fat<00:00:27.240> loss<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.720> muscle<00:00:28.260> mass<00:00:28.650> gain<00:00:29.010> yes<00:00:29.370> so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
fat loss and muscle mass gain yes so

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.670 
fat loss and muscle mass gain yes so
food<00:00:30.150> timing<00:00:30.540> that's<00:00:30.690> the<00:00:30.840> issue<00:00:30.930> today<00:00:31.230> let's

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
food timing that's the issue today let's

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.139 
food timing that's the issue today let's
get<00:00:31.860> into<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.579> let's<00:00:32.759> start<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.059> our

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
get into it so let's start with our

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
get into it so let's start with our
general<00:00:33.600> principles<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.950> first<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
general principles the first one is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.190 
general principles the first one is
don't<00:00:35.790> go<00:00:35.970> any<00:00:36.210> more<00:00:36.450> than<00:00:36.690> three<00:00:37.020> hours

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
don't go any more than three hours

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
don't go any more than three hours
without<00:00:37.680> eating<00:00:38.040> okay<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:38.850> super

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
without eating okay that's super

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.430 
without eating okay that's super
important<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.990> keep<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.320> metabolism

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
important to keep your metabolism

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.190 
important to keep your metabolism
ticking<00:00:41.160> over<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.610> always<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.720> relate<00:00:43.050> this

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
ticking over I always just relate this

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.560 
ticking over I always just relate this
to<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.470> fire<00:00:43.829> okay<00:00:44.490> if<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.940> fire<00:00:45.150> is<00:00:45.270> already

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to a fire okay if a fire is already

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.030 
to a fire okay if a fire is already
burning<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:46.050> metabolism<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.650> already<00:00:46.890> going

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
burning your metabolism is already going

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.800 
burning your metabolism is already going
what<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> want<00:00:47.880> to<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.150> keep<00:00:48.510> feeding

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
what you want to do is just keep feeding

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.170 
what you want to do is just keep feeding
it<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.260> flog<00:00:49.560> logs<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.730> fire<00:00:50.970> can

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it will flog logs and then that fire can

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.760 
it will flog logs and then that fire can
continue<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:51.630> burn<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.380> same<00:00:52.560> as<00:00:52.590> your

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
continue to burn that's the same as your

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
continue to burn that's the same as your
metabolism<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.060> want<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> happen

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
metabolism what you don't want to happen

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.120 
metabolism what you don't want to happen
is<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.079> donate<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> long<00:00:55.800> period<00:00:55.950> of

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
is that you donate for a long period of

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.710 
is that you donate for a long period of
time<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.579> fire<00:00:56.760> dies<00:00:57.000> down<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.480> throw<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
time the fire dies down then you throw a

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.330 
time the fire dies down then you throw a
massive<00:00:58.079> log<00:00:58.260> onto<00:00:58.470> it<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:58.950> that's<00:00:59.130> not

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
massive log onto it because that's not

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.010 
massive log onto it because that's not
going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> burn<00:00:59.670> well<00:00:59.940> okay<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
going to burn well okay so we want to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.960 
going to burn well okay so we want to
keep<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> metabolism<00:01:01.680> ticking<00:01:02.040> over<00:01:02.160> no<00:01:02.760> more

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
keep the metabolism ticking over no more

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.340 
keep the metabolism ticking over no more
than<00:01:03.000> three<00:01:03.329> hours<00:01:03.480> without<00:01:03.750> food<00:01:03.899> that's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
than three hours without food that's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.080 
than three hours without food that's
that's<00:01:05.100> number<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:05.610> right<00:01:05.880> general

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that's number one right general

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.879 
that's number one right general
principle<00:01:06.570> number<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.899> then<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.499> move<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:07.889 
principle number one then we move on to

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:09.440 
principle number one then we move on to
other<00:01:07.979> principle<00:01:08.609> so<00:01:08.759> some<00:01:08.969> other<00:01:09.060> general

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
other principle so some other general

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.800 
other principle so some other general
principles<00:01:09.869> are<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.829> should<00:01:11.100> always

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
principles are that you should always

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.919 
principles are that you should always
try<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> eat<00:01:13.130> within<00:01:14.130> 30<00:01:14.729> minutes<00:01:14.999> after<00:01:15.539> a

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
try to eat within 30 minutes after a

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:17.419 
try to eat within 30 minutes after a
workout<00:01:16.139> okay<00:01:16.499> so<00:01:16.560> that's<00:01:16.799> super<00:01:17.039> important

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
workout okay so that's super important

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:18.349 
workout okay so that's super important
you've<00:01:17.520> got<00:01:17.609> to<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.789> good<00:01:18.060> quality

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
you've got to have a good quality

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.989 
you've got to have a good quality
protein<00:01:18.810> source<00:01:19.139> 30<00:01:19.799> minutes<00:01:20.189> directly<00:01:20.729> after

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
protein source 30 minutes directly after

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.029 
protein source 30 minutes directly after
a<00:01:21.240> workout<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.409> allows<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.889> body

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
a workout and then that allows the body

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.010 
a workout and then that allows the body
to<00:01:23.189> lay<00:01:23.429> down<00:01:23.459> more<00:01:23.880> lean<00:01:24.090> muscle<00:01:24.119> tissue<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to lay down more lean muscle tissue and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.109 
to lay down more lean muscle tissue and
helps<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.499> to<00:01:25.590> burn<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:25.979> fat<00:01:26.219> okay<00:01:26.639> so

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
helps you to burn more fat okay so

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.389 
helps you to burn more fat okay so
that's<00:01:27.299> another<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.689> good<00:01:27.869> principle

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
that's another really good principle

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.459 
that's another really good principle
another<00:01:29.399> general<00:01:29.759> principle<00:01:30.179> of<00:01:30.450> food<00:01:31.020> timing

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
another general principle of food timing

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.459 
another general principle of food timing
is<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.219> when<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.209> you<00:01:34.020> don't<00:01:34.200> want

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
is that when you get up you don't want

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.760 
is that when you get up you don't want
to<00:01:34.529> have<00:01:34.709> 3-4<00:01:35.670> hours<00:01:36.090> before<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.659> eat<00:01:36.810> okay<00:01:37.319> so

we're going to go into that soon it is

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.459 
we're going to go into that soon it is
okay<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> train<00:01:41.819> on<00:01:41.969> an<00:01:42.119> empty<00:01:42.240> stomach<00:01:42.509> but

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
okay to train on an empty stomach but

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.690 
okay to train on an empty stomach but
you<00:01:43.560> certainly<00:01:43.770> don't<00:01:44.039> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.279> go<00:01:44.340> three<00:01:44.609> or

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you certainly don't want to go three or

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.219 
you certainly don't want to go three or
four<00:01:44.880> hours<00:01:45.209> without<00:01:45.389> putting<00:01:45.719> some<00:01:45.990> food

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
four hours without putting some food

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
four hours without putting some food
into<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.619> body<00:01:46.740> alright<00:01:47.099> so<00:01:47.549> that's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
into the body alright so that's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.730 
into the body alright so that's
principle<00:01:48.539> number<00:01:48.630> three<00:01:48.959> and<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.499> you<00:01:49.590> put

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
principle number three and if you put

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.830 
principle number three and if you put
all<00:01:49.859> those<00:01:49.979> three<00:01:50.310> together<00:01:50.539> and<00:01:51.539> your

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
all those three together and your

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.289 
all those three together and your
general<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:52.950> general<00:01:53.099> health<00:01:53.299> you'll

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
general just for general health you'll

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.970 
general just for general health you'll
be<00:01:54.389> sorted<00:01:54.719> out<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.349> now<00:01:55.469> we're<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.679> to

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
be sorted out and now we're going to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.070 
be sorted out and now we're going to
too<00:01:56.370> fat<00:01:56.670> loss<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.150> lean<00:01:57.720> muscle<00:01:58.050> tissue

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
too fat loss and lean muscle tissue

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.710 
too fat loss and lean muscle tissue
gangs<00:01:58.640> radio<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.760> let's<00:01:59.970> talk<00:02:00.180> about<00:02:00.240> food

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
gangs radio so let's talk about food

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.650 
gangs radio so let's talk about food
timing<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.500> weight<00:02:01.680> loss<00:02:02.150> more<00:02:03.150> specifically

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
timing for weight loss more specifically

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.930 
timing for weight loss more specifically
i<00:02:03.780> should<00:02:04.050> say<00:02:04.230> food<00:02:04.980> timing<00:02:05.400> for<00:02:05.670> fat<00:02:05.910> loss

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
i should say food timing for fat loss

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.850 
i should say food timing for fat loss
alright<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.900> want<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.140> lose<00:02:07.260> fat<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.620> want<00:02:07.800> to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
alright we want to lose fat we want to

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.230 
alright we want to lose fat we want to
increase<00:02:08.100> lean<00:02:08.369> muscle<00:02:08.670> tissue<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.180> not

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
increase lean muscle tissue so it's not

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.660 
increase lean muscle tissue so it's not
necessarily<00:02:09.300> weight<00:02:09.930> but<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.619> fat<00:02:10.860> loss<00:02:11.040> so

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
necessarily weight but it is fat loss so

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.120 
necessarily weight but it is fat loss so
food<00:02:12.420> timing<00:02:12.810> from<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> fat<00:02:13.200> loss<00:02:13.380> what<00:02:14.010> you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
food timing from the fat loss what you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.740 
food timing from the fat loss what you
what<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.520> want<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.820> try<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> do<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.390> for<00:02:15.630> those

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
what you want to try to do is for those

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.670 
what you want to try to do is for those
of<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.990> who<00:02:16.080> want<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.260> train<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.620> morning

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
of you who want to train in the morning

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.800 
of you who want to train in the morning
if<00:02:17.190> your<00:02:17.370> train<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.760> morning<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.420> okay

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
if your train in the morning it is okay

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.950 
if your train in the morning it is okay
to<00:02:19.080> get<00:02:19.470> up<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.800> train<00:02:20.130> all<00:02:20.850> right<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.840> are

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
to get up and train all right there are

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.230 
to get up and train all right there are
a<00:02:21.990> couple<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.260> drawbacks<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.160> if<00:02:23.460> you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
a couple of drawbacks to that so if you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.640 
a couple of drawbacks to that so if you
train<00:02:24.510> early<00:02:24.840> for<00:02:25.020> morning<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.410> haven't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
train early for morning and you haven't

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.350 
train early for morning and you haven't
had<00:02:25.740> any<00:02:25.890> food<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.280> system<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.120> feel

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
had any food in the system you can feel

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.420 
had any food in the system you can feel
a<00:02:27.390> little<00:02:27.510> bit<00:02:27.630> noisy<00:02:27.960> little<00:02:28.020> bit<00:02:28.290> dizzy<00:02:28.470> and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
a little bit noisy little bit dizzy and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.010 
a little bit noisy little bit dizzy and
that's<00:02:29.580> that's<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:30.000> totally<00:02:30.300> normal<00:02:30.420> reaction

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
that's that's a totally normal reaction

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.770 
that's that's a totally normal reaction
if<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.740> do<00:02:31.950> feel<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.850> what<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:33.540> want<00:02:33.660> to

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
if you do feel like that what we want to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.820 
if you do feel like that what we want to
do<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:33.990> we<00:02:34.080> want<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.230> use<00:02:34.320> faddish<00:02:34.740> your

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
do is we want to use faddish your

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.260 
do is we want to use faddish your
primary<00:02:35.160> fuel<00:02:35.430> source<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:35.850> don't<00:02:36.120> want<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
primary fuel source so we don't want to

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.390 
primary fuel source so we don't want to
put<00:02:36.420> too<00:02:36.450> much<00:02:36.720> food<00:02:36.960> food<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.250> do

just a couple of sips of 100-percent
fruit<00:02:44.220> juice<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.390> gives<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.720> body

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
fruit juice that just gives the body

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.110 
fruit juice that just gives the body
some<00:02:46.440> simple<00:02:46.920> very<00:02:47.160> simple<00:02:47.340> sugars<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.970> keep

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
some simple very simple sugars to keep

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.670 
some simple very simple sugars to keep
your<00:02:48.270> brain<00:02:48.480> active<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.320> don't<00:02:49.500> feel

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
your brain active so that you don't feel

your brain active so that you don't feel
that<00:02:49.890> sort<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.190> noise<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.520> feeling<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.060> that's

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
that sort of noise is feeling so that's

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.150 
that sort of noise is feeling so that's
that's<00:02:51.810> food<00:02:52.080> timing<00:02:52.440> number<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:52.920> can

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
that's food timing number one you can

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.950 
that's food timing number one you can
train<00:02:53.430> on<00:02:53.580> an<00:02:53.700> empty<00:02:53.790> stomach<00:02:54.090> if<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.750> don't

can replenish the food we don't want you
to<00:04:30.040> use<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.460> food<00:04:30.700> as<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.150> fuel<00:04:31.480> okay<00:04:31.960> so

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
to use the food as the fuel okay so

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.790 
to use the food as the fuel okay so
there's<00:04:32.620> some<00:04:32.890> principles<00:04:33.430> for<00:04:33.610> fat<00:04:33.910> loss

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
there's some principles for fat loss

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.020 
there's some principles for fat loss
okay<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:35.860> if<00:04:36.100> you're<00:04:36.250> trying<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.580> increase

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
okay so if you're trying to increase

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.880 
okay so if you're trying to increase
your<00:04:37.180> lean<00:04:37.720> muscle<00:04:37.750> tissue<00:04:38.140> if<00:04:38.530> you're<00:04:38.680> trying

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
your lean muscle tissue if you're trying

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.770 
your lean muscle tissue if you're trying
to<00:04:38.980> put<00:04:39.160> weight<00:04:39.310> on<00:04:39.370> good<00:04:40.030> weight<00:04:40.240> we<00:04:40.690> don't

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
to put weight on good weight we don't

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.030 
to put weight on good weight we don't
want<00:04:40.990> bad<00:04:41.110> way<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.350> go<00:04:41.500> on<00:04:41.680> but<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.860> definitely

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
want bad way to go on but you definitely

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.260 
want bad way to go on but you definitely
want<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.370> increase<00:04:42.640> your<00:04:42.700> lean<00:04:42.910> muscle<00:04:42.940> tissue

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
want to increase your lean muscle tissue

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.390 
want to increase your lean muscle tissue
stores<00:04:43.810> probably<00:04:44.530> one<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.280> most

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
stores probably one of the most

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.310 
stores probably one of the most
important<00:04:46.090> things<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.390> you<00:04:46.510> can<00:04:46.690> do<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:47.140> to

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
important things that you can do is to

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.720 
important things that you can do is to
make<00:04:47.470> sure<00:04:47.530> that<00:04:47.890> you're<00:04:48.010> in<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.250> positive

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
make sure that you're in a positive

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.600 
make sure that you're in a positive
caloric<00:04:49.300> state<00:04:49.740> before<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.070> do<00:04:51.190> any<00:04:51.340> training

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
caloric state before you do any training

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.370 
caloric state before you do any training
okay<00:04:52.210> so<00:04:52.600> let<00:04:52.720> me<00:04:52.780> just<00:04:52.900> break<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.080> down<00:04:53.320> for

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
okay so let me just break that down for

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.020 
okay so let me just break that down for
you<00:04:53.560> what<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.190> what<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.430> need<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.760> have<00:04:54.880> done

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
you what you what you need to have done

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.760 
you what you what you need to have done
is<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.360> make<00:04:55.540> sure<00:04:55.570> there's<00:04:55.960> more<00:04:56.140> food<00:04:56.440> in<00:04:56.680> the

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
is to make sure there's more food in the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.020 
is to make sure there's more food in the
body<00:04:56.950> than<00:04:57.160> what<00:04:57.310> you've<00:04:57.430> expended<00:04:57.820> during

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
body than what you've expended during

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.660 
body than what you've expended during
the<00:04:58.330> day<00:04:58.480> before<00:04:58.720> your<00:04:59.050> workout<00:04:59.230> okay<00:05:00.160> that

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
the day before your workout okay that

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
the day before your workout okay that
means<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:01.030> there's<00:05:01.180> plenty<00:05:01.450> of<00:05:01.510> energy

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
means that there's plenty of energy

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.930 
means that there's plenty of energy
stored<00:05:02.230> in<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.440> body<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:03.460> when<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.670> do<00:05:03.790> your

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
stored in the body so when you do your

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.310 
stored in the body so when you do your
workout<00:05:04.300> later<00:05:04.510> they<00:05:04.660> can<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.870> workout<00:05:05.170> be

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
workout later they can you workout be

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.780 
workout later they can you workout be
better<00:05:05.500> because<00:05:06.160> there's<00:05:06.430> plenty<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:06.670> energy

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
better because there's plenty of energy

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.910 
better because there's plenty of energy
to<00:05:07.000> do<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:07.810> you<00:05:07.840> can<00:05:08.230> get<00:05:08.350> a<00:05:08.380> good<00:05:08.620> quality

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
to do it so you can get a good quality

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.310 
to do it so you can get a good quality
workout<00:05:09.280> with<00:05:09.460> more<00:05:09.700> intensity<00:05:10.120> but<00:05:11.110> then

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
workout with more intensity but then

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.900 
workout with more intensity but then
there's<00:05:11.560> nutrients<00:05:12.100> they're<00:05:12.280> already<00:05:12.610> in<00:05:12.820> the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
there's nutrients they're already in the

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.550 
there's nutrients they're already in the
body<00:05:13.120> for<00:05:13.420> you<00:05:13.510> to<00:05:13.630> start<00:05:13.900> repairing<00:05:14.290> and

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
body for you to start repairing and

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.440 
body for you to start repairing and
restoring<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:15.010> muscle<00:05:15.400> tissue<00:05:15.580> okay<00:05:15.910> so

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
restoring that muscle tissue okay so

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.120 
restoring that muscle tissue okay so
make<00:05:16.690> sure<00:05:16.720> you're<00:05:17.020> in<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.140> positive<00:05:17.650> caloric

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
make sure you're in a positive caloric

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.550 
make sure you're in a positive caloric
state<00:05:18.430> before<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.450> begin<00:05:19.720> your<00:05:19.870> workouts<00:05:20.290> and

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
state before you begin your workouts and

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.410 
state before you begin your workouts and
you<00:05:21.040> will<00:05:21.160> definitely<00:05:21.520> get<00:05:21.880> more<00:05:22.120> lean<00:05:22.390> muscle

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
you will definitely get more lean muscle

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.440 
you will definitely get more lean muscle
tissue<00:05:22.810> increases<00:05:23.590> so<00:05:24.220> an<00:05:24.550> addendum<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.300> that

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
tissue increases so an addendum to that

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.900 
tissue increases so an addendum to that
is<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:26.380> 30<00:05:26.620> minutes<00:05:26.950> afterwards<00:05:27.400> it's<00:05:27.550> really

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
is the 30 minutes afterwards it's really

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.130 
is the 30 minutes afterwards it's really
really<00:05:28.150> important<00:05:28.480> for<00:05:28.570> those<00:05:28.660> trying<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.990> put

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
really important for those trying to put

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.600 
really important for those trying to put
on<00:05:29.230> lean<00:05:29.440> muscle<00:05:29.770> tissue<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:30.460> your

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
on lean muscle tissue that your

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.460 
on lean muscle tissue that your
30-minute<00:05:30.970> window<00:05:31.360> immediately<00:05:31.660> after<00:05:32.350> your

30-minute window immediately after your

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.680 
30-minute window immediately after your
workout<00:05:32.830> it's<00:05:33.490> got<00:05:33.760> to<00:05:33.880> be<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.030> good<00:05:34.300> protein

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
workout it's got to be a good protein

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.360 
workout it's got to be a good protein
source<00:05:34.990> going<00:05:35.320> in<00:05:35.440> okay<00:05:35.560> because<00:05:36.250> your

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
source going in okay because your

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.190 
source going in okay because your
muscles<00:05:36.580> have<00:05:36.820> been<00:05:36.940> broken<00:05:37.300> down<00:05:37.450> they<00:05:37.870> need

muscles have been broken down they need

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.630 
muscles have been broken down they need

that lean muscle tissue they need that

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.760 
that lean muscle tissue they need that
protein<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.630> that<00:05:40.750> you<00:05:40.900> can<00:05:41.050> get<00:05:41.169> stronger<00:05:41.530> and
