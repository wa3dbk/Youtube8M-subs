the ball you pick up your ball and then
when<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> replace<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:57.000> ball<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.989> put<00:00:58.289> your

ball directly in front of the coin the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.130 
ball directly in front of the coin the
reason<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.789> sounds<00:01:03.210> very<00:01:03.329> simple<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
reason that sounds very simple but the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.800 
reason that sounds very simple but the
reason<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:04.949> important<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.299> if

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
reason that it's so important is that if

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.690 
reason that it's so important is that if
one<00:01:07.049> time<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.530> put<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.920> coin<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.369> front<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
one time you put your coin in front of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
one time you put your coin in front of
the<00:01:08.820> ball<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> side<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> ball<00:01:11.040> or

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the ball or on the side of the ball or

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.490 
the ball or on the side of the ball or
behind<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> ball<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.900> don't<00:01:13.170> put<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> back

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
behind the ball if you don't put it back

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.280 
behind the ball if you don't put it back
in<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> same<00:01:14.220> exact<00:01:14.700> way<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.900> could<00:01:16.170> be

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
in the same exact way you could be

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.800 
in the same exact way you could be
getting<00:01:16.470> an<00:01:16.740> advantage<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.549> disadvantage

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
getting an advantage or disadvantage

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
getting an advantage or disadvantage
that's<00:01:18.810> why<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> coin<00:01:19.470> always<00:01:19.979> goes<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that's why the coin always goes to the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.800 
that's why the coin always goes to the
back<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> ball<00:01:22.729> let's<00:01:23.729> assume<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.420> coin

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
