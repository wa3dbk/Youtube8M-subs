00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:09.820
 and it appeals to you my friend the gangsta 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.740
 family today we're going to laugh at it 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.240
 know I know it and we know from 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.280
 marseille on this sea prank that 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.199

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.910
 smooth video in a rather cool way 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.919
 except quiet talking about this pilot 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.449
 Indonesian plane after performing 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.710
 a perfect trip without problems 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.369
 particular managed a landing 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.289
 carefree nickel he just got it wrong 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.460
 airport so I already wonder 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.350
 how he could announce that you 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.670
 passengers you know the famous moment where 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.090
 he wants to give information about the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.530
 arrival point 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.030
 ladies and gentlemen this is your 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.590
 captain who speaks to you accompanied by 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.150
 his ray ban aviator 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.650
 because it did not fit into the budget 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.060
 we are currently stationed in 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.740
 the solar at the doors of greenland the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.690
 outside temperature and -60 2 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.020
 degrees it is currently 6h30 7h 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.550
 local 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.990
 you can now see in 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.160
 looking through the porthole right that the 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.740
 Carnival and angels and four 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.740
 [Applause] 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.260
 and you imagine what it would have given 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.360
 if this guy had not been a pilot but 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.159
 plainly something else still baker 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:40.350
 Filipinos bit but hallucinating in 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.940

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.710
 it's a kind of glasses pair of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.580
 future we can you must m it's a step 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.840
 meaning and that actually allow you to 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 watch a lot of things paint 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.009

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.060
 by drinking his coffee etc and as 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.200
 dude I mean we all thought about the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.759
 same as that is really 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.649
 practice to view his lectures at 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.320
 three dimensions look at 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.380
 documentaries on the internet 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.380
 [Music] 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.110
 good more seriously and because that's 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.819
 to all that guys think when we 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.209
 talk to them about ice balls imagine 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.830
 the scene 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.360
 a guy watching a porn video on 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.739
 cnet team during that time receives 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:30.470

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.860
 but on your screen little rogue ambidextrous 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.600
 you think that's all but it's not 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.190
 not all google does not stop after 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.450
 the google class he invents google 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.070
 thing or they invent google 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.390
 do not know how much they are what 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.620
 is that new things in three 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.760
 bombs these are shoes that speaks 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.410
 that is to say that the shoes that you 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.120
 actually motivates while you're doing it by 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.370
 example of cycling running from 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.960
 sprint lamy walking 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.640
 but hey those shoes too 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.200
 interesting that the concept be it I 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.950
 you rope were made by people 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.150
 correct 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.800
 finally people people people 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.540
 sane I would have liked to see 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.430
 it would have given if it's google thing 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.660
 in this case had been done by 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.340
 young people of our generation people 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.480
 like you like me as we have 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.650
 really looking forward to testing his news 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:29.870
 shoes later floch to blow 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:36.290
 sending ever more legs 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.580
 disgusting but at this moment we see 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.200
 a lot of reports on TV saying 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.340
 Australia is the place to be 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.230
 the place you absolutely have to be 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.000
 absolutely live absolutely see that 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.780
 absolutely go because if a country 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.280
 who is from the kangaroo hamilton country and from 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.780
 sun that you think about the beach with 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.220
 chicks who will your body tanned to dry 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.810

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.060
 [Applause] 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.890
 not long ago in australia so 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.930
 an 8 year old child has died 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.160
 his soul we're not going to laugh about that after 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.160
 being bitten by a bat 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.230
 so batman really became a 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.310
 asshole we confirm that's it and when I 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.350
 look at the teenage girls of the 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.030
 current youth I say to myself for keeping 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:27.100
 this report necessarily had at least 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:29.080
 one who had this reaction on their 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.280
 fate he was holding my fiat 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.390
 we now have red faults to 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.650
 lips in australia a little crazy 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.450
