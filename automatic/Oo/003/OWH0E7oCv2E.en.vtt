for<00:02:40.490> speed<00:02:41.060> they're<00:02:41.330> all<00:02:41.510> confused<00:02:42.430> first<00:02:43.430> of

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
for speed they're all confused first of

all you want to have it be able to move

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.850 
all you want to have it be able to move
efficiently<00:02:47.380> something<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.560> can<00:02:48.710> move

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
efficiently something that you can move

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.220 
efficiently something that you can move
fast<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.300> also<00:02:50.450> has<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.960> be<00:02:51.020> something

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
fast but it also has to be something

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.050 
fast but it also has to be something
that's<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.620> little<00:02:51.800> challenging<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.700> can<00:02:52.730> see

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
that's a little challenging you can see

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.410 
that's a little challenging you can see
here<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:53.770> 495<00:02:54.770> pounds<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.090> pretty<00:02:56.270> much

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
here just 495 pounds and it pretty much

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.350 
here just 495 pounds and it pretty much
just<00:02:56.480> crushed<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.380> but<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:57.770> also

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
just crushed it but it's also

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.630 
just crushed it but it's also
challenging<00:02:59.360> enough<00:02:59.710> to<00:03:00.710> where<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.920> have<00:03:01.430> to

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
challenging enough to where I have to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.430 
challenging enough to where I have to
put<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> lot<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.090> violence<00:03:02.540> into<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:02.930> barbell

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
put a lot of violence into that barbell

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.560 
put a lot of violence into that barbell
and<00:03:03.680> that's<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.550> way<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.700> want<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:05.300> if<00:03:05.480> I

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
and that's the way you want to be if I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.500 
and that's the way you want to be if I
was<00:03:05.720> just<00:03:05.900> moving<00:03:06.110> 225<00:03:06.920> little<00:03:07.510> haphazardly

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
was just moving 225 little haphazardly

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.330

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
to 6 sets of singles at a given weight

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.770 
to 6 sets of singles at a given weight
let's<00:04:09.200> just<00:04:09.410> say<00:04:09.560> 300<00:04:10.070> pounds<00:04:10.459> say<00:04:10.880> use<00:04:11.270> 300

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
let's just say 300 pounds say use 300

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.090 
let's just say 300 pounds say use 300
pounds<00:04:12.170> or<00:04:13.069> six<00:04:13.610> sets<00:04:13.819> of<00:04:14.000> one<00:04:14.180> rep

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
pounds or six sets of one rep

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.430 
pounds or six sets of one rep
then<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.340> could<00:04:15.490> add<00:04:15.820> anywhere<00:04:16.810> between<00:04:16.990> 30

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
then you could add anywhere between 30

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.100 
then you could add anywhere between 30
to<00:04:17.560> 50<00:04:17.980> pounds<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.640> you<00:04:19.330> can<00:04:19.540> depending<00:04:20.020> on

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
to 50 pounds and you can depending on

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.030 
to 50 pounds and you can depending on
strength<00:04:20.500> level<00:04:20.860> and<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:22.000> can<00:04:22.150> do<00:04:22.270> another

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
strength level and you can do another

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.220 
strength level and you can do another
about<00:04:24.040> four<00:04:24.370> or<00:04:24.520> five<00:04:24.730> sets<00:04:25.090> are<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:25.960> really

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
about four or five sets are you really

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.870 
about four or five sets are you really
looking<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.560> end<00:04:26.770> up<00:04:26.920> with<00:04:27.010> about<00:04:27.220> ten<00:04:27.490> sets<00:04:27.730> of

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
looking to end up with about ten sets of

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.090 
looking to end up with about ten sets of
one<00:04:28.090> but<00:04:28.300> for<00:04:28.420> myself<00:04:28.540> personally<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.590> have

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
one but for myself personally I have

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.890 
one but for myself personally I have
always<00:04:30.220> liked<00:04:30.670> to<00:04:30.790> utilize<00:04:31.210> some<00:04:31.540> different

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
always liked to utilize some different

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.250 
always liked to utilize some different
weights

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
weights

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.370 
weights
remember<00:04:33.360> force<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.600> mass<00:04:34.870> times

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
remember force is mass times

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.980 
remember force is mass times
acceleration<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.700> so<00:04:37.270> it's<00:04:37.390> a<00:04:37.450> good<00:04:37.600> idea<00:04:37.720> to

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
acceleration and so it's a good idea to

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.520 
acceleration and so it's a good idea to
mess<00:04:38.410> with<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.570> throw<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.600> little<00:04:40.810> variable<00:04:41.140> in

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
mess with and throw a little variable in

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.140 
mess with and throw a little variable in
there<00:04:41.800> with<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.190> amount<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.460> mass<00:04:42.700> that's<00:04:42.970> on

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
there with the amount of mass that's on

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.660 
there with the amount of mass that's on
the<00:04:43.360> barbell<00:04:43.780> on<00:04:43.990> this<00:04:44.920> particular<00:04:45.430> day<00:04:45.640> we

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
the barbell on this particular day we

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.960 
the barbell on this particular day we
did<00:04:45.970> about<00:04:46.180> six<00:04:46.210> sets<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.950> want<00:04:48.160> short<00:04:48.670> rest

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
did about six sets you want short rest

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.690 
did about six sets you want short rest
periods<00:04:49.510> how<00:04:50.110> short<00:04:50.500> should<00:04:50.710> they<00:04:50.830> be<00:04:51.010> it's

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
periods how short should they be it's

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.190 
periods how short should they be it's
best<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:52.180> be<00:04:52.450> a<00:04:52.480> fifth<00:04:52.780> plate<00:04:53.020> where

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
best to just be a fifth plate where

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.990 
best to just be a fifth plate where
you're<00:04:53.290> in<00:04:53.410> a<00:04:53.440> group<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:53.890> one<00:04:54.100> guy<00:04:54.280> goes<00:04:54.610> after

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
you're in a group and one guy goes after

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.730 
you're in a group and one guy goes after
another<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.480> it<00:04:55.960> kind<00:04:56.140> of<00:04:56.200> just<00:04:56.290> goes<00:04:56.530> when

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
another and it kind of just goes when

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.730 
another and it kind of just goes when
he's<00:04:56.830> ready<00:04:57.100> there<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:57.940> a<00:05:01.560> there<00:05:02.560> is<00:05:02.590> a

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
he's ready there is a there is a

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.550 
he's ready there is a there is a
component<00:05:03.190> of<00:05:03.490> trying<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.180> rush<00:05:04.450> into<00:05:04.810> you

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
component of trying to rush into you

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.620 
component of trying to rush into you
know<00:05:05.650> each<00:05:05.890> each<00:05:06.220> lift<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:06.940> we're<00:05:07.120> trying<00:05:07.420> to

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
know each each lift and we're trying to

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.690 
know each each lift and we're trying to
be<00:05:07.720> conscious<00:05:08.290> of<00:05:08.440> that<00:05:08.680> but<00:05:09.460> we're<00:05:09.580> not

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
be conscious of that but we're not

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.270 
be conscious of that but we're not
timing<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.450> would<00:05:10.630> say<00:05:10.870> sit<00:05:11.710> there<00:05:11.890> and<00:05:12.010> time

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
timing it I would say sit there and time

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.130 
timing it I would say sit there and time
it<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.670> take<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.210> good<00:05:13.480> look<00:05:13.540> at<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:13.930> it's

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
it and take a good look at it it's

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
it and take a good look at it it's
probably<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:15.450> anywhere<00:05:16.450> between<00:05:17.160> seventy

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
probably a anywhere between seventy

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.420 
probably a anywhere between seventy
seconds<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.670> 90<00:05:19.000> seconds<00:05:19.920> rest<00:05:20.920> interval

seconds to 90 seconds rest interval
depending<00:05:22.150> on<00:05:22.320> you<00:05:23.320> know<00:05:23.440> from<00:05:23.680> what<00:05:23.860> lift

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
depending on you know from what lift

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.920 
depending on you know from what lift
that<00:05:24.310> what<00:05:24.460> lift<00:05:24.700> with<00:05:25.000> max<00:05:25.270> going<00:05:25.600> that<00:05:25.750> slow

that what lift with max going that slow

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.630 
that what lift with max going that slow
we<00:05:26.200> got<00:05:26.380> like<00:05:26.530> four<00:05:26.770> out<00:05:26.920> of<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.130> way

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
we got like four out of the way

we got like four out of the way
max<00:05:28.420> was<00:05:28.600> working<00:05:28.870> on<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.080> stiff<00:05:29.350> leg<00:05:29.560> deadlift

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
max was working on so stiff leg deadlift

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.350 
max was working on so stiff leg deadlift
stiff<00:05:30.250> leg<00:05:30.430> dead<00:05:30.670> lifts<00:05:30.850> are<00:05:30.940> great<00:05:31.150> for<00:05:31.300> the

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
stiff leg dead lifts are great for the

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.160 
stiff leg dead lifts are great for the
lower<00:05:31.510> back<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:32.080> glutes<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.470> hamstrings<00:05:34.170> to
