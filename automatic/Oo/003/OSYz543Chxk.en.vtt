00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
administrative abilities you'd be able

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.740 
administrative abilities you'd be able
to<00:02:58.260> kick<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.710> ban<00:02:58.890> people<00:02:59.390> but<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.510> will<00:03:00.630> not

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
to kick and ban people but you will not

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.570 
to kick and ban people but you will not
be<00:03:00.900> able<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.110> configure<00:03:01.500> certain<00:03:02.100> game<00:03:02.280> types

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
be able to configure certain game types

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.090 
be able to configure certain game types
and<00:03:02.820> that's<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.780> cost<00:03:03.930> 1495<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:04.950> about

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
and that's going to cost 1495 so about

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.670 
and that's going to cost 1495 so about
15<00:03:05.790> bucks<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.120> month<00:03:06.270> basically<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.410> have

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
15 bucks a month basically and you have

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.800 
15 bucks a month basically and you have
to<00:03:07.890> rent<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.310> from<00:03:08.460> them<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:09.450> can't<00:03:09.720> go

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
to rent it from them you can't go

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.750 
to rent it from them you can't go
anywhere<00:03:10.140> else<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.560> think<00:03:10.680> that's<00:03:11.040> what

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
anywhere else so I think that's what

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.970 
anywhere else so I think that's what
might<00:03:12.120> piss<00:03:12.540> some<00:03:12.780> PC<00:03:13.020> gamers<00:03:13.470> offers<00:03:13.830> that

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.290 
might piss some PC gamers offers that
