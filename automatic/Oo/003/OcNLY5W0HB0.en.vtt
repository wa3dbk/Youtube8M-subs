of held together by friction the way

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
of held together by friction the way
this<00:01:20.340> case<00:01:20.610> works<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.330> first<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.990> battery

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
this case works is at first the battery

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.609 
this case works is at first the battery
is<00:01:22.560> utilized<00:01:23.430> off<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.030> case<00:01:24.270> itself<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.049> then

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
is utilized off the case itself and then

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.740 
is utilized off the case itself and then
once<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.009> battery<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.700> fully<00:01:26.909> depleted<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
once that battery is fully depleted the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300 
once that battery is fully depleted the
phone<00:01:27.960> starts<00:01:28.320> using<00:01:28.470> its<00:01:28.770> own<00:01:28.950> internal

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
phone starts using its own internal

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
phone starts using its own internal
battery<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.570> why<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.290> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
battery so that's why you see that you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.780 
battery so that's why you see that you
know<00:01:31.650> when<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> plug<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.280> phone<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.640> it's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
know when you plug your phone and it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.069 
know when you plug your phone and it's
actually<00:01:32.939> being<00:01:33.360> charged<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:33.900> it's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
actually being charged because it's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.080 
actually being charged because it's
using<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> battery<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> case<00:01:35.340> first<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
using the battery off the case first and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969 
using the battery off the case first and
then<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> goes<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.740> phone's

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
then it goes on to use the phone's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.640 
then it goes on to use the phone's
battery<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.840> always<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.500> much
