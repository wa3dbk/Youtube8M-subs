00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the rack to dragon and one of my videos

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.509 
the rack to dragon and one of my videos
when<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.140> Dino<00:00:25.410> dragon<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.070> first<00:00:26.340> released

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
when the Dino dragon was first released

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.400 
when the Dino dragon was first released
I<00:00:26.849> said<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.330> they're<00:00:27.779> probably<00:00:28.140> gonna

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
I said that they're probably gonna

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.339 
I said that they're probably gonna
release<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> t-rex<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:30.990> exactly

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
release a t-rex and this is what exactly

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.940 
release a t-rex and this is what exactly
I<00:00:31.769> guess<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.840> direct<00:00:34.380> dragon

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
I guess this is what the direct dragon

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.810 
I guess this is what the direct dragon
is<00:00:35.190> exactly<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.000> mean<00:00:37.010> they<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.040> named<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
is exactly I mean they just named it the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
is exactly I mean they just named it the
Rex<00:00:39.090> dragon<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:40.050> pretty<00:00:40.350> sure<00:00:40.620> it's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
Rex dragon but I'm pretty sure it's

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
Rex dragon but I'm pretty sure it's
supposed<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> t-rex<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.390> supposed<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
supposed to be a t-rex it's supposed to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.250 
supposed to be a t-rex it's supposed to
represent<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.620> t-rex<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.480> don't<00:00:45.870> know<00:00:45.989> they

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
represent a t-rex but I don't know they

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.660 
represent a t-rex but I don't know they
probably<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.680> didn't<00:00:47.129> want<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> call<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
probably just didn't want to call it
t-rex<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.660> had<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> pterodactyl
