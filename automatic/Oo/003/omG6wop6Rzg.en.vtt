00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.410
 this all of us 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.329
 we have to be able to hydrogen from 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.199
 hydrogen when it is outside the 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:30.119
 magnetic field is disoriented in 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.560
 several ways in several ways and its 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.570
 Magnetic vector will always be zero 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.059
 not then at the time of entering the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 patient the magnetic vector is worth a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.550
 magnitude that will be addressed to in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.220
 zeta direction of the magnetic field of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.290
 He decides all gandia handing me there 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.350
 a magnet that is an electromagnet as it 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:54.050
 I said then they are going to line up 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.210
 align the team has some 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.579
 a radiofrequency transmitter that emitter 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.309
 radio frequency is emitted by 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.559
 the machine orders it and this the resonator 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.590
 emits the radio frequency wave from 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.740
 causes the spins to derive to a 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.560
 magnitude of this x in this magnitude of 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.259
 x and in us we can stop lying 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.690
 the pulse and then the magnitude of 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.759
 that goes back to the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.220
 magnetization is where we 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.430
 we can capture the images of each 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.640
 tissue not distinguish so much in t1 as in 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.909
 t2 in this movement 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.880
 but the clear movement emits a 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.979
 an energy because they make an energy 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.829
 It is emitted wave 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.710
 radio frequency then they are put 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.689
 they phase in and everyone starts to 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.100
 move and it's there in the lag in 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.969
 us where we can 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.969
 distinguish the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.930
 each variety each east 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:01.010
 tissue intensity or each 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.670
 characteristic of the body and the 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.950
 antennas and antennas serve to 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.869
 receive that energy that has been 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.090
 released that energy that has been released 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.430
 is the one that will form the image the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.530
 energy that is released because first 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.090
 us by the waves of 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.070
 radio frequency we two emit 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.860
 then the spins starts to win 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:26.330
 energy then they start to shift and 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.490
 it is in that phase shift that another one is issued 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.890
 an energy and that energy is what is 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.190
 transform into that image 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.200
 the receivers work if there are antennas 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.300
 that are receivers and transmitters at the same time 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.310
 The kneeling times are 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.580
 only these receptors also the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.670
 of them the big both the head 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.130
 as the cardiac one are emitters and 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.120
 receivers the team itself also has 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.629
 a 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.319
 inside has to emit this pulse 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.319
 radiofrequency 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.959
 well there are antennas for brains like them 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.299
 I said before the knees antennas for 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.730
 look like cardiac antennas exams for 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.530
 make shoulder antennas to do column 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.379
 we can use the same antenna 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.970
 field the magnetic field of 21 before a 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.950
 own 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.320
 antennas for abdomen pelvis 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.020
 lower limbs limb angels 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.470
 lower 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.390
 do not 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.390
 there is a variety for atm likewise 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.990
 with respect to protections and this 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.880
 ambient 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.530
 we are out because we have a 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.900
 elevated magnetic field that plays in 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.610
 magnetic field in which you came from 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.050
 protection has here because I observe that 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.330
 also the video is a special video 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.000
 the hours 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.760
 what effect do we not speak the resonance if 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.030
 do not be extreme magnetism to what 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.600
 effect has on the human body 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.600
 the excess of 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.450
 and good as I say be in without 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.670
 income without substance 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.620
 you do not have metallic clicks you do not have 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.690
 health there is no step you do not have a pacemaker no 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.180
 it's going to happen nothing no problem the only thing 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.410
 that can produce is heat not by the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.560
 energy exchange is giving them 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:25.300
 is not going to produce clear that heat what 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.710
 only that no but glass and that's 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.570
 so that no waves of 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.699
 radio frequency interfere with 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.930
 the image that is produced there 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.220
 because if waves come in here 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.460
 radiofrequency images interfere 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.380
 is in the faraday cage and do not enter 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.210
 do not enter what approximated will disturb 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.370
 the image and produces distortion the 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.199
 images in the radiofrequency then 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.510
 he applied the radiofrequency emitted by 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.370
 the body is very small very small is 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.340
 too small 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.590
 and clear disturbs and produce artifacts 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.449
 there in the images why this is all 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.449
 given to the lower part 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.190
 it's not good it's not going to produce us 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.840
 enter, take out and try to receive calls not 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.750
 I enter an application is closed 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.969
 no no no signal reception here 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.339
 all this is shielded not 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.310
 the question good protocols people 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:22.530
 500 agents 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.750
 yes because he has in this small amount 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.210
 of iron then they can not pass 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.300
 patients with problems in heat produces 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.750
 heat more than all heat irritates us 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.490
 no heat 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.440
 denote by having ink 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.350
 tattoo 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.520
 full 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.520
 everything I close 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.360
 and of course 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:52.069
 people who have prostheses can not 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.069
 pass us any regulation 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.949
 because the plan does not come before 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.819
 although the engineers of the same 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.030
 institution and do calibrations with 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.250
 the phantoms that mention them and here 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.599
 there is no greater risk from the external 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.300
 ionizing 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.030
 the risk is for patients who have 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.139
 example that with a bullet then it 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:24.260
 have to ask a question several 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.890
 times the patient does not 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.890
 thank you very much
