00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
of a little over an hour well actually I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.670 
of a little over an hour well actually I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
think it's 90 minutes I'm not a hundred

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.940 
think it's 90 minutes I'm not a hundred
percent<00:02:07.799> sure<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:09.000> packaging<00:02:09.770> it's<00:02:10.770> no

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
percent sure I the packaging it's no

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.570 
percent sure I the packaging it's no
longer<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.459> me<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.239> don't

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
longer with me so I don't

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.220 
longer with me so I don't
have<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.970> probably<00:02:13.510> should<00:02:13.720> look<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.050> up

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
have that probably should look that up

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.460 
have that probably should look that up
sorry<00:02:14.560> guys<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.900> decently<00:02:17.380> long

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
sorry guys but it's it's decently long

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.890 
sorry guys but it's it's decently long
and<00:02:18.400> then<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.760> low<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:20.530> very<00:02:20.950> long<00:02:21.190> it's

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
and then the low is very long it's

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.190 
and then the low is very long it's
almost<00:02:22.900> two<00:02:23.320> hours<00:02:23.350> I<00:02:23.710> think<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.780> got<00:02:25.930> four

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
almost two hours I think it's got four

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.240 
almost two hours I think it's got four
modes<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:27.030> high<00:02:28.030> medium<00:02:29.020> low<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.920> then

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
modes on it high medium low and then

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.760

flash<00:02:30.810> which<00:02:31.810> would<00:02:31.960> be<00:02:32.020> good<00:02:32.200> for<00:02:32.470> if<00:02:32.590> you're

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
flash which would be good for if you're

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.630 
flash which would be good for if you're

thing<00:02:36.910> if<00:02:37.180> you're<00:02:37.420> at<00:02:37.540> night<00:02:37.720> trying<00:02:37.990> to

thing if you're at night trying to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.180 
thing if you're at night trying to
signal<00:02:38.260> since<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.040> can't<00:02:39.250> use<00:02:39.460> your<00:02:41.190> mirror

signal since you can't use your mirror

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.560 
signal since you can't use your mirror
you<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.520> use<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:44.140> whistle<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.570> a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
you can use this and a whistle and a

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.530 
you can use this and a whistle and a
fire<00:02:47.580> those<00:02:48.580> could<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:48.820> three<00:02:49.090> things<00:02:49.330> to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
fire those could be three things to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:03:01.500 
fire those could be three things to
signal<00:02:49.960> with<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:56.190> light<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.820> type<00:03:01.480> of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
signal with the light the the type of

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.830 
signal with the light the the type of
light<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.800> produces<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.550> white<00:03:04.450> LED

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
light that this produces is white LED

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
light that this produces is white LED
and<00:03:05.080> it's<00:03:05.200> um<00:03:05.640> flood<00:03:06.640> light<00:03:07.470> meaning<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.709> it

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
and it's um flood light meaning that it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.900 
and it's um flood light meaning that it
is<00:03:09.700> mean<00:03:10.060> meant<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.570> cover<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.990> large<00:03:11.530> area<00:03:11.910> but

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
is mean meant to cover a large area but

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.460 
is mean meant to cover a large area but
it<00:03:13.000> doesn't<00:03:13.300> throw<00:03:13.540> very<00:03:13.810> far

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.550 

some<00:03:17.470> headlamps<00:03:18.280> do<00:03:18.519> both<00:03:19.510> flood<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.200> spot

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
some headlamps do both flood and spot

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.350 
some headlamps do both flood and spot
but<00:03:20.890> most<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.370> time<00:03:21.550> you<00:03:21.730> just<00:03:21.910> need<00:03:22.000> a

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
but most of the time you just need a

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.720 
but most of the time you just need a
flood<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:23.470> add<00:03:23.590> lamp<00:03:23.830> because<00:03:24.040> majority<00:03:24.670> of

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
flood for add lamp because majority of

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.160 
flood for add lamp because majority of
the<00:03:24.790> time<00:03:24.940> you're<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.180> walking<00:03:25.540> around<00:03:25.810> real

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
the time you're just walking around real

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.190 
the time you're just walking around real
close<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.470> need<00:03:26.800> to<00:03:27.670> illuminate<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.630> front<00:03:29.080> of

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
close and need to illuminate in front of

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.650 
close and need to illuminate in front of
you<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.709> don't<00:03:29.760> trip<00:03:30.760> over<00:03:30.910> anything<00:03:31.300> and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
you so you don't trip over anything and

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.130 
you so you don't trip over anything and
if<00:03:31.840> you're<00:03:31.989> trying<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.290> find<00:03:32.700> wood<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.959> just

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
if you're trying to find wood you just

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.390 
if you're trying to find wood you just
need<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.350> be<00:03:35.470> illuminated<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.070> don't<00:03:36.250> really

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
need to be illuminated you don't really

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.540 
need to be illuminated you don't really
need<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:37.410> see<00:03:38.410> things<00:03:38.590> far<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.280> could<00:03:39.430> be

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
need to see things far that it could be

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.940 
need to see things far that it could be
the<00:03:40.450> duty<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.019> could<00:03:41.230> be<00:03:41.320> done<00:03:41.709> with<00:03:41.890> a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
the duty of that could be done with a

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.699 
the duty of that could be done with a
flashlight<00:03:43.110> although<00:03:44.110> I<00:03:44.170> don't<00:03:44.380> really<00:03:44.530> have

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
flashlight although I don't really have

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.180 
flashlight although I don't really have
any<00:03:45.000> really<00:03:46.000> nice<00:03:46.570> flashlights<00:03:48.870> but<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.650> you

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
any really nice flashlights but the you

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.740 
any really nice flashlights but the you
the<00:03:51.400> actuators<00:03:52.000> just<00:03:52.239> whatever<00:03:52.510> rubber<00:03:53.610> click

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
the actuators just whatever rubber click

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.800 
the actuators just whatever rubber click
button<00:03:55.750> on<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.989> top<00:03:56.200> so<00:03:56.920> it's<00:03:57.070> easy<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.910> find

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
button on the top so it's easy to find

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.870 
button on the top so it's easy to find
because<00:03:59.350> it's<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.530> only<00:03:59.590> rubber<00:03:59.860> part<00:04:00.190> at

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
because it's the only rubber part at

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.050 
because it's the only rubber part at
night<00:04:01.180> when<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:01.750> turn<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.140> on<00:04:02.200> your<00:04:02.440> head

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
night when you turn it on on your head

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.400 
night when you turn it on on your head
the<00:04:04.060> front<00:04:04.780> head<00:04:05.080> rotates<00:04:06.010> up<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.209> down

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
the front head rotates up and down

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.860 
the front head rotates up and down
although<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.830> think<00:04:09.070> just<00:04:09.760> words<00:04:10.390> that<00:04:10.690> right

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
although I think just words that right

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.520 
although I think just words that right
now<00:04:11.049> is<00:04:11.260> perfect<00:04:11.709> it's<00:04:11.860> already<00:04:12.150> angled

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
now is perfect it's already angled

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.430 
now is perfect it's already angled
because<00:04:14.530> you<00:04:14.650> can<00:04:14.769> just<00:04:14.920> turn<00:04:15.100> your<00:04:15.280> head<00:04:16.440> but

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
because you can just turn your head but

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.530 
because you can just turn your head but
I<00:04:17.709> mean<00:04:18.070> if<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.430> are<00:04:18.760> doing<00:04:18.940> something<00:04:19.239> down

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
I mean if you are doing something down

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.060 
I mean if you are doing something down
and<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.870> don't<00:04:20.049> want<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.440> don't<00:04:20.560> have<00:04:20.919> your

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
and you don't want you don't have your

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.159 
and you don't want you don't have your
head<00:04:21.220> turned<00:04:21.520> far<00:04:22.360> enough<00:04:22.539> down<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:22.990> can

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
head turned far enough down you can

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.659 
head turned far enough down you can
definitely<00:04:23.620> adjust<00:04:24.460> it

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
definitely adjust it

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.499 
definitely adjust it
so<00:04:25.939> it's<00:04:26.300> good<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.509> have<00:04:26.629> the<00:04:26.780> option<00:04:28.509> excuse

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
so it's good to have the option excuse

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.510 
so it's good to have the option excuse
me<00:04:29.659> uh<00:04:29.689> I<00:04:31.300> believe<00:04:32.300> on<00:04:32.719> high<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.919> throws<00:04:34.310> about

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
me uh I believe on high it throws about

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.260 
me uh I believe on high it throws about
39<00:04:35.650> meters<00:04:36.650> or<00:04:37.449> feet<00:04:38.449> can't<00:04:39.289> call<00:04:40.120> which<00:04:41.120> is

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
39 meters or feet can't call which is

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.839 
39 meters or feet can't call which is
pretty<00:04:41.449> good<00:04:41.689> but<00:04:41.870> that's<00:04:41.960> only<00:04:42.340> if<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.550> just

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
pretty good but that's only if you just

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.429 
pretty good but that's only if you just
turn<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.210> with<00:04:44.360> fresh<00:04:44.629> batteries<00:04:45.139> and<00:04:45.349> then

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:45.439 
turn on with fresh batteries and then

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.640 
turn on with fresh batteries and then
slowly<00:04:45.800> declines<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.669> like<00:04:47.180> 35<00:04:47.779> feet<00:04:48.110> after<00:04:48.439> 10

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
slowly declines to like 35 feet after 10

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.670 
slowly declines to like 35 feet after 10
minutes<00:04:48.860> or<00:04:49.159> so<00:04:49.340> and<00:04:49.999> I've<00:04:50.120> this<00:04:50.629> isn't<00:04:50.990> as

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
minutes or so and I've this isn't as

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.589 
minutes or so and I've this isn't as
bright<00:04:51.889> as<00:04:52.129> it<00:04:52.159> it's<00:04:52.460> pretty<00:04:53.029> close<00:04:53.270> but<00:04:53.569> I

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
bright as it it's pretty close but I

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.420 
bright as it it's pretty close but I
went<00:04:54.560> camping<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.479> used<00:04:56.479> it<00:04:56.800> heavily<00:04:57.800> on<00:04:58.129> that

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
went camping and used it heavily on that

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.990

you've been in the dark for a while so

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.790 
you've been in the dark for a while so
if<00:05:54.710> it<00:05:54.889> had<00:05:55.069> more<00:05:55.610> of<00:05:55.729> a<00:05:55.849> dimmer<00:05:56.629> light<00:05:57.020> just

if it had more of a dimmer light just

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.469 
if it had more of a dimmer light just
for<00:05:58.870> in<00:05:59.870> the<00:06:00.080> tent<00:06:00.319> use<00:06:00.849> that<00:06:01.849> would<00:06:02.000> be<00:06:02.029> nice

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
for in the tent use that would be nice

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.480 
for in the tent use that would be nice
but<00:06:02.509> I<00:06:02.899> mean<00:06:03.379> it's<00:06:03.560> only<00:06:03.620> twenty<00:06:04.009> five<00:06:04.099> dollars

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
but I mean it's only twenty five dollars

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.249 
but I mean it's only twenty five dollars
I<00:06:04.669> mean<00:06:04.819> if<00:06:05.029> you<00:06:05.270> went<00:06:05.479> for<00:06:05.689> like<00:06:05.810> a<00:06:05.870> fifty

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
I mean if you went for like a fifty

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.409 
I mean if you went for like a fifty
dollar<00:06:06.289> one<00:06:06.770> I<00:06:06.800> am<00:06:07.520> assuming<00:06:07.789> that<00:06:07.969> may<00:06:08.210> have

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
dollar one I am assuming that may have

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.189 
dollar one I am assuming that may have
that<00:06:09.069> mode<00:06:10.149> or<00:06:11.149> you<00:06:11.419> could<00:06:11.599> use<00:06:12.050> your

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
that mode or you could use your

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.159 
that mode or you could use your
flashlight<00:06:12.500> since<00:06:12.979> you<00:06:13.099> don't<00:06:13.279> really<00:06:13.430> need

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
flashlight since you don't really need

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.279 
flashlight since you don't really need
two<00:06:15.169> hands<00:06:15.439> as<00:06:15.680> much<00:06:15.710> in<00:06:16.189> the<00:06:16.399> tent<00:06:16.610> but
