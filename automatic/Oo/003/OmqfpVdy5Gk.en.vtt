00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.980
 well this is the little move of dynamo 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.930
 It's a 2013 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.270
 It is a machine that responds 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.610
 pretty well I barely made a trip to 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.410
 Toluca to the state of Tlaxcala and without 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.830
 no problem aesthetically so good 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.860
 It is a return and depending on tastes 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.430
 for me it's a pretty pretty bike 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.940
 pretty 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.710
 you really do not read any modification 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.380
 more than the paint is a matte black 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.300
 opaque and some details in vinyl in the 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.399
 rear fender 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.840
 it corresponds very well the motorcycle at speed 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.760
 of 100 130 on the rim of the entrance 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.210
 tends to migrate a little we have a pension 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.850
 lead 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.370
 but being a rigid box good 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.690
 in the later parts we only count 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.670
 with him 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.840
 spring cushion of the same 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.440
 seat is basically this is the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.440
 small green voice 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.399
 we have a high flow filter is removed 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.790
 the filter of the flows out there and the 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:20.090
 good escape because he was a driller 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.460
 to give it a sound a little 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.260
 best 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.560
 let's turn it on so they can 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.560
 listen to the sound of the bike with 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.000
 the move 200 d 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.000
 what do you want dynamos more or less
