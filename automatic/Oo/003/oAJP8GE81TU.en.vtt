pink bismuth across all three games the
puzzles<00:01:35.690> basically<00:01:36.230> take<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.560> same<00:01:36.740> approach

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890

lots<00:01:41.480> of<00:01:41.570> headaches<00:01:41.930> robot<00:01:42.740> rescue<00:01:43.130> is

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
lots of headaches robot rescue is

lots of headaches robot rescue is
obviously<00:01:43.640> about<00:01:43.850> rescuing<00:01:44.540> robots<00:01:45.050> so

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
obviously about rescuing robots so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.530 
obviously about rescuing robots so
there's<00:01:46.010> a<00:01:46.070> very<00:01:46.250> mechanical<00:01:46.940> approach<00:01:47.270> to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
there's a very mechanical approach to

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.660 
there's a very mechanical approach to
the<00:01:47.660> levels<00:01:48.020> it's<00:01:48.410> like<00:01:48.530> it's<00:01:49.100> like<00:01:49.160> figuring

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
the levels it's like it's like figuring

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.790 
the levels it's like it's like figuring

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
out how to put a mousetrap together

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.640 
out how to put a mousetrap together
remember<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.990> then<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:54.140> knock<00:01:54.620> it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
remember that then you just knock it

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.149 
remember that then you just knock it
over

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
over

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.080 
over
haha<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:57.170> robot<00:01:57.650> rescue<00:01:58.159> can<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.730> lot<00:01:59.060> to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
haha the robot rescue can be a lot to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.040 
haha the robot rescue can be a lot to
handle<00:01:59.590> both<00:02:00.590> mentally<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.670> visually<00:02:02.420> we'll

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
handle both mentally and visually we'll

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.630 
handle both mentally and visually we'll
get<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.440> visual<00:02:03.770> part<00:02:04.040> later<00:02:04.220> but

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
get to the visual part later but

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.120 
get to the visual part later but
seriously<00:02:05.300> these<00:02:05.900> puzzles<00:02:06.409> are<00:02:06.470> brutal<00:02:06.950> I

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
seriously these puzzles are brutal I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.710 
seriously these puzzles are brutal I
actually<00:02:07.460> mentioned<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.269> our<00:02:08.390> view<00:02:08.420> of

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
actually mentioned this in our view of

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.080 
actually mentioned this in our view of
robot<00:02:09.140> rescue<00:02:09.500> 2<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.580> levels<00:02:10.879> almost

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
robot rescue 2 but the levels almost

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.850 
robot rescue 2 but the levels almost
feel<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.659> they<00:02:11.959> were<00:02:12.019> designed<00:02:12.200> by<00:02:12.590> some

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
feel like they were designed by some

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.970 
feel like they were designed by some
smartass<00:02:13.790> dorks<00:02:14.420> for<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> level<00:02:15.110> editor<00:02:15.349> they

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
smartass dorks for the level editor they

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.640 
smartass dorks for the level editor they
just<00:02:16.159> have<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> chaotic<00:02:16.879> messy<00:02:17.810> look<00:02:18.110> which<00:02:18.530> is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
just have a chaotic messy look which is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.530 
just have a chaotic messy look which is
actually<00:02:19.040> very<00:02:19.069> daunting<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:20.090> takes<00:02:20.330> thought

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
actually very daunting it takes thought

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.270 
actually very daunting it takes thought
just<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.900> make<00:02:21.049> sense<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> puzzles<00:02:21.980> let

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
just to make sense of the puzzles let

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.119 
just to make sense of the puzzles let
alone<00:02:22.489> solve

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.589 

another<00:02:29.129> part<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.639> challenge<00:02:30.120> comes<00:02:30.420> from

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
another part of the challenge comes from

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.119 
another part of the challenge comes from
