will then ask you to perform this

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.649 
will then ask you to perform this
maneuver<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.700> first<00:01:35.909> thing<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> must<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.630> is

once you have straightened the car in
the<00:03:27.910> new<00:03:28.060> road<00:03:28.300> reverse<00:03:28.900> back<00:03:29.170> about<00:03:29.470> four<00:03:29.830> to

the new road reverse back about four to
five<00:03:29.980> car<00:03:30.430> lengths<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:30.940> order<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.450> safely

five car lengths in order to safely

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.480 
five car lengths in order to safely

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.790 

now<00:03:36.210> let's<00:03:36.810> look<00:03:36.960> at<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:37.170> maneuver<00:03:37.410> again

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
now let's look at this maneuver again

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.110 
now let's look at this maneuver again
only<00:03:38.130> this<00:03:38.370> time<00:03:38.430> without<00:03:38.910> any<00:03:39.090> pauses

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120

so<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.270> summary<00:03:43.650> check<00:03:44.650> all<00:03:44.860> around<00:03:45.250> you

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
so in summary check all around you

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.670 
so in summary check all around you
before<00:03:45.850> moving<00:03:46.090> off<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.960> make<00:03:47.200> sure<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.650> is

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
before moving off to make sure it is

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.150 
before moving off to make sure it is
safe<00:03:48.090> when<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.210> is<00:03:49.420> safe<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.720> move<00:03:50.020> start<00:03:50.830> drive

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
safe when it is safe to move start drive

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.810 
safe when it is safe to move start drive
towards<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.030> past<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:53.080> junction<00:03:53.610> look<00:03:54.610> into
