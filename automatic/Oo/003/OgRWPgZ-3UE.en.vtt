00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
technical steps over and over again I

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.690 
technical steps over and over again I
also<00:03:03.720> had<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.140> sort<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.160> adolescent

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
also had this sort of adolescent

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.060 
also had this sort of adolescent
obsession<00:03:06.120> with<00:03:06.270> D<00:03:06.360> H<00:03:06.450> Lawrence<00:03:06.980> during<00:03:07.980> the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
obsession with D H Lawrence during the

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.140 
obsession with D H Lawrence during the
time<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.400> he<00:03:08.490> was<00:03:08.580> living<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:08.910> Taos<00:03:09.120> New

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
time that he was living in Taos New

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.460 
time that he was living in Taos New
Mexico<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.860> guess<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.160> was<00:03:11.280> early<00:03:11.640> 1920s<00:03:12.540> and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
Mexico so I guess I was early 1920s and

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.240 
Mexico so I guess I was early 1920s and
I<00:03:13.530> think<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.770> would've<00:03:13.920> been<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> really

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
I think that would've been a really

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.550 
I think that would've been a really
exciting<00:03:14.580> time<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.910> be<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.840> southwest<00:03:16.320> in

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
exciting time to be in the southwest in

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.860 
exciting time to be in the southwest in
the<00:03:16.650> US<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:17.790> Georgia<00:03:18.090> O'Keeffe<00:03:18.450> making

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the US like Georgia O'Keeffe making

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.370 
the US like Georgia O'Keeffe making
paintings<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:20.180> Santa<00:03:21.180> Fe<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.750> could<00:03:22.260> go

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
paintings and in Santa Fe I could go

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.120 
paintings and in Santa Fe I could go
back<00:03:22.590> as<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.010> dancer<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.910> any<00:03:24.090> point<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.570> history

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
back as a dancer to any point in history

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.950 
back as a dancer to any point in history
I'm<00:03:26.130> sure<00:03:26.370> everyone<00:03:26.700> said<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.630> Ballet

I'm sure everyone said this like Ballet

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.300 
I'm sure everyone said this like Ballet
Russe<00:03:28.260> Paris<00:03:29.390> 1910s<00:03:30.390> no<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.070> totally

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
Russe Paris 1910s no that is totally

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.120 
Russe Paris 1910s no that is totally
where<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.670> would<00:03:32.820> be<00:03:32.970> like<00:03:33.440> Diaghilev<00:03:34.440> Nijinsky

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
where I would be like Diaghilev Nijinsky

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.490 
where I would be like Diaghilev Nijinsky
Nijinsky<00:03:35.760> at<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> height<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.320> these

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
Nijinsky at the height of these

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.350 
Nijinsky at the height of these
interdisciplinary<00:03:38.000> collaborations<00:03:39.000> with

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
interdisciplinary collaborations with

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.240 
interdisciplinary collaborations with
like<00:03:39.480> Picasso<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.320> Jean<00:03:40.470> Cocteau<00:03:40.830> making

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
like Picasso and Jean Cocteau making

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.580 
like Picasso and Jean Cocteau making
costumes<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.970> libretto<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.690> commissioned

think<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.640> would<00:03:47.790> totally<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.390> the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
think that that would totally be the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.920 
think that that would totally be the
place<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:49.070> one<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.340> most<00:03:50.930> exciting

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930

things about working in this environment

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
things about working in this environment
is<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:56.010> profound<00:03:56.400> sense<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.700> community

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
is the the profound sense of community

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.550 
is the the profound sense of community
