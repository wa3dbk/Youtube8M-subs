nine three if they can beat that time
that<00:02:07.539> would<00:02:07.690> be<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:08.229> really<00:02:08.950> solid<00:02:09.369> swim<00:02:09.940> and

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
that would be a really solid swim and

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.660 
that would be a really solid swim and
also<00:02:11.019> plan<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.320> little<00:02:11.560> bit<00:02:11.799> of<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.950> seal<00:02:12.220> and

also plan a little bit of a seal and
yeah<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.060> probably<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.720> time<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.200> look<00:02:14.350> for

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
yeah it probably is a time that look for

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.930 
yeah it probably is a time that look for
them<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.709> make<00:02:14.860> sure<00:02:14.890> they<00:02:15.220> qualify<00:02:15.640> always

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940

them to make sure they qualify always
there's<00:02:16.360> no<00:02:16.420> question<00:02:16.780> about<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.019> if<00:02:17.320> they

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
there's no question about that if they

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.930 
there's no question about that if they
can<00:02:17.620> beat<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:17.860> Australian<00:02:18.370> time<00:02:18.579> they're<00:02:18.790> in
