00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
of edge of it hasn't been that great and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
of edge of it hasn't been that great and
as<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.879> Windows<00:00:57.300> 8<00:00:57.510> user<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.129> totally<00:00:59.129> agree<00:00:59.239> even

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
as a Windows 8 user I totally agree even

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
as a Windows 8 user I totally agree even
with<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> windows<00:01:00.719> 8.1<00:01:01.320> Update<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.100> still<00:01:02.430> feel

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
with the windows 8.1 Update I still feel

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.490 
with the windows 8.1 Update I still feel
like<00:01:02.850> when<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.660> using<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.960> desktop<00:01:04.170> computer

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
like when I'm using a desktop computer

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
like when I'm using a desktop computer
that<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:06.150> using<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.720> desktop

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
that I'm not really using a desktop

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.950 
that I'm not really using a desktop
computer<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> feel<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.100> Microsoft<00:01:08.670> has

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
computer and I feel that Microsoft has

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.800 
computer and I feel that Microsoft has
detached<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.470> lot<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.250> their<00:01:11.430> desktop<00:01:12.180> users

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
detached a lot of their desktop users

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.679 
detached a lot of their desktop users
from<00:01:13.530> using<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.280> desktop<00:01:14.729> points<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
from using a desktop points now of

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.810 
from using a desktop points now of
course<00:01:15.840> i<00:01:16.020> alternate<00:01:16.830> between<00:01:16.890> Windows<00:01:17.490> 7<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
course i alternate between Windows 7 and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.749 
course i alternate between Windows 7 and
Windows<00:01:17.939> 8<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.979> prefer<00:01:20.460> windows

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
Windows 8 and I do really prefer windows

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.539 
Windows 8 and I do really prefer windows
7<00:01:21.060> over<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> gives<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.869> much<00:01:22.110> better

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
7 over it because it gives a much better

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
7 over it because it gives a much better
desktop<00:01:23.549> experience<00:01:23.939> than<00:01:24.720> windows<00:01:25.080> 8<00:01:25.290> does

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
desktop experience than windows 8 does

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.190 
desktop experience than windows 8 does
hopefully<00:01:26.670> though<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.299> windows<00:01:27.780> 9

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
hopefully though with this windows 9

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.899 
hopefully though with this windows 9
update<00:01:28.799> they're<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> focus<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.880> on

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
update they're going to focus more on

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
update they're going to focus more on
desktop<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.869> they're<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.680> bringing

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
desktop and they're going to be bringing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.010 
desktop and they're going to be bringing
in<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.250> lot<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.430> features<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:32.939> wasn't<00:01:33.509> asking

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
in a lot of features that wasn't asking

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.380 
in a lot of features that wasn't asking
for<00:01:34.259> hopefully<00:01:35.250> they'll<00:01:35.400> put<00:01:35.640> Metro<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
for hopefully they'll put Metro on the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.640 
for hopefully they'll put Metro on the
back<00:01:36.600> burner<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.049> guess<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.320> not<00:01:37.409> called

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
back burner I guess it's not called

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.710 
back burner I guess it's not called
metro<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.340> called<00:01:38.549> modern<00:01:39.150> or<00:01:39.450> whatever

it's called anyways though they're gonna

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
it's called anyways though they're gonna
be<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.780> focusing<00:01:43.320> largely<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.340> more

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
be not focusing largely on that but more

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
on the desktop users to kind of gain
