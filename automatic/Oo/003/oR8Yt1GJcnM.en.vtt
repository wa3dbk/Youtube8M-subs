00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.469
 we were given a letter saying that we were fired 29 employees 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.029
 flipped by america tv 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.329
 two of its subsidiaries 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.149
 the rate the mind 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.129
 we deliver a document 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.970
 the next charge 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.640
 for damages 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 the payment of labor benefits 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.270
 with this year a group of almost 30 employees canceled by american the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.149
 years division aero port services 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.550
 of all your work benefits among other things 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.340
 some of them indicate how to stay in this turn and the second in 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.220
 a race 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.040
 now they say they have an impediment to work in any other line 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 flight at the americas airport 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.290
 the journey of this group of people still does not end and nobody knew where 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.120
 reach 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.150
 the complement there was a plan b 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 from a bmw 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.290
 besides being canceled by latin america and without services 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.700
 airports also weigh on them other prohibitions with forgiveness 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.750
 a plan very well 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.540
 inside 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.920
 in the wire says rodríguez leads the group of canceled 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.580
 that tries to get information about the impediment that weighs on 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.759
 them to enter any other company that elaborates not only in the 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.410
 americas airport 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.590
 makes more terminals concessioned by aerodom 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.900
 rodríguez graduated in advertising 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.690
 I had been in the company for a year and ten months and I worked in the area of 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.300
 netanyahu security 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.210
 a town that saw man free 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.900
 the universal 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.290
 after a first moment 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.390
 everybody talks about the above the one of pablo del río nalón 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.349
 Colonel Mejía by then was in charge of 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.349
 identification of that year 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.710
 we have always increased in a program of great value 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.899
 in him if the book 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:25.309
 but the real problem 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.769
 northern fountains 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.249
 but they allow it 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:30.480
 that is the same 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.599
 nobody can work image of the security area what do they have a card 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.620
 which is apt for everything by a certain touch of the airport area 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.989
 but I do not want to see but add 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.489
 evidently the man wounded slight an ideal man in crime 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.599
 the model 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.179
 when obama has not yet achieved something no less 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.909
 I asked 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:00.809
 who do not want 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.899
 a certification of why we can not work at the airport 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:07.569
 in our case 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 us in cold and ninguneo that no case 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:19.419
 it's a shame because most of those who fired us on January 21 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.949
 professional hinson this group of prelates worked in the security of 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.929
 america airport services division 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:30.390
 the guarantee for the safety of the passengers 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.280
 their luggage and control over traffic of banned substances and 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.710
 explosives karina gómez had been working for two years and three months 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.680
 tourism and hotel management and he is fluent in two other languages, English and 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.609
 Italian 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.749
 and in life he not only also urged 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:52.869
 that this can also go beyond the perimeter of the airport, that is, 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:56.799
 limit only the airlines but also that you can not also 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.399
 percent in the problem in our work I am professional just like 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.179
 the vast majority 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.569
 and we have a lot of attitude to work in any company 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:09.319
 and not 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.349
 we were able to get any work the misadventure of the group began to 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.670
 early in the year 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.749
 after the airport services division of the airline 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:23.819
 decided to dismiss all employees more than 30 who participated in the 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.319
 action to ask for work improvements we had some requests 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.629
 that request was based on me and did not mention salary 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.650
 the best in the uniforms thing like that in basic things of the employees 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.220
 we had asked 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.130
 before so much in mind but we had not been heard 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.920
 the action to deliver the document was held around one o'clock and 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.259
 mid afternoon of January 21 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.580
 after receiving the flight from new york 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.629
 the next two flights would be close to three in the afternoon 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.110
 they calculated that they had enough time not to interrupt the work 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.930
 of the company 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.999
 We delivered this document at a time when there was no 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.500
 flights 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.729
 on land 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.929
 they finally arrived if they came but within an hour or so 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:10.240
 we all meet 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.750
 on the open ramp 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.560
 that was the most suitable place for this since there we did not see each other 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.650
 passenger 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.379
 we did not accept anyone 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.740
 but the hands of the clock moved quickly 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.270
 between going to the ramp and then moving to the offices of the company as you 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.559
 suggested the immediate supervisor 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:33.139
 then there the time goes by more or less a span of 40 45 minutes and 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.870
 flights began to arrive 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.990
 the flights of lan doky 40 in the afternoon of the three 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.259
 to which we could not 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.800
 working 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.059
 because we were waiting for our boss the mediate 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.059
 then there is a rather uncomfortable situation 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.900
 the position that the boss diego but talked about the letter 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.159
 he told us that he was going to give it course 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.159
 and that we would immediately retire to our operation 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.750
 the audio that you listen to next
