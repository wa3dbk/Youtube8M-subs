 the possibility of using the six gears 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.040
 in simple or reduced form what 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.840
 provide 12 different speeds 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.420
 for situations that demand a strong 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.990
 boot effort you can count 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.020
 with the so-called first tractor also

 pressing less selects a 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.670
 March down is shorter if you 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.210
 use the box in the automatic mode 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.580
 box 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.070
 hertz will change the gears 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.110
 automatically according to the 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.110
 need for power and torque of the motor 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.660
 the ignition key has the 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:50.590
 following positions disconnected radio 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:53.820
 preheating and starting driving 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.520
 it is not necessary to step on the accelerator 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.260
 the engine command module calculates to 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.960
 through the information of several 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.970
 sensors and the other modules the 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.670
 amount of fuel needed to 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.830
 the start warning lights of 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.660
 board are lit at the moment of 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.480
 start 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:17.290
 that happens for a self-test 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:20.050
 of lights and some functions for 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.990
 warm up the engine put this key in the 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.690
 option on 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.270
 and press the tip of the lever until 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.200
 reach a thousand revolutions per minute or 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.120
 press the resume key 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.460
 to reduce the warm-up time 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.610
 of the engine while the brake 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.610
 parking is activated on 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.530
 exhaust gas regulator 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.100
 restricts its exit and effects a 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.450
 faster motor heating 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.760
 take advantage of the warm-up time of the 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:53.330
 engine to perform a check of the 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.790
 truck and trailer lights after 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.610
 that the engine has warmed up I stepped on 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:01.169
 the brake pedal that will make the 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.840
 acceleration return to idle 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.310
 while the command module will come 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.520
 being informed about the conditions 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.379
 brake 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.910
 If the system is in conditions 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.069
 ideals 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.750
 the module authorizes the use of the function 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:18.689
 constant speed control 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.959
 also called autopilot 

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:23.740
 you can adjust the idle with a lot 

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:25.840
 more easily 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.360
 with the vehicle parked in place 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.740
 safe but with the engine running 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.340
 coolant temperature 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.759
 greater than 50 degrees Celsius presses the 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.370
 brake pedal and at the same time hold 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:43.270
 the key in the summary position by 3 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:46.900
 seconds does not raise the brake foot in 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:51.160
 each click done in set plus is increased 10 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:54.830
 rpm and if you click on set minus it 

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:57.170
 decrease 10 rpm 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.870
 with the desired revolutions but 

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:02.300
 still when the foot on the brake 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:04.940
 return the key to the summary position and 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.940
 press set more at the same time during 

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:12.460
 three seconds the lift the foot of the 

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.460
 brake and the new idle will be recorded
