lab could say the complaints resume
within<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.719> few<00:01:57.899> months<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> license<00:01:58.799> being

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
within a few months of the license being

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.530 
within a few months of the license being
restored<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.030> pattern<00:02:00.270> they

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
restored that it's a pattern they

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690 
restored that it's a pattern they
documented<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.439> hefty<00:02:01.740> binder<00:02:02.369> over

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
documented in this hefty binder over

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.270 
documented in this hefty binder over
several<00:02:03.000> years<00:02:03.180> she's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> chronic<00:02:04.770> offender

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
several years she's a chronic offender

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.219 
several years she's a chronic offender
so<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.000> enforcement<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.930> is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
so we think that enforcement is is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.800 
so we think that enforcement is is
really<00:02:07.590> key<00:02:07.979> when<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.429> these
