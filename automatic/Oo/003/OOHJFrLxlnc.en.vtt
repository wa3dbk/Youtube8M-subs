started on this I'm going to dry sketch

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.210 
started on this I'm going to dry sketch
of<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.549> parallelogram<00:00:18.500> and<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.680> doesn't<00:00:20.039> have

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
of a parallelogram and it doesn't have

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.080 
of a parallelogram and it doesn't have
to<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.520> perfect<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:22.670> i'm<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.060> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
to be perfect and i'm just going to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.150 
to be perfect and i'm just going to
label<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.600> sides<00:00:24.630> here<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> side<00:00:26.130> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
label the sides here we have a side of

10 centimeters and we have a side of 18
centimeters<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.309> then<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.489> also<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.969> an

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
centimeters and then we also have an

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.209 
centimeters and then we also have an
angle<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.719> 46<00:00:34.290> degrees<00:00:34.620> i'm<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> put

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
angle of 46 degrees i'm going to put

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.430 
angle of 46 degrees i'm going to put
that<00:00:35.430> right<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:38.750> then<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.260> this

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that right here and then to do this

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.610 
that right here and then to do this
problem<00:00:41.450> there<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.570> no<00:00:42.809> while<00:00:43.320> there<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
problem there is no while there is a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.779 
problem there is no while there is a
formula<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> area<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
formula for the area of the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.000 
formula for the area of the
parallelogram<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.530> level<00:00:46.590> what

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
parallelogram but at this level what

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.650 
parallelogram but at this level what
they<00:00:47.160> want<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.940> anytime<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.510> ask

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
they want you to do is anytime they ask

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
they want you to do is anytime they ask
you<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:48.930> area<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.890> usually<00:00:50.340> want<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
you about area they usually want you to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.670 
you about area they usually want you to
use<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.149> formula<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.289> formula<00:00:52.649> sheet

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
use that formula on your formula sheet

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.189 
use that formula on your formula sheet
with<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.070> area<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> triangle<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> I'm

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
with the area of a triangle and so I'm

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.430 
with the area of a triangle and so I'm
going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> form<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.920> triangle<00:00:56.190> by<00:00:56.460> connecting

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
going to form a triangle by connecting

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
going to form a triangle by connecting
or<00:00:58.440> drawing<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.430> diagonal<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.090> creating

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
or drawing this diagonal and creating

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.090 
or drawing this diagonal and creating
this<00:01:00.600> triangle<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.980> going

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
this triangle right here and I'm going

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.479 
this triangle right here and I'm going
to<00:01:02.190> label<00:01:02.430> my<00:01:02.789> vertices<00:01:03.149> thermal<00:01:03.690> label<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
to label my vertices thermal label as a

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.289 
to label my vertices thermal label as a
B<00:01:05.840> C<00:01:06.950> now<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> forget<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> says<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.270> your

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
B C now I forget what it says on your

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.500 
B C now I forget what it says on your
formula<00:01:09.840> sheet<00:01:09.920> but<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.060> adjust<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
formula sheet but you have to adjust the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
formula sheet but you have to adjust the
format<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.170> diagram<00:01:13.650> anyways<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
format to your diagram anyways and so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.350 
format to your diagram anyways and so
I'm<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.270> use<00:01:15.330> K<00:01:15.720> equals<00:01:16.400> one-half<00:01:17.400> now

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I'm going to use K equals one-half now

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760 
I'm going to use K equals one-half now
the<00:01:18.420> angle<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.140> dealing<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the angle that I'm dealing with this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.390 
the angle that I'm dealing with this
angle<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> be<00:01:20.939> sign<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:22.400> at

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
angle a so it's going to be sign a at

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.050 
angle a so it's going to be sign a at
the<00:01:23.460> end<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.530> then<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> need<00:01:26.009> little<00:01:26.790> B

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the end here and then I need little B

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.230 
the end here and then I need little B
and<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.720> see<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.970> little

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and little see right there and so little

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.109 
and little see right there and so little
B<00:01:31.159> is<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:33.119> 10<00:01:33.329> centimeters<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.049> little<00:01:34.320> C<00:01:35.119> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
B is the 10 centimeters in little C is

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.560 
B is the 10 centimeters in little C is
the<00:01:36.659> 18<00:01:37.200> centimeters<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.329> plug

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the 18 centimeters so I'm going to plug

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.240 
the 18 centimeters so I'm going to plug
those<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> k<00:01:41.610> equals<00:01:43.820> one-half<00:01:46.100> little<00:01:47.100> B

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
those in so k equals one-half little B

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.380 
those in so k equals one-half little B
is<00:01:47.399> 10<00:01:47.930> little<00:01:48.930> C<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.259> 18<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.090> sign

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
is 10 little C is 18 and then the sign

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.639 
is 10 little C is 18 and then the sign
of<00:01:51.750> our<00:01:51.930> angle<00:01:52.320> which<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.619> 46<00:01:53.630> degrees<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.869> I

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
of our angle which is 46 degrees and I

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.690 
of our angle which is 46 degrees and I
just<00:01:55.829> need<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> plug<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.280> into<00:01:56.520> my

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
just need to plug that into my

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
just need to plug that into my
calculator<00:01:56.759> now<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.689> we're<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.829> round

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
calculator now and we're going to round

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.280 
calculator now and we're going to round
it<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> nearest<00:01:59.490> square<00:02:00.060> centimeter<00:02:00.689> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
it to the nearest square centimeter so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
it to the nearest square centimeter so
this<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> probably<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> disappear<00:02:02.729> when

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
this is probably going to disappear when

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.649 
this is probably going to disappear when
I<00:02:02.939> pull<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.450> calculator<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:05.570> well<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
I pull up my calculator so just well I

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.470 
I pull up my calculator so just well I
just<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.140> remember<00:02:07.320> that
