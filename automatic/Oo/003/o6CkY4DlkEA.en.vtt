00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
review now the reason I'm doing a remake

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.960 
review now the reason I'm doing a remake
of<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> first<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:17.789> was

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
of this is because the first one was

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.640 
of this is because the first one was
kind<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.270> bad<00:00:18.449> quality<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> tripod<00:00:19.439> was

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
kind of bad quality and the tripod was

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.010 
kind of bad quality and the tripod was
crooked<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> was<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.820> dark<00:00:21.119> so

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
crooked and it was all in the dark so

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.300 
crooked and it was all in the dark so
hopefully<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.680> will<00:00:22.740> turn<00:00:22.890> out<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.070> be<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
hopefully this one will turn out to be a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.300 
hopefully this one will turn out to be a
little<00:00:23.519> bit<00:00:23.699> better<00:00:24.529> before<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.830> get<00:00:25.949> into<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
little bit better before we get into the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.700 
little bit better before we get into the
laptop<00:00:26.760> itself<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> battery<00:00:28.019> I'm<00:00:28.289> just

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
laptop itself and the battery I'm just

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.930 
laptop itself and the battery I'm just
going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.039> look<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> charger<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:35.579> shorter

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
going to look at the charger the shorter

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.549 
going to look at the charger the shorter
cord<00:00:36.239> that's<00:00:36.480> attached<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> charger

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
cord that's attached to the charger

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.229 
cord that's attached to the charger
plugs<00:00:37.829> into<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.430> box<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:39.090> will

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
plugs into this little box which will

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.700 
plugs into this little box which will
then<00:00:39.390> plug<00:00:39.629> into<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.260> plugs<00:00:40.469> into

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
then plug into the one that plugs into

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.760 
then plug into the one that plugs into
the<00:00:40.829> computer<00:00:41.930> however<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the computer however this is just the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.900 
the computer however this is just the
one<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.010> will<00:00:44.160> plug<00:00:44.370> into<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> wall<00:00:46.910> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
one that will plug into the wall the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
one that will plug into the wall the
next<00:00:48.180> chord<00:00:48.450> comes<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> charger<00:00:49.469> box

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
next chord comes with the charger box

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
next chord comes with the charger box
and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> port<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.850> will<00:00:51.059> plug

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and then this is the port that will plug

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
and then this is the port that will plug
into<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> laptop<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.559> quite<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> long<00:00:53.160> cord

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
into the laptop it's quite a long cord

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.069 
into the laptop it's quite a long cord
which<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.730> nice<00:00:54.090> for<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> need<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> show

thing I didn't like about this is that

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.490 
thing I didn't like about this is that
the<00:04:56.370> arrow<00:04:56.550> keys<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.630> can<00:04:57.810> get<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:57.960> little<00:04:58.110> weird

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
sizes in this I decide because sometimes

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.230 
sizes in this I decide because sometimes
when<00:05:01.770> you're<00:05:01.889> using<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.220> arrow<00:05:02.400> keys<00:05:02.669> will

just reach up to the shift since you're

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.890 
just reach up to the shift since you're
used<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.950> having<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.520> arrow<00:05:05.700> key<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.270> up
