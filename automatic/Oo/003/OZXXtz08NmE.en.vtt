00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.590
 life is a constant taking of 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.670
 decisions 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.670
 What do I wear today 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.420
 what am I going to take 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.470
 how to spend Saturday night 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.440
 sometimes it can be stressful and why 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.480
 have to choose and not have all this 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.820
 The same must have been thought by the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.730
 of samsung when creating the 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.440
 smartphone that we are going to talk about today 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.750
 It has a touch screen and keyboard 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.150
 full qwerty and his name samsung 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.980
 galaxy chat sure that some of 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.690
 you are thinking but this is how it is 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.940
 and it's just what we 're going to find out 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.530
 now we have around here the galaxy chat 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.000
 we also have the battery 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.540
 we have the quick guide the charger the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 battery and the microusb cable for data and 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.610
 for cargo we simply have to 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.460
 remove the back cover and place the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.530
 sim card in the slot has a 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.570
 internal memory of 4 gigas that we can 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.150
 expand with a micro sd card 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 up to 32GB that is placed here in this 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.190
 slot let's put the battery 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.140
 and we replace the lid 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.960
 and so 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 At first glance I can say that it is a 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.450
 touch-friendly smartphone 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.460
 soft and very manageable 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500
 in addition as it has this black color it gives 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.689
 a sophisticated and elegant air has its 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.179
 point in the back found 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.469
 the 2 megapixel camera without flash with 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.079
 which we can also record videos 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.000
 up here we have the 3.5 connector 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.770
 the jack for headphones and here 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.360
 we have volume control but the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.100
 part star the main part that 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.189
 it deserves a first close-up 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.619
 is up here and the touch screen 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.210
 with the full qwerty keyboard and how 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.219
 you better see this is turning it on like this 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.729
 if you think I'm going to take the 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.729
 sticker 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.860
 and let's turn it on we find 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.350
 a very simple basic configuration 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.180
 you just have to follow the steps here 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.630
 question about our connection I 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.160
 I select yes because I do have 'rate 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.080
 flat ' something that I always recommend 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.940
 because it really is the best way to 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.280
 take advantage of a smartphone and the 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.080
 rest is now now so if for a 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.330
 side we have the touch screen of 3 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.360
 inches with the bottom buttons that 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.730
 we all know contextual menu home and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.890
 back and just below 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.960
 we have the complete qwerty keyboard with 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 this combination imagine how it 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.060
 enjoy the tools of 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.430
 communication email chat sms but let's go 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.560
 by parts as jack said the system 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.300
 operative of samsung galaxy chat is 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.030
 android under the ice cream version 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.920
 sanwich and work under android we 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.640
 offers among many other possibilities 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.750
 the customization ability you will see 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.360
 initially we found five 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.020
 different screens but we can add 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.340
 more or even delete the one we want 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.050
 It also lets us choose which one we want 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.750
 that is our home screen 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.310
 for that we click here in this little house and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.290
 how each person is a world and each 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.730
 world has your needs you can 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.770
 placed on each screen to 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.150
 apps and widgets that you want we go 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.490
 that you put it to your liking because all 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.340
 they are configurable we select 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.380
 menu 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.590
 I'm going to widgets 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.220
 and I'm going to choose yahoo news for that from 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.720
 be informed I keep pressed and 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.170
 release the screen you want by 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.120
 example in this fact to me is that I 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.000
 love to customize everything we are going to 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.640
 have things my way look for 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.360
 example in these accesses from here 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.400
 call agenda messages menu are icons 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.319
 fixed that are always present 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.200
 regardless of the screen in the 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.050
 that we are well then except the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.120
 access to the menu that is not modifiable 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.060
 three others can be changed so that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.960
 You see I'm going to remove agenda I keep 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.490
 pressed and I send it to the trash 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.490
 and under gallery 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.079
 I can go directly to my photos of 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.330
 like the screen on which you are watching 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.699
 that's the idea of ​​being able to access things 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.550
 quickly but what happens 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.259
 when we have it blocked since 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.090
 if I click on any of the icons 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:35.060
 for example the camera and we slide 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.770
 access directly to it without need 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.690
 to go through the main screen 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.729
 and do not think that with all this I have 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.949
 forgot the qwerty keyboard because to 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.740
 nothing in fact here in the customization 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.090
 we also have options 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.009
 these two keys here are 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.349
 configurables can be assigned the 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.260
 function that we want is enough to enter into 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.750
 settings 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.520
 here 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.520
 custom keys 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:06.210
 here 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.830
 and on the first button I have messages this 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.500
 I'll leave it like this in the other 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.320
 I'm going to put calendar assign 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.740
 calendar 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.680
 assigned 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:23.160
 and now you are going to see I give him to go back 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.039
 and when it enters the 1 here I go 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.729
 directly to see my messages and if I 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.530
 I give 2 access to the good calendar and already 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.960
 I'm here I can not resist 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.530
 try the keyboard so I'm going to send 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.530
 a little message 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.849
 It is very good because each key 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.409
 it has a slight relief and this makes 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.409
 It is much easier to press 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.080
 To the touch, the 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.080
 zones of the others 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.130
 I like it 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.630
 send continue with the keyboard when not 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.520
 we are writing if we press 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.120
 any key opens the search 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.120
 from google look 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.990
 and ready to write whatever you want 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.730
 good to write or to say because 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.980
 here we also have the option of 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.750
 voice search has become clear that 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.610
 one of the most attractive things in 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.760
 galaxy chat is your ability to join what 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.230
 tactile with the physical but eye that is not 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.540
 the only thing because it also has other 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.880
 interesting things like for example play 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.550
 store 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.900
 From here you can download thousands of 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.320
 applications that you can enjoy 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.670
 comfortably from your touch screen already 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.640
 that all the contents are adapted 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.130
 perfectly to it and yes before 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.400
 download anything, look at what is already 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.470
 you have in this case maps navigation mis 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.000
 files with which we manage and 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:55.220
 we organize all our files and 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.900
 look at this here that is the quick 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.750
 office and that allows us to visualize 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.120
 all our documents plus things from 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.280
 galaxy chat music player radio 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.590
 fm and one thing that I find extremely 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.450
 Useful from the notification bar 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.610
 that we can deploy from any 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:15.160
 screen we access wifi and gps 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.050
 mobile data notifications and 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.850
 simply with pressing we activate them or 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.130
 we deactivate instantly that easy 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.590
 without having to go through menus or submenus 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.420
 and up to here the samsung galaxy chat a 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.430
 social smartphone that combines the 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.320
 qwerty keyboard comfort with the 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.940
 advantages of the touch screen and how 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.190
 I said at the beginning because I'm going to choose 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.580
 If I can have it all we'll see each other in the 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.580
 next
