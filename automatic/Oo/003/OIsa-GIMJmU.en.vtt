00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
them off because if theory is on and you

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.800 
them off because if theory is on and you
have<00:02:40.190> disabled<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.850> Facebook<00:02:41.390> app<00:02:41.570> and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
have disabled the Facebook app and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.020 
have disabled the Facebook app and
someone<00:02:42.650> launches<00:02:43.130> Siri<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.550> says<00:02:43.790> launch
