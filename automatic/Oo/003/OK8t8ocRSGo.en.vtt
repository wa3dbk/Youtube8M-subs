right<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.530> guess<00:02:57.950> one<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.340> last<00:02:58.519> times

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
right I guess one of the last times

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.880 
right I guess one of the last times
probably<00:02:59.600> not<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.930> last<00:02:59.959> time<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.739> saw

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
probably not the last time that you saw

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.400 
probably not the last time that you saw
Darby<00:03:01.610> was<00:03:01.940> at<00:03:02.120> Wembley<00:03:02.569> on<00:03:02.690> what<00:03:02.870> was<00:03:03.019> a<00:03:03.049> very

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
Darby was at Wembley on what was a very

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.490 
Darby was at Wembley on what was a very
hard<00:03:04.010> day<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.370> Darby<00:03:04.880> fans<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.900> take<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.410> the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500

club<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.920> take<00:03:07.360> but<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.420> guess<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.840> fact<00:03:09.019> that

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
club to take but I guess the fact that

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.250 
club to take but I guess the fact that
very<00:03:09.950> much<00:03:10.160> in<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.540> frontrunner<00:03:11.540> has<00:03:11.870> been<00:03:12.170> a

very much in the frontrunner has been a

demonstration that whatever happened at

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.920 
demonstration that whatever happened at
Wembley<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.410> day<00:03:15.650> has<00:03:16.130> been<00:03:16.519> put<00:03:16.790> behind<00:03:16.970> and

Wembley that day has been put behind and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.110 
Wembley that day has been put behind and
it's<00:03:18.110> carry<00:03:18.440> on<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.890> kick<00:03:19.160> off<00:03:19.370> well<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.030> know
