00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
episode pads made me think a lot about

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.769 
episode pads made me think a lot about
and<00:00:16.190> Teenage<00:00:17.190> Mutant<00:00:17.640> Ninja<00:00:17.670> Turtle<00:00:18.359> series

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle series

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.189 
and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle series
so<00:00:19.230> yeah<00:00:19.619> I'm<00:00:19.949> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.029> explain<00:00:21.449> who<00:00:21.930> i<00:00:21.960> think

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
so yeah I'm going to explain who i think

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.140 
so yeah I'm going to explain who i think
the<00:00:23.039> main<00:00:23.250> 6<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.350> after<00:00:25.350> turtles<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.949> also<00:00:26.789> why

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
the main 6 is after turtles and also why

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.029 
the main 6 is after turtles and also why
i<00:00:27.180> think<00:00:27.449> there<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> comparison<00:00:28.800> between

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
i think there is a comparison between

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.810 
i think there is a comparison between
the<00:00:29.609> two<00:00:29.820> shows<00:00:30.119> yeah<00:00:31.040> so<00:00:32.040> first<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:32.759> we

two different characters I'm just saying
their<00:00:42.450> personality<00:00:43.410> looks<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.789> alike

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
party and the cupcakes and all that kind
of<00:01:00.420> stuff<00:01:00.480> say<00:01:01.170> yeah<00:01:01.530> that's<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.219> first

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
of stuff say yeah that's the first

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420 
of stuff say yeah that's the first
comparison<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:04.229> next<00:01:04.530> comparison<00:01:05.220> is

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
comparison the next comparison is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.630 
comparison the next comparison is
Raphael<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.450> Rainbow<00:01:07.080> Dash<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.400> both

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
Raphael to Rainbow Dash they are both

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.280 
Raphael to Rainbow Dash they are both
cool<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.290> crude<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.580> guessing<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.900> it's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
cool and crude so I'm guessing that it's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.219 
cool and crude so I'm guessing that it's
also<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.950> comparison<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> two<00:01:15.509> shows<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
also a comparison to the two shows and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
also a comparison to the two shows and
also<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:18.950> noticed<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.100> Rainbow<00:01:21.090> Dash

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
also I have noticed that Rainbow Dash

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.120 
also I have noticed that Rainbow Dash
and<00:01:21.600> Rafael<00:01:22.170> both<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.540> way<00:01:24.780> rebel<00:01:25.439> against

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and Rafael both in a way rebel against

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.230 
and Rafael both in a way rebel against
their<00:01:26.220> leader<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.970> shown<00:01:29.970> in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
their leader or it's not that shown in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.010 
their leader or it's not that shown in
MLP<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.650> i<00:01:32.009> guess<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> later<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.780> will<00:01:33.810> see

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
MLP but i guess it later on we will see

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.130 
MLP but i guess it later on we will see
who<00:01:34.770> wants<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.880> leader<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.509> Rainbow

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
who wants to be the leader if Rainbow

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.340 
who wants to be the leader if Rainbow
Dash<00:01:37.439> had<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.100> chance<00:01:38.369> I'll<00:01:38.840> bet<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.900> she

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
Dash had the chance I'll bet that she

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.520 
Dash had the chance I'll bet that she
wants<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> leader<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:43.229> next

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
wants to be the leader the next

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
wants to be the leader the next
comparison<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.000> will<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.390> agree<00:01:45.720> on

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
comparison I think you will not agree on

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.550 
comparison I think you will not agree on
its<00:01:46.290> Twilight<00:01:46.710> Sparkle<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.790> Donatello<00:01:48.600> yeah<00:01:49.530> I

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
its Twilight Sparkle to Donatello yeah I

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.649 
its Twilight Sparkle to Donatello yeah I
know<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.189> bit<00:01:50.220> weird<00:01:50.610> because<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.329> Mattel

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
know it's a bit weird because the Mattel

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.440 
know it's a bit weird because the Mattel
has<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:52.110> machines<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.979> stuff<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:54.000> i<00:01:54.060> think

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
has the machines and stuff but i think

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.109 
has the machines and stuff but i think
the<00:01:54.869> technobabble<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.920> Donatella<00:01:56.549> dose<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the technobabble that Donatella dose is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.940 
the technobabble that Donatella dose is
the<00:01:57.390> same<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.899> Twilight<00:01:58.590> dose<00:01:58.920> in

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the same as Twilight dose in

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.760 
the same as Twilight dose in
it's<00:02:00.070> it's<00:02:00.880> just<00:02:01.240> going<00:02:01.719> to<00:02:01.750> show<00:02:02.049> that<00:02:02.289> those

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
it's it's just going to show that those

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.249 
it's it's just going to show that those
two<00:02:03.130> have<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.670> lot<00:02:03.969> in<00:02:04.030> common<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.780> also<00:02:05.229> I

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
two have a lot in common and also I

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.150 
two have a lot in common and also I
think<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:06.039> technology<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:08.590> know<00:02:08.800> the

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
think that technology and you know the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.580 
think that technology and you know the
magic<00:02:10.030> has<00:02:10.300> something<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.959> do<00:02:11.140> with<00:02:11.440> each

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
magic has something to do with each

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.479 
magic has something to do with each
other<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.160> I'm<00:02:13.060> not<00:02:13.360> totally<00:02:13.840> sure<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:15.129> I

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
other and I'm not totally sure and I

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.320 
other and I'm not totally sure and I
could<00:02:15.970> be<00:02:16.150> wrong<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.930> whatever<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.400> also<00:02:19.000> she

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
could be wrong so whatever and also she

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.190 
could be wrong so whatever and also she
could<00:02:20.170> look<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:20.880> Leonardo<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.090> leader<00:02:22.360> so

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
could look like Leonardo the leader so

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.059 
could look like Leonardo the leader so
yeah<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.099> will<00:02:24.940> just<00:02:25.720> let<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.230> hang<00:02:26.470> there<00:02:26.500> you

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
yeah I will just let it hang there you

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.180 
yeah I will just let it hang there you
can<00:02:27.250> make<00:02:27.430> your<00:02:27.610> own<00:02:27.730> comparison<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
the terrors because he was thinking

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.670 
the terrors because he was thinking
about<00:02:51.310> how<00:02:51.579> he<00:02:51.640> should<00:02:52.150> be<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.390> leader<00:02:52.840> for<00:02:53.380> the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
about how he should be a leader for the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.819 
about how he should be a leader for the
others<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.340> take<00:02:55.060> responsibility<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829

others<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.299> why<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.569> think<00:02:59.140> he<00:02:59.349> looks

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
others so that is why I think he looks

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.660 
others so that is why I think he looks
like<00:02:59.890> ever<00:03:00.220> jack<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:01.000> lot<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:03.370> shy<00:03:03.640> part
