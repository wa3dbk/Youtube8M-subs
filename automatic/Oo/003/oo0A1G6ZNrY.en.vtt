incredibly overpowered incredibly just
ridiculously<00:03:01.420> overpowered<00:03:02.700> then<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.880> have

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
ridiculously overpowered then you have

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
with each other as well so you have all

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.949 
with each other as well so you have all
these<00:03:09.100> balance<00:03:09.760> issues<00:03:10.090> all<00:03:10.300> over<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.750> place

these balance issues all over the place

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.320 
these balance issues all over the place
and<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:12.370> fact<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.880> can<00:03:13.060> roll<00:03:13.300> around

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
and the fact that you can roll around

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.199 
and the fact that you can roll around
doesn't<00:03:14.230> help<00:03:14.350> either<00:03:14.549> by<00:03:15.549> pressing<00:03:15.790> by<00:03:16.150> the

doesn't help either by pressing by the

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.729 
doesn't help either by pressing by the
press<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> shift<00:03:16.989> key<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.290> can<00:03:17.320> roll

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
press of the shift key you can roll

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.140 
press of the shift key you can roll
around<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:18.630> basically<00:03:20.370> bunnyhop<00:03:21.370> except<00:03:22.030> on

the ground and that's basically what

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.910 
the ground and that's basically what

them<00:03:30.610> in<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.730> back<00:03:31.019> that's<00:03:32.019> basically<00:03:32.320> how<00:03:32.410> it

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
them in the back that's basically how it

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.880 
them in the back that's basically how it
works<00:03:35.640> everyone<00:03:36.640> sprays<00:03:36.970> hear<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:38.290> guns<00:03:38.620> have

an incredibly inaccurate credibly
ridiculous<00:03:42.750> accuracy<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:44.260> they<00:03:44.410> they're

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
ridiculous accuracy it that they they're

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.039 
ridiculous accuracy it that they they're
just<00:03:45.010> retarded<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.850> rate<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.120> recoil<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:46.930> the

just retarded the rate of recoil in the

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.789 
just retarded the rate of recoil in the
accuracy<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.620> ridiculous<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:49.799> even

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
accuracy is just ridiculous and even

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.330 
accuracy is just ridiculous and even

possible<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.299> run<00:03:55.540> up<00:03:55.630> some<00:03:55.840> spray<00:03:56.320> in

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
possible to just run up some spray in

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.890 
possible to just run up some spray in
their<00:03:56.560> face<00:03:58.890> but<00:04:00.060> there's<00:04:01.060> also<00:04:01.329> a<00:04:01.510> balance
