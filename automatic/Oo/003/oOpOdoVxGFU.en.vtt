00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.299
 well this morning I was cooking with 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.370
 a quick pot and it occurred to me that 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.599
 I could make a video explaining what is 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.590
 the operating principle of a 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.900
 pot fast and good today let's see 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.300
 we have to understand some concepts 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.580
 basic we're going to see at sea level 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 we have an air column over 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.279
 our weighing that air weighs 760 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.560
 millimeters of mercury or height to 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.300
 that we are that air that is a weight 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.220
 is pressing us about is not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.320
 pressing on us and if we put 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.380
 water to boil is pressing on the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.750
 Water 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.540
 and the water at sea level and it was 100 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.210
 degrees as we all know it's worth but it's 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.250
 that if we come to a mountain we have 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.260
 less air column above ours to 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.740
 have less air column we are at 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.770
 less price therefore that column of 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.510
 air weighs less and water needs less 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.699
 energy to become steam and escape 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.500
 this is equal to 12,000 meters a 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.659
 Atmospheric pressure of 150 mm 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.930
 mercury as we go down the 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.330
 pressure is greater well here we can see 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.790
 in this table as altitude of the level of 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.100
 sea atmospheric pressure is 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.700
 one hundred one kilo pascal is 100 degrees 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.320
 centigrade to boil the water the water 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.320
 boil zinc and as we go 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.950
 rising the water boils more unless 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.310
 temperature at one thousand meters and the 96 at the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.750
 500 and 95 to 2,096 up to 4000 and he sees 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.750
 86 degrees centigrade 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.830
 here in this graph we have in pa co 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.310
 inc 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.320
 and in degrees centigrade well customized 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.869
 that increases the pressure we see clearly 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.430
 how the pressure increases to which the water 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:57.860
 boil at 52 psi the water boils at 149 gr 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.729
 2 232 204 to 666 lose 200 mushrooms then 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.250
 this is the principle of operation 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.140
 from a fast pot the quick aie what 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.780
 will try to get is to increase 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.840
 the water pressure of the atmosphere that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.340
 exists inside the pot and then the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.410
 water boils at least always more 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.670
 temperature boil over temperature to 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.050
 boil at sea ​​temperature in the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.090
 Food is cooked faster 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.470
 it is simply that that is 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.840
 simply what a pot does 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.519
 fast well in this graph we see 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.420
 clearly how as the 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.100
 pressure 700 760 xa 800 measure comments the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.980
 pressure increases the temperature that arrives 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.120
 the water and in this graph we see even more 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.209
 as if we increase the pressure to 1,500 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.280
 millimeters of mercury the water boils 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.080
 120 degrees and this is the goal of 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.260
 our fast pot our fast 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.390
 that the water is up here to this the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.040
 atmosphere is at this pressure so 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.440
 both the water to boil to 120 and the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.850
 food will be made faster 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.180
 well what are the elements of a 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.939
 fast pot 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.670
 then the body of the pot the lid 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.709
 metric the seal that will seal with the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.150
 pressure on us not miss anything and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.829
 the regulating valve this element is 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.900
 fundamental because when we 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.160
 we started to fire the pot and 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.080
 that starts to rise 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.850
 the molecules are going to start improving 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.800
 unable to escape, the pressure increases 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.900
 from the pot and that can burst 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.970
 then we will have a valve 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.860
 tared with a spring for a 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.290
 certain pressure the valve open and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.840
 let the steam release that what is it 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.520
 that we hear when the steam comes out and 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.750
 then it will keep us constant 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.780
 pressure inside the pot 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.280
 therefore we get the water to 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.250
 keep to the pressure that we 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.440
 we want and it does not evaporate therefore it 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.740
 so the temperature is that 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.010
 temperature and the food are cooked 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.080
 before 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.450
 here we see it maybe it's the valve 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.390
 regulation when when we passed the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.950
 internal pressure that is standing the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.510
 valve opens and lets steam escape 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.330
 well this is neither more nor less than what 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.240
 that explained 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.250
 this is the same 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.230
 and the food is cooked because the water 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.740
 can not evaporate because it is subject to 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.620
 Pressure 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.310
 ready and that's all that's all so 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.780
 simple as that the one that knew it then 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.880
 you do not need to see the video and the one that does not 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.620
 know it, he already knows it, so nothing else 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.620
 greetings and until the next video
