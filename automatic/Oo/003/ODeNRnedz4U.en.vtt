00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.319
 work at 70 meters altitude so far 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.450
 wear the rails and steel beams of 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.490
 get to know the skies over ostholstein 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.559
 every bolt on the rails of the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.070
 second largest roller coaster in Europe 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.190
 sit 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.560
 each of the 120 steel beams stand perfectly 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.289
 every screw properly tightened and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.340
 be sealed to see that the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.359
 wall thickness also with the planning 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.739
 to match 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:37.079
 here are 8 mm the new roller coaster 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.879
 be certified in hansa-park needs 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.590
 tüv checked without the okay 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.980
 Experts from Munich will be here 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.960
 no train with guests driving up to 127 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.239
 kilometers per hour need not only the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.250
 Ironing had to seem to go soft 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.289
 the centrifugal force of 16 seated reins 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.329
 was someone who checks a nuclear power plant 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.620
 and there the state structure in it has the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.210
 Ultimately, it's the same as we're doing here 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.829
 the only difference to the others 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 is likely of the operation of this 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.650
 systems and the safety functions 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.439
 which are still installed and will 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.439
 in the interior of the 79 meter high fortress 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.130
 thomes tested well felix then we are 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.080
 as soon start conditions we okay 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.150
 plant is free then we leave it in 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.770
 so-called station start the scarce 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.729
 two tons of heavy tracks and come 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.710
 again 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.140
 Here monitor employees of the park 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.790
 after releasing the new co-star still 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.470
 However, the men test the tüv 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.390
 every movement of the roller coaster 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.090
 speed and pressure keep the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.010
 trains on and in Munich more than 100 times 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.750
 you already have the core suits 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.020
 over a kilometer long track 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.020
 cleverly 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.020
 one sees there are the magnets in the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.410
 cheers storm principle and now become two 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.700
 Brakes and can be held safely 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.470
 not anymore by one 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.600
 misc operation or other starting 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.790
 automatic operation we have a 3 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.670
 Zugbetrieb that means there are 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.960
 Three vehicles on the track on the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.209
 total distance in the fall on the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.679
 really only one thing out there 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.480
 the blog system is fixed here 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.310
 there will always be two vehicles in the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.310
 Train Station are 1 on the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.350
 stretch until at least Monday 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.270
 check the men of the type sees when 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.220
 next week everything runs perfectly 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.430
 Fine adjustment of the technology with pinpoint accuracy 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.320
 right , the experts give her 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.500
 then you will be the first test drive 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.500
 do
