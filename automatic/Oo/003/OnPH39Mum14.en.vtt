00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Well, we decided to intern my dad because 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.849
 between the expenses of the house and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.969
 kids because I really was not going to be able to 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.030
 take care of him came a moment in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.640
 they told me in the hospital that my 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.280
 Dad was not in a position to take 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.610
 no call so 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.680
 I worry and I decided to visit it 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:31.460
 there was another person was totally 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.710
 changed they had lost a lot of weight and 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 muttering things that even I do not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.350
 understood what I saw really scared me 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.290
 because it was worse than when I had 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.190
 seen the last time when you try to 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.450
 touch him 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.870
 he turned sharply and 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:59.100
 and he grabbed me by the shoulders but 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.000
 that look froze me horrible and threw 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 a frightening scream that scared me one of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.520
 The nurses told me that when I went to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.460
 keep an eye on him at night like 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.580
 spoke to someone but it obviously 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.630
 there was no one who apparently my dad 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.479
 he saw things under his bed and that according to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.370
 this was someone there advising what 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.760
 what they said 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:35.440
 then obviously the treatment 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:40.120
 it did not work at all 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:45.000
 and well they found my dad without 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.000
 life in your bedroom and what 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.510
 I do not understand what happened or why 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.830
 what did that decision really do not 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.180
 he was in his 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.890
 in his senses when he did it 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.630
 and well that's how this ended 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.630
 we never knew what happened to him
