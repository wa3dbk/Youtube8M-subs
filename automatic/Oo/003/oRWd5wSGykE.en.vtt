00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.990
 hello and welcome to avis access 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.490
 we will introduce you to the helicopter 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.029
 on which you will do your flight 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.450
 initiation 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.680
 this helicopter is a robinson r44 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.680
 equipped with a piston engine developing 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.029
 about 250 horses 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.220
 this apparatus consists of a rotor 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.079
 principal which itself consists of 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.710
 two bullets and a tail rotor 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.149
 also called anti-couple twists I 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.430
 now offers you to discover the 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.760
 commands that drive this 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.760
 helicopter 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.379
 the helicopter has three controls on 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.010
 No general acting on the orders 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:54.469
 of the main rotor when I pull on the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.569
 helicopter general page goes up when 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:02.870
 I lower the general pace the helicopter 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:04.760
 goes down the rudder act on the 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.950
 anti torque rotor and varied fauna 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.900
 the inclination of the blades which has for 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.260
 effect of rotating the helicopter on 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.260
 himself 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.979
 I press the left rudder 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.979
 helicopter rotates left 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.100
 I press on the right rudder 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.100
 the helicopter swivels on the right 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.450
 the cyclic lever acts on 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.800
 the inclination of rotor discs I put 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.090
 the cyclic before the helicopter 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:44.310
 ahead I put cyclic back 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.350
 the helicopter from behind I put some 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.960
 site on the right 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.340
 the helicopter goes right I'm going from 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.410
 cyclic left 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.460
 the helicopter departs left flight for 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.770
 maintain the helicopter in a straight line 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.600
 at a constant altitude it is 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 needed to have two landmarks one 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.440
 internal landmark 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.440
 the amount of plexiglass and a benchmark 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.019
 outside the horizon he'll have to 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.540
 maintain their crossing at the same level 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.480
 and try to keep the angle they 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.090
 make constant keeping 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.280
 its perpendicular landmarks is going us 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.670
 allow to fly at a constant heading to 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.470
 a constant attitude attention the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.600
 movements must be very very hungry 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.519
 and 2 very low amplitude 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.209
 we can associate these movements with 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.220
 keeping a marble on a plate 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.760
 safety instructions for access to 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.250
 tarmac 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.060
 you must always be accompanied by 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.060
 an authorized person 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.220
 it is strictly forbidden to smoke in 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.370
 proximity to helicopters access to a 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.040
 helicopter is always done from the front 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.680
 slightly lower attention never 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.989
 run raise your arms and approach 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.450
 the helicopter from the back 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.640
 any object likely to fly away from 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.950
 type escapes or caps 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.819
 is strictly prohibited around the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.440
 helicopters once installed in 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.269
 the helicopter 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.660
 fasten your belt this way 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.640

 ground staff 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.269
 now that co-ops land no longer 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.580
 no secret for you any team 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.819
 of opinion access wishes you an excellent 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.819
