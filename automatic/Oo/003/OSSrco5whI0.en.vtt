00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
meat we didn't everything that we would

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.740

tree versus one bot lane against us we

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.819 
tree versus one bot lane against us we
could<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.820> deafened<00:01:27.479> fish<00:01:27.750> turret<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.560> I

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
me why you think he's so good at the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.670 
me why you think he's so good at the
moment<00:02:01.079> they<00:02:02.040> puffed<00:02:02.460> his<00:02:02.930> ultimate<00:02:03.930> now<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
moment they puffed his ultimate now it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.880

reduce<00:02:05.070> damage<00:02:05.310> by<00:02:05.700> fifty<00:02:06.210> percent<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.960> when

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
reduce damage by fifty percent on when

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.249 
reduce damage by fifty percent on when
you<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.360> has<00:02:09.629> three<00:02:09.959> stacks

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
you have of it and it has three stacks

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.940 
you have of it and it has three stacks
so<00:02:10.649> he<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.039> very<00:02:11.430> true

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
so he is very true

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.229 
so he is very true
wrong<00:02:12.069> when<00:02:12.900> verses<00:02:13.900> 1<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.349> in<00:02:15.010> two<00:02:15.910> versus

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
wrong when verses 1 and in two versus

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.110 
wrong when verses 1 and in two versus
two<00:02:16.269> as<00:02:16.450> well<00:02:16.629> so<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:17.530> kinda<00:02:18.519> want<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.790> pick

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
two as well so you kinda want to pick

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.540 
two as well so you kinda want to pick
him<00:02:19.360> because<00:02:19.840> one<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.440> best<00:02:21.099> junglers

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
him because one of the best junglers

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.830 
him because one of the best junglers
right<00:02:21.790> now<00:02:22.800> yeah<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:24.040> think<00:02:24.730> that's<00:02:25.209> why<00:02:25.450> he's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
right now yeah I think that's why he's

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.839 
right now yeah I think that's why he's
drunk<00:02:26.170> what<00:02:26.769> about<00:02:26.860> Elise<00:02:27.190> them<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
drunk what about Elise them in the

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.130 
drunk what about Elise them in the
patchy<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.239> remember<00:02:28.540> actually<00:02:28.630> talking<00:02:28.989> with

your<00:02:29.440> body<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.769> said<00:02:29.950> yeah<00:02:30.160> she's<00:02:30.459> still<00:02:30.640> okay

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
your body you said yeah she's still okay

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.790 
your body you said yeah she's still okay
I'm<00:02:31.569> not<00:02:31.690> hundred<00:02:31.989> percent<00:02:32.170> sure<00:02:32.200> what<00:02:32.650> do<00:02:32.709> you

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
I'm not hundred percent sure what do you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.050 
I'm not hundred percent sure what do you
think<00:02:32.920> about<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.160> least<00:02:33.340> now<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.580> seen<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> few

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
think about the least now you seen a few

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.100 
think about the least now you seen a few
games<00:02:34.239> with<00:02:34.540> her<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:35.970> seen<00:02:36.970> her<00:02:37.180> analysis<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.019> I

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
games with her I seen her analysis and I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.900 
games with her I seen her analysis and I
played<00:02:38.349> her<00:02:38.560> more<00:02:38.799> in<00:02:38.950> solo<00:02:39.220> kiani<00:02:39.549> schemes

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
played her more in solo kiani schemes

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.330 
played her more in solo kiani schemes
and<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.810> think<00:02:41.080> she's<00:02:41.319> still<00:02:41.530> pretty<00:02:41.860> broken

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
and I think she's still pretty broken

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.729 
and I think she's still pretty broken
because<00:02:42.910> her<00:02:43.120> damage<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.660> still<00:02:43.870> high<00:02:44.080> her

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
because her damage is still high her

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.300 
because her damage is still high her
stone<00:02:45.099> early<00:02:45.430> levels<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.660> bit<00:02:47.410> weaker

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
stone early levels is a bit weaker

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.660 
stone early levels is a bit weaker
because<00:02:48.549> it's<00:02:48.880> only<00:02:49.120> one<00:02:49.239> second<00:02:49.690> now<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:51.370> her

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
because it's only one second now but her

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.400 
because it's only one second now but her
damage<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.209> champions<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.870> still<00:02:53.170> pretty

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
damage to champions is still pretty

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.270 
damage to champions is still pretty
strong<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.459> he'll<00:02:55.000> jungle<00:02:55.420> curry<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:56.280> weaker

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
strong and he'll jungle curry is weaker

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.240 
strong and he'll jungle curry is weaker
