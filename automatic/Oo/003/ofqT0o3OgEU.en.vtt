pull<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:36.380> through<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.189> first<00:01:38.340> loop<00:01:38.900> so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
pull one through just the first loop so

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.319 
pull one through just the first loop so
it<00:01:40.020> looks<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:41.000> you're<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> take

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
it looks like this you're going to take

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.840 
it looks like this you're going to take
your<00:01:42.479> next<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:44.159> put<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.579> hook<00:01:44.729> we're

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
your next one and put on your hook we're

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.130 
your next one and put on your hook we're
going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> pull<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.720> middle<00:01:46.049> one

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
going to pull just this middle one

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.440 
going to pull just this middle one
through<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> pull<00:01:47.880> through<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
through so I'm going to pull through the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.520 
through so I'm going to pull through the
first<00:01:48.479> two<00:01:48.840> loops<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.850> lift<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:52.170> first

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
first two loops and then lift this first

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.249 
first two loops and then lift this first
one<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:54.110> slide<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> down<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.829> then

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
one here slide it down and then

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.649 
one here slide it down and then
reorganize<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> band's<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.390> also<00:02:00.390> pull<00:02:00.570> on

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
reorganize the band's I also pull on

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.840 
reorganize the band's I also pull on
this<00:02:00.780> cap<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.610> then<00:02:02.610> I'm<00:02:02.729> going

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.050 
pull it through the second and the third
loops<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:16.900> these<00:02:17.049> two<00:02:17.290> Center<00:02:17.680> loops<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> I'm

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
loops so these two Center loops so I'm

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.460 
loops so these two Center loops so I'm
going<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.239> pull<00:02:19.390> through<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.750> first<00:02:19.780> three

I'm going to go ahead and pull through
the<00:02:34.150> first<00:02:34.180> two<00:02:34.569> loops<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.910> can<00:02:37.090> reattach

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
the first two loops and I can reattach

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.869 
the first two loops and I can reattach
and<00:02:38.319> then<00:02:38.500> get<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.860> more<00:02:39.129> of<00:02:39.280> your<00:02:39.310> Jolly<00:02:39.640> Green

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
to take off this first loop and hold on

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.240 
to take off this first loop and hold on
to<00:02:45.579> it<00:02:46.079> and<00:02:47.079> you're<00:02:47.230> going<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.470> put<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.739> cap<00:02:47.980> band

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
to it and you're going to put a cap band

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.069 
to it and you're going to put a cap band
with<00:02:48.879> your<00:02:49.030> green<00:02:49.239> bands<00:02:49.599> on<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.769> hook<00:02:50.799> and

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
with your green bands on the hook and

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.740 
with your green bands on the hook and
reattach<00:02:53.609> this<00:02:54.609> white<00:02:54.910> band<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.359> now<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:55.629> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
reattach this white band so now if the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.110 
reattach this white band so now if the
cap<00:02:55.930> in<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.260> in<00:02:56.410> between<00:02:56.530> there<00:02:57.030> then<00:02:58.030> what

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
cap in is in between there then what

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.670 
cap in is in between there then what
you're<00:02:58.269> going<00:02:58.359> to<00:02:58.420> do<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.690> grab<00:02:58.930> both<00:02:59.140> loops<00:02:59.500> of

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
you're going to do is grab both loops of

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.750 
you're going to do is grab both loops of
the<00:02:59.709> cap<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.220> pull<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.060> over<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.359> hook<00:03:01.690> just

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the cap and pull it over the hook just

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.610 
the cap and pull it over the hook just
like<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.569> now<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.840> will<00:03:04.900> be<00:03:05.079> also

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
like that so now it will be also

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.640 
like that so now it will be also
attached<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.609> white<00:03:07.150> band<00:03:07.470> take<00:03:08.470> your

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
attached to this white band take your

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.580 
attached to this white band take your
last<00:03:08.859> green<00:03:09.220> band<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.930> you're<00:03:11.260> going<00:03:11.379> to<00:03:11.440> pull

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
last green band and you're going to pull

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.610 
last green band and you're going to pull
it<00:03:11.709> through<00:03:11.739> all<00:03:12.220> four<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:14.109> loops<00:03:14.349> there

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
it through all four of the loops there

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.300 
it through all four of the loops there
on<00:03:14.799> your<00:03:14.950> hook<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.400> then<00:03:16.389> reattach<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:18.160> this

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
on your hook and then reattach so this

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.250 
on your hook and then reattach so this
is<00:03:18.489> just<00:03:18.730> for<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.060> first<00:03:19.329> petal<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.900> second

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
is just for the first petal the second

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.390 
is just for the first petal the second
one<00:03:20.380> is<00:03:20.500> going<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.799> be<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:20.980> little<00:03:21.280> bit

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
one is going to be a little bit

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400 
one is going to be a little bit
different<00:03:21.639> I'm<00:03:22.299> just<00:03:22.569> because<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:23.109> the<00:03:23.230> cap

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
different I'm just because of the cap

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.879 
different I'm just because of the cap
and<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.910> first<00:03:25.120> one<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:25.450> different<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:26.019> if<00:03:26.290> you

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
and the first one is different so if you

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.559 
and the first one is different so if you
want<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.280> can<00:03:27.430> transfer<00:03:28.000> this<00:03:28.120> onto<00:03:28.299> another

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
want you can transfer this onto another

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.180 
want you can transfer this onto another
hook<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.049> since<00:03:29.260> it's<00:03:29.410> only<00:03:29.620> two<00:03:29.799> loops<00:03:30.010> I'm

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
hook but since it's only two loops I'm

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.190 
hook but since it's only two loops I'm
just<00:03:30.340> going<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.549> take<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:30.730> off<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.239> then<00:03:31.299> turn

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
just going to take it off and then turn

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.879 
just going to take it off and then turn
it<00:03:32.349> around

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
it around

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.420 
it around
just<00:03:33.669> like<00:03:33.819> this<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:36.190> what<00:03:36.310> you're

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
just like this and then what you're

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.690 
just like this and then what you're
going<00:03:36.639> to<00:03:36.700> do<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:37.209> take<00:03:37.480> six<00:03:37.900> more<00:03:38.489> these<00:03:39.489> white

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
going to do is take six more these white

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.530 
going to do is take six more these white
bands<00:03:40.739> okay<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.120> first<00:03:43.329> thing<00:03:43.510> that

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
bands okay and the first thing that

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.009 
bands okay and the first thing that
you're<00:03:43.720> going<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.079> do<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.849> pull<00:03:45.849> your<00:03:46.150> white

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
you're going to do is pull your white

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:53.370 
you're going to do is pull your white
band<00:03:47.290> through<00:03:48.010> just<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.609> first<00:03:48.790> loop<00:03:49.000> here<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
band through just the first loop here to

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.580 
band through just the first loop here to
pull<00:03:53.620> through<00:03:53.799> just<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:54.129> first<00:03:54.280> loop<00:03:54.459> and

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
pull through just the first loop and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.509 
pull through just the first loop and
then<00:03:56.590> what<00:03:56.680> you're<00:03:56.829> going<00:03:56.919> to<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.220> is<00:03:57.310> take

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
then what you're going to do is take

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.000 
then what you're going to do is take
your<00:03:57.639> next<00:03:57.879> band<00:03:58.650> you're<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.799> to<00:03:59.859> pull<00:03:59.980> it

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
your next band you're going to pull it

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.809 
your next band you're going to pull it
through<00:04:00.099> just<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.579> first<00:04:00.879> white<00:04:01.120> loop<00:04:02.819> and

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
through just this first white loop and

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.509 
through just this first white loop and
then<00:04:04.030> reattach<00:04:04.239> in<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:06.069> trick<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.340> I

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
then reattach in the trick that I

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.220 
then reattach in the trick that I
noticed<00:04:07.000> when<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.209> was<00:04:07.419> making<00:04:07.780> this<00:04:07.930> bracelet

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
noticed when I was making this bracelet

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.920 
noticed when I was making this bracelet
here<00:04:08.949> I<00:04:09.180> noticed<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.449> we<00:04:11.169> are<00:04:11.349> looping<00:04:12.930> like

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
here I noticed that we are looping like

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.710 
here I noticed that we are looping like
the<00:04:14.109> middle<00:04:14.410> band<00:04:14.620> if<00:04:14.919> these<00:04:15.220> two<00:04:15.699> first<00:04:16.389> loops

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
the middle band if these two first loops

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.240 
the middle band if these two first loops
are<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.049> same<00:04:17.260> band<00:04:17.620> then<00:04:17.919> we're<00:04:18.070> going<00:04:18.190> to

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
are the same band then we're going to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.849 
are the same band then we're going to
take<00:04:18.430> this<00:04:18.609> middle<00:04:18.820> one<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:20.109> with<00:04:20.500> our<00:04:20.650> third

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
take this middle one so with our third

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.250 
take this middle one so with our third
band<00:04:21.099> we're<00:04:21.459> going<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.609> take<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.909> Center<00:04:22.210> one

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
band we're going to take to Center one

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.730 
band we're going to take to Center one
and<00:04:24.740> then<00:04:24.920> put<00:04:25.130> this<00:04:25.250> back<00:04:25.460> on<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:27.560> also

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
and then put this back on and I also

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.800 
and then put this back on and I also
noticed<00:04:28.130> when<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.640> two<00:04:28.850> Center<00:04:29.330> bands<00:04:29.540> are

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
noticed when the two Center bands are

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.930 
noticed when the two Center bands are
the<00:04:29.960> two<00:04:30.620> Center<00:04:30.920> loops<00:04:31.160> are<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.430> same<00:04:31.640> band

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
the two Center loops are the same band

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.360 
the two Center loops are the same band
we're<00:04:32.120> going<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.270> grab<00:04:32.450> the<00:04:32.600> first<00:04:32.780> two<00:04:33.370> so

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
we're going to grab the first two so

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.160 
we're going to grab the first two so
take<00:04:34.580> another<00:04:34.700> white<00:04:35.000> band<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.810> pull<00:04:36.020> through

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170

the first two and reattach and now these
first<00:04:39.920> two<00:04:40.130> loops<00:04:40.310> are<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.640> same<00:04:40.880> so<00:04:41.270> we're

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
first two loops are the same so we're

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.070 
first two loops are the same so we're
going<00:04:41.480> to<00:04:41.540> grab<00:04:41.780> these<00:04:41.960> two<00:04:42.170> middle<00:04:42.380> loops

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
going to grab these two middle loops

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.670 
going to grab these two middle loops
pull<00:04:45.080> through<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.770> first<00:04:46.010> three<00:04:46.610> bands<00:04:47.680> then

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
pull through the first three bands then

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
last band we're gonna grab through these

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.960 
last band we're gonna grab through these
first<00:04:57.140> two<00:04:57.410> loops<00:04:57.590> because<00:04:58.040> he<00:04:58.250> is<00:04:58.370> Center<00:04:58.790> two

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
first two loops because he is Center two

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.130 
first two loops because he is Center two
are<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.300> same<00:04:59.510> band<00:05:01.870> pull<00:05:02.870> through<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.110> first

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
are the same band pull through the first

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.620 
are the same band pull through the first
two<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:04.370> before<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.760> reattached<00:05:05.090> I'm<00:05:05.450> just

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
two and before I reattached I'm just

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.660 
two and before I reattached I'm just
going<00:05:05.810> to<00:05:05.870> hold<00:05:06.140> this<00:05:06.290> with<00:05:06.500> my<00:05:06.680> hands<00:05:07.160> I'm

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
going to hold this with my hands I'm

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
and then I'm going to reattach it and

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.640 
and then I'm going to reattach it and
then<00:05:13.840> remember<00:05:14.840> you're<00:05:14.960> gonna<00:05:15.050> pull<00:05:15.410> both

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
then remember you're gonna pull both

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.550 
then remember you're gonna pull both
loops<00:05:15.920> over<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:20.110> then<00:05:21.110> you're<00:05:21.200> going<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:21.380> take

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
loops over and then you're going to take

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.970 
loops over and then you're going to take
your<00:05:21.740> next<00:05:21.920> band<00:05:23.260> you're<00:05:24.260> gonna<00:05:24.380> pull<00:05:24.680> through

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
your next band you're gonna pull through

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.220 
your next band you're gonna pull through
all<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.610> loops<00:05:25.940> on<00:05:26.450> your<00:05:26.480> hook<00:05:26.660> it<00:05:26.960> should<00:05:27.140> be

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
all the loops on your hook it should be

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.960 
all the loops on your hook it should be
five<00:05:27.470> loops<00:05:27.740> this<00:05:28.010> time<00:05:28.280> because<00:05:28.640> we<00:05:28.820> have

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
five loops this time because we have

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.540 
five loops this time because we have
that<00:05:29.150> extra<00:05:29.450> green<00:05:29.720> one<00:05:30.400> you're<00:05:31.400> going<00:05:31.490> to

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
that extra green one you're going to

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.250 
that extra green one you're going to
reattach<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:32.540> this<00:05:32.660> is<00:05:32.810> what<00:05:32.960> it's<00:05:33.080> going<00:05:33.200> to

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
reattach and this is what it's going to

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.440 
reattach and this is what it's going to
look<00:05:33.320> like<00:05:34.000> you're<00:05:35.000> going<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.180> turn<00:05:35.300> this

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
look like you're going to turn this

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.330 
look like you're going to turn this
around<00:05:35.510> again<00:05:38.170> and<00:05:39.170> I'll<00:05:39.620> show<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.860> how<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.160> do

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
around again and I'll show you how to do

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.890 
around again and I'll show you how to do
this<00:05:40.490> quickly<00:05:40.820> one<00:05:41.090> more<00:05:41.120> time<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:41.750> then<00:05:41.870> I

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
this quickly one more time and then I

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.560 
this quickly one more time and then I
will<00:05:42.260> show<00:05:42.410> you<00:05:42.470> how<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.740> finish<00:05:43.040> this<00:05:43.370> off<00:05:43.640> so
