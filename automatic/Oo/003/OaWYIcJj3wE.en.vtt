of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.430> next<00:00:26.640> generation<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.330> let's<00:00:28.170> start

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
of the next generation and let's start

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.470 
of the next generation and let's start
here<00:00:28.619> he's<00:00:29.220> imagining<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.060> 5-inch<00:00:30.090> display

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
here he's imagining a 5-inch display

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.440 
here he's imagining a 5-inch display
within<00:00:31.050> her<00:00:31.289> full<00:00:31.560> HD<00:00:31.980> s<00:00:32.040> lair<00:00:32.309> 2k<00:00:32.880> display<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
within her full HD s lair 2k display I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
within her full HD s lair 2k display I
really<00:00:33.870> hope<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.469> least<00:00:34.620> 2k<00:00:34.890> because

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
really hope this at least 2k because

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.510 
really hope this at least 2k because
which<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.630> resolution<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.290> 2560<00:00:37.770> x<00:00:37.950> 1440

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
which is like resolution of 2560 x 1440

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.910 
which is like resolution of 2560 x 1440
because<00:00:39.180> that's<00:00:39.420> what<00:00:39.540> most<00:00:40.170> actually<00:00:40.680> smart

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
because that's what most actually smart

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.819 
because that's what most actually smart

stepping<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> game<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
stepping up the game you can see the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.970 
stepping up the game you can see the
massive<00:00:48.239> massive<00:00:48.870> massive<00:00:49.260> speaker<00:00:49.800> down

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
massive massive massive speaker down

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.560 
massive massive massive speaker down
here<00:00:50.219> at<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> bottom<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.879> also<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> top

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
here at the bottom and also the top

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.900 
here at the bottom and also the top
seems<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> made<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:53.250> bigger<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
seems like this made a way bigger and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.380 
seems like this made a way bigger and
then<00:00:54.510> he<00:00:54.780> also<00:00:54.930> ditched<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.390> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
then he also ditched here the the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.319 
then he also ditched here the the
capacitive<00:00:58.230> touch<00:00:58.559> buttons<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.120> get

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
capacitive touch buttons so you just get

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
capacitive touch buttons so you just get
a<00:01:00.359> moving<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> on-screen<00:01:01.649> buttons

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
a moving in on the on-screen buttons

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
a moving in on the on-screen buttons
which<00:01:02.850> definitely<00:01:03.270> exotic<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.930> also<00:01:04.140> looks

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
which definitely exotic it also looks

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.920 
which definitely exotic it also looks
thinner<00:01:04.850> overall<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.600> something<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
thinner overall which is something that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.830 
thinner overall which is something that
I<00:01:07.080> definitely<00:01:07.350> definitely<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.490> enjoy<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.119> we

I definitely definitely do enjoy here we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
I definitely definitely do enjoy here we
also<00:01:09.990> some<00:01:10.229> other<00:01:10.350> pictures<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.400> see

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
also some other pictures here if you see

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240 
also some other pictures here if you see
the<00:01:11.909> camera<00:01:12.540> diocese<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.470> focusing<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.040> on

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the camera diocese to be focusing now on

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.010 
the camera diocese to be focusing now on
in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> middle<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.210> don't<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.689> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
in the middle and I don't think that it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
in the middle and I don't think that it
was<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> before<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:17.220> course<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.580> would

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
was like that before of course it would

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
was like that before of course it would
come<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.060> an<00:01:18.180> affordable<00:01:18.689> KitKat<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> sense

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
come with an affordable KitKat a sense

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.010 
come with an affordable KitKat a sense
it's<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.100> 6<00:01:20.369> foot<00:01:20.490> though<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:21.750> also

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it's like 6 foot though and then also

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's like 6 foot though and then also
pretty<00:01:22.259> interesting<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.920> eat<00:01:23.180> eat

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
pretty interesting here to eat eat

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.160 
pretty interesting here to eat eat
ultrapixel<00:01:24.930> camera<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.799> we've<00:01:26.400> been<00:01:26.549> having<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
ultrapixel camera so we've been having a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.010 
ultrapixel camera so we've been having a
4-megapixel<00:01:28.170> ultrapixel<00:01:28.979> camera<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
4-megapixel ultrapixel camera and that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200 
4-megapixel ultrapixel camera and that
one<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.320> HTC<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:31.950> definitely<00:01:32.640> boring

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
one on HTC one was definitely boring

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.190 
one on HTC one was definitely boring
because<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.890> much<00:01:35.430> low<00:01:35.850> resolution<00:01:36.659> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
because it was so much low resolution is

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.890 
because it was so much low resolution is
it<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:37.799> horrible<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.750> on

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it was horrible and you can see here on

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
it was horrible and you can see here on
the<00:01:40.020> back<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.650> also<00:01:40.890> find<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the back that you can also find a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.450 
the back that you can also find a
fingerprint<00:01:42.600> reader<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.860> back<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
fingerprint reader the only back and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.999 
fingerprint reader the only back and
then<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.570> mean<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.990> might<00:01:46.140> order<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
then I mean you might order that this

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.810 
then I mean you might order that this
looks<00:01:47.310> oddly<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:48.119> hell<00:01:49.159> but<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.430> mean<00:01:50.579> remember

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
looks oddly as hell but I mean remember

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.999 
looks oddly as hell but I mean remember
this<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.229> sketch<00:01:52.649> here

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
this is like more like a sketch here

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.429 
this is like more like a sketch here
probably<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.939> used<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:55.079> pretty<00:01:55.350> sure

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
probably of it used and I'm pretty sure

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.139 
probably of it used and I'm pretty sure
if<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> would<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.280> cool<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.790> had<00:01:57.000> like

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
if it would be that cool if it had like

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.499 
if it would be that cool if it had like
a<00:01:57.210> different<00:01:57.600> color<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.060> is

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a different color but I think that is

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.690 
a different color but I think that is
this<00:02:00.780> concept<00:02:01.170> case<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.159> point<00:02:02.399> out

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this concept case is one to point out

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.929 
this concept case is one to point out
and<00:02:03.000> maybe<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:04.020> sketch<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:05.520> there

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and maybe that is like sketch that there

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.340 
and maybe that is like sketch that there
would<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.450> probably<00:02:06.810> fingerprint

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
would be like probably fingerprint

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.559 
would be like probably fingerprint
reader<00:02:07.619> there<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.239> see<00:02:09.390> like

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
reader there and then you can see like

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.600 
reader there and then you can see like
to<00:02:09.810> next

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
to next

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.180 
to next
camera<00:02:11.030> there<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.960> can<00:02:12.110> see<00:02:12.140> two<00:02:12.470> rather<00:02:12.830> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
camera there you can see two rather the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.190 
camera there you can see two rather the
little<00:02:13.760> things<00:02:14.030> probably<00:02:14.390> one<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
little things probably one is like the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.380 
little things probably one is like the
flash<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> other<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:17.000> makes<00:02:17.180> some

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
flash and the other one it makes some

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.240 
flash and the other one it makes some
kind<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.540> infrared<00:02:17.930> port<00:02:18.410> or<00:02:18.650> something<00:02:19.100> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
kind of infrared port or something and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.010 
kind of infrared port or something and
this<00:02:19.850> phone<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.210> also<00:02:20.330> probably<00:02:20.720> come<00:02:20.990> with

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
this phone but also probably come with

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.060 
this phone but also probably come with
like<00:02:21.860> Snapdragon<00:02:22.550> 805<00:02:23.440> which<00:02:24.440> we<00:02:24.800> are

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
like Snapdragon 805 which we are

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.070 
like Snapdragon 805 which we are
speculating<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.880> we<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.270> see<00:02:26.540> probably<00:02:26.810> on

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
speculating that we can see probably on

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.130 
speculating that we can see probably on
the<00:02:27.200> galaxy<00:02:27.770> s5<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.640> then<00:02:29.270> probably<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.930> to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
the galaxy s5 and then probably like to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.320 
the galaxy s5 and then probably like to
give<00:02:30.290> out<00:02:30.380> or<00:02:30.650> maybe<00:02:30.950> even<00:02:31.070> 3d<00:02:31.490> about<00:02:31.790> ceramics

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
give out or maybe even 3d about ceramics

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.990 
give out or maybe even 3d about ceramics
out<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.750> bad<00:02:32.990> boy<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:34.670> do<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.820> think

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
out of this bad boy so what do you think

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.580 
out of this bad boy so what do you think
about<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.270> concept<00:02:35.720> i<00:02:35.900> think<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> very

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
about this concept i think is a very

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.790 
about this concept i think is a very
nice<00:02:37.400> concert<00:02:37.940> special<00:02:38.180> speaker<00:02:39.110> large

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
nice concert special speaker large

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.850 
nice concert special speaker large
speaker<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.930> design<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.530> more

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
speaker and I like the design of it more

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.280 
speaker and I like the design of it more
because<00:02:43.520> they<00:02:44.240> wanted<00:02:44.660> problems<00:02:45.050> with<00:02:45.200> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
because they wanted problems with the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.220 
because they wanted problems with the
HTC<00:02:45.740> one<00:02:46.430> was<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.510> horrible<00:02:47.959> horrible

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
HTC one was the the horrible horrible

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.360 
HTC one was the the horrible horrible
design<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:49.130> felt<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.700> if<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.360> bulky<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:52.190> just

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
design it felt that if a bulky but just

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.250 
design it felt that if a bulky but just
button<00:02:52.790> layout<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.690> become<00:02:54.020> like<00:02:54.050> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
button layout and it become like the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.320 
button layout and it become like the
curve<00:02:54.530> on<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.770> phone<00:02:54.980> which<00:02:55.160> is<00:02:55.250> weird<00:02:55.550> this

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
curve on the phone which is weird this

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.290 
curve on the phone which is weird this
one<00:02:56.570> definite<00:02:56.930> seem<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.380> having<00:02:57.980> that

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
one definite seem to be having that

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.270 
one definite seem to be having that
fixed<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.020> is<00:03:00.230> definitely<00:03:00.260> pretty<00:03:00.950> cool

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
fixed so that is definitely pretty cool

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.070 
fixed so that is definitely pretty cool
so<00:03:01.640> yeah<00:03:01.850> it's<00:03:02.270> a<00:03:02.390> quick<00:03:02.570> little<00:03:02.690> video<00:03:02.870> here

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
so yeah it's a quick little video here

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.020 
so yeah it's a quick little video here
checking<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:03.770> out<00:03:03.950> hopefully<00:03:04.250> you<00:03:04.640> get<00:03:04.820> in

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
checking this out hopefully you get in
