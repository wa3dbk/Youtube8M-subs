00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
to a test now I'm using this with an

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.250 
to a test now I'm using this with an
iPhone<00:00:14.490> 6<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> also<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> previous

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260

iPhone 6 and I also have the previous

version for the iPhone 5 as well and as

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.939 
version for the iPhone 5 as well and as
you<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.359> see<00:00:18.420> there's<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> big<00:00:19.500> difference

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
you can see there's a big difference

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.340 
you can see there's a big difference
between<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.850> two<00:00:21.000> models<00:00:21.240> themselves<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
between the two models themselves and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.080 
between the two models themselves and
we'll<00:00:22.500> take<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> closer<00:00:22.949> look<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.340> those<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.760> bit

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
we'll take a closer look at those a bit

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.099 
we'll take a closer look at those a bit
later<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.060> take<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> closer<00:00:30.510> look<00:00:30.750> here

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
later so if we take a closer look here

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.229 
later so if we take a closer look here
at<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.500> iPhone<00:00:31.859> 6<00:00:32.219> model<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.059> it's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
at the iPhone 6 model you can see it's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.450 
at the iPhone 6 model you can see it's
really<00:00:33.719> nice<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> thin<00:00:34.410> really<00:00:34.829> nice<00:00:35.040> sort<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
really nice and thin really nice sort of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.150 
really nice and thin really nice sort of
feel<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> covers<00:00:36.450> well<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.829> self

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
feel to the covers well now it's self

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.670 
feel to the covers well now it's self
from<00:00:38.430> its<00:00:38.610> predecessor<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.079> iPhone<00:00:40.410> 5

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
from its predecessor with the iPhone 5

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.979 
from its predecessor with the iPhone 5
model<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.149> clips<00:00:42.690> which

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
model you can see it has clips which

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.860 
model you can see it has clips which
sort<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> secure<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.190> actual<00:00:44.489> case<00:00:44.870> inside

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
sort of secure the actual case inside

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.889 
sort of secure the actual case inside
the<00:00:46.440> iPhone<00:00:46.829> now<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.760> difference<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.360> this

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
the iPhone now the difference is this

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.510 
the iPhone now the difference is this
early<00:00:49.260> has<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.770> little<00:00:50.010> flap<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.489> here

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
early has this little flap right here

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.240 
early has this little flap right here
which<00:00:50.910> gives<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.300> access<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.649> ports<00:00:53.070> are

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
which gives you access to the ports are

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.340 
which gives you access to the ports are
your<00:00:53.760> headphone<00:00:54.120> jacks<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.780> speaker<00:00:55.289> as

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
your headphone jacks and your speaker as

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.319 
your headphone jacks and your speaker as
well<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.100> other<00:00:56.280> thing<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> you've<00:00:56.820> got<00:00:57.030> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
well the other thing is you've got this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
well the other thing is you've got this
little<00:00:57.629> flap<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.160> guess<00:00:59.460> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
little flap right here which I guess is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.340 
little flap right here which I guess is
pretty<00:01:00.030> secure<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.480> did<00:01:00.750> put<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> wall

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
pretty secure I did put it on the wall

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.709 
pretty secure I did put it on the wall
and<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.620> works<00:01:01.800> fine<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.180> feel<00:01:03.660> like

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and it works fine but I do feel like

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440 
and it works fine but I do feel like
this<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.559> gives<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> bit<00:01:05.430> more<00:01:05.640> security

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
this just gives it a bit more security

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.840 
this just gives it a bit more security
just<00:01:07.260> because<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.590> feel<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.040> bit<00:01:08.220> more<00:01:08.250> safer

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
just because I feel a bit more safer

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
just because I feel a bit more safer
when<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.510> clip<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.290> knowing

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
when there's a clip in there knowing

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
when there's a clip in there knowing
that<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.100> keeping<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.640> phone<00:01:11.880> nice<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that it's keeping my phone nice and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.640 
that it's keeping my phone nice and
intact

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
intact

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
intact
so<00:01:13.979> using<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.340> case<00:01:14.580> over<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> long<00:01:15.060> weekend

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
so using this case over the long weekend

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
so using this case over the long weekend
made<00:01:16.080> me<00:01:16.259> feel<00:01:16.500> slightly<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.009> bit<00:01:17.130> safer

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
made me feel slightly a bit safer

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.010 
made me feel slightly a bit safer
knowing<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.750> type<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
an ordinary case it's not gonna

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
now personally I find that the case is

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.649 
now personally I find that the case is
okay<00:02:04.680> yes<00:02:05.220> one<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> things<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.420> feel

okay yes one of the things I would feel

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.900 
okay yes one of the things I would feel
a<00:02:06.690> bit<00:02:07.020> more<00:02:07.229> secure<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.369> case<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
a bit more secure with the case if it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.029 
a bit more secure with the case if it
did<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.390> clips<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.050> there<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.649> secure

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039

did have clips in there just to secure
the<00:02:11.190> backing<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.270> quite<00:02:12.569> solid<00:02:12.900> don't
