and we have movie servo AF we can enable
or<00:00:44.390> disable<00:00:44.629> this<00:00:45.199> so<00:00:45.470> this<00:00:45.680> is<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:47.290> special

feature on the EOS 70d so when it's on

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.119 
feature on the EOS 70d so when it's on
enable<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:53.780> basically<00:00:54.140> get<00:00:54.440> continuous

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
enable you basically get continuous

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.009 
enable you basically get continuous
autofocus<00:00:55.460> in<00:00:56.199> movie<00:00:57.199> mode<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.659> have<00:00:59.780> quite

recording<00:01:21.560> sighs<00:01:22.189> alright<00:01:23.079> so<00:01:24.079> basically<00:01:24.289> you

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
recording sighs alright so basically you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.029 
recording sighs alright so basically you
get<00:01:24.679> to<00:01:24.799> change<00:01:25.039> between<00:01:25.719> these<00:01:26.740> formats<00:01:27.740> you

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
get to change between these formats you

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.609 
get to change between these formats you
get<00:01:28.250> 1080p<00:01:28.880> 30<00:01:29.240> frames<00:01:29.539> per<00:01:29.659> second<00:01:30.079> on<00:01:30.170> all<00:01:30.590> I

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
get 1080p 30 frames per second on all I

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.679 
get 1080p 30 frames per second on all I
compassion<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.670> all<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:31.880> compression<00:01:32.539> is

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
compassion and all I compression is

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.349 
compassion and all I compression is
basically<00:01:33.289> a<00:01:33.500> low<00:01:33.950> compassion<00:01:34.579> because<00:01:35.179> it

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
basically a low compassion because it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.109 
basically a low compassion because it
compresses<00:01:35.810> each<00:01:36.320> frame<00:01:36.979> regardless<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.880> the

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
compresses each frame regardless of the

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.060 
compresses each frame regardless of the
frames<00:01:38.420> before<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.409> after<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:40.609> ipb<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:42.140> high

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
frames before and after so ipb is a high

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.849 
frames before and after so ipb is a high
compression<00:01:43.490> basically<00:01:44.299> it<00:01:44.450> compresses<00:01:44.960> the

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 
compression basically it compresses the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.669 
compression basically it compresses the
frame<00:01:46.100> based<00:01:46.789> on<00:01:47.060> taking<00:01:47.990> into<00:01:48.200> account<00:01:48.229> the

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
frame based on taking into account the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.450 
frame based on taking into account the
frame<00:01:48.859> before<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.460> after<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:50.570> IPB<00:01:51.560> will<00:01:52.249> give

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
frame before and after so IPB will give

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.940 
frame before and after so IPB will give
you<00:01:52.579> a<00:01:52.609> lot<00:01:53.090> more<00:01:53.119> recording<00:01:53.689> time<00:01:53.960> than<00:01:54.350> all<00:01:54.590> I

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
you a lot more recording time than all I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.910 
you a lot more recording time than all I
simply<00:01:55.729> because<00:01:55.999> I'm<00:01:56.210> recording<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.229> IBB<00:01:57.710> will

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
simply because I'm recording on IBB will

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.179 
simply because I'm recording on IBB will
give<00:01:58.069> a<00:01:58.369> much<00:01:58.939> smaller<00:01:59.530> video<00:02:00.530> sizes<00:02:00.920> while

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
give a much smaller video sizes while

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.510 
give a much smaller video sizes while
you<00:02:01.280> get<00:02:01.429> huge<00:02:01.999> video<00:02:02.420> sizes<00:02:02.929> with<00:02:03.229> all<00:02:03.499> I<00:02:03.920> so

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
you get huge video sizes with all I so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.200 
you get huge video sizes with all I so
the<00:02:04.700> bitrate<00:02:04.909> with<00:02:05.329> all<00:02:05.539> is<00:02:05.990> also<00:02:06.439> higher<00:02:06.649> and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
the bitrate with all is also higher and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.140 
the bitrate with all is also higher and
also<00:02:08.210> we<00:02:08.360> get<00:02:08.860> 1080p<00:02:09.860> at<00:02:09.950> 24<00:02:10.399> fps<00:02:10.729> oh<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.420> PB

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
also we get 1080p at 24 fps oh I I PB

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.410 
also we get 1080p at 24 fps oh I I PB

25<00:02:33.769> frames<00:02:34.190> per<00:02:34.310> second<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.849> comparison<00:02:35.480> with

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
25 frames per second in comparison with

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
30 frames per second 24 frames a second

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.740 
30 frames per second 24 frames a second
and<00:02:38.540> 50<00:02:39.409> frames<00:02:39.560> per<00:02:39.709> second<00:02:40.129> instead<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.819> 60

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
and 50 frames per second instead of 60

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.979 
and 50 frames per second instead of 60
frames<00:02:42.409> per<00:02:42.560> second<00:02:43.129> so<00:02:43.360> basically<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.569> shoot

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
frames per second so basically I shoot

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:52.300 
frames per second so basically I shoot
in<00:02:45.400> NTSC<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:49.180> also<00:02:50.180> we<00:02:50.390> have<00:02:50.629> digital<00:02:51.140> zoom<00:02:51.500> so

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
in NTSC and also we have digital zoom so

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.190 
in NTSC and also we have digital zoom so
digital<00:02:52.819> zoom<00:02:53.650> basically<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:56.390> function

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
digital zoom basically is a function

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.470 
digital zoom basically is a function
borrowed<00:02:58.040> over<00:02:58.220> from<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.060> EOS<00:02:59.959> 600d<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:02.150> with

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
borrowed over from the EOS 600d so with

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.699 
borrowed over from the EOS 600d so with
this<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.900> can<00:03:03.079> actually<00:03:04.690> digitally<00:03:05.690> zoom<00:03:05.959> in

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
this you can actually digitally zoom in

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.500 
this you can actually digitally zoom in
into<00:03:06.920> your<00:03:07.040> subjects<00:03:07.640> I'm<00:03:07.760> sorry<00:03:08.030> I'm<00:03:08.299> a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
into your subjects I'm sorry I'm a

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.830 
into your subjects I'm sorry I'm a
little<00:03:08.599> overexposed<00:03:09.409> here<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:11.480> with<00:03:11.629> this

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
little overexposed here so with this

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.059 
little overexposed here so with this
feature<00:03:12.079> you<00:03:12.829> get<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:14.170> digitally<00:03:15.170> zoom<00:03:15.200> in<00:03:15.650> to

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
feature you get to digitally zoom in to

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.190 
feature you get to digitally zoom in to
your<00:03:16.190> subject<00:03:16.640> without<00:03:16.909> losing<00:03:17.599> resolution

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.599 

but<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.349> limitations<00:03:22.129> are<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:23.480> can<00:03:23.780> only

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
but the limitations are you can only

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.690 
but the limitations are you can only
shoot<00:03:25.609> in<00:03:25.879> 1080p<00:03:26.799> so<00:03:27.799> all<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.310> other<00:03:28.459> modes

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
shoot in 1080p so all the other modes

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.670 
shoot in 1080p so all the other modes
are<00:03:28.910> disabled<00:03:29.569> and<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:30.079> only<00:03:30.230> shoot<00:03:30.470> in

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
are disabled and you can only shoot in

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.890 
are disabled and you can only shoot in
1080p<00:03:30.859> if<00:03:31.569> you<00:03:32.569> enable<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.590> digital<00:03:34.130> zoom<00:03:35.739> and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
1080p if you enable the digital zoom and

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.530 
1080p if you enable the digital zoom and
we<00:03:38.900> have<00:03:39.079> sound<00:03:39.440> recording<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.940> can<00:03:41.180> set<00:03:41.419> it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
we have sound recording you can set it

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.289 
we have sound recording you can set it
to<00:03:41.569> auto<00:03:41.870> manner<00:03:42.829> or<00:03:43.099> disable<00:03:43.730> disables

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
to auto manner or disable disables

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.750 
to auto manner or disable disables
basically<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.379> won't<00:03:45.560> get<00:03:45.739> any<00:03:45.950> sound<00:03:46.370> from

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
basically you won't get any sound from

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.020 
basically you won't get any sound from
your<00:03:47.060> video<00:03:47.419> so<00:03:48.139> the<00:03:48.379> sound<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.889> off<00:03:49.190> auto

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
your video so the sound is off auto

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.670 
your video so the sound is off auto
basically<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:52.430> camera<00:03:52.730> takes<00:03:52.910> care<00:03:53.209> of<00:03:53.239> the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
basically the camera takes care of the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.059 
basically the camera takes care of the
levels<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.889> if<00:03:55.790> it's<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.060> manual<00:03:56.419> you<00:03:56.480> can

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
levels and if it's a manual you can

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.000 
levels and if it's a manual you can
manually<00:03:58.150> select<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.540> level<00:04:00.019> you<00:04:00.620> want<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:00.889> be

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
manually select the level you want to be

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.089 
manually select the level you want to be
recording<00:04:01.489> at<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:03.109> is<00:04:03.199> a<00:04:03.319> great<00:04:03.650> plus<00:04:03.859> for

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
recording at so this is a great plus for

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.240 
recording at so this is a great plus for
if<00:04:05.060> you're<00:04:05.419> using<00:04:05.660> an<00:04:05.840> external<00:04:06.500> mic<00:04:06.650> or<00:04:06.829> if

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
if you're using an external mic or if

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.180 
if you're using an external mic or if
you're<00:04:07.430> very<00:04:07.609> serious<00:04:07.819> about<00:04:08.060> audio<00:04:08.449> and<00:04:09.190> also

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
you're very serious about audio and also

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.909 
you're very serious about audio and also
we<00:04:10.730> have<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.150> wind<00:04:11.569> filter<00:04:11.989> or<00:04:12.230> attenuate<00:04:12.889> err

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
we have a wind filter or attenuate err

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.180 
we have a wind filter or attenuate err
so<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:14.180> wind<00:04:14.419> filter<00:04:14.660> is<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.049> digital<00:04:15.949> wind

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
so the wind filter is a digital wind

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.569 
so the wind filter is a digital wind
filter

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
filter

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.390 
filter
it's<00:04:16.789> basically<00:04:17.329> a<00:04:17.660> low<00:04:18.410> cut<00:04:18.769> filter<00:04:18.799> and

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
it's basically a low cut filter and

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.810 
it's basically a low cut filter and
atención<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.090> turret<00:04:20.479> I<00:04:21.310> don't<00:04:22.310> really<00:04:22.460> get<00:04:22.639> how

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
atención a turret I don't really get how

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.900 
atención a turret I don't really get how
it<00:04:22.880> works

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
it works

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.550 
it works
timecode<00:04:25.910> so<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.599> EOS<00:04:26.810> 70d<00:04:26.990> supports

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
timecode so the EOS 70d supports

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.060 
timecode so the EOS 70d supports
timecode<00:04:27.979> and<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.910> can<00:04:29.060> count<00:04:29.300> up<00:04:29.889> based<00:04:30.889> on

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
timecode and you can count up based on

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.469 
timecode and you can count up based on
recording<00:04:31.849> run<00:04:32.000> or<00:04:32.180> free<00:04:33.169> run<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:35.300> can

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
recording run or free run and you can

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.200 
recording run or free run and you can
also

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
also

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.360 
also
set<00:04:36.600> this<00:04:36.780> start<00:04:37.139> time<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:38.009> manually

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
set this start time so you can manually

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.050 
set this start time so you can manually
input<00:04:39.120> your<00:04:39.720> start<00:04:40.020> time<00:04:40.319> you<00:04:41.310> can<00:04:41.430> reset<00:04:41.850> or

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
input your start time you can reset or

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.499 
input your start time you can reset or
set<00:04:42.630> it<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.289> cameras<00:04:43.889> type<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.970> movie

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
set it to the cameras type and the movie

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.779 
set it to the cameras type and the movie
recording<00:04:45.780> count<00:04:46.349> will<00:04:46.889> be<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.130> recording

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
recording count will be the recording

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.600 
recording count will be the recording
time<00:04:48.030> or<00:04:48.349> time<00:04:49.349> code<00:04:49.590> basically<00:04:49.979> if<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.370> set

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
time or time code basically if you set

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.010 
time or time code basically if you set
it<00:04:50.699> to<00:04:50.819> recording<00:04:51.330> time<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.910> it<00:04:54.660> will<00:04:54.840> show

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
it to recording time the it will show

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.969 
it to recording time the it will show
you<00:04:55.080> um<00:04:56.960> how<00:04:57.960> long<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.289> have<00:04:58.380> been<00:04:58.440> recording

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
you um how long you have been recording
