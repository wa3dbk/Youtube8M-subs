00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.030 
circles inside of the big circle now
this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.600> very<00:01:33.990> tricky<00:01:34.259> I'm<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> lie

and a lot of people mess up on it but
with<00:01:37.409> practice<00:01:37.680> comes<00:01:38.220> perfect<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.090> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
with practice comes perfect and if you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.090
