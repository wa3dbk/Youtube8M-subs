bottom a five gallon bucket I other
black<00:02:28.920> fits<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.579> moonshine<00:02:29.850> for<00:02:30.420> Nielsen

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
black fits in my moonshine for Nielsen

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.660 
black fits in my moonshine for Nielsen
at<00:02:32.220> five<00:02:32.609> pounds<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.060> sugar

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.270 

so<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:40.030> not<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.160> not<00:02:42.220> bad<00:02:42.580> moonshine

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
so this is not this is not bad moonshine

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.680 
so this is not this is not bad moonshine
cornmeal<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.430> sugar<00:02:45.730> just<00:02:45.910> like<00:02:46.120> logs<00:02:46.330> to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
cornmeal and sugar just like logs to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.470 
cornmeal and sugar just like logs to
make<00:02:47.160> half<00:02:48.160> full<00:02:48.460> with<00:02:48.670> warm<00:02:48.940> water<00:02:49.000> warm

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
make half full with warm water warm

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
make half full with warm water warm
enough<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.750> melt<00:02:49.870> sugar<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.560> not<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:50.920> hot<00:02:51.130> as

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
enough to melt sugar but not so hot as

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.150 
enough to melt sugar but not so hot as
they<00:02:51.520> kill<00:02:51.730> least<00:02:52.710> till<00:02:53.710> sugars<00:02:54.010> dissolved

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
they kill least till sugars dissolved

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.890 
they kill least till sugars dissolved
okay<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.070> five<00:02:57.250> gallons<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> guess

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
okay this is five gallons so I guess

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.650 
okay this is five gallons so I guess
well<00:02:59.260> this<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.470> 2.5<00:03:00.460> gallons<00:03:00.850> perfect<00:03:01.300> that's

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
well this is 2.5 gallons perfect that's

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.330 
well this is 2.5 gallons perfect that's
it<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.350> should<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.710> microwave<00:03:02.890> then<00:03:05.010> he<00:03:06.010> did

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
it so should we microwave then he did

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.130 
it so should we microwave then he did
aliky<00:03:06.670> loadable<00:03:07.030> yeah<00:03:07.330> that's<00:03:07.690> probably<00:03:07.930> bad

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
aliky loadable yeah that's probably bad

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.610 
aliky loadable yeah that's probably bad
idea<00:03:08.790> alright<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.020> a<00:03:11.050> story<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.470> that

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
idea alright so this is a story of that

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.400 
idea alright so this is a story of that
idea<00:03:11.830> though<00:03:12.190> let's<00:03:12.610> do<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.170> cheering<00:03:14.170> water

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
idea though let's do it cheering water

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.120 
idea though let's do it cheering water
is<00:03:14.680> obviously<00:03:15.610> very<00:03:15.670> flammable<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.950> you've

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
is obviously very flammable if you've

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.949 
is obviously very flammable if you've
area<00:03:18.550> means<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:19.090> mean<00:03:19.450> it's<00:03:19.630> two<00:03:19.810> parts

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
area means I mean it's two parts

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.310 
area means I mean it's two parts
hydrogen<00:03:21.510> begin<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.690> way<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.870> never<00:03:23.050> been

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
hydrogen begin to the way I never been

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.170 
hydrogen begin to the way I never been
hit<00:03:23.470> invert<00:03:23.800> yeah<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.490> mean<00:03:24.700> what<00:03:24.850> was<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
hit invert yeah I mean what was on the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.510 
hit invert yeah I mean what was on the
outside<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.690> air<00:03:25.900> oxygen<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.770> hydrogen<00:03:27.070> when

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
outside of air oxygen and hydrogen when

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.390 
outside of air oxygen and hydrogen when
the<00:03:27.610> two<00:03:27.760> combined<00:03:28.260> boom<00:03:29.260> water<00:03:29.650> water<00:03:30.250> water

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
the two combined boom water water water

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.730 
the two combined boom water water water
explode<00:03:31.120> that's<00:03:31.480> why<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.810> thing<00:03:32.110> burst<00:03:32.380> into

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
explode that's why the thing burst into

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.220 
explode that's why the thing burst into
a<00:03:32.770> water<00:03:33.070> ballon<00:03:33.370> that's<00:03:33.550> what<00:03:33.670> happening

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
a water ballon that's what happening

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.300 
a water ballon that's what happening
that's<00:03:35.230> why<00:03:35.380> they<00:03:35.530> had<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.800> Burton<00:03:36.100> killed

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
that's why they had the Burton killed

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.480 
that's why they had the Burton killed
that<00:03:36.400> big<00:03:36.640> fire<00:03:36.910> right<00:03:37.240> after<00:03:37.540> exploded<00:03:38.080> to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
that big fire right after exploded to

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.070 
that big fire right after exploded to
evaporate<00:03:39.490> all<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.730> water<00:03:39.940> that's<00:03:40.780> right

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
evaporate all the water that's right

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.350 
evaporate all the water that's right
we're<00:03:42.040> making<00:03:42.280> Hindenburg<00:03:42.730> jokes<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.180> too

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
we're making Hindenburg jokes the too

soon too soon so it's Luke warmish we're

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.640 
soon too soon so it's Luke warmish we're
looking<00:03:52.390> for<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.570> temperature<00:03:53.050> that's<00:03:53.080> just

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
looking for a temperature that's just

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.560 
looking for a temperature that's just
warm<00:03:53.890> enough<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.130> melt<00:03:54.280> all<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.060> sugar<00:03:55.360> in

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
warm enough to melt all of this sugar in

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.490 
warm enough to melt all of this sugar in
here<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:57.459> go<00:03:57.640> science<00:03:58.570> oh<00:03:59.459> crap<00:04:00.459> oh<00:04:00.940> yeah

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
here we go science oh crap oh yeah

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.010 
here we go science oh crap oh yeah
so<00:04:03.280> we<00:04:03.370> don't<00:04:03.490> want<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.760> kill<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.120> yeast<00:04:04.270> right

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
so we don't want to kill the yeast right

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.500 
so we don't want to kill the yeast right
that's<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.440> biggest<00:04:05.620> issue<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.940> bubbling<00:04:07.420> I

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
that's the biggest issue it's bubbling I

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.560 
that's the biggest issue it's bubbling I
love<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:09.700> means<00:04:09.880> it's<00:04:10.030> definitely

love that that means it's definitely

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.280 
love that that means it's definitely
science<00:04:11.220> yeah<00:04:12.630> where's<00:04:13.630> our<00:04:13.840> science

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
science yeah where's our science

instruction to fill half full with warm

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.930 
instruction to fill half full with warm
water<00:04:16.799> enough<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.829> melt<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.130> sugar<00:04:18.190> but<00:04:18.640> not

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
water enough to melt the sugar but not

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.150 
water enough to melt the sugar but not
to<00:04:19.269> kill<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.660> yeast<00:04:19.980> distracted<00:04:20.980> by<00:04:21.100> this

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
to kill the yeast distracted by this

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.480 
to kill the yeast distracted by this
bubbling<00:04:21.760> brew<00:04:22.060> it's<00:04:22.510> actually<00:04:22.630> bubbling

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
bubbling brew it's actually bubbling

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
bubbling brew it's actually bubbling
that's<00:04:24.490> how<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:24.670> notice<00:04:24.940> I<00:04:25.060> account<00:04:25.420> with

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
that's how you notice I account with

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.810 
that's how you notice I account with
bubbles<00:04:25.840> equal<00:04:26.110> science<00:04:26.500> it's<00:04:27.460> not<00:04:27.610> bubbling

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
bubbles equal science it's not bubbling

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.020 
bubbles equal science it's not bubbling
it's<00:04:28.150> not<00:04:28.270> science<00:04:29.310> my<00:04:30.310> next<00:04:30.580> question<00:04:30.910> is

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
it's not science my next question is

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.290 
it's not science my next question is
this<00:04:31.240> one<00:04:31.960> packet<00:04:32.410> with<00:04:33.220> three<00:04:33.460> envelopes<00:04:33.640> or

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
this one packet with three envelopes or

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.170 
this one packet with three envelopes or
is<00:04:34.450> this<00:04:34.570> three<00:04:34.840> packet<00:04:35.550> we're<00:04:36.550> introducing

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
is this three packet we're introducing

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.920 
is this three packet we're introducing
the<00:04:37.330> science<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.050> mixture<00:04:38.320> right<00:04:38.560> now<00:04:42.930> go

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
the science to the mixture right now go

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:53.090 
the science to the mixture right now go
little<00:04:44.140> yeast<00:04:44.440> do<00:04:45.280> your<00:04:45.430> job<00:04:46.290> work<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.470> magic

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.470 

perfect<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:54.280> would<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:55.030> looks<00:04:55.180> like<00:04:55.330> it's

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
perfect that would that looks like it's

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.610 
perfect that would that looks like it's
definitely<00:04:55.900> going<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.080> be<00:04:56.140> moonshine

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
definitely going to be moonshine

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.490 
definitely going to be moonshine
something<00:04:57.630> there<00:04:58.630> first<00:04:58.810> this<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.140> a<00:04:59.260> valve

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
something there first this is a valve

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.880 
something there first this is a valve
okay<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.450> you<00:05:01.450> fill<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.690> with<00:05:01.780> water<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.320> when

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
okay and you fill it with water and when

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.810 
okay and you fill it with water and when
you're<00:05:03.190> done<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:04.210> bubbles<00:05:04.570> stop<00:05:04.780> topping<00:05:04.960> up

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.300

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
I think we just wait until we have

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.850 
I think we just wait until we have
alcohol<00:05:16.990> now<00:05:17.140> I'm<00:05:17.729> not<00:05:18.729> positive<00:05:19.060> but<00:05:19.860> all

comes to mind how cool would that be or

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.150 
comes to mind how cool would that be or
glassblowing<00:05:55.990> looks<00:05:56.260> really<00:05:56.500> cool<00:05:56.710> or

importantly this list has given me so

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.180 
importantly this list has given me so
much<00:06:07.960> direction<00:06:08.320> in<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:08.650> last<00:06:08.830> year<00:06:09.040> and<00:06:09.070> a

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
much direction in the last year and a

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.010 
much direction in the last year and a
half<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:09.490> that's<00:06:09.640> totally<00:06:09.850> blown<00:06:10.180> my<00:06:10.360> mind<00:06:10.510> so
