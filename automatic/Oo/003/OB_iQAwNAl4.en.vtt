00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.980
 biodegradable waste can be divided into two large groups at the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.909
 first group belong the funny materials d 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.349
 that is those and still alive rich in water 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.710
 and being alive 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.140
 clothes also of protein and therefore of nitrogen to second group belong 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.109
 instead dry materials 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.330
 that is dead 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.830
 that have lost their moisture so much of the water 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.490
 in this case they are rich in carbon 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.640
 it is precisely the relationship between the wet materials and the materials according to them 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.740
 relationship 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.890
 the main secret of a good mixture 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.720
 if the facts prevail the nitrogen rights materials 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.440
 the microorganisms have so much to eat and it's just like us when we have 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 eaten so much we tend to supeeer there is also microorganisms in this case 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 pendulum a little to fall asleep are other microorganisms that take the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.410
 upper hand 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.960
 start an unpleasant fermentation and the compound obtained is not certain 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.120
 good 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.780
 as well as if the dry materials are too abundant 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.450
 wraps of microorganisms do not have to eat and fail to transform 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 these scraps I blame 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 just right relationship between these two materials 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.890
 makes that the mixture obtained is really a good terrinha you make me 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.289
 domestic waste 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.289
 the United States has a clear prevalence 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.470
 for this reason it is always good to have a little stock of dry material set aside 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.340
 in fact for every kilo 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.229
 of wet material and well add about 10% there is a pound of material 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.570
 dry for this we can for example hold by the corrugated cardboard e 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.830
 break it apart eten arluno aside from 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.380
 the same is true of tar of dried flowers we have a carpenter friend because 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 no getting sawdust 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.840
 if on the other hand I were to have an overabundance of material 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.369
 rich in carbon just like dry mowing, I can always resort to 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.069
 of the supplements that I find on the market that are richer in material 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.010
 nitrogenous are really activators of the process accelerators 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.420
 composting accelerates it and ensures that I can get a good compote 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.419
 even only with materials 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.049
 of the garden 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.269
 other things that are found on the market rich in nitrogen may be blood 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.529
 dry or cornunghia
