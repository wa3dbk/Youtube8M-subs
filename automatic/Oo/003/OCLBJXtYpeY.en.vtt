00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
toner so it's a lot cheaper

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.430 
toner so it's a lot cheaper
you<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.059> open<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> front<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.200> kind<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
you just open the front and you kind of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
you just open the front and you kind of
pull<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.860> cartridge<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.280> actually

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
pull the cartridge out and you actually

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.310 
pull the cartridge out and you actually
take<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.050> black<00:00:50.449> container<00:00:51.449> so

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
take it out of this black container so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350 
take it out of this black container so
on<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> brother<00:00:53.100> laser<00:00:53.550> printer<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.270> are

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
on the brother laser printer there are

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.529 
on the brother laser printer there are
two<00:00:54.660> sensors<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.590> either<00:00:55.829> side<00:00:56.309> here<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
two sensors on either side here that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.590 
two sensors on either side here that
tell<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> toner<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.190> low<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.149> something

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
tell that the toner is low so something

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.000 
tell that the toner is low so something
that<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> lot<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.020> people<00:01:01.350> online<00:01:01.500> have

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that a lot of people online have

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.630 
that a lot of people online have
suggested<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.090> keep<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.260> toner<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
suggested to keep your toner going is to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.840 
suggested to keep your toner going is to
cover<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.210> sensors<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:08.670> an

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
cover up the sensors so I just use an

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.300 
cover up the sensors so I just use an
opaque<00:01:09.210> label<00:01:09.900> right<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.770> cover<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
opaque label right here to cover up the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.600 
opaque label right here to cover up the
sensor<00:01:11.729> once<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.450> take<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.990> off<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> holder

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
sensor once you take this off the holder

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.580 
sensor once you take this off the holder
you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.330> sensor<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you can see the sensor down in the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.969 
you can see the sensor down in the
middle<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:22.500> we're<00:01:22.650> trying<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
middle so that's what we're trying to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
middle so that's what we're trying to
cover<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> extend<00:01:24.390> our<00:01:24.600> toner<00:01:24.930> life

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
cover up just to extend our toner life

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.740 
cover up just to extend our toner life
first<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> reason<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> cover<00:01:27.570> up

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
first so the reason we want to cover up

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
first so the reason we want to cover up
the<00:01:27.900> sensor<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.619> because<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.060> normally

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the sensor is because you know normally

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
the sensor is because you know normally
when<00:01:30.810> you're<00:01:31.170> buying<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.619> printer<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.189> want

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
when you're buying a printer they want

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
when you're buying a printer they want
you<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.000> buy<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.329> whole<00:01:33.990> thing<00:01:34.320> over

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
you to just buy this whole thing over

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
you to just buy this whole thing over
again<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.520> buy<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:36.270> brother

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
again and if you buy one from brother

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.460 
again and if you buy one from brother
it's<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.229> 45<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:38.549> 60<00:01:39.060> dollars<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:40.290> buy

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
it's like 45 you know 60 dollars to buy

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.490 
it's like 45 you know 60 dollars to buy
it<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.250> cover<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> sensor<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it so I cover up the sensor so that the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.130 
it so I cover up the sensor so that the
toner<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.490> last<00:01:44.790> longer<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> will

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
toner will last longer because it will

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.609 
toner will last longer because it will
last<00:01:47.100> longer<00:01:47.610> than<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.210> manufacturer<00:01:48.990> states

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
last longer than the manufacturer states

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.090 
last longer than the manufacturer states
so<00:01:50.579> when<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.880> buy<00:01:51.149> your<00:01:51.840> toner<00:01:52.170> online<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
so when you buy your toner online it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.859 
so when you buy your toner online it
will<00:01:53.280> come<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:54.180> bottle<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.840> this

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
will come in a little bottle like this

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.100 
will come in a little bottle like this
or<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.890> size<00:01:56.430> bigger<00:01:57.060> than<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.780> our<00:01:57.869> two

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
or a size bigger than this or our two

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.709 
or a size bigger than this or our two
bottles<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:59.159> will<00:01:59.369> also<00:01:59.820> probably<00:02:00.090> come<00:02:00.689> with

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
bottles it will also probably come with

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.709 
bottles it will also probably come with
some<00:02:01.170> gloves<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.540> need

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
some gloves like this so you really need

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.380 
some gloves like this so you really need
to<00:02:03.930> use<00:02:04.140> some<00:02:04.469> kind<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.829> gloves<00:02:05.149> because<00:02:06.149> as

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to use some kind of gloves because as

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
to use some kind of gloves because as
you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.840> see<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> bottles<00:02:07.890> I've

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
you can see on one of the bottles I've

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.430 
you can see on one of the bottles I've
used<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.640> very<00:02:08.970> powdery<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.229> gets

have to really like get it off there
it's<00:02:38.239> not<00:02:38.510> always<00:02:38.750> easy<00:02:42.969> the<00:02:43.969> powdered<00:02:44.450> toner

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
it's not always easy the powdered toner

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.110 
it's not always easy the powdered toner
kit<00:02:45.170> should<00:02:45.500> come<00:02:45.769> with<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.370> nozzle<00:02:46.609> too

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.690 
kit should come with a little nozzle too
so<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.139> it's<00:02:48.290> easier<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.829> get<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.430> toner

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
pair of pliers to do it so that's just

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.149 
pair of pliers to do it so that's just
how<00:04:06.979> you<00:04:07.099> reset<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.669> you<00:04:07.699> can<00:04:07.970> use<00:04:08.150> pliers<00:04:08.540> or

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
refilled it about five or six times I've

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.000 
refilled it about five or six times I've
actually<00:04:23.029> sometimes<00:04:23.750> only<00:04:23.960> had<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.440> use<00:04:24.469> half

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
actually sometimes only had to use half

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.650 
actually sometimes only had to use half
of<00:04:25.219> this<00:04:25.400> bottle<00:04:25.669> and<00:04:26.060> that<00:04:26.150> was<00:04:26.330> an

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
of this bottle and that was an

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.410 
of this bottle and that was an
for<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:28.070> know<00:04:28.190> two<00:04:28.250> bottles<00:04:28.790> like<00:04:28.940> this<00:04:29.120> it's

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
for you know two bottles like this it's

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.740 
for you know two bottles like this it's
basically<00:04:29.660> under<00:04:30.320> $10<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:32.030> I'm<00:04:32.270> just<00:04:32.510> using

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
basically under $10 so I'm just using

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.870 
basically under $10 so I'm just using
the<00:04:33.020> original<00:04:33.530> cartridge<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.100> came<00:04:34.640> with

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
the original cartridge that came with

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.670 
the original cartridge that came with
the<00:04:35.030> printer<00:04:35.270> if<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.080> have<00:04:36.350> bought<00:04:36.650> a

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
the printer if you have bought a

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.730 
the printer if you have bought a
cartridge<00:04:37.130> in<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.490> past<00:04:37.760> as<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.390> refill<00:04:39.110> you

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
cartridge in the past as a refill you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.890 
cartridge in the past as a refill you
can<00:04:39.920> use<00:04:40.070> that<00:04:40.250> as<00:04:40.490> well<00:04:40.520> it's<00:04:41.270> not<00:04:41.540> a<00:04:41.570> special

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
can use that as well it's not a special

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.350 
can use that as well it's not a special
cartridge<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:43.490> you<00:04:43.550> can<00:04:43.760> see<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.150> this<00:04:44.300> area

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
cartridge so you can see that this area

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.780 
cartridge so you can see that this area
is<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.020> little<00:04:45.200> messy<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:45.980> got<00:04:46.160> some<00:04:46.460> toner

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
is a little messy and I got some toner

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.450 
is a little messy and I got some toner
on<00:04:47.120> my<00:04:47.330> hands<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.020> it's<00:04:48.440> easier<00:04:48.980> to<00:04:49.040> clean<00:04:49.430> up

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
on my hands so it's easier to clean up

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.360 
on my hands so it's easier to clean up
if<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:49.970> keep<00:04:50.240> like<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:51.140> know<00:04:51.370> designated

once you turn it on you'll want to print
out<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.620> test<00:05:37.130> sheet<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:37.700> you<00:05:38.660> do<00:05:38.810> that<00:05:38.990> by

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170
