00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.649 

now<00:00:00.980> very<00:00:01.250> often<00:00:01.460> in<00:00:01.699> summer<00:00:02.060> people<00:00:02.360> come

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:02.659 
now very often in summer people come

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:03.940 
now very often in summer people come
into<00:00:02.899> me<00:00:03.020> and<00:00:03.200> they<00:00:03.320> think<00:00:03.560> their<00:00:03.710> heaters

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
into me and they think their heaters

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.730 
into me and they think their heaters
don't<00:00:04.340> work<00:00:04.670> and<00:00:05.000> the<00:00:05.990> reason<00:00:06.259> why<00:00:06.380> they<00:00:06.529> think

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
don't work and the reason why they think

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.430 
don't work and the reason why they think
this<00:00:06.890> is<00:00:07.069> because<00:00:07.640> if<00:00:07.970> the<00:00:08.570> temperature<00:00:09.230> of

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
this is because if the temperature of

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.439 
this is because if the temperature of
the<00:00:09.709> aquarium<00:00:09.980> is<00:00:10.280> sitting<00:00:10.879> above<00:00:11.089> what<00:00:11.329> the

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:11.449 
the aquarium is sitting above what the

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.899 
the aquarium is sitting above what the
heater<00:00:11.659> is<00:00:11.869> set<00:00:12.530> at<00:00:12.709> then<00:00:13.249> the<00:00:13.429> heater<00:00:13.639> will

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:13.909 
heater is set at then the heater will

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.390 
heater is set at then the heater will
not<00:00:14.150> come<00:00:14.480> on<00:00:14.629> so<00:00:15.559> if<00:00:15.679> you<00:00:15.799> want<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.070> test<00:00:16.250> it

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
not come on so if you want to test it

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.609 
not come on so if you want to test it
it's<00:00:16.580> very<00:00:16.820> easy<00:00:16.939> you<00:00:17.480> just<00:00:17.779> take<00:00:18.109> the<00:00:18.320> heater

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
it's very easy you just take the heater

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.040 
it's very easy you just take the heater
out<00:00:18.980> of<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.310> water<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:19.880> you<00:00:20.419> get<00:00:20.539> yourself<00:00:20.929> a

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
out of the water and you get yourself a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.499 
out of the water and you get yourself a
thermometer<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:22.820> then<00:00:23.060> look<00:00:23.240> at<00:00:23.390> the

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
thermometer you then look at the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.570 
thermometer you then look at the
temperature<00:00:23.990> on<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.320> thermometer<00:00:24.349> and<00:00:24.980> it's

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
temperature on the thermometer and it's

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.069 
temperature on the thermometer and it's
easier<00:00:25.999> to<00:00:26.119> do<00:00:26.269> this<00:00:26.419> in<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.660> temperate

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
easier to do this in a temperate

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.829 
easier to do this in a temperate
environment<00:00:27.710> where<00:00:28.429> the<00:00:28.759> room<00:00:29.269> temperature

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
environment where the room temperature

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.659 
environment where the room temperature
of<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:30.380> room<00:00:30.560> or<00:00:30.829> when<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.220> room<00:00:31.400> temperature

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
of the room or when the room temperature

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.450 
of the room or when the room temperature
of<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.119> room<00:00:32.270> is<00:00:32.329> not<00:00:32.599> too<00:00:32.809> hot<00:00:33.190> then<00:00:34.190> you<00:00:34.309> look

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
of the room is not too hot then you look

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.950 
of the room is not too hot then you look
at<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.640> thermometer<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:35.120> say<00:00:35.329> let's<00:00:35.660> say<00:00:35.840> the

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
at the thermometer and say let's say the

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.369 
at the thermometer and say let's say the
thermometer<00:00:36.379> says<00:00:36.590> I'm<00:00:36.940> 26<00:00:37.940> degrees<00:00:38.359> you<00:00:39.140> then

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
thermometer says I'm 26 degrees you then

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.549 
thermometer says I'm 26 degrees you then
turn<00:00:39.770> up<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.730> dial<00:00:41.359> on<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:42.140> heater<00:00:43.070> until<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
turn up the dial on the heater until the

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.090 
turn up the dial on the heater until the
light<00:00:46.100> turns<00:00:46.519> on<00:00:47.170> because<00:00:48.170> if<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.649> heater<00:00:48.890> is

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
light turns on because if the heater is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.369 
light turns on because if the heater is
set<00:00:49.340> for<00:00:49.489> 25<00:00:49.879> degrees<00:00:50.300> which<00:00:50.539> is<00:00:50.570> standard<00:00:51.230> and

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
set for 25 degrees which is standard and

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.590 
set for 25 degrees which is standard and
your<00:00:51.980> aquarium<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.550> sitting<00:00:52.820> above<00:00:52.910> 25

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
your aquarium is sitting above 25

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.930 
your aquarium is sitting above 25
degrees<00:00:53.960> then<00:00:54.500> at<00:00:54.769> no<00:00:55.010> point<00:00:55.309> will<00:00:55.699> your

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
degrees then at no point will your

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.150 
degrees then at no point will your
heater<00:00:56.539> come<00:00:56.809> on

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
heater come on

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.279 
heater come on
so<00:00:58.160> therefore<00:00:58.399> if<00:00:58.910> you<00:00:59.390> take<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.989> out<00:01:00.109> of<00:01:00.230> the

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
so therefore if you take it out of the

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.110 
so therefore if you take it out of the
water<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:00.739> check<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.399> temp<00:01:01.609> ambient

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
water and check the temp ambient

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.420 
water and check the temp ambient
temperature<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.379> you<00:01:03.500> slowly<00:01:03.769> turn<00:01:04.220> up

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
temperature and then you slowly turn up

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.040 
temperature and then you slowly turn up
the<00:01:04.640> temperature<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.450> heater<00:01:05.660> is<00:01:05.810> set

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
the temperature that the heater is set

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.720 
the temperature that the heater is set
for<00:01:06.260> when<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.580> heater<00:01:08.410> feels<00:01:09.410> that<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.520> air

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
for when the heater feels that the air

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.630 
for when the heater feels that the air
temperature<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:11.540> less<00:01:12.380> than<00:01:12.830> what<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.430> heater

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
temperature is less than what the heater

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.270 
temperature is less than what the heater
is<00:01:13.820> now<00:01:14.060> set<00:01:14.330> for<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.380> heater<00:01:15.650> will<00:01:15.830> then<00:01:16.010> turn

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
is now set for the heater will then turn

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.240 
is now set for the heater will then turn
on<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.230> especially<00:01:18.230> with<00:01:18.560> your<00:01:18.800> cheaper

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
on and especially with your cheaper

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.940 
on and especially with your cheaper
brand<00:01:19.490> heaters<00:01:19.910> they<00:01:20.720> cannot<00:01:21.140> be<00:01:21.380> calibrated

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
brand heaters they cannot be calibrated

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.180 
brand heaters they cannot be calibrated
so<00:01:22.550> therefore<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.870> heater<00:01:24.080> might<00:01:24.320> say<00:01:24.620> that

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
so therefore the heater might say that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.510 
so therefore the heater might say that
it's<00:01:25.910> 26<00:01:26.420> degrees<00:01:26.720> but<00:01:27.530> your<00:01:27.710> thermometer<00:01:28.100> is

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
it's 26 degrees but your thermometer is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.250 
it's 26 degrees but your thermometer is
actually<00:01:28.970> reading<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.690> heat<00:01:29.840> is<00:01:29.870> coming

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
actually reading that the heat is coming

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.720 
actually reading that the heat is coming
on<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.530> off<00:01:30.620> at<00:01:30.830> 24<00:01:31.370> degrees

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
on and off at 24 degrees

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.820 
on and off at 24 degrees
that's<00:01:32.600> no<00:01:32.840> drama<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.440> just<00:01:33.590> got<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.800> know

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
that's no drama you just got to know

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.460 
that's no drama you just got to know
what<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.310> variance<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.690> if<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:36.050> turn<00:01:36.320> up

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
what the variance is so if you turn up

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.500 
what the variance is so if you turn up
your<00:01:36.650> heater<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.190> find<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:38.000> light

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
your heater and find that the light

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.730 
your heater and find that the light
clicks<00:01:38.840> on<00:01:39.020> at<00:01:40.900> 26<00:01:41.900> degrees<00:01:42.230> on<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.530> heater

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
clicks on at 26 degrees on the heater

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.490 
clicks on at 26 degrees on the heater
but<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.790> thermometer<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.360> saying<00:01:44.570> 24<00:01:45.170> degrees

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
but the thermometer is saying 24 degrees

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.460 
but the thermometer is saying 24 degrees
then<00:01:46.190> you<00:01:46.220> just<00:01:46.550> need<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.820> remember<00:01:47.150> that<00:01:47.540> your

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
then you just need to remember that your

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.160 
then you just need to remember that your
heater<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:50.150> calibration<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:50.810> your<00:01:50.870> heater<00:01:51.080> is

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
heater the calibration of your heater is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.930 
heater the calibration of your heater is
slightly<00:01:51.500> wrong<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:52.430> with<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.730> better

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
slightly wrong and with the better

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.120 
slightly wrong and with the better
quality<00:01:53.150> heaters<00:01:53.630> such<00:01:53.810> as<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.110> jaegers<00:01:54.530> they

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
quality heaters such as the jaegers they

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.480 
quality heaters such as the jaegers they
do<00:01:55.190> have<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.550> calibration<00:01:56.710> method<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.280> can

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
do have a calibration method so you can

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.600 
do have a calibration method so you can
calibrate<00:01:58.760> these<00:01:59.180> heaters<00:01:59.830> therefore<00:02:00.830> you

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
calibrate these heaters therefore you

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.310 
calibrate these heaters therefore you
can<00:02:01.790> make<00:02:01.970> sure<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.510> the<00:02:02.660> temperature<00:02:03.140> on

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
can make sure that the temperature on

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.440 
can make sure that the temperature on
the<00:02:03.350> heater<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:03.890> correct<00:02:04.280> with<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.120> cheaper

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
the heater is correct with the cheaper

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.630 
the heater is correct with the cheaper
ones<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.780> cannot<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.860> as<00:02:07.280> far<00:02:07.490> as

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
ones you cannot do that and as far as

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.209 
ones you cannot do that and as far as
I'm<00:02:07.790> concerned<00:02:08.209> it<00:02:08.420> doesn't<00:02:08.719> matter<00:02:09.079> all<00:02:09.859> that

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:10.219 
I'm concerned it doesn't matter all that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.160 
I'm concerned it doesn't matter all that
matters<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.640> me<00:02:10.819> is<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.510> my<00:02:11.870> temperature

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
matters to me is that my temperature

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.870 
matters to me is that my temperature
monitor<00:02:12.829> is<00:02:12.950> giving<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> correct

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
monitor is giving the correct

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.460 
monitor is giving the correct
reading<00:02:14.120> having<00:02:15.020> more<00:02:15.170> than<00:02:15.200> month

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
reading having more than month

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.470 
reading having more than month
thermometer<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.550> not<00:02:16.700> bad<00:02:16.970> thing<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.330> have<00:02:17.450> a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
thermometer is not bad thing to have a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.740 
thermometer is not bad thing to have a
reference<00:02:17.810> point<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:20.090> make<00:02:20.300> sure<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.690> I

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
reference point and to make sure that I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.410 
reference point and to make sure that I
know<00:02:20.930> what<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.400> heater<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.850> going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.270> keep

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
know what the heater is going to keep

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.140 
know what the heater is going to keep
the<00:02:23.570> aquarium<00:02:23.990> at<00:02:24.130> regardless<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the aquarium at regardless of the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.110 
the aquarium at regardless of the
setting<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.840> on<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.500> actual<00:02:27.800> heater<00:02:28.130> itself

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.860 

so<00:02:32.120> they're<00:02:32.270> very<00:02:32.300> easy<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:34.280> play<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.270> I

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
so they're very easy to play with and I

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.630 
so they're very easy to play with and I
usually<00:02:38.110> test<00:02:39.110> them<00:02:39.290> out<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.650> water<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.190> if

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
usually test them out of water and if

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.860 
usually test them out of water and if
you<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.850> feel<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.120> need<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.420> test<00:02:41.600> them<00:02:41.720> in

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
you do feel you need to test them in

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.440 
you do feel you need to test them in
water<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.380> easier<00:02:42.740> just<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.040> do<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.670> 10

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
water it's easier just to do it in a 10

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.170 
water it's easier just to do it in a 10
liter<00:02:44.570> bucket<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.050> water<00:02:45.610> so<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.640> slowly<00:02:47.030> turn

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
liter bucket of water so you slowly turn

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.390 
liter bucket of water so you slowly turn
them<00:02:47.510> up<00:02:47.630> until<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.020> see<00:02:48.230> what<00:02:48.500> temperature

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
them up until you see what temperature

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.670 
them up until you see what temperature
it<00:02:49.460> comes<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.850> at<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.380> if<00:02:51.380> you're<00:02:51.530> unhappy

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
it comes on at and if you're unhappy

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.770 
it comes on at and if you're unhappy
with<00:02:52.070> what<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.850> comes<00:02:53.060> on<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.360> your<00:02:53.480> best<00:02:53.630> to

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
with what it comes on it your best to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.730 
with what it comes on it your best to
either<00:02:54.020> bring<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.260> down<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> aquarium

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
either bring it down to the aquarium

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.580 
either bring it down to the aquarium
shop<00:02:55.120> because<00:02:56.120> over<00:02:56.510> time<00:02:56.540> they<00:02:56.840> can<00:02:56.900> fail<00:02:57.320> and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
shop because over time they can fail and

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.180 
shop because over time they can fail and
you<00:02:58.490> might<00:02:58.670> be<00:02:58.820> up<00:02:58.910> for<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.060> new<00:02:59.180> heater<00:02:59.420> and<00:03:00.190> it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
you might be up for a new heater and it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.090 
you might be up for a new heater and it
is<00:03:01.670> best<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.900> all<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.410> new<00:03:03.590> heaters<00:03:03.920> these

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
is best and all of the new heaters these

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.820 
is best and all of the new heaters these
age<00:03:04.310> they<00:03:04.610> should<00:03:04.640> fail<00:03:05.180> off<00:03:05.590> once<00:03:06.590> upon<00:03:06.770> a

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
age they should fail off once upon a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.220 
age they should fail off once upon a
time<00:03:06.890> here<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.340> is<00:03:07.460> just<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.760> fail<00:03:08.210> on<00:03:08.480> which

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
time here it is just a fail on which

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.750 
time here it is just a fail on which
means<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.710> often<00:03:09.920> take<00:03:10.070> out<00:03:10.220> your<00:03:10.340> fish<00:03:10.550> and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
means that often take out your fish and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.820 
means that often take out your fish and
cook<00:03:10.880> them<00:03:11.030> when<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:12.080> heater<00:03:12.260> fail<00:03:12.530> but<00:03:12.740> that

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
cook them when the heater fail but that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.430 
cook them when the heater fail but that
doesn't<00:03:13.100> really<00:03:13.220> happen<00:03:13.400> anymore<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.870> having

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
doesn't really happen anymore so having

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.520 
doesn't really happen anymore so having
a<00:03:15.530> new<00:03:15.710> heater<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.340> really<00:03:17.330> worth<00:03:17.540> really

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
a new heater is really worth really

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.100 
a new heater is really worth really
worth<00:03:18.830> it<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.300> if<00:03:20.300> you<00:03:20.390> have<00:03:20.540> large<00:03:20.780> fish

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
worth it and if you have large fish

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.560 
worth it and if you have large fish
having<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.470> non<00:03:21.650> breakable<00:03:22.160> heater<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.610> an<00:03:23.300> even

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
having a non breakable heater is an even

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.720 
having a non breakable heater is an even
better<00:03:23.810> idea<00:03:24.070> because<00:03:25.070> getting<00:03:25.400> yourself

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
better idea because getting yourself

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.000 
better idea because getting yourself
electrocuted<00:03:26.300> when<00:03:27.080> your<00:03:27.200> heater<00:03:27.380> smack<00:03:27.680> fish

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
electrocuted when your heater smack fish

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.250 
electrocuted when your heater smack fish
master<00:03:28.430> heater<00:03:28.610> is<00:03:28.820> really<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.180> nuisance<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.990> can

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
master heater is really a nuisance I can

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.330 
master heater is really a nuisance I can
tell<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.590> because<00:03:30.710> it's<00:03:30.980> happened<00:03:31.280> to

tell you that because it's happened to

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.810 
tell you that because it's happened to
