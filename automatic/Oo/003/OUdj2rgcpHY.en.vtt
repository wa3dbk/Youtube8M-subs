part of the confusion around stretching

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.960 
part of the confusion around stretching
it's<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.830> term<00:00:41.160> stretching<00:00:41.790> has

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
it's because the term stretching has

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.670 
it's because the term stretching has
been<00:00:42.090> used<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> describe<00:00:42.540> different<00:00:43.320> types<00:00:43.530> of

it<00:00:51.450> can<00:00:51.630> be<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> powerful<00:00:52.320> tool<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> help<00:00:52.950> you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
it can be a powerful tool to help you

stretching<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.430> moving<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.850> muscles<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
stretching is moving your muscles and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
stretching is moving your muscles and
joints<00:01:00.540> through<00:01:00.990> their<00:01:01.140> complete<00:01:01.590> range<00:01:02.040> of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
joints through their complete range of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.690 
joints through their complete range of
motion<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:02.790> there<00:01:03.240> are<00:01:03.300> two<00:01:03.540> main<00:01:03.780> types

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
motion and there are two main types

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.920 
motion and there are two main types
dynamic<00:01:05.700> activation<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.740> static<00:01:08.190> stretching

dynamic activation and static stretching
dynamic<00:01:09.930> activation<00:01:10.500> occurs<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> move

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
dynamic activation occurs when you move

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.490
