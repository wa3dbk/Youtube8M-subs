welcome

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.880 

so<00:00:43.570> this<00:00:44.570> is<00:00:44.750> kind<00:00:45.020> of<00:00:45.050> an<00:00:45.200> interesting<00:00:45.470> topic

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
so this is kind of an interesting topic

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.070 
so this is kind of an interesting topic
because<00:00:46.280> I<00:00:46.580> I'm<00:00:46.940> generally<00:00:47.480> one<00:00:47.690> talks<00:00:47.960> about

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
because I I'm generally one talks about

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.010 
because I I'm generally one talks about
this<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.380> lot<00:00:48.590> it's<00:00:49.210> stopping<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.450> spiral<00:00:50.870> and

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
this a lot it's stopping the spiral and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.660 
this a lot it's stopping the spiral and
by<00:00:51.320> spiral<00:00:51.710> what<00:00:51.830> we<00:00:51.920> mean<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.370> downward

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
by spiral what we mean the downward

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.900 
by spiral what we mean the downward
spiral<00:00:52.820> into<00:00:53.270> just<00:00:54.220> complete<00:00:55.220> other<00:00:55.370> like

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
spiral into just complete other like

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.850 
spiral into just complete other like
what<00:00:56.150> we<00:00:56.210> consider<00:00:56.510> failure<00:00:56.960> which<00:00:57.410> is<00:00:57.590> like

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
what we consider failure which is like

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.990 
what we consider failure which is like
binge<00:00:58.340> eating<00:00:59.260> now<00:01:00.260> exercising<00:01:00.500> enough<00:01:01.000> the

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
binge eating now exercising enough the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.970 
binge eating now exercising enough the
downward<00:01:02.180> spiral<00:01:02.600> that<00:01:03.140> happens<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.860> most

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
downward spiral that happens to most

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.080 
downward spiral that happens to most
people<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:05.510> me<00:01:05.660> as<00:01:05.810> well<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:07.070> how<00:01:08.030> do

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
people and to me as well in that how do

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.760 
people and to me as well in that how do
we<00:01:08.690> go<00:01:09.080> about<00:01:09.110> stopping<00:01:09.890> at<00:01:10.160> what<00:01:10.340> causes<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:10.820> I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
we go about stopping at what causes it I

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.200 
we go about stopping at what causes it I
don't<00:01:12.770> know<00:01:12.940> stopping<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.000> spiral<00:01:14.800> um<00:01:16.210> I'll

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
don't know stopping the spiral um I'll

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.580 
don't know stopping the spiral um I'll
take<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.420> different<00:01:17.570> approach<00:01:17.780> generally<00:01:18.470> like

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
take a different approach generally like

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.260 
take a different approach generally like
I<00:01:18.680> always<00:01:18.860> do<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.640> should<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:19.910> elicit

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
I always do you should to elicit

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.190 
I always do you should to elicit
conversation<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:22.220> i<00:01:22.960> want<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.020> tell<00:01:24.170> you

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
conversation and that i want to tell you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.920 
conversation and that i want to tell you
to<00:01:24.350> embrace<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.860> spiral<00:01:25.220> because<00:01:25.880> in<00:01:26.510> that

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
to embrace the spiral because in that

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.050 
to embrace the spiral because in that
spiral<00:01:27.500> when<00:01:27.710> we're<00:01:27.920> thinking<00:01:28.400> we're<00:01:28.790> failing

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
spiral when we're thinking we're failing

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.000 
spiral when we're thinking we're failing
is<00:01:29.360> when<00:01:29.990> we<00:01:30.110> really<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.530> learn<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.740> most

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
is when we really can learn the most

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.820 
is when we really can learn the most
about<00:01:31.250> who<00:01:31.580> we<00:01:31.760> really<00:01:31.970> are<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.440> what<00:01:33.440> makes

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
about who we really are and what makes

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.480 
about who we really are and what makes
us<00:01:34.070> weak<00:01:34.430> i<00:01:35.680> think<00:01:36.680> i<00:01:36.740> wrote<00:01:36.950> like<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.190> couple

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
us weak i think i wrote like a couple

days<00:01:37.610> ago<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.850> twitter<00:01:38.150> i'm<00:01:38.330> downward<00:01:38.750> spiral

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
days ago on twitter i'm downward spiral

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.660 
days ago on twitter i'm downward spiral
downward<00:01:39.470> spiral<00:01:39.950> which<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.310> maybe<00:01:40.490> where

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
downward spiral which is maybe where

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.290 
downward spiral which is maybe where
this<00:01:40.820> came<00:01:41.030> from<00:01:41.060> but

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.330 

it's<00:01:44.870> because<00:01:45.200> I'm<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:45.500> self<00:01:45.830> aware<00:01:46.100> of<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
it's because I'm so self aware of the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.680 
it's because I'm so self aware of the
fact<00:01:46.580> that<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:46.880> happening<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.330> me<00:01:47.420> because

fact that it's happening to me because

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.910 
fact that it's happening to me because
I've<00:01:47.840> been<00:01:47.870> doing<00:01:48.170> this<00:01:48.230> for<00:01:48.530> god<00:01:48.680> knows<00:01:48.860> how

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
I've been doing this for god knows how

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.270 
I've been doing this for god knows how
long<00:01:49.190> that's<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:50.180> know<00:01:50.450> my<00:01:50.900> triggers<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.010> what

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
long that's I know my triggers and what

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.610 
long that's I know my triggers and what
makes<00:01:52.790> me<00:01:53.000> go<00:01:53.090> into<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.420> spiral<00:01:53.660> my<00:01:54.110> spiral<00:01:54.380> is

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
makes me go into the spiral my spiral is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.850 
makes me go into the spiral my spiral is
depression<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.370> my<00:01:56.210> spiral<00:01:56.510> is<00:01:56.840> not<00:01:57.470> caring

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
depression and my spiral is not caring

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.240 
depression and my spiral is not caring
about<00:01:57.950> to<00:01:58.310> what<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.460> eat<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.620> I'll<00:02:00.620> go<00:02:00.740> on<00:02:00.770> for

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
about to what I eat and I'll go on for

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.830 
about to what I eat and I'll go on for
usually<00:02:01.910> a<00:02:02.060> couple<00:02:02.390> days<00:02:03.730> mostly<00:02:04.730> a<00:02:04.850> week<00:02:05.060> but

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
usually a couple days mostly a week but

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.280 
usually a couple days mostly a week but
then<00:02:06.050> it<00:02:06.590> generally<00:02:07.040> goes<00:02:07.190> away<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:07.990> use<00:02:08.990> my

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
then it generally goes away I use my

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.290 
then it generally goes away I use my
spirals<00:02:10.010> as<00:02:10.190> an<00:02:10.820> opportunity<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:13.150> give<00:02:14.150> myself

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
spirals as an opportunity to give myself

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.060 
spirals as an opportunity to give myself
a<00:02:14.540> break<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:15.680> learn<00:02:15.950> what's<00:02:16.220> wrong<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:18.500> get

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
a break to learn what's wrong and to get

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.059 
a break to learn what's wrong and to get
out<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.250> it

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
out of it

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.699 
out of it
people<00:02:21.819> who<00:02:21.969> are<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.239> spiral<00:02:22.569> who<00:02:23.499> know

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
people who are in a spiral who know

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.770 
people who are in a spiral who know
they're<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.040> spiral<00:02:24.310> but<00:02:24.969> then<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.329> obsess

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
they're in a spiral but then just obsess

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.809 
they're in a spiral but then just obsess
like<00:02:26.409> oh<00:02:26.590> my<00:02:26.739> god<00:02:26.889> I'm<00:02:27.040> failing<00:02:27.310> I'm<00:02:27.579> failing

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
like oh my god I'm failing I'm failing

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.280 
like oh my god I'm failing I'm failing
i'm<00:02:28.030> failing<00:02:28.349> will<00:02:29.349> continue<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.639> fail<00:02:31.290> over

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
and over and over again and it could go

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.979 
and over and over again and it could go
on<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.719> months<00:02:34.959> sometimes<00:02:35.859> a<00:02:36.129> year<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.989> speak
