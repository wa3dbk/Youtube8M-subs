 finally 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.320

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.880
 of the team gmt 94 and a bike that when 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.460
 even second in the world championship 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.100
 endurance of us your impressions 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.960
 because you got to say a biker 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.340
 ordinary quotation marks what does that 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.590
 it 's getting on a motorcycle 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.900
 like that so yes actually it's 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.400
 a real privilege I will thank you 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.930
 never enough the mutual bikers and 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.910
 christophe guillo for having realized my 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.820
 dream 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.460
 the impressions it's incredible 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.020
 like motorcycle it's just amazing it's 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.630
 rigid and at the same time very comfortable 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 very flexible we have no effort to do 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.130
 she really obeys the finger and the eye 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.259
 and the first impression of heaviness 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.240
 that we have starting disappearing as soon as 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.280
 we take a little speed and that's 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.680
 really just amazing it's nothing to see 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.210
 with the track bike that I have 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.890
 personally that I tried to 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.399
 prepare but finally it's really two 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.630
 different worlds 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.170
 I have a trustee 6 2 kawasaki in india and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.110
 2009 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.090
 I always wondered how a 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.070
 Real motorcycle racing behave by 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.500
 compared to what we prepare in 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.900
 recreation and it's really these two 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 completely different worlds are you 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.420
 have also discovered slick tires is 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.310
 what you felt 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.230
 something particular he his 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.700
 tires really put confidence in 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.930
 no time while there is still 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.630
 210 horses 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.239
 at no time does one feel like 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.320
 can lose the bike it's amazing 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.480
 braking as well as 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.459
 the acceleration is then now on 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.989
 will leave a little bit of a dean motorcycle or 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.660
 how did you get that chance that 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.250
 bring you like that rolled on 7 on this 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.239
 machine is fine as I said everything to 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.760
 the time I thank the mutual 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.900
 bikers since regularly playing I 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.200
 rolls in mutual open bikers is 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.440
 the last of the season 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.840
 October 9 there was the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.640
 christophe guyot's truck and 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.620
 christophe guyot suggested 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.350
 what is a person from the expert group 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.260
 can try the bike and he did a 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.569
 draw and I was for once 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.760
 the lucky ones and reminders or a whole 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.200
 little bit what are these open the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.750
 mutual agreement what does it consist of and 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.390
 how does it unfold the open of the 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.490
 mutual so it's the best 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.260
 way to start the track since for 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.959
 a completely affordable price especially 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.620

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.330
 euros the day 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.540
 we have the right to ride sessions 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.800
 six or seven depending on the circuit and one is 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.330
 accompanied all day by 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.709
 professional drivers like kenny foray 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.630
 who give us advice that we 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.510
 proposes to follow him and who makes us 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.510
 the debrief on on our position our 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.940
 our trajectories here they are on 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.250
 which circuit is those of roots and 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.910
 it's open bar is pretty much every 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.850
 circuits in France 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.480

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.750
 bresse 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.030
 and then the carole the squires kind of 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.489
 this kind of circuit is short or we 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.019
 lives in France we have a possibility 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.320
