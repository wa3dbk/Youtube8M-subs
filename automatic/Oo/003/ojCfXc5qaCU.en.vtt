00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.000

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.240
 liverpool it's not a team that 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.010
 I particularly like the fact that I do not 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.020
 know absolutely no player if I 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.330
 know some kind brief a messi 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.640
 I have sterling we roll brothers canvas 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.010
 woven big strikes already be normal 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.699
 always on a football game one breaks the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.949
 balls with a cross bar 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.180
 it's my goal it's my passion it's 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.979
 this is the soundbar this is the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.290
 white I love white under curfew 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.550
 marc artigau finally I say that we are not 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.960
 that the fifth minute the fact that they 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.379
 not demoralize too much complained 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.379
 what I think 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.710
 it says or short it's to break through at 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.030
 flew up the big hits from afar 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.420
 which is absolutely useless 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.860
 okay goodbye i can say 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.450
 like it's useless when de gaulle 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.010
 all this to do that the guy he says 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.750
 advance all that to make a page but 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.920

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.610
 earlier moment 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.640
 but like a big shit no but no 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.530
 there is no right 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.530
 they had the right to do that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.640
 1 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 years 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.770
 Milton brive the bed is the head 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.460

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.200
 noticed the guys penalty but yes it's 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.959
 the world wants to put what art 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.340
 half time but smg hall too raw 1 0 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.060

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.290
 I love it cauchon here that recovers as 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.330

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.400

 back as well as in a motion 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.060
 I refrained from saying it 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.460

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.560

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.960

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.440

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.000
