around the fight was about do all of it
like<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.180> lower<00:02:16.480> agent<00:02:16.810> will<00:02:16.960> will<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:19.380> small

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
like this lower agent will will a small

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.890 
like this lower agent will will a small
little<00:02:20.590> strip<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.100> LAN<00:02:21.400> party<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:23.560> there

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.330 

when<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.959> come<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.409> landing<00:02:29.769> slow<00:02:30.010> did

when you come in and landing slow did

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.069 
when you come in and landing slow did
the<00:02:30.640> other<00:02:30.849> ones<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:31.209> less<00:02:31.420> effective<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.019> if

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
the other ones get less effective so if

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.960
