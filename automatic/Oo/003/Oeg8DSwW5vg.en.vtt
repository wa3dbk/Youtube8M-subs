 0 scorer for the sg support country 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.810
 Now it's time for a coach to sedate 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.880
 blaring with the free kick the ball is coming 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.450
 deflected to marius helmer and the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.070
 shot of ergic does not come through 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.710
 also the shot of sneijder from 18 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.780
 meters then does not find the way into the gate 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.550
 the team of buseck ii and belong 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.590
 have to come up with something again 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.110
 to come into play perhaps with the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.420
 next error midfield of ripple 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.640
 julian keller is on e radici the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.220
 umpire pascal bible decides 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.220
 on eleven meters 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.810
 player coaches belong to themselves 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:47.170
 and hits the right lower corner to 1 1 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:49.030
 balancing the guests out must do now 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.070
 a better game of cellar plays 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.940
 Shining in the run of aerobic week 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.030

 he puts it over on the demi but that 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.200
 stumbles a huge chance for me 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.750
 This was followed by a very unsightly scene 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.280
 belong and dusts in the fight of the ball 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.860
 was long gone and stumble only opens 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.510
 you do not have enough of that 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.520
 slitters are still in the right direction 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.560
 The floor judge is the referee 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.970
 turns yellow and stoiber is lucky 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.910
 he was not sent early to take a shower 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.020
 becomes 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.220
 after the break, the homeowners caught 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.170
 a lightning start 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.360
 a minute after the reheat panty 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.310
 nyse defense and fabius tax exists 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.880
 again gold right and shoots the sg 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.880
 back in the lead 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.430
 this tries to stay tuned but finds 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.410
 Hardly Michel tries it out of the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.970
 distance and carrier parried shot 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.130
 the first by the bad lawn 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.610
 The guests were dangerous 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.320
 not up 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.450
 marcel büttner brings the flank on 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.690
 Aerobic but he forgives a good one again 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.220
 opportunity in the 90 minute still has 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.110
 once julian keller a huge chance 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.130
 to balance it should be today 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.260
 just do not be 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.390

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.230

 God lost to the game at the end 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.790
 by two individual mistakes the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.370
 again in the game also produced 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.630

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.670
 Impact was missing 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.739
