00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
gooey chocolaty mixture that we've got

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.920 
gooey chocolaty mixture that we've got
all<00:02:45.130> we<00:02:45.490> have<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> do<00:02:45.820> now<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.210> pour<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.780> into

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
all we have to do now is pour it into

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.120 
all we have to do now is pour it into
these<00:02:47.940> cupcake<00:02:48.940> aces<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.810> put<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.800> into<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
these cupcake aces and put it into the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.990 
these cupcake aces and put it into the
owl<00:02:51.960> ideally<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:53.260> would<00:02:53.860> suggest<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.700> you

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
owl ideally I would suggest that you

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.530 
owl ideally I would suggest that you
fill<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.420> only<00:02:55.840> 2/3<00:02:56.640> gives<00:02:57.640> some<00:02:57.910> space<00:02:58.209> for<00:02:58.420> it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
fill it only 2/3 gives some space for it

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.430 
fill it only 2/3 gives some space for it
to<00:02:58.690> rise<00:02:58.840> because<00:02:59.260> these<00:03:00.660> little<00:03:01.660> ones<00:03:02.110> will

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
to rise because these little ones will

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.330 
to rise because these little ones will
rise<00:03:02.770> nicely<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.900> pour<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.620> gently<00:03:06.130> inside

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
rise nicely so pour a gently inside

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.190 
rise nicely so pour a gently inside
about<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.730> much<00:03:10.000> should<00:03:10.300> do<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.720> think

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
about that much should do I think

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.160 
about that much should do I think
because<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.770> will<00:03:11.950> rise<00:03:12.130> nicely

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.289 

this<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.920> quantities<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.700> I've<00:03:18.819> told<00:03:19.030> you

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
this the quantities that I've told you

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.240 
this the quantities that I've told you
would<00:03:19.480> probably<00:03:20.019> make<00:03:20.290> around<00:03:20.709> twenty

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
would probably make around twenty

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.860 
would probably make around twenty
cupcakes<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.030> think<00:03:22.900> I'm<00:03:23.470> making<00:03:23.920> mini<00:03:24.310> ones<00:03:24.870> so

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
cupcakes I think I'm making mini ones so

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.250 
cupcakes I think I'm making mini ones so
I<00:03:25.900> probably<00:03:26.290> get<00:03:26.620> more<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:27.840> mean<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.989> can<00:03:29.230> make

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
I probably get more I mean you can make

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.680 
I probably get more I mean you can make
the<00:03:29.620> bigger<00:03:29.799> ones<00:03:30.069> as<00:03:30.250> well<00:03:33.269> there<00:03:34.269> we<00:03:34.420> are

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
the bigger ones as well there we are

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.960 
the bigger ones as well there we are
we<00:03:34.870> filled<00:03:35.170> up<00:03:35.260> our<00:03:35.500> lovely<00:03:35.920> cupcake<00:03:36.579> cases

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
we filled up our lovely cupcake cases

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.080 
we filled up our lovely cupcake cases
with<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.290> chocolate<00:03:38.500> mixture<00:03:39.040> now<00:03:39.879> all

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
with the the chocolate mixture now all

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.750 
with the the chocolate mixture now all
we<00:03:40.269> need<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.450> do<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:41.170> put<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:41.890> in<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.040> oven<00:03:42.250> for

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
we need to do is put it in the oven for

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.170 
we need to do is put it in the oven for
about<00:03:43.859> 17<00:03:44.859> minutes<00:03:45.099> because<00:03:45.430> these<00:03:45.730> are<00:03:45.909> small

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
about 17 minutes because these are small

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.589 
about 17 minutes because these are small
sizes<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.409> they<00:03:47.500> get<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.859> bit<00:03:48.069> faster

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
sizes so they get that a bit faster

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.819 
sizes so they get that a bit faster
preheated<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.629> oven<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:50.230> 180<00:03:50.829> degree<00:03:51.370> Celsius

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
preheated the oven to 180 degree Celsius

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.680 
preheated the oven to 180 degree Celsius
so<00:03:53.829> I'm<00:03:54.069> just<00:03:54.340> gonna<00:03:56.099> carefully<00:03:57.150> stick<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.450> in

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
so I'm just gonna carefully stick it in

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.670 
so I'm just gonna carefully stick it in
there<00:03:58.930> oh<00:04:00.810> can<00:04:01.810> we<00:04:01.840> steam<00:04:02.230> them<00:04:02.440> yeah<00:04:03.659> and<00:04:04.680> we

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
there oh can we steam them yeah and we

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.649 
there oh can we steam them yeah and we
can<00:04:05.950> forget<00:04:06.190> about<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.670> for<00:04:06.879> the<00:04:07.060> next<00:04:07.090> 15<00:04:07.540> to

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
can forget about it for the next 15 to

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.440 
can forget about it for the next 15 to
17<00:04:07.989> minutes<00:04:08.290> once<00:04:09.010> yeah<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:09.970> they<00:04:10.090> should<00:04:10.299> get

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
17 minutes once yeah so they should get

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.069 
17 minutes once yeah so they should get
done<00:04:10.659> in<00:04:10.810> about<00:04:10.900> 17<00:04:11.409> minutes<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:13.599> usual

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.259 
done in about 17 minutes the usual
toothpick<00:04:14.590> test<00:04:14.799> will<00:04:15.190> work<00:04:15.400> well<00:04:15.639> to<00:04:15.940> check

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
toothpick test will work well to check

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.110 
toothpick test will work well to check
if<00:04:16.449> they<00:04:16.600> are<00:04:16.630> down<00:04:16.810> or<00:04:16.989> not<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.760> if<00:04:18.940> they're

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
not you can just stick them in for

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.760 
not you can just stick them in for
another<00:04:20.919> couple<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.340> minutes<00:04:21.489> oh<00:04:25.320> look<00:04:26.320> the

beautiful they seem to be have done
perfectly<00:04:45.390> well<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:46.770> mean<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.400> saw<00:04:47.610> them<00:04:47.790> rise

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
perfectly well I mean you saw them rise

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.510 
perfectly well I mean you saw them rise
a<00:04:48.030> lot<00:04:48.480> in<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.810> oven<00:04:49.080> but<00:04:49.800> they<00:04:49.980> will<00:04:50.160> sort<00:04:50.460> of

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
a lot in the oven but they will sort of

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520 
a lot in the oven but they will sort of
settle<00:04:50.940> down<00:04:51.060> after<00:04:51.450> some<00:04:51.630> time<00:04:51.810> because<00:04:52.230> they

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
settle down after some time because they

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.230 
settle down after some time because they
won't<00:04:52.710> just<00:04:52.890> stay<00:04:53.280> resin<00:04:53.610> like<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:53.970> which<00:04:54.120> is

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
won't just stay resin like that which is

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.820 
won't just stay resin like that which is
ideal<00:04:54.660> when<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:55.710> want<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:55.950> ice<00:04:56.190> them<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.830> we're

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
ideal when you want to ice them so we're

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.410 
ideal when you want to ice them so we're
going<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.100> remove<00:04:59.310> our<00:04:59.490> cupcakes<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.300> leave

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.480 
going to remove our cupcakes and leave
them<00:05:00.660> aside<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:01.680> they<00:05:01.860> cool<00:05:02.250> down

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
them aside so that they cool down

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.870 
them aside so that they cool down
completely<00:05:02.790> they<00:05:03.600> need<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.900> be<00:05:04.550> really<00:05:05.550> cool

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
completely they need to be really cool

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.440 
completely they need to be really cool
before<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.540> can<00:05:06.840> ice<00:05:07.470> them<00:05:08.450> buttercream

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
before you can ice them buttercream

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.530 
before you can ice them buttercream
icing<00:05:09.630> cream<00:05:10.530> cheese<00:05:10.830> icing<00:05:11.330> would<00:05:12.330> work

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
icing cream cheese icing would work

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
really slowly because otherwise the

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.040 
really slowly because otherwise the
sugar<00:05:53.880> is<00:05:53.940> going<00:05:54.120> to<00:05:54.180> go<00:05:54.270> flying<00:05:54.510> all<00:05:54.720> over<00:05:54.750> the

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
sugar is going to go flying all over the

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.870 
sugar is going to go flying all over the
kitchen<00:05:55.770> like<00:05:56.010> it<00:05:56.130> was<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.370> first<00:05:56.550> time<00:05:56.760> I

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
kitchen like it was the first time I

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.290 
kitchen like it was the first time I
made<00:05:57.030> it<00:05:57.500> so<00:05:59.450> this<00:06:00.450> is<00:06:00.750> nicely<00:06:01.140> and<00:06:01.970> let<00:06:02.970> add<00:06:03.240> a

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
made it so this is nicely and let add a

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:17.620 
made it so this is nicely and let add a
few<00:06:03.900> few<00:06:04.620> few<00:06:04.650> few<00:06:04.980> bits<00:06:05.520> of<00:06:05.640> sugar<00:06:05.970> at<00:06:06.090> a<00:06:06.120> time

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.140
