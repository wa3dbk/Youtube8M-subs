00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:33.670
 novorosii almost directly about it

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.870
 insufficient action Razi 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.079
 I was not disappointed that Russia is not 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.920
 applied military force and this 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.140
 disappointment in my opinion encourages 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.480
 disappointment and in Russian ult 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.450
 they didnâ€™t want to noticeably 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.030
 most many marriages wanted more 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:02.540
 new wins this first because it is 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.079
 will be paul ii secondly and if all the same 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.700
 you yourself said that here the doctrine that 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:15.579
 President and the right is not all the same 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:23.779
 there will be no Ukrainian army just 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:25.969
 beautiful she has been fighting for several months 

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:29.299
 recruited some experience which 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:32.090
 never had she got to some 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:37.880
 material technical support 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.799
 West side what she can nothing 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.289
 get some material support 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.630
 Well, why say things that 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.159
 absolute nonsense they have technology 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.740
 Soviet Soviet 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.909
 they didn't get to the soviet technology 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 nothing west ear how do you think pasta 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.349
 maybe they cover but for now 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.020
 Replaceable one well let's say 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.810
 something happens first it 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.999
 disappointment first you can 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.279
 compete who is more disappointed 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.240
 and the same can say 

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:12.850
 Russian 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.470
 comrades of the hero of the south-east of Ukraine 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.730
 the company and am living Kharkiv prohlopali 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.360
 so that other areas would not take and why 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.840
 you people today are missing two areas 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.290
 7 million miners are silent, I do not speak 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.300
 about miners 7 million people can 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.050
 expose more combat-ready raven 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.050
 strength than nick 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.840
 that is, in disappointment 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.580
 she depending on what is waiting 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.350
 rank 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.790
 Putin acts as far as he understands 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.330
 as far as he can according to interests 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.030
 Russia and Ukraine 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.040
 having the east of Ukraine or whether or 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.230
 other political and kind 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.070
 active in Ukraine who believes that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.250
 he knows better that he needs Putin 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.630
 president of russia and ukraine not 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.540
 southeastern Ukraine here tactics that 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.790
 he chose his point of view she told him 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.580
 seems like the best it will be 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.280
 effectively and me this we will see whenever 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:26.280
 the results will be definitive they for now 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.800
 not definitive causes someone this 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.530
 bewilderment or disappointment why up 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.450
 so far 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.490
 Russian tanks do not stand on the shore 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.410
 Dnieper and Moldavian well, so it is them 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.150
 the problem is no one promised them that 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.340
 it will be a possible option if 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.980
 the president of russia will come to him 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.720
 the conclusion that it is necessary for him 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.510
 opinion for the interests of Russia no one and 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.120
 never in one country of the world 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.920
 acted in the interest of another 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.670
 states only in their own if they 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.420
 accordingly therefore since 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.550
 comrades from the south-east of Ukraine were 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.870
 less effective than they could be 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.989
 what was expected of them 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.609
 so let them be content now 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.850
 what are they capable of 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.979
 not holy believing that someone is behind her 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.560
 solve problems they don't even 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.260
 could 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.490
 Ashley if only today under their power was 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.310
 two more areas 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.060
 The situation would be different yah so and I 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.100
 so let on 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.889
 they must answer this question themselves 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.690
 yourself or they are not wealthy or at all 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.980
 the desire of the population of these areas 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.600
 do something for your change 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.930
 their position that they are not 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:57.340
 satisfies below that norm which from 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:59.810
 they are required regarding the issue 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.660
 Russian army can occupy 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.240
 Ukraine in a few hours in two days 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.639
 basic on the main physical points 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.770
 Soviet of course almost without any 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.150
 resistance 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.200
 all this talk about partisan 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.150
 movement 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.610
 these are people who do not know and do not understand 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.660
 what they say no partisan 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.790
 movement without outside support well so in 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.200
 during the week these or other gangsters will 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.970
 run and well so on to mints and everything will be 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.870
 quiet don't forget that half 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:36.669
 population of Ukraine against the current 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.110
 politicians and the last thing I want to say 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.390
 evaluating the current situation possible 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.740
 amount development 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.630
 possible developments may be 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.360
 continuation of negotiations transition 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.950
 negotiations in the new stage and the present 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:56.800
 of negotiations between Kiev and southeast 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:06:00.139
 about the main problems of Ukraine or 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.960
 slow quiet russia care and elimination 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.410
 we wash our hands well what do I want 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.200
 noticed all the forecasts 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:12.669
 terrible terrible about what happens in 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.120
 Crimea and happen in the Crimea were 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:19.100
 unreal Crimea today is the most calm 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.540
 territory of the former Ukraine 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:28.180
 and there are no those excesses about 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:34.280
 which scared and terrible sanctions of the West 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:38.930
 on Russia give Crimea back while 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:43.610
 No, they are not applying Well, we will 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:48.650
 hope that the booming labor grind 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:51.260
 today's dangers and who are those on 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:55.460
 it is hoping for advice to see what 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:59.990
 going on in iraq is also the same reasonable 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:02.660
 also reasonable and time to overthrow 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:06.850
 steady power dispersion 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:10.940
 state times inciting religious 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:14.630
 national feud loss real 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.180
 authorities and then national nuance because 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:20.030
 its done so much nonsense i hope 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.360
 that Ukraine will manage and Director 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.010
 did stupid things in iraq now they 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.640
 try to play their game on 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.210
 Ukraine 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:32.000
 the same people by the same ones already 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.730
