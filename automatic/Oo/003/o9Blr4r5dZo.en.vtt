redemption<00:03:54.030> for<00:03:55.190> dark<00:03:56.190> angel<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:56.760> again<00:03:57.150> it

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
redemption for dark angel so again it

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.479 
redemption for dark angel so again it
comes<00:03:57.900> with<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.200> instruction<00:03:58.680> manual<00:03:58.709> which

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
comes with the instruction manual which

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.729 
comes with the instruction manual which
is<00:03:59.730> not<00:03:59.940> 40k<00:04:00.510> legal<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.109> way<00:04:01.380> too<00:04:01.410> big<00:04:03.739> but

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
is not 40k legal this is way too big but

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.550 
is not 40k legal this is way too big but
it's<00:04:04.950> got<00:04:05.100> lots<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.519> different<00:04:05.760> options<00:04:06.239> for

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
it's got lots of different options for

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.309 
it's got lots of different options for
it<00:04:07.560> as<00:04:07.680> well<00:04:07.920> in<00:04:08.450> multiple<00:04:09.450> languages<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.079> each

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
it as well in multiple languages so each

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.660 
it as well in multiple languages so each
one<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.530> these<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> different

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
one of these is it like a different

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.270 
one of these is it like a different
thing<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.030> guess<00:04:12.560> when<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.590> comes<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.920> gameplay

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
thing I guess when it comes to gameplay

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.259 
thing I guess when it comes to gameplay
so<00:04:14.579> let's<00:04:15.180> take<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.329> look<00:04:15.510> at<00:04:15.600> this

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
so let's take a look at this

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.069 
so let's take a look at this
here<00:04:16.660> all<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.349> bags<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.919> year's<00:04:19.079> turret

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
here all the bags this year's turret

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.920 
here all the bags this year's turret
bitch<00:04:20.819> they've<00:04:21.819> got<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.120> couple<00:04:22.419> things<00:04:22.780> out

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
bitch they've got a couple things out

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.439 
bitch they've got a couple things out
different<00:04:23.680> things<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.870> got<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.990> big<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:27.669> guess

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
different things and got the big I guess

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.689 
different things and got the big I guess
press<00:04:28.900> molded<00:04:29.349> you<00:04:29.830> can<00:04:29.979> make<00:04:30.099> it<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.310> lasers

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
press molded you can make it the lasers

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.070 
press molded you can make it the lasers
or<00:04:30.909> you<00:04:30.970> can<00:04:31.120> make<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.389> defense<00:04:31.720> turret

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
or you can make it the defense turret

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.240 
or you can make it the defense turret
itself<00:04:32.819> there<00:04:33.819> and<00:04:34.569> here's<00:04:35.020> your<00:04:35.169> here's<00:04:36.099> your

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
itself there and here's your here's your

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.339 
itself there and here's your here's your
turret<00:04:36.639> piece<00:04:36.849> kind<00:04:37.599> of<00:04:37.659> locks<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:38.080> there<00:04:38.199> and

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
turret piece kind of locks in there and

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:39.869 
turret piece kind of locks in there and
you<00:04:38.530> just<00:04:38.560> decide<00:04:39.009> I<00:04:39.039> guess<00:04:39.310> whatever<00:04:39.550> you're

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
you just decide I guess whatever you're

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.580 
you just decide I guess whatever you're
going<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.060> whatever<00:04:40.810> pieces<00:04:41.169> you're<00:04:41.409> going<00:04:41.530> to

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
going to whatever pieces you're going to

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.350 
going to whatever pieces you're going to
put<00:04:41.740> on<00:04:41.860> they're<00:04:42.069> not<00:04:42.520> interesting<00:04:42.909> enough<00:04:43.090> it

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
put on they're not interesting enough it

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.839 
put on they're not interesting enough it
looks<00:04:43.419> like<00:04:43.780> it's<00:04:44.169> fairly<00:04:44.409> symmetrical<00:04:45.129> so<00:04:45.400> if

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
looks like it's fairly symmetrical so if

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.279 
looks like it's fairly symmetrical so if
you<00:04:45.970> get<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.300> these<00:04:46.479> things<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:47.080> know<00:04:47.139> they

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
you get to these things you know they

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.110 
you get to these things you know they
can<00:04:47.440> kind<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.710> kind<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.400> lock<00:04:48.550> together<00:04:48.759> there

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
can kind of kind of lock together there

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.550 
can kind of kind of lock together there
so<00:04:49.330> those<00:04:49.509> that<00:04:49.870> was<00:04:49.960> kind<00:04:50.139> of<00:04:50.169> cool<00:04:50.229> to<00:04:50.349> see

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
so those that was kind of cool to see

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.920 
so those that was kind of cool to see
homie<00:04:50.740> i<00:04:50.860> don't<00:04:51.130> i'm<00:04:51.970> not<00:04:52.180> sure<00:04:52.659> what<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.900> make

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
homie i don't i'm not sure what to make

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.550 
homie i don't i'm not sure what to make
of<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.259> either<00:04:53.409> way<00:04:53.650> as<00:04:53.800> far<00:04:54.009> as<00:04:54.099> I<00:04:55.349> who<00:04:56.349> knows

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
of it either way as far as I who knows

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.550 
of it either way as far as I who knows
so<00:04:57.490> then<00:04:57.669> it's<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.030> idea<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:59.199> know<00:04:59.380> this<00:04:59.530> is

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
so then it's the idea you know this is

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.899 
so then it's the idea you know this is
just<00:04:59.830> normal<00:05:00.009> stuff<00:05:00.280> but<00:05:00.550> just<00:05:00.699> looks<00:05:00.880> like

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
just normal stuff but just looks like

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.700 
just normal stuff but just looks like
it's<00:05:01.120> clipped<00:05:01.360> off<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.659> sprue<00:05:01.930> like<00:05:02.199> and<00:05:02.440> put

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
it's clipped off the sprue like and put

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.580 
it's clipped off the sprue like and put
it<00:05:02.770> in<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:02.889> bag<00:05:03.069> so<00:05:04.030> there's<00:05:04.210> your<00:05:04.300> your<00:05:05.229> defense

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
it in a bag so there's your your defense

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.070 
it in a bag so there's your your defense
line<00:05:05.830> kind<00:05:06.159> of<00:05:06.280> walls<00:05:06.599> then<00:05:07.599> you<00:05:07.719> got<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:07.870> couple

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
line kind of walls then you got a couple

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.749 
line kind of walls then you got a couple
you<00:05:08.500> know<00:05:08.590> different<00:05:08.830> pieces<00:05:09.190> that<00:05:09.490> are<00:05:09.550> just

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
you know different pieces that are just

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.490 
you know different pieces that are just
basically<00:05:10.150> like<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.690> door<00:05:11.080> on<00:05:11.199> the<00:05:11.500> front

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
basically like a door on the front

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.480 
basically like a door on the front
bought<00:05:14.500> your<00:05:14.680> seeds<00:05:14.889> and<00:05:15.099> things<00:05:15.310> like<00:05:15.430> that

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
bought your seeds and things like that

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.360 
bought your seeds and things like that
here's<00:05:16.300> yeah<00:05:16.750> here's<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.319> larger<00:05:17.740> pieces<00:05:17.949> for

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
here's yeah here's the larger pieces for

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.200 
here's yeah here's the larger pieces for
the<00:05:18.400> turret<00:05:18.759> itself<00:05:20.460> just<00:05:21.460> give<00:05:21.699> me<00:05:21.729> an<00:05:21.849> idea

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
the turret itself just give me an idea

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.170 
the turret itself just give me an idea
try<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:22.930> large<00:05:23.199> scale<00:05:23.789> and<00:05:24.789> then<00:05:24.909> here's<00:05:25.120> the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
try the large scale and then here's the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.089 
try the large scale and then here's the
buttresses<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.930> Gothic<00:05:26.289> buttresses<00:05:26.830> that<00:05:27.009> we

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
buttresses the Gothic buttresses that we

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.999 
buttresses the Gothic buttresses that we
all<00:05:27.190> know<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.430> love<00:05:27.960> so<00:05:28.960> very<00:05:29.259> interesting<00:05:29.889> to

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
all know and love so very interesting to

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.510 
all know and love so very interesting to
see<00:05:30.190> this<00:05:30.759> coming<00:05:31.180> all<00:05:31.949> flipped<00:05:32.949> off<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.219> bag

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
see this coming all flipped off the bag

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.309 
see this coming all flipped off the bag
and<00:05:33.789> things<00:05:34.029> like<00:05:34.210> that<00:05:34.270> I'm<00:05:34.810> not<00:05:35.020> really<00:05:35.229> sure

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
and things like that I'm not really sure

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.649 
and things like that I'm not really sure
what<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.710> make<00:05:35.740> of<00:05:35.889> that<00:05:36.130> but<00:05:36.419> maybe<00:05:37.419> that's

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
what to make of that but maybe that's

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:38.820 
what to make of that but maybe that's
how<00:05:37.810> we're<00:05:37.960> going<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.110> see<00:05:38.259> these<00:05:38.380> though<00:05:38.560> gets

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
how we're going to see these though gets

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.140 
how we're going to see these though gets
in<00:05:39.009> in<00:05:39.099> your<00:05:39.219> future<00:05:39.370> because<00:05:39.699> they<00:05:39.789> just<00:05:40.000> you

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
in in your future because they just you

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.640 
in in your future because they just you
know<00:05:40.180> maybe<00:05:40.630> they're<00:05:40.779> just<00:05:40.900> not<00:05:41.110> not<00:05:41.380> enough

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
know maybe they're just not not enough
