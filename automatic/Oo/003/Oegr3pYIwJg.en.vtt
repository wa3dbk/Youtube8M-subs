00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
parts of the power twister I was very

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.650 
parts of the power twister I was very
proud<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.900> myself<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:34.280> gotten<00:02:35.180> hit<00:02:35.269> up<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.510> like

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
proud of myself I gotten hit up to like

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.890 
proud of myself I gotten hit up to like
50<00:02:36.019> repetitions<00:02:37.030> on<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.330> power<00:02:38.480> twister<00:02:38.810> and

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
50 repetitions on the power twister and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.690 
50 repetitions on the power twister and
it's<00:02:39.049> like<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.440> super<00:02:39.860> heavy-duty<00:02:40.130> one<00:02:40.430> even

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
it's like the super heavy-duty one even

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.740 
it's like the super heavy-duty one even
though<00:02:40.760> his<00:02:40.880> was<00:02:41.090> actually<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.420> little<00:02:41.540> bit

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
though his was actually a little bit

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.090 
though his was actually a little bit
more<00:02:41.959> heavy<00:02:42.170> duty<00:02:42.260> than<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.739> I<00:02:42.890> don't<00:02:43.040> know

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
more heavy duty than that I don't know

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.350 
more heavy duty than that I don't know
where<00:02:43.250> he<00:02:43.310> got<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.459> from<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.730> couldn't<00:02:44.060> find<00:02:44.209> one

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
where he got it from I couldn't find one

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.589 
where he got it from I couldn't find one
more<00:02:44.540> more<00:02:45.380> difficult<00:02:45.799> but<00:02:46.450> know<00:02:47.450> what<00:02:47.540> i

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
more more difficult but know what i

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.080 
more more difficult but know what i
thought<00:02:47.780> was<00:02:47.900> definitely<00:02:48.549> good<00:02:49.549> enough<00:02:49.610> that

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
thought was definitely good enough that

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.910 
thought was definitely good enough that
i<00:02:50.359> was<00:02:51.019> able<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:52.359> pop<00:02:53.359> out<00:02:53.570> more<00:02:53.750> reps<00:02:54.019> than<00:02:54.620> he

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
i was able to pop out more reps than he

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.110 
i was able to pop out more reps than he
could<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:56.299> also<00:02:57.200> improved<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:58.120> push-ups

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
could so I also improved in push-ups

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.720 
could so I also improved in push-ups
test<00:03:00.010> even<00:03:01.010> though<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.130> haven't<00:03:01.400> been<00:03:01.609> keeping

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
test even though I haven't been keeping

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.289 
test even though I haven't been keeping
it<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> hundred<00:03:02.480> push-ups<00:03:02.660> challenge<00:03:03.290> I

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
it with a hundred push-ups challenge I

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.870 
it with a hundred push-ups challenge I
know<00:03:05.299> I<00:03:05.840> should<00:03:06.170> man<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:07.160> been<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.489> long<00:03:07.549> I

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
know I should man it's been so long I

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.060 
know I should man it's been so long I
should<00:03:07.910> like<00:03:08.299> probably<00:03:08.540> do<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> little<00:03:09.109> little

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
should like probably do a little little

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.520 
should like probably do a little little
push<00:03:10.280> ups<00:03:10.600> for<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.720> guys<00:03:11.870> just<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.200> see<00:03:12.440> if

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.770 
reference me oh yeah i'm moving by the
way<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.799> it's<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.310> lot<00:03:16.430> more<00:03:16.489> intuitive<00:03:17.030> in<00:03:17.450> here

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
way so it's a lot more intuitive in here

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.150 
way so it's a lot more intuitive in here
the<00:03:17.930> most<00:03:18.140> I'm<00:03:18.350> this<00:03:18.530> will<00:03:18.680> be<00:03:18.799> in<00:03:18.890> my<00:03:18.980> last

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
the most I'm this will be in my last

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:28.830 
the most I'm this will be in my last
video<00:03:19.340> from<00:03:19.790> in<00:03:20.540> my<00:03:20.810> room<00:03:20.959> here

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.289 

alright<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.739> here<00:03:30.860> we<00:03:30.920> go<00:03:30.950> random<00:03:31.700> how<00:03:32.150> many

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
alright so here we go random how many

00:03:32.299 --> 00:04:14.510 
alright so here we go random how many
pushups<00:03:32.450> can<00:03:32.659> I<00:03:32.810> do

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:23.820 

Oh

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.339 

not<00:04:32.210> that<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.419> probably<00:04:32.660> would<00:04:32.900> have<00:04:32.990> done<00:04:33.139> more

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
not that I probably would have done more

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:43.629 
not that I probably would have done more
if<00:04:33.500> he<00:04:33.590> hadn't<00:04:33.889> gotten<00:04:34.099> in<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.310> way<00:04:42.370> all<00:04:43.370> right

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
if he hadn't gotten in the way all right

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.960 
if he hadn't gotten in the way all right
so<00:04:43.940> not<00:04:44.090> in<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.240> sub<00:04:44.560> 40<00:04:45.849> actually<00:04:46.849> don't

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
so not in the sub 40 actually don't

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.270 
so not in the sub 40 actually don't
