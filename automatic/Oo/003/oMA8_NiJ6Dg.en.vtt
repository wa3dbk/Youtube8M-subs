charisma<00:00:28.029> s1<00:00:28.810> I've<00:00:29.169> already<00:00:29.890> shown<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.279> in<00:00:30.640> a

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
charisma s1 I've already shown it in a

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.110 
charisma s1 I've already shown it in a
video<00:00:30.910> in<00:00:31.570> action<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:32.829> can<00:00:33.219> see<00:00:33.460> it<00:00:33.520> only

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
video in action so you can see it only

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.959 
video in action so you can see it only
in<00:00:34.719> German<00:00:35.260> but<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.559> think<00:00:36.219> the<00:00:36.790> material

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
in German but I think the material

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.869 
in German but I think the material
speaks<00:00:37.660> for<00:00:37.960> itself<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.710> here<00:00:39.430> two<00:00:39.640> very

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
speaks for itself and here two very

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.090 
speaks for itself and here two very
similar

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
similar

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.610

Calvillo<00:00:44.190> Daphna<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:46.030> only<00:00:46.750> difference<00:00:47.350> I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
Calvillo Daphna the only difference I

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.050 
Calvillo Daphna the only difference I
see<00:00:47.710> is<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.880> blue<00:00:49.450> unit<00:00:50.230> as<00:00:50.620> well<00:00:51.310> as<00:00:51.370> here<00:00:51.820> the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
see is the blue unit as well as here the

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.930 
see is the blue unit as well as here the
knobs<00:00:52.300> are<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.960> bit<00:00:53.260> different<00:00:53.770> but<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.550> rest

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
knobs are a bit different but the rest

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.440 
knobs are a bit different but the rest
is<00:00:55.360> more<00:00:56.020> or<00:00:56.260> less<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:56.710> same<00:00:56.970> except<00:00:57.970> here<00:00:58.239> the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
is more or less the same except here the

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.100 
is more or less the same except here the
railing<00:00:58.840> is<00:00:58.870> missing<00:00:59.530> but<00:01:00.870> everything<00:01:01.870> else

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
railing is missing but everything else

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.840 
railing is missing but everything else
is<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.950> same

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
is the same

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.649 
is the same
so<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.149> can<00:01:04.509> ask<00:01:04.750> why<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.549> holy<00:01:07.180> is<00:01:07.390> that

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
so you can ask why the holy is that

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.190 
so you can ask why the holy is that
the<00:01:07.869> same<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:09.250> quite<00:01:09.579> easy<00:01:09.850> because<00:01:10.299> if<00:01:10.990> I

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
the same that's quite easy because if I

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.639 
the same that's quite easy because if I
am<00:01:11.469> as<00:01:11.680> well<00:01:12.070> as<00:01:12.250> Cassity<00:01:12.939> or<00:01:13.149> as<00:01:13.869> well<00:01:14.290> as

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
am as well as Cassity or as well as

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
producing of course in a similar way so

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.069 
producing of course in a similar way so
they're<00:01:24.100> produced<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.909> concept<00:01:25.359> you<00:01:25.539> Daphna

expensive than the one from Casa do and

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.669 
expensive than the one from Casa do and
also<00:01:37.630> 5<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.679> more<00:01:39.060> yeah<00:01:40.060> let's<00:01:40.359> say<00:01:40.600> a
