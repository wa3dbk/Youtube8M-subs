00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
you begin to paint your area your

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.190 
you begin to paint your area your
surface<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:47.000> going<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.269> roll<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.750> product

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
surface it's going to roll that product

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.740 
surface it's going to roll that product
off<00:02:48.349> pretty<00:02:48.650> quick<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.549> what<00:02:50.030> happens<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
off pretty quick and what happens is the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.170 
off pretty quick and what happens is the
inside<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.290> your<00:02:51.620> roller<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.130> still<00:02:52.430> dry<00:02:52.790> and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
inside of your roller is still dry and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.710 
inside of your roller is still dry and
so<00:02:53.989> you're<00:02:54.230> going<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.440> get<00:02:54.620> those<00:02:54.879> lines<00:02:55.879> those

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
so you're going to get those lines those

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.020 
so you're going to get those lines those
those<00:02:57.110> dry<00:02:57.500> looking<00:02:57.860> lines<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.790> lot<00:02:58.819> of

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
those dry looking lines and a lot of

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.080 
those dry looking lines and a lot of
times<00:02:59.209> those<00:02:59.450> aren't<00:02:59.690> noticeable<00:03:00.260> until<00:03:01.090> the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
times those aren't noticeable until the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.390 
times those aren't noticeable until the
paint<00:03:02.420> or<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:02.840> clear<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.290> dry<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.950> it's

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
paint or the clear is dry and it's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.729 
paint or the clear is dry and it's
really<00:03:04.910> really<00:03:05.060> hard<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.810> recover<00:03:06.260> from<00:03:06.500> those

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.020 
really really hard to recover from those
once<00:03:07.549> they're<00:03:07.849> there<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.620> lot<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.730> people

that have emailed me and they tried it

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.300 
that have emailed me and they tried it
and<00:03:13.730> they<00:03:13.879> just<00:03:14.060> give<00:03:14.299> up<00:03:14.440> because<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.859> is

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
and they just give up because it is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
about this for a second you want to get

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.039 
about this for a second you want to get
a<00:03:43.250> frame<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.880> that's<00:03:44.120> really<00:03:44.450> good<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:44.780> solid

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
a frame to that's really good and solid

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.180 
a frame to that's really good and solid
but<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:46.130> know<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.419> way<00:03:47.680> because<00:03:48.680> as<00:03:48.889> you're

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
but you know this way because as you're

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.210 
but you know this way because as you're
applying<00:03:49.519> your<00:03:50.150> finish<00:03:50.690> you<00:03:51.470> want<00:03:51.650> this<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:52.069> be

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
applying your finish you want this to be

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.879 
applying your finish you want this to be
good<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.760> sturdy<00:03:53.030> or<00:03:53.359> else<00:03:53.660> one<00:03:54.230> side<00:03:54.500> is

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
good and sturdy or else one side is

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.289 
good and sturdy or else one side is
going<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.280> get<00:03:55.519> more<00:03:55.730> pressure<00:03:55.970> than<00:03:56.239> the

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
going to get more pressure than the

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.819 
going to get more pressure than the
other<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.870> it's<00:03:57.200> going<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.410> give<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.709> an

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
other and it's going to give you an

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.250 
other and it's going to give you an
uneven<00:03:58.280> finish<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:59.209> it<00:03:59.329> may<00:03:59.480> cost<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.930> buck

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
uneven finish so it may cost you a buck

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.860 
uneven finish so it may cost you a buck
more<00:04:00.530> but<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:00.859> promise<00:04:01.370> it's<00:04:01.549> worth<00:04:01.609> it<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.150> you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870
