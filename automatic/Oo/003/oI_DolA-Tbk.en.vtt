like one level design classes our first

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.319 
like one level design classes our first
game<00:00:40.230> class<00:00:40.559> ever<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.640> started<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.120> game

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
game class ever and we started this game

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.560

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
yet when we had just started it because

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
yet when we had just started it because
we<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.579> made<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.000> level<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.750> turned<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
we just made one level and we turned it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.840

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
grew over several months but what mostly

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.670 
grew over several months but what mostly
inspired<00:01:02.640> us<00:01:03.090> were<00:01:03.329> games<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.470> Zelda

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
have have said hey that looks a bit like

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.039 
have have said hey that looks a bit like
you<00:01:11.189> know<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> puzzle<00:01:11.820> adventure<00:01:12.150> aspect

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you know at the puzzle adventure aspect

well<00:01:16.369> that<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.670> puzzle<00:01:18.030> design<00:01:18.210> with

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
well that kind of puzzle design with

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.289 
well that kind of puzzle design with
where<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.619> too<00:01:19.860> difficult<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
where it's it's not too difficult to to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.030 
where it's it's not too difficult to to
kind<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> solve<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> same<00:01:22.530> time<00:01:22.770> like

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
kind of solve but at the same time like

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I got to figure out like how our whole

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
I got to figure out like how our whole
Kickstarter<00:01:42.630> page<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> look<00:01:43.560> like

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
Kickstarter page was going to look like

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.210 
Kickstarter page was going to look like
and<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.790> had<00:01:45.689> fun<00:01:45.899> doing<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.770> graphics

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and then I had fun doing the graphics

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.550 
and then I had fun doing the graphics
and<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.729> think<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.540> soon<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.200> started

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and then I think as soon as it started

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.260 
and then I think as soon as it started

something that people cared about so i

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.249 
something that people cared about so i
think<00:02:04.979> i<00:02:05.399> think<00:02:05.640> doing<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.210> crowdfunding<00:02:06.840> if

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
think i think doing the crowdfunding if

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.980 
think i think doing the crowdfunding if
nothing<00:02:07.649> else<00:02:07.829> i<00:02:08.069> mean<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> made<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
nothing else i mean it made it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.570 
nothing else i mean it made it
made<00:02:09.290> it<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.560> we<00:02:09.740> had<00:02:09.920> more<00:02:10.400> of<00:02:10.460> a

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
made it so that we had more of a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.580 
made it so that we had more of a
community<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.240> are<00:02:11.510> our<00:02:11.990> parents<00:02:12.440> also

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
community and are our parents also
