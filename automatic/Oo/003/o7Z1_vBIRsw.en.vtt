00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
first part of the video is with all the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.230 
first part of the video is with all the
lights<00:00:23.810> on<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:24.199> office<00:00:24.910> then<00:00:25.910> I'm<00:00:26.000> going<00:00:26.179> to

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
lights on the office then I'm going to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.109 
lights on the office then I'm going to
turn<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.689> lights<00:00:26.900> off<00:00:27.109> now<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.910> you'll<00:00:28.910> see

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
turn the lights off now and you'll see

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.210 
turn the lights off now and you'll see
in<00:00:29.179> a<00:00:29.240> second<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:30.349> camera<00:00:30.679> will<00:00:30.769> switch<00:00:30.980> over

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
in a second the camera will switch over

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.760 
in a second the camera will switch over
to<00:00:31.460> night<00:00:32.210> mode<00:00:32.510> and<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:32.870> IR<00:00:33.170> should<00:00:33.470> click<00:00:33.650> on

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
to night mode and the IR should click on

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.330 
to night mode and the IR should click on
in<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:33.950> second

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
in a second

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.400 
in a second
just<00:00:37.120> make<00:00:37.300> my<00:00:37.480> way<00:00:37.510> carefully<00:00:38.020> to<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.260> back

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
just make my way carefully to the back

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.630 
just make my way carefully to the back
of<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.590> room<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.860> room<00:00:38.890> is<00:00:39.100> completely<00:00:39.460> dark

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
of the room the room is completely dark

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.980 
of the room the room is completely dark
right<00:00:39.910> now

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.530 

and<00:00:44.080> this<00:00:44.980> is<00:00:45.130> what<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:45.430> invisible<00:00:45.970> infrared

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
and this is what the invisible infrared

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:54.560 
and this is what the invisible infrared
keep<00:00:47.140> doing<00:00:47.470> looks<00:00:47.680> like

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.419 

and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.199> I'll<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.559> turn<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.129> lights<00:00:56.309> back

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
and then I'll just turn the lights back

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.639 
and then I'll just turn the lights back
on<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.089> you'll<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.719> takes<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.320> second

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
on and you'll see it takes just a second

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.560 
on and you'll see it takes just a second
or<00:00:58.739> two<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:59.250> switch<00:00:59.519> between<00:00:59.910> day<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.390> night

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
or two to switch between day and night

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
or two to switch between day and night
modes<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.379> IRS<00:01:01.829> would<00:01:01.920> turn<00:01:02.100> off<00:01:02.219> would<00:01:02.460> be

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
modes the IRS would turn off would be

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
modes the IRS would turn off would be
black<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.909> white<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.239> second<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.589> then

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
black and white for a second and then

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.289 
black and white for a second and then
the<00:01:04.769> IR<00:01:04.979> cut<00:01:05.159> filter<00:01:05.220> will<00:01:05.759> disengage<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the IR cut filter will disengage and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.430 
the IR cut filter will disengage and
we're<00:01:06.720> back<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.259> color<00:01:07.740> mode<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.210> PIR<00:01:12.630> HD<00:01:12.960> 24

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
we're back to color mode the PIR HD 24

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.529 
we're back to color mode the PIR HD 24
