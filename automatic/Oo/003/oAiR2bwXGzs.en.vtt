00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.940
 once we come with the chandé plus one of 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.509
 the most watched videos of my channel and how 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.920
 always controversial because they always happen 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.300
 problems with this mod good what 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.770
 I want to answer your questions 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.620
 before they make me 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.090
 I'm anticipating your questions 1 I do not know 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.479
 if you can multiplayer 2 if it works 3 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.240
 if your computer says it's a fucking 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.549
 virus do not believe it is not a virus yes no 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.829
 well I do not have how to scan it 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.270
 here but be the windows 8 brings a good 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.640
 antivirus that everything detects you as 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.259
 antivirus like good virus that's not 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.909
 it means that it's good but it 's because 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.350
 protection is not not that it's a virus 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.740
 but it detects you as a malware 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.049
 a malware is not a virus, a malware is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.210
 as a program that can be harmful 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.799
 for your PC as time goes by a virus 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.200
 is different there are several types of 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.220
 Trojan viruses etc. etc. good 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.810
 guys after that I'm going to show it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.700
 the easiest way to install what 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.360
 Well, it would be easier if I had 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.760
 windows 7 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.400
 good in windows 7 will only be the start 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.380
 and execute will put agd percentage to is 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.080
 percentage and they will go roaming room 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.519
 minecraft point folder except that I 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 here in here in cross and a hundred 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.850
 here in windows 8 I have to go to 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.850
 search later 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.430
 execute what I'm going here 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.950
 then we put percentage to percentage 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.230
 app data percentage and we will accept it 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.570
 and it will send us roaming and then point 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.120
 minecraft exam in windows xp and in 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.190
 Windows Vista or Windows 7 only give 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.950
 start will put percentage data app 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.170
 percentage to search and ready then here 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.610
 will go in the folder mods that by 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.610
 true I did not say it, forgive me the redundancy 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.550
 and good if you need the mini craft 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.200
 Forge and the Minister of Justice for 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.640
 taxis from anywhere if the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.710
 screen will appear an annotation with the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.380
 microphone when you have the krafft force 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.230
 you just paste the two files that you 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.740
 would give the description if there will be two 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.820
 hit here in the folder mod and ready 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.320
 he tells me to replace because 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.480
 obviously I put them there and I want 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.530
 show them how it works and 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.420
 the thing is good 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.170
 well I'm going to lower a little the bold ones 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.630
 they give the sounds because it's good now 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.740
 has a master volume good guys 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.020
 as I said 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.790
 click birds to testing as I 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.640
 I was fucking since since I did 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.240
 all this montage good the thing is that 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.640
 now you can see do not risk taking out 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.040
 anything here, what gives you 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.280
 this everything you have to have with 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.540
 espanyol obviously but the center of 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.540
 game in English 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.100
 I've always liked 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.070
 As I will tell you, I have always liked to play 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.870
 the game in its original language is that 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.950
 Sometimes they are our production this gives value 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.150
 of the forests does not come down closed our 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.340
 options all values ​​that do not have 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.989
 nothing to do with the subject 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.989
 and I prefer to switch to that and 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.490
 m the idea when changing language success 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.360
 the type because that Spanish rules because 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.180
 I want 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.500
 good and we put here and as you see here 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.789
 it changes to Spanish 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.889
 here it tells you what it says so that it does not 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.150
 you guessing that you click letters on 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.330
 someone 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.430
 someone someone english please 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.460
 then that teaches you that with 30 goes to 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.210
 have 4 punishment 3 double push and as 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.770
 you see here is 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.860
 click on bird 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.750
 You see good and that's all you 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.120
 gives more of the idea and among those things 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.480
 basically that would be all in the video
