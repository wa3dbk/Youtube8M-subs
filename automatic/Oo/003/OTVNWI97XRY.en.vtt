00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
hello guys today what we thought we do

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.190 
hello guys today what we thought we do
is<00:00:11.969> gonna<00:00:12.120> try<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.330> turn<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.719> little<00:00:12.900> not

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
is gonna try to turn this little not

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.230 
is gonna try to turn this little not
thing<00:00:13.700> this<00:00:14.700> little<00:00:15.000> knot<00:00:15.179> down<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.910> hollow

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
thing this little knot down it's hollow

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.870 
thing this little knot down it's hollow
on<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> inside<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:19.500> I'm<00:00:20.039> hoping<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.760> it's

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
on the inside here I'm hoping that it's

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.599 
on the inside here I'm hoping that it's
strong<00:00:21.480> enough<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.960> turn<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> might<00:00:23.430> not

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
strong enough to turn but it might not

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.750 
strong enough to turn but it might not
be<00:00:23.760> might<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:24.449> wind<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.779> trashing<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.500> but

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
be might just wind up trashing it but

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.160 
be might just wind up trashing it but
we're<00:00:26.760> gonna<00:00:26.880> try<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:27.300> anyway<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.900> thought

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we're gonna try it out anyway I thought

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.620 
we're gonna try it out anyway I thought
it'd<00:00:28.230> make<00:00:28.260> him<00:00:28.439> eat<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> little<00:00:28.769> hollow<00:00:29.070> form

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
it'd make him eat a little hollow form

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:58.450 
it'd make him eat a little hollow form
so<00:00:31.399> let's<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.520> our<00:00:32.820> guys

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.709 

and<00:00:59.460> unfortunately<00:00:59.789> guys<00:01:00.210> there's<00:01:00.449> no<00:01:00.570> way

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and unfortunately guys there's no way

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.090 
and unfortunately guys there's no way
for<00:01:00.899> me<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.019> do<00:01:01.199> anything<00:01:01.409> with<00:01:01.679> this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
for me to do anything with this

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.380 
for me to do anything with this
I<00:01:02.129> mean<00:01:02.429> besides<00:01:02.640> turning<00:01:03.059> between<00:01:03.870> centers

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
I mean besides turning between centers

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.550 
I mean besides turning between centers
it<00:01:06.390> won't<00:01:06.570> hold<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> Chuck

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
it won't hold in the Chuck

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.830 
it won't hold in the Chuck
there's<00:01:08.310> too<00:01:08.460> far-gone<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.240> inside<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
there's too far-gone on the inside to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.160 
there's too far-gone on the inside to
make<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.080> new<00:01:10.320> tenon<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.840> would<00:01:12.960> look<00:01:13.110> pretty

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
make a new tenon so it would look pretty

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.120 
make a new tenon so it would look pretty
cool<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.799> got<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.520> something<00:01:14.789> but

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
cool if I got it to do something but

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
cool if I got it to do something but
unfortunately<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.909> know

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
unfortunately you know

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.340 
unfortunately you know
it's<00:01:19.470> way<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> cookie<00:01:19.799> crumbles<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.430> guess

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
it's way the cookie crumbles I guess

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's way the cookie crumbles I guess

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.100 
okay let's want to show you what looked
like<00:04:33.169> after<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.590> sent<00:04:34.400> it<00:04:34.490> down<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.669> little<00:04:34.850> bit

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
like after I sent it down a little bit

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:44.110 
like after I sent it down a little bit
this<00:04:36.110> is<00:04:36.289> just<00:04:36.470> 80<00:04:36.740> grit<00:04:37.389> and<00:04:39.280> so<00:04:43.000> what<00:04:44.000> the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
this is just 80 grit and so what the

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.930 
this is just 80 grit and so what the
ball<00:04:44.270> was<00:04:44.449> gonna<00:04:44.660> look<00:04:44.750> like

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.910 

this<00:04:50.450> stuff's<00:04:50.690> really<00:04:50.840> hard<00:04:51.170> like<00:04:51.560> really

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
this stuff's really hard like really

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.610 
this stuff's really hard like really
really<00:04:52.130> hard<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.640> know<00:04:52.760> it's<00:04:53.060> not<00:04:53.180> popular<00:04:53.620> I

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
really hard so I know it's not popular I

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.680 
really hard so I know it's not popular I
think<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.940> might<00:04:56.090> be<00:04:56.500> maple<00:04:58.330> but<00:04:59.330> this<00:04:59.480> looks

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
think it might be maple but this looks

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.980 
think it might be maple but this looks
like<00:04:59.810> my<00:05:00.020> boy<00:05:00.230> here

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:11.420 

so<00:05:04.500> it's<00:05:04.650> faulted<00:05:05.009> Mabel's<00:05:05.370> when<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.669> is<00:05:10.430> I'm

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
so it's faulted Mabel's when it is I'm

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.370 
so it's faulted Mabel's when it is I'm
not<00:05:11.550> sure<00:05:11.759> it<00:05:11.880> might<00:05:12.030> be<00:05:12.150> ambrosia<00:05:12.539> I<00:05:12.960> don't

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
not sure it might be ambrosia I don't

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.810 
not sure it might be ambrosia I don't
know<00:05:13.470> what<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.680> difference<00:05:14.009> in<00:05:14.160> ambrosia<00:05:14.669> and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
know what the difference in ambrosia and

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:22.530 
know what the difference in ambrosia and
spalted<00:05:15.389> is<00:05:15.509> but<00:05:16.610> anyway

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540
