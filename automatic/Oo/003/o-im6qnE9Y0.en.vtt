00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
about Los Angeles since that's basically

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.249 
about Los Angeles since that's basically
where<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> game<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.770> basically<00:01:29.100> taking<00:01:29.970> place

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
where the game is basically taking place

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.910 
where the game is basically taking place
except<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.590> Los<00:01:31.770> Santos

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
except you know it's Los Santos

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.609 
except you know it's Los Santos
obviously<00:01:32.700> how<00:01:33.270> often<00:01:33.570> does<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.200> earthquake

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
obviously how often does an earthquake

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.770 
obviously how often does an earthquake
actually<00:01:35.040> happen<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.549> Los<00:01:35.759> Angeles<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
actually happen in Los Angeles what to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.969 
actually happen in Los Angeles what to
the<00:01:36.810> point<00:01:37.049> where<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.259> significant<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the point where it's significant you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
the point where it's significant you
know<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.640> tiny<00:01:38.909> miniature<00:01:39.360> ones

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
know not like the tiny miniature ones

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.060 
know not like the tiny miniature ones
where<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.140> oh<00:01:40.259> hey<00:01:40.500> did<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.799> hear<00:01:40.950> we

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
where it's like oh hey did you hear we

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920 
where it's like oh hey did you hear we
had<00:01:41.159> an<00:01:41.220> earthquake<00:01:41.340> today<00:01:41.670> oh<00:01:41.939> yeah<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> kind

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
had an earthquake today oh yeah I kind

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.690 
had an earthquake today oh yeah I kind
of<00:01:42.990> felt<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.799> know<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> significant

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of felt that you know like a significant

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 
of felt that you know like a significant
earthquake<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.170> fact<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.590> matter<00:01:46.649> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
earthquake the the fact of the matter is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.330 
earthquake the the fact of the matter is
that<00:01:47.040> earthquakes<00:01:47.790> are<00:01:48.030> too<00:01:48.240> rare<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:49.340> really

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
that earthquakes are too rare to really

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 
that earthquakes are too rare to really
just<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.000> game<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:52.259> know

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
just put in a game like I don't know

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
just put in a game like I don't know
Rockstar<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> put<00:01:53.880> something

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
Rockstar is not going to put something

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.310 
Rockstar is not going to put something
like<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.420> into<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> game<00:01:54.840> where<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.229> know

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
like that into the game where you know

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499 
like that into the game where you know
it<00:01:55.409> might<00:01:55.590> happen<00:01:55.829> once<00:01:56.579> every<00:01:56.790> thousand

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it might happen once every thousand

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
it might happen once every thousand
gameplay<00:01:57.960> hours<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.070> want<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
gameplay hours because if they want the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.069 
gameplay hours because if they want the
game<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.610> realistic<00:02:00.240> they<00:02:00.630> cannot<00:02:00.899> have

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
game to be realistic they cannot have

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.319 
game to be realistic they cannot have
earthquakes<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:02.009> happening<00:02:02.460> every<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.299> know

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
earthquakes be happening every you know

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.300 
earthquakes be happening every you know
few<00:02:03.750> hours<00:02:04.049> or<00:02:04.229> something<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
few hours or something like that and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
few hours or something like that and
also<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.759> make<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> game<00:02:06.329> realistic

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
also to make the game realistic

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.630 
also to make the game realistic
buildings<00:02:07.619> would<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.129> crumbling

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
buildings would have to be crumbling

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.760 
buildings would have to be crumbling
buildings<00:02:09.209> would<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.599> falling<00:02:09.959> over<00:02:10.289> this

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
buildings would not be falling over this

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.440 
buildings would not be falling over this
the<00:02:11.190> streets<00:02:11.489> would<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
the streets would have to be like you

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790 
the streets would have to be like you
know<00:02:12.480> falling<00:02:12.930> apart

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
know falling apart

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440 
know falling apart
and<00:02:14.160> things<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.420> just

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and things like that now that is just

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.870 
and things like that now that is just
way<00:02:15.900> too<00:02:15.960> much<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.710> know<00:02:16.830> Rockstar<00:02:17.550> does<00:02:17.700> not

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
way too much you know Rockstar does not

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.840 
way too much you know Rockstar does not
have<00:02:18.120> time<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.530> program<00:02:19.530> earthquakes<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.610> all

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
have time to program earthquakes and all

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.760 
have time to program earthquakes and all
this<00:02:21.000> stuff<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.960> devastation<00:02:22.440> that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
this stuff and the devastation that

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.410 
this stuff and the devastation that
would<00:02:22.920> come<00:02:23.070> with<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.310> basically<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.120> also

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
would come with it basically and also

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.570 
would come with it basically and also
like<00:02:24.570> with<00:02:24.720> tsunamis<00:02:25.260> how<00:02:26.040> would<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.520> even

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
like with tsunamis how would that even

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.640 
like with tsunamis how would that even
work<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.150> mean<00:02:27.330> that's<00:02:27.690> something<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.320> so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
work I mean that's something that is so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.770 
work I mean that's something that is so
rare<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.340> as<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.850> said<00:02:29.880> before<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:30.600> want

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
rare that as I said before if they want

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.870 
rare that as I said before if they want
to<00:02:30.840> keep<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.050> game<00:02:31.230> realistic<00:02:31.830> they<00:02:32.310> really

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
to keep this game realistic they really

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.060 
to keep this game realistic they really
can't<00:02:33.150> add<00:02:33.330> tsunamis<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.230> if<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.770> happens

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
can't add tsunamis because if it happens

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.890 
can't add tsunamis because if it happens
too<00:02:35.220> often<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.910> ridiculous<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.630> mean

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
too often it's just ridiculous I mean

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.000 
too often it's just ridiculous I mean
this<00:02:37.020> isn't<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.410> movie<00:02:37.680> The<00:02:37.830> Day<00:02:37.980> After

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
Tomorrow this isn't war of the worlds

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.870 
Tomorrow this isn't war of the worlds
this<00:02:40.410> isn't<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> end<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.490> world<00:02:41.700> or

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
this isn't the end of the world or

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.130 
this isn't the end of the world or
anything<00:02:42.150> like<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.870> grand<00:02:43.080> theft

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
anything like that this is grand theft

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.610 
anything like that this is grand theft
auto<00:02:43.410> 5<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.300> all<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.690> need<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.020> my<00:02:46.140> opinion<00:02:46.380> is

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
auto 5 and all we need in my opinion is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.340 
auto 5 and all we need in my opinion is
just<00:02:46.890> basic<00:02:47.370> weather<00:02:47.580> effects<00:02:48.140> personally<00:02:49.140> I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
just basic weather effects personally I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.610 
just basic weather effects personally I
as<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.550> said<00:02:50.790> tsunamis<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.780> earthquakes<00:02:51.930> would

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
as I said tsunamis and earthquakes would

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.280 
as I said tsunamis and earthquakes would
just<00:02:52.890> maybe<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.240> happen<00:02:54.390> once<00:02:54.840> or<00:02:55.080> twice

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
just maybe have to happen once or twice

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
just maybe have to happen once or twice
after<00:02:55.770> like<00:02:56.070> years<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.520> playing<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.850> game<00:02:57.000> for

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
after like years of playing the game for

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.750 
after like years of playing the game for
it<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.510> realistic<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.350> mean<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.400> like

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
it to be realistic I mean if it's like

to look great the wind effects are going
to<00:03:15.450> be<00:03:15.540> good<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.930> time<00:03:16.110> around<00:03:16.290> we've

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
to be good this time around we've

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.050 
to be good this time around we've
already<00:03:17.190> seen<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.640> trailers<00:03:18.030> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
already seen in the trailers that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.030 
already seen in the trailers that
thing's<00:03:18.810> actually<00:03:19.110> blow<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.770> windows

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
thing's actually blow in the windows
