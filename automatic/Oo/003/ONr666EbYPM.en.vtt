the<00:03:22.610> proper<00:03:23.610> fan<00:03:23.850> shroud<00:03:24.090> because<00:03:24.510> mine<00:03:25.080> runs

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
the proper fan shroud because mine runs

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.670 
the proper fan shroud because mine runs
about<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.830> little<00:03:26.459> under<00:03:26.640> 190<00:03:27.360> degrees<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.590> I

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
about a little under 190 degrees and I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.790 
about a little under 190 degrees and I
Drive<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.070> about<00:03:29.959> 25-30<00:03:30.959> miles<00:03:31.200> back<00:03:31.590> and

comes in through the frame right there
on<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.590> Oldsmobile<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.090> we<00:03:45.239> just<00:03:45.420> ran<00:03:46.410> it

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
on this Oldsmobile so we just ran it

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.920 
on this Oldsmobile so we just ran it
down<00:03:46.739> across<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.550> frame<00:03:47.970> over<00:03:48.209> there<00:03:50.720> over<00:03:51.720> to

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
that big of an issue and I just ran mine

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.270 
that big of an issue and I just ran mine
behind<00:03:57.170> my<00:03:58.170> alternator<00:03:58.620> right<00:03:58.860> there<00:03:59.040> um

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
behind my alternator right there um

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.840 
behind my alternator right there um
yeah<00:04:02.270> you<00:04:02.330> have<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.750> also<00:04:03.140> your<00:04:03.850> transmission

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
yeah you have to also your transmission

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.770 
yeah you have to also your transmission
cooling<00:04:05.210> lines<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:06.350> go<00:04:06.530> into<00:04:06.680> your<00:04:07.780> radiator

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
cooling lines that go into your radiator

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.190 
cooling lines that go into your radiator
here<00:04:09.550> back<00:04:10.550> up<00:04:10.760> under<00:04:11.060> there<00:04:11.270> you'll<00:04:11.900> have<00:04:11.960> to

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
here back up under there you'll have to

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.160 
here back up under there you'll have to
like<00:04:12.350> bend<00:04:12.620> them<00:04:12.800> out<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.070> way<00:04:13.250> because

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
like bend them out of the way because

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.160 
like bend them out of the way because
the<00:04:15.170> headers<00:04:15.470> are<00:04:15.620> different<00:04:16.040> or<00:04:16.989> if<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.140> just

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
the headers are different or if you just

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.690 
the headers are different or if you just
went<00:04:18.530> over<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.190> have<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.459> stock

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
went over you just have the stock

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.270 
went over you just have the stock
manifolds<00:04:20.329> it's<00:04:20.510> different<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.130> just

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
manifolds it's different but you just

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.950 
manifolds it's different but you just
have<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.490> bend<00:04:22.700> them<00:04:22.820> out<00:04:22.910> of<00:04:23.000> way<00:04:23.090> up<00:04:23.210> here<00:04:23.420> if

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
have to bend them out of way up here if

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.360 
have to bend them out of way up here if
you<00:04:24.050> bend<00:04:24.260> them<00:04:24.320> carefully<00:04:24.800> enough<00:04:25.010> they

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
you bend them carefully enough they

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.310 
you bend them carefully enough they
won't<00:04:25.520> kink<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.390> still<00:04:26.630> be<00:04:26.750> able<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:26.990> bend

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
won't kink and you still be able to bend

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.190 
won't kink and you still be able to bend
them<00:04:27.440> however<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.860> want<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.540> not<00:04:29.540> mess<00:04:29.960> them

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
but just running all the vacuum lines

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.770 
but just running all the vacuum lines
you<00:04:39.710> got<00:04:39.890> one<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:40.280> comes<00:04:40.550> if<00:04:40.910> you're<00:04:41.120> using

engine<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.600> even<00:05:38.810> if<00:05:39.080> you<00:05:39.280> end<00:05:40.280> transmission

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
engine and even if you end transmission

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.190 
engine and even if you end transmission
one<00:05:42.590> thing<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:42.919> do<00:05:42.979> have<00:05:43.070> to<00:05:43.310> say<00:05:43.490> is<00:05:43.700> if<00:05:44.030> you<00:05:44.990> do

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
one thing I do have to say is if you do

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.480 
one thing I do have to say is if you do
plan<00:05:45.440> on<00:05:45.470> using<00:05:45.620> a<00:05:46.780> Chevy<00:05:48.520> 312<00:05:49.520> hydro<00:05:49.729> 350<00:05:51.490> you

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
plan on using a Chevy 312 hydro 350 you

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.920 
plan on using a Chevy 312 hydro 350 you
better<00:05:53.060> make<00:05:53.210> sure<00:05:53.270> that's<00:05:53.660> a<00:05:53.810> short<00:05:54.140> tail<00:05:54.890> one

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
better make sure that's a short tail one

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.230 
better make sure that's a short tail one
and<00:05:56.930> you'll<00:05:57.650> also<00:05:57.860> have<00:05:58.010> to<00:05:58.190> get<00:05:58.880> a<00:05:58.910> different

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
and you'll also have to get a different

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.760 
and you'll also have to get a different
cross<00:05:59.510> member<00:05:59.900> for<00:06:00.080> under

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
cross member for under

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:07.129 
cross member for under
but<00:06:01.770> if<00:06:01.919> you<00:06:02.039> just<00:06:02.099> use<00:06:02.639> this<00:06:04.969> holds<00:06:05.969> mobile<00:06:06.270> to

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
but if you just use this holds mobile to

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.520 
but if you just use this holds mobile to
Rajal<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.949> 50<00:06:08.430> or<00:06:10.310> 200<00:06:11.310> are<00:06:11.729> for<00:06:12.319> you<00:06:13.319> know<00:06:13.379> how

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
Rajal to 50 or 200 are for you know how

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.839 
Rajal to 50 or 200 are for you know how
you<00:06:13.800> can<00:06:14.310> still<00:06:14.550> use<00:06:14.699> the<00:06:14.789> same<00:06:14.849> existing<00:06:15.569> deal

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
you can still use the same existing deal

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.369 
you can still use the same existing deal
but<00:06:17.849> yeah<00:06:20.060> that's<00:06:21.060> about<00:06:21.210> it<00:06:21.419> really<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.229> then

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:22.379 
but yeah that's about it really and then

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.390 
but yeah that's about it really and then
mainly<00:06:22.889> it's<00:06:23.159> just<00:06:23.250> about<00:06:25.009> figuring<00:06:26.009> out<00:06:26.129> how

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
mainly it's just about figuring out how

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.149 
mainly it's just about figuring out how
everything<00:06:26.520> goes<00:06:26.969> man

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:28.159 
everything goes man

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.550 
everything goes man
so<00:06:29.159> the<00:06:30.150> biggest<00:06:30.509> issue<00:06:30.659> we<00:06:30.930> had<00:06:31.110> was<00:06:31.379> the

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
so the biggest issue we had was the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.670 
so the biggest issue we had was the
frame<00:06:32.460> mounts<00:06:32.909> the<00:06:33.840> motor<00:06:34.169> mounts<00:06:34.560> on<00:06:34.650> the

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
frame mounts the motor mounts on the

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.089 
frame mounts the motor mounts on the
frame<00:06:36.379> and<00:06:37.379> also<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:38.009> proper<00:06:39.000> linkages<00:06:40.099> for

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
frame and also the proper linkages for

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.689 
frame and also the proper linkages for
your<00:06:41.279> throttle<00:06:41.909> cable<00:06:42.330> and<00:06:42.569> whatnot<00:06:43.699> pay

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
your throttle cable and whatnot pay

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.670 
your throttle cable and whatnot pay
attention<00:06:45.180> to<00:06:45.389> what<00:06:45.930> type<00:06:46.139> of<00:06:46.259> transmission

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
attention to what type of transmission

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.260 
attention to what type of transmission
you<00:06:46.889> have<00:06:46.919> because<00:06:47.400> there's<00:06:47.550> different<00:06:47.699> donal

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
you have because there's different donal

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.890 
you have because there's different donal
cables<00:06:48.629> to<00:06:48.870> go<00:06:48.990> to<00:06:49.050> different<00:06:51.259> carburetors<00:06:52.759> so

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
cables to go to different carburetors so

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.939 
cables to go to different carburetors so
that's<00:06:54.900> about<00:06:55.020> it<00:06:55.169> man<00:06:55.500> if<00:06:55.590> you<00:06:55.680> have<00:06:55.800> any
