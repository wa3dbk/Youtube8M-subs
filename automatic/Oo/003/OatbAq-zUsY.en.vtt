previous to this are kind of listen back
to<00:01:49.380> them<00:01:49.469> and<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.649> were<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.130> lackluster<00:01:50.789> they

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
to them and they were so lackluster they

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.989 
to them and they were so lackluster they
were<00:01:51.030> terrible<00:01:51.740> from<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.859> listening<00:01:53.579> point<00:01:53.820> of

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
view and that pretty much is the reason

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.349 
view and that pretty much is the reason
why<00:01:56.130> people<00:01:56.490> come<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.640> watch<00:01:56.850> these<00:01:57.030> common
