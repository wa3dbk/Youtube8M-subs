00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.389
 hello everybody, this next class, I'm going 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.199
 show you how to do the test 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.930
 of current leakage by consumers 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.630
 most installed by key defects 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.820
 electric short circuits in conductors 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.180
 and so on and it 's a very test 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.090
 using the perimeter of the 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.730
 first multimeter we will return 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.079
 to the voltage measurement of that battery or 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.159
 select the voltmeter let's make the 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.100
 Link 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:45.129
 respecting the popularity 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.489
 then we have here negative stimulus 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.389
 the voltmeter we have an indication of 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.749
 12.15 you drummer born close 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:58.690
 easy is to turn off the negative battery 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.239
 so that we can connect the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.999
 ammeter in series with the terminal 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.610
 battery negative 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.610
 Let's turn off the battery. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.280
 now that I've disconnected the battery cable 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.640
 negative off 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.640
 let's prepare the previous one then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 select 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.160
 amperes not faithful to take Emilia 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.610
 red 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:39.400
 we will put in the value of up to 10 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.470
 amperes is positioned or pm prepared 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.640
 to perform the test and consumption 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:51.430
 before taking the measurement. 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:56.200
 We have to disconnect the connector from the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:59.070
 car now respecting the polarity we 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.399
 Let's fight in series with the perimeter. 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.979
 with the negative battery cable with 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.890
 battery negative the positive with the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.070
 car that I turned off on the battery then 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.200
 a perimeter can only be connected in series 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.430
 the electrons flow through a 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 the perimeter you told me after the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.080
 cable connections observe the reading on the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.910
 pne we have the reading from 760 to 780 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.450
 my leg because the vehicle door 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.780
 It is open the sintetro of cesa then 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.170
 alarm system on working 131 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.570
 so we're going to have to close the vehicle 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.900
 lock system enters the wait 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.900
 rest 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:58.290
 note now after locking 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.710
 ultrasound has already performed internal 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.420
 passenger seat attention to the crash now 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:11.610
 to 68 70 my leg that is the current 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.430
 normal and working alarm system 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.920
 of the vehicle 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.050
 in this case the value found is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.980
 accordance with this type of vehicle in 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.820
 values â€‹â€‹above 100 120 m 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.460
 foot 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.770
 is a very high value which corresponds 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.220
 to a possible consumer shows a 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.750
 short circuit and for 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.440
 identify the problem and just 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.870
 removing one fuse at a time 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.960
 always observing a danger if it goes 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.020
 to lower the chain when you take the 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.840
 fuse of the circuit that has the 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.710
 leakage current will drop in the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.470
 danger then just take the circuit and 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.470
 have the inspection locate the defect 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.850
 Hi guys, I would like to introduce 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.120
 for you too 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.820
 my book of technology and regulation of 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.370
 internal combustion engines 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.489
 a book with fairly defined tensions 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.920
 all procedures with terrorism 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.700
 the step-by-step assemblers of how 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.680
 make a correct diagnosis and 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.040
 regulation of combustion engines 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.040
 internal
