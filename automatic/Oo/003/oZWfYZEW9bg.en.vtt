00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.150
 in the start panel we counted 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.860
 with groups within our 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.130
 applications like you are seeing in 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.610
 this moment here we have divided into 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.610
 groups 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.890
 our applications we have here three 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.949
 groups you can identify for this 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.850
 great space bar that is 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:37.220
 between store and bing between skydrive and 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.090
 travel and so on 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.370
 we can appreciate then how this is 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.440
 a group if we go here what 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.590
 we will be able to preside much better since 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.470
 is going to select the whole group this 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.570
 it's another group 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.360
 and this is another group 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.950
 which each group can give you a 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.050
 selection we can give you a coarse name 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.269
 with a right click on the group 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.300
 and we will appear here the option to give 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.660
 name to the group we can identify it 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.170
 when an arrow or a 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.330
 Dove inside this group we are going to give 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.619
 the names of this group and we're going to 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.619
 put my things 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.689
 you can put your favorites again 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.740
 material and so on work material 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.780
 etc 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.909
 then here work then with 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.549
 any group we are going to select this 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.790
 group and automatically compress the 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.189
 screen until you see this group in this 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.659
 case the three groups are together like this 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.539
 that will show us 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.080
 but if for example I had the groups 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.630
 up here 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.680
 and selected groups of up to here goes to 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.150
 the screen being a hundred percent up 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.540
 to recover that space 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.880
 another of the advantages that we can create or 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.480
 modify within the groups is 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.480
 change 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.110
 instead of the applications in this 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.390
 case we have metro applications we're going 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.569
 to change the camera where are my 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.380
 things in this case I made another 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.360
 movement 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.700
 let's change the camera where they are 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.490
 my things and we see that it was already applied to a 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.740
 new group that is the one of my things 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.170
 let's change sports also in my 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.080
 things and finally we are going to change 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.990
 Photos 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.920
 as you are seeing we have just 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.980
 modify our home panel to 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.870
 that looks better we are going to return this to 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.180
 where it was 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.940
 and now what we are going to do is create a 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.360
 new group with elements of these 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.610
 existing groups in this case I'm going to 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:07.790
 choose the one of photos and we see that here 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.360
 appears a space and a bar that 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.230
 is practically crashing a bar 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.230
 White 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.680
 this means that you are going to create a 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.900
 new group there I'll give it to ok and now 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.130
 we have here a new group I'm going to put 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.160
 the camera 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.350
 I'm going to put the videos I'm going to put my 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.180
 contacts I will put the messages 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.180
 and already here we have a new group 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.260
 let's go back to the 100% view we're going to 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.280
 see right click in the group and we're going 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.370
 to give a name here we are going to put 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.370
 see let's put more used 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.430
 is for an example let's name it 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.319
 let's go back here and we see that in 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.330
 the lower part already shows us a 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.190
 scroll bar that's because ya 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.050
 we have a group created 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.380
 we can also move the groups 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.450
 existing ones you simply have to 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.660
 direct us to the view 100% we select 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.520
 the group and we move it 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.819
 where we want to go 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.230
 shape 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:22.780
 that we can create or modify here 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.320
 the space of our groups then 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.810
 here we see that they are the most used 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.820
 those who connect to the internet those who 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.030
 they come by default to the desktop and my 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.030
 things
