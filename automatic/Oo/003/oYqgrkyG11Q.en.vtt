continue<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.940> little<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.630> between<00:01:40.140> here

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
continue on a little bit in between here

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.660 
continue on a little bit in between here
in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> next<00:01:40.950> point<00:01:41.159> there's<00:01:41.340> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.610> a

shot<00:03:46.770> alright<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:47.920> now<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.100> we<00:03:48.310> got<00:03:48.520> that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
shot alright so now that we got that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.360 
shot alright so now that we got that
we're<00:03:49.300> going<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.870> head<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:51.190> next

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
we're going to head to the next

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.330 
we're going to head to the next
checkpoint<00:03:51.790> area<00:03:52.710> and<00:03:53.710> once<00:03:53.920> we<00:03:54.040> go<00:03:54.160> through

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
checkpoint area and once we go through

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.310 
checkpoint area and once we go through
that<00:03:54.460> checkpoint<00:03:54.760> there's<00:03:55.600> going<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.960> be<00:03:56.080> a

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
that checkpoint there's going to be a

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.290 
that checkpoint there's going to be a
car<00:03:56.860> in<00:03:57.100> Fernie<00:03:57.400> but<00:03:57.700> there's<00:03:57.850> also<00:03:58.000> going<00:03:58.240> to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
it'll be between you and the car so go

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.290 
it'll be between you and the car so go
through<00:04:02.710> this<00:04:02.950> checkpoint<00:04:03.310> now<00:04:03.730> be<00:04:03.880> careful

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
through this checkpoint now be careful

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.970 
through this checkpoint now be careful
not<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.540> hit<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.020> car<00:04:05.230> that's<00:04:05.530> going<00:04:05.710> to<00:04:05.770> be<00:04:05.890> on

this area we're going to go to the next
area<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:41.550> you<00:04:42.550> get<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.820> checkpoint<00:04:43.300> here<00:04:43.770> the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
area and you get the checkpoint here the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.860 
area and you get the checkpoint here the
gates<00:04:45.010> going<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.310> lock<00:04:45.430> behind<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:46.030> now<00:04:46.750> all

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
gates going to lock behind you now all

gates going to lock behind you now all
you<00:04:47.020> need<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.290> do<00:04:47.530> is<00:04:47.860> just<00:04:48.100> go<00:04:48.310> straight<00:04:48.760> to

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
you need to do is just go straight to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.450 
you need to do is just go straight to
the<00:04:49.030> right<00:04:49.300> over<00:04:49.480> here<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.110> behind<00:04:50.980> this<00:04:51.130> tent

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
the right over here and behind this tent

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.880 
the right over here and behind this tent
is<00:04:51.670> going<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:52.090> be<00:04:52.270> a<00:04:52.300> box<00:04:53.230> there<00:04:53.500> for<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.770> to

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
is going to be a box there for you to

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.270 
is going to be a box there for you to
open<00:04:54.010> an<00:04:54.280> ammo<00:04:54.460> box<00:04:54.700> and<00:04:55.980> then<00:04:56.980> you're<00:04:57.130> going

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
open an ammo box and then you're going

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.610 
open an ammo box and then you're going
to<00:04:57.340> have<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.490> several<00:04:58.330> waves<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.840> enemies<00:04:59.200> come

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
to have a several waves of enemies come

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.020 
to have a several waves of enemies come
through<00:04:59.860> here<00:05:00.100> then<00:05:00.280> once<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.550> clear<00:05:00.820> them

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
through here then once you clear them

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.910 
through here then once you clear them
this<00:05:01.210> gate<00:05:01.480> is<00:05:01.690> going<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.110> open<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:02.650> once<00:05:02.770> the

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
this gate is going to open and once the

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.650 
this gate is going to open and once the
gate<00:05:03.100> is<00:05:03.280> open<00:05:03.610> just<00:05:03.790> go<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.180> left<00:05:04.330> here

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
gate is open just go to the left here

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.050 
gate is open just go to the left here
and<00:05:04.870> there's<00:05:05.050> a<00:05:05.110> another<00:05:05.920> memento<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.700> that

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
and there's a another memento in that

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.440 
and there's a another memento in that
loop<00:05:07.630> box<00:05:07.990> there<00:05:08.320> and<00:05:11.790> that's<00:05:12.790> going<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.150> be<00:05:13.270> it

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
loop box there and that's going to be it

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.700 
loop box there and that's going to be it
here<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:13.990> then<00:05:14.110> you're<00:05:14.260> just<00:05:14.320> going<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.560> go

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
here and then you're just going to go

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.140 
here and then you're just going to go
through<00:05:14.950> this<00:05:15.130> section<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:17.940> then<00:05:18.940> you're

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
through this section and then you're

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.520 
through this section and then you're
going<00:05:19.300> to<00:05:19.390> reach<00:05:19.540> an<00:05:19.720> area<00:05:20.050> where<00:05:20.320> you're

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
going to reach an area where you're

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.800 
going to reach an area where you're
going<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.680> have<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.860> bunch<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.190> fire<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.910> in

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
going to have a bunch of fire and in

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.260 
going to have a bunch of fire and in
that<00:05:23.020> area<00:05:23.380> it's<00:05:23.830> going<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.280> be<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.970> can<00:05:25.120> just

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
that area it's going to be you can just

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.440 
that area it's going to be you can just
ignore<00:05:25.390> all<00:05:25.720> those<00:05:25.870> zombies<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:28.120> just<00:05:28.330> go

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
ignore all those zombies so just go

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.950 
ignore all those zombies so just go
through<00:05:28.480> here<00:05:30.090> travel<00:05:31.090> pass<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:31.480> fire<00:05:31.720> and

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
through here travel pass this fire and

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.450 
through here travel pass this fire and
there's<00:05:32.080> our<00:05:32.200> first<00:05:32.350> cars<00:05:32.680> right<00:05:32.980> in<00:05:33.160> front<00:05:33.400> of

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
there's our first cars right in front of

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.440 
there's our first cars right in front of
us

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.850 

and<00:05:38.960> then<00:05:39.170> we're<00:05:39.470> going<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:39.800> loot<00:05:40.790> that<00:05:41.060> there

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
and then we're going to loot that there

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.530 
and then we're going to loot that there
in<00:05:42.860> a<00:05:42.950> second<00:05:45.460> and<00:05:46.460> then<00:05:47.120> there's<00:05:47.300> going<00:05:47.420> to<00:05:47.480> be

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
in a second and then there's going to be
