they<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:10.500> often<00:01:10.860> reference<00:01:11.280> things

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
they they they often reference things

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.590 
they they they often reference things
that<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> didn't<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.360> weren't

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that you didn't know what they weren't

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.300 
that you didn't know what they weren't
so<00:01:12.720> later<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> rules<00:01:13.500> bad<00:01:13.770> bad<00:01:14.010> ready

strategically and there's a lot of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.899 
strategically and there's a lot of
strategy<00:01:32.100> there's<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.640> different

each<00:02:05.630> color<00:02:05.840> or<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.649> may<00:02:06.770> control<00:02:07.130> multiple

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
each color or you may control multiple

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.040 
each color or you may control multiple
teams<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.030> depends<00:02:08.360> how<00:02:08.420> many<00:02:08.599> people<00:02:08.899> are<00:02:08.959> in

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
teams it depends how many people are in

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.170 
teams it depends how many people are in
the<00:02:09.170> game<00:02:09.349> each<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.429> these<00:02:10.519> space<00:02:10.849> marines

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
the game each of these space marines

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.690 
the game each of these space marines
really<00:02:11.629> doesn't<00:02:12.050> have<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.500> much

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
really doesn't have that much

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.160 
really doesn't have that much
distinguishing<00:02:13.700> themselves<00:02:13.879> other<00:02:14.599> than

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
distinguishing themselves other than

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.110 
distinguishing themselves other than
there's<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.129> stats<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.640> cards<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.090> can

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
there's a stats in the cards and you can

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.000 
there's a stats in the cards and you can
see<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:17.450> only<00:02:17.599> stat<00:02:17.900> basically<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.739> range

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
see the only stat basically is the range

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.369 
see the only stat basically is the range
there's<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.580> range<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:19.940> attack<00:02:20.420> here<00:02:20.750> this

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
there's a range to attack here this

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.890 
there's a range to attack here this
guy's<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.620> range<00:02:21.950> zero<00:02:22.310> attack<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.970> you're

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
guy's a range zero attack and you're

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.570 
guy's a range zero attack and you're
going<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.049> be<00:02:24.200> placing<00:02:24.680> these<00:02:24.769> cards<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.459> a

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
game and they're going to be there

game and they're going to be there
facing<00:02:30.349> it<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:31.160> way<00:02:31.579> is<00:02:31.640> depending<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.390> know

facing it the way is depending you know

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.819 
facing it the way is depending you know
I'm<00:02:32.630> not<00:02:32.750> showing<00:02:33.019> you<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.140> beginning<00:02:33.530> setup

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
I'm not showing you the beginning setup

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.400 
I'm not showing you the beginning setup
but<00:02:34.610> there's<00:02:35.390> an<00:02:35.540> arrow<00:02:35.690> showing<00:02:35.989> which<00:02:36.230> way

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
but there's an arrow showing which way

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.009 
but there's an arrow showing which way
they're<00:02:36.590> facing<00:02:36.829> they're<00:02:37.250> attacking<00:02:37.610> a

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
progresses players will be drawing cards

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.050 
progresses players will be drawing cards
like<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:45.019> show<00:02:45.410> how<00:02:46.220> these<00:02:46.549> jeans

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
like this that show how these jeans

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.580 
like this that show how these jeans
dealers<00:02:47.450> aren't<00:02:47.660> moved<00:02:47.900> there's<00:02:48.200> different

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
dealers aren't moved there's different

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.860 
dealers aren't moved there's different
levels<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.280> each<00:02:49.880> time<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.269> go<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.510> level

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
levels and each time you go to a level

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.539 
levels and each time you go to a level
you'll<00:02:50.989> set<00:02:51.200> different<00:02:51.530> rooms<00:02:51.829> up<00:02:52.069> some<00:02:52.310> rooms

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
you'll set different rooms up some rooms

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.850 
you'll set different rooms up some rooms
are<00:02:52.730> pretty<00:02:53.569> boring<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.470> one<00:02:54.680> although

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
are pretty boring like this one although

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.990 
are pretty boring like this one although
that's<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.129> place<00:02:55.340> where<00:02:55.489> they<00:02:55.579> may<00:02:55.700> spawn

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
that's a place where they may spawn

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.089 
that's a place where they may spawn
others<00:02:56.870> have<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.110> control<00:02:57.530> panel<00:02:57.769> like<00:02:58.069> this

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
others have a control panel like this

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.390 
others have a control panel like this
one<00:02:58.489> where<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.269> can<00:02:59.450> use<00:02:59.720> an<00:03:00.440> ability<00:03:00.799> at<00:03:01.220> that

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
one where you can use an ability at that

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.030 
one where you can use an ability at that
panel<00:03:01.609> they'll<00:03:02.510> be<00:03:02.660> set<00:03:02.900> somewhere<00:03:03.170> in<00:03:03.650> this

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
panel they'll be set somewhere in this

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.280 
panel they'll be set somewhere in this
column<00:03:04.639> and<00:03:04.790> then<00:03:05.329> genes<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.900> ORS<00:03:06.079> are<00:03:06.170> going

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
column and then genes the ORS are going

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.620 
column and then genes the ORS are going
to<00:03:06.380> show<00:03:06.530> up<00:03:06.620> out<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:06.769> nowhere<00:03:07.030> attacking<00:03:08.030> now

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
to show up out of nowhere attacking now

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.030 
to show up out of nowhere attacking now
gene<00:03:08.900> stealers<00:03:09.290> are<00:03:09.470> all<00:03:09.590> pretty<00:03:09.769> much<00:03:09.980> the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
gene stealers are all pretty much the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.890 
gene stealers are all pretty much the
same<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.639> mean<00:03:11.090> they<00:03:11.209> have<00:03:11.299> different<00:03:11.569> pictures

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
same I mean they have different pictures

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.020 
same I mean they have different pictures
they<00:03:12.500> have<00:03:12.530> different<00:03:12.950> icons<00:03:13.100> on<00:03:13.639> them<00:03:13.850> as

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
they have different icons on them as

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.680 
they have different icons on them as
cards<00:03:14.900> are<00:03:15.230> drawn<00:03:15.920> different<00:03:16.880> icons<00:03:17.450> will

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
cards are drawn different icons will

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.110 
cards are drawn different icons will
move<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.709> more<00:03:18.889> icons<00:03:19.340> in<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.579> location<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
move so the more icons in a location the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.479 
move so the more icons in a location the
more<00:03:20.269> dangerous<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.109> because<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.680> swarm

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
more dangerous it is because that swarm

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.599 
more dangerous it is because that swarm
may<00:03:23.060> move<00:03:23.299> somewhere<00:03:23.750> else<00:03:23.930> now<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:25.220> basic

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
may move somewhere else now the basic

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.059 
may move somewhere else now the basic
gameplay<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.389> game<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:26.750> pretty<00:03:26.930> good<00:03:27.620> it's

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
gameplay of the game is pretty good it's

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.370

have to play one of the remaining two
next<00:03:45.290> time<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.709> can<00:03:45.859> never<00:03:46.010> play<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.340> same

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
next time so you can never play the same

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.599 
next time so you can never play the same
card<00:03:46.849> twice<00:03:47.599> in<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.870> row<00:03:48.049> now<00:03:48.980> what<00:03:49.400> does<00:03:49.489> each

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
card twice in a row now what does each

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.220 
card twice in a row now what does each
card<00:03:49.880> do<00:03:50.090> well<00:03:50.510> let's<00:03:50.720> talk<00:03:50.810> about<00:03:50.989> moving

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
card do well let's talk about moving

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.229 
card do well let's talk about moving
activate<00:03:51.590> first<00:03:51.859> when<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.609> move<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.940> simply

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
activate first when you move you simply

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.059 
activate first when you move you simply
can<00:03:53.389> move<00:03:53.599> somewhere<00:03:54.260> else<00:03:54.410> in<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.590> row<00:03:54.739> which

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
can move somewhere else in a row which

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.530 
can move somewhere else in a row which
might<00:03:55.280> help<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.609> get<00:03:55.760> in<00:03:55.849> range<00:03:56.060> of<00:03:56.239> attacking

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
might help you get in range of attacking

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.589 
might help you get in range of attacking
for<00:03:57.530> example<00:03:57.859> this<00:03:57.919> guy<00:03:58.099> has<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> range<00:03:58.599> 0

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
for example this guy has a range 0

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.659 
for example this guy has a range 0
attack<00:04:00.049> so<00:04:00.680> he<00:04:00.799> can<00:04:00.950> only<00:04:01.040> attack<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.519> guys

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
attack so he can only attack the guys

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.470 
attack so he can only attack the guys
next<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.090> him

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
next to him

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.599 
next to him
this<00:04:03.049> guy's<00:04:03.260> arranged<00:04:03.560> 0<00:04:03.799> taxol<00:04:04.250> he<00:04:04.340> can't

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
this guy's arranged 0 taxol he can't

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.610 
this guy's arranged 0 taxol he can't
attack<00:04:04.730> well<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.180> guy's<00:04:05.329> a<00:04:05.359> range<00:04:05.630> of<00:04:05.750> 2<00:04:05.930> so

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
attack well this guy's a range of 2 so

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.900 
attack well this guy's a range of 2 so
he<00:04:06.709> could<00:04:06.859> attack<00:04:07.070> all<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.340> way<00:04:07.430> up<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.639> here

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
he could attack all the way up to here

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.330 
he could attack all the way up to here
so<00:04:08.570> getting<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.199> guys<00:04:09.380> in<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.680> proper<00:04:10.070> places

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
so getting the guys in the proper places

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.020 
so getting the guys in the proper places
for<00:04:10.639> the<00:04:10.729> rain

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
for the rain

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.480 
for the rain
just<00:04:11.180> might<00:04:11.300> matter<00:04:11.510> also<00:04:12.350> when<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.560> move<00:04:12.770> you

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
just might matter also when you move you

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.390 
just might matter also when you move you
can<00:04:13.700> change<00:04:14.240> your<00:04:14.830> facing<00:04:15.830> although<00:04:16.040> changing

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
can change your facing although changing

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.400 
can change your facing although changing
your<00:04:16.519> facing<00:04:16.820> away<00:04:16.910> from<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.180> Jean<00:04:17.389> sewers<00:04:17.720> is

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
your facing away from the Jean sewers is

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.120 
your facing away from the Jean sewers is
kind<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.769> dumb

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
kind of dumb

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.280 
kind of dumb
if<00:04:19.190> you<00:04:19.700> move<00:04:19.850> next<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.299> something<00:04:20.510> that<00:04:20.840> can

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
if you move next to something that can

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.320 
if you move next to something that can
be<00:04:21.350> activated<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.310> activate<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:22.940> and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
be activated you can activate it and

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.850 
be activated you can activate it and
that's<00:04:23.510> all<00:04:23.780> kinds<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.169> things<00:04:24.350> like<00:04:24.530> pushing

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
that's all kinds of things like pushing

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.260 
that's all kinds of things like pushing
a<00:04:24.889> button<00:04:25.160> trying<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.550> blow<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.940> whole<00:04:26.090> room

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
a button trying to blow the whole room

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.629 
a button trying to blow the whole room
up<00:04:26.419> or<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:27.440> know<00:04:27.560> doing<00:04:27.980> different<00:04:28.010> things<00:04:28.430> so

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
up or you know doing different things so

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.010 
up or you know doing different things so
that's<00:04:28.790> what<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.150> move<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.419> activate<00:04:29.810> card

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
that's what the move and activate card

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.020 
that's what the move and activate card
does<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:31.190> support<00:04:31.850> card<00:04:32.650> on<00:04:33.650> this<00:04:33.889> one<00:04:34.160> you

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
does the support card on this one you

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.680 
does the support card on this one you
get<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.419> put<00:04:35.660> a<00:04:35.870> support<00:04:36.740> token<00:04:37.250> on<00:04:38.090> another

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
get to put a support token on another

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.090 
get to put a support token on another
space<00:04:39.020> ring<00:04:39.320> which<00:04:39.500> will<00:04:39.680> allow<00:04:39.860> them<00:04:40.070> to

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
space ring which will allow them to

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.220 
space ring which will allow them to
re-roll<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.669> die<00:04:40.940> that's<00:04:41.480> a<00:04:41.630> pretty<00:04:41.780> big<00:04:41.990> deal

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
re-roll a die that's a pretty big deal

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.670 
re-roll a die that's a pretty big deal
and<00:04:43.180> then<00:04:44.180> there<00:04:44.450> is<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:44.690> attack<00:04:45.020> which<00:04:45.470> lets

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
and then there is the attack which lets

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.740 
and then there is the attack which lets
you<00:04:45.770> attack<00:04:46.100> with<00:04:46.669> both<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.300> Marines<00:04:47.540> of

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
you attack with both of the Marines of

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.630 
you attack with both of the Marines of
that<00:04:47.870> color<00:04:48.110> should<00:04:48.770> they<00:04:48.950> still<00:04:49.220> be<00:04:49.400> alive

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
that color should they still be alive

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.450 
that color should they still be alive
now<00:04:50.600> most<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.260> time<00:04:51.530> when<00:04:51.980> you<00:04:52.100> attack

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
now most of the time when you attack

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.220 
now most of the time when you attack
you're<00:04:53.060> going<00:04:53.180> to<00:04:53.240> be<00:04:53.330> rolling<00:04:53.480> a<00:04:53.690> special<00:04:54.080> dye

you're going to be rolling a special dye
that<00:04:54.410> came<00:04:54.650> with<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.919> game<00:04:55.060> this<00:04:56.060> dye<00:04:56.300> has

skull kill one of the gene stealers when

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.810 
skull kill one of the gene stealers when
the<00:05:03.530> gene<00:05:03.710> stealers<00:05:04.010> attack<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.520> they're

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820

trying to roll well less than the number

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.610 
trying to roll well less than the number
that<00:05:07.880> are<00:05:08.060> there<00:05:08.479> so<00:05:08.990> if<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.169> have<00:05:09.260> six<00:05:09.440> or

more you are some severe trouble you

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.900 
more you are some severe trouble you
take<00:05:12.560> one<00:05:12.770> hit<00:05:12.919> you're<00:05:13.370> dead

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
take one hit you're dead

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.820 
take one hit you're dead
they<00:05:14.330> take<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.600> hit<00:05:14.810> you've<00:05:15.050> killed<00:05:15.350> one<00:05:15.440> gene

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
they take a hit you've killed one gene

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.700 
they take a hit you've killed one gene
stealer<00:05:16.150> now<00:05:17.150> all<00:05:17.720> that<00:05:18.110> is<00:05:18.169> good<00:05:18.470> but<00:05:18.530> there's

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
stealer now all that is good but there's

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.200 
stealer now all that is good but there's
some<00:05:18.800> other<00:05:18.919> things<00:05:18.979> about<00:05:19.280> these<00:05:19.430> cards<00:05:19.790> each

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
some other things about these cards each
