 some percent tips 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.960
 that very often the applicants 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.619

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.500
 seek dental care 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.570
 in our particular case every time a patient comes with us what 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.620
 first thing he does is ask doctor what can I do now to improve 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.450
 the health status of my teeth 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.630
 and that's why today in this segment I want to share with you some 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.520
 ideas that can serve 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.530
 as a first point 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.740
 we have to take into account and when one eats 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.140
 you have a maximum of 20 minutes after you finished food districts for 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.720
 brush your teeth 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.350
 if you do not do it in this period 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.180
 the bacteria processes begin to multiply inside your mouth and 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.450
 occasional tooth decay and gum disease 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.500
 July main manifestation 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
 it's toothache and bleeding 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.280
 starting with children is very important percent that really are 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.210
 the Popes 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.490
 those who take charge 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.339
 of giving that care and brushing their teeth 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:16.819
 because many times we delegate this important part to children and 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.969
 The problem is that what they do is that young children have not yet 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.830
 developed the psychomotor skill 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.899
 to be able to make a good brushing 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:24.849
 Thus 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.239
 we as parents must supervise and complement the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.239
 brushed allowing the child to do it first 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.910
 so you can develop that skill 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.060
 And in second place 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.149
 we give a review 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.969
 with the simple to what the child 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.059
 and admitted previously 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:46.259
 something very important is that children also floss is used and also 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.589
 it is indispensable to use une 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.979
 in the same way bulls as dentists we can recommend 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:56.449
 which is the best and juan that your children can use in this case in the 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:00.589
 In most cases, it is essential 1040 base of the club that 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.589
 complement what one does here in haiti 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:09.889
 mcquaid hein and talking about the toothbrush and children percent a question 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.199
 that also very often make us good for which this month by 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.789
 brush to taste for 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.239
 the dental hygiene of my children 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.160
 percent 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.780
 we have many alternatives in the market there are uncles 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.329
 specialized in children 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.469
 that also come in different stages therefore it would be necessary to go orienting 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.839
 the choice of the brush 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.959
 depending on the characteristics and age of the child 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:32.969
 for this then 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.079
 with great pleasure we can as poles to be able to be orienting of 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.359
 Customized case of each patient 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.619
 a very important aspect 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.029
 is to be able to clean the teeth as they should be 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:51.439
 therefore that uncle must have certain characteristics among them that is not 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.169
 a safe brush 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.899
 usually people tell us my next doctor checked this period 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.059
 I feel that I do not brush my teeth 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.739
 but more than the hardness of the brush we will depend on the technique that 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.069
 we can implement 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.639
 in the same way and we have a general technique that 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.989
 anyone can use at home but there are times when the 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.539
 patient needs an accompaniment and supervision more people like this 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:16.949
 that in general terms 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.909
 Well, we are going to use our site cleaning the molars from above 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.479
 down 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.509
 trying to make at least 20 movements of this nature we are going to 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:27.140
 avoid 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.379
 the set and ad hoc unison such 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.279
 this brushing is very harmful 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:35.360
 because it will concentrate the force of wear of a very particular area of ​​the 

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:35.970
 tooth 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.110
 which is the union of the police tooth 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.559
 Over the years, some steps will be formed 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.029
 that may be slight you will be 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:48.330
 but July caracuel to features in common this one causes teeth 

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.110
 sensible 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.780
 then a lot of eye is using this technique please you have to 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.159
 modify it trying to print a rotation movement 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.759
 to distribute the force of brushing on the entire surface of the tooth 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.939
 eye achieve the technique that we call neighborhood so you can 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.270
 in this way 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.430
 from top to bottom can clean 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.539
 those in the area of ​​the molars 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:12.789
 of the teeth 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.240
 If it's down, we're going to do the movement backwards 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.259
 bottom up 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.389
 a very important guy 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.590
 the people not descended to by the onct or anyway i have sarcasm to invoke is 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.550
 what's going on 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.029
 as usual 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:29.180
 people 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.919
 or the patient makes this movement in the front teeth 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.900
 when putting the brush in this position 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.999
 You may notice that there are very little sergio hairs that really clean up 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.079
 therefore it is advisable to place cash in a vertical position 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.140
 and allow the whole head of the set and I to clean each of the 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.699
 internal surfaces 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.080
