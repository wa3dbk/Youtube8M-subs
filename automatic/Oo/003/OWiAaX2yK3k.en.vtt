online<00:00:16.530> and<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.430> video<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.760> want<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> talk

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
online and in this video I want to talk

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
online and in this video I want to talk
a<00:00:18.360> little<00:00:18.570> bit<00:00:18.750> about<00:00:18.990> why<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.650> haven't<00:00:19.950> got<00:00:20.040> it

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
a little bit about why we haven't got it

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.620 
a little bit about why we haven't got it
in<00:00:20.190> the<00:00:20.310> West<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.700> when<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.150> expect<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
in the West and when we can expect it

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.090 
in the West and when we can expect it
and<00:00:21.779> also<00:00:21.990> why<00:00:22.290> I<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> call<00:00:23.070> of

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
and also why I think it's the call of

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.680 
and also why I think it's the call of
duty<00:00:23.220> game<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.790> squad<00:00:24.150> fans<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.570> been

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
duty game that a squad fans have been

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.810 
duty game that a squad fans have been
waiting<00:00:24.720> for<00:00:25.220> just<00:00:26.220> before<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.759> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
waiting for just before we get to the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.130 
waiting for just before we get to the
video<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> gameplay<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.689> watching<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
video the gameplay that watching in the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.690 
video the gameplay that watching in the
background<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> call<00:00:28.919> of<00:00:29.040> duty<00:00:29.189> ghosts<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.669> the

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
background is call of duty ghosts on the

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.030 
background is call of duty ghosts on the
castle<00:00:30.540> map<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> don't<00:00:31.710> know<00:00:31.919> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
castle map you know I don't know the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.370 
castle map you know I don't know the
name<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.279> these<00:00:32.369> maps<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.990> think<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.260> some

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
name of these maps and I think it's some

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.890 
name of these maps and I think it's some
team<00:00:34.590> deathmatch<00:00:35.150> so<00:00:36.150> the<00:00:36.270> game<00:00:36.420> call<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.690> duty

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
team deathmatch so the game call of duty

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.530 
team deathmatch so the game call of duty
online<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.560> free-to-play

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
Activision Shanghai and raven software

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.130 
Activision Shanghai and raven software
and<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.580> you<00:00:56.790> don't<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.270> who<00:00:57.420> Raven<00:00:57.780> Software

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and if you don't know who Raven Software

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.980 
and if you don't know who Raven Software
are<00:00:58.560> they<00:00:58.920> developed<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> 2009<00:01:00.270> reboot<00:01:00.840> of

are they developed the 2009 reboot of
Wolfenstein<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.040> think<00:01:02.220> they<00:01:02.340> also<00:01:02.490> might

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
Wolfenstein and I think they also might

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.359 
Wolfenstein and I think they also might
have<00:01:02.850> done<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> quake<00:01:03.360> game<00:01:03.690> among<00:01:04.650> many<00:01:05.129> other

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
have done a quake game among many other

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
have done a quake game among many other
sort<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.840> Wolverine<00:01:06.840> games<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.409> there's<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
sort of Wolverine games and there's a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.600 
sort of Wolverine games and there's a
whole<00:01:07.890> they've<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.490> weird

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
whole they've got a really weird

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.100 
whole they've got a really weird
eclectic<00:01:09.270> range<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.630> games<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.930> they've

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
eclectic range of games that they've

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
eclectic range of games that they've
done<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.040> game's<00:01:11.250> been<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.790> about<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
done and the game's been out for about a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.510 
done and the game's been out for about a
year<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.439> best<00:01:13.560> way<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.799> describe<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
year and the best way to describe it is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.550 
year and the best way to describe it is
it's<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.450> greatest<00:01:15.990> hits<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it's kind of like a greatest hits of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.609 
it's kind of like a greatest hits of
call<00:01:16.859> of<00:01:16.890> duty<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.030> reuses<00:01:18.570> maps<00:01:18.929> character

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
call of duty so it reuses maps character

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.380 
call of duty so it reuses maps character
models<00:01:19.649> weapons<00:01:20.549> perks<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.179> killstreaks

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
models weapons perks and killstreaks

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.419 
models weapons perks and killstreaks
from<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.499> it's<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.770> modern<00:01:22.890> warfare<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
from I think it's the modern warfare and

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:25.340 
from I think it's the modern warfare and
the<00:01:23.490> black<00:01:23.700> ops<00:01:23.909> series<00:01:24.270> which<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.109> kind<00:01:25.289> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the black ops series which is kind of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.510 
the black ops series which is kind of
cool<00:01:25.409> because<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.039> first<00:01:26.249> time<00:01:26.460> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
cool because it's the first time that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.029 
cool because it's the first time that
we've<00:01:26.819> seen<00:01:27.079> Treyarch<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:28.319> infinity<00:01:28.770> ward

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
we've seen Treyarch and infinity ward

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.309 
we've seen Treyarch and infinity ward
stuff<00:01:29.759> sort<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.119> cross<00:01:30.359> over<00:01:30.719> into<00:01:30.749> the<00:01:31.020> same

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
stuff sort of cross over into the same

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.230 
stuff sort of cross over into the same
game<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.069> a<00:01:32.130> lot<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> cod<00:01:32.700> fans<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
game which I think a lot of cod fans and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.550 
game which I think a lot of cod fans and
a<00:01:33.270> lot<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.450> cod<00:01:33.659> enthusiasts<00:01:34.319> have<00:01:34.409> been

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
a lot of cod enthusiasts have been

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:04.139 
stocks and a lot of these I think are

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:05.690 
stocks and a lot of these I think are
just<00:02:04.200> aesthetic<00:02:04.740> only<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.280> don't<00:02:05.310> actually

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
just aesthetic only they don't actually

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.219 
just aesthetic only they don't actually
provide<00:02:05.999> any<00:02:06.240> advantage<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.020> kind<00:02:07.170> of

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
provide any advantage but it's kind of

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.930 
provide any advantage but it's kind of
cool<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.499> there's<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.069> extra<00:02:08.490> level<00:02:08.880> of

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
cool that there's this extra level of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.480 
cool that there's this extra level of
customization<00:02:09.530> which<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.709> think<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.100> lot<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.340> us

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
customization which I think a lot of us

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.309 
customization which I think a lot of us
have<00:02:11.670> been<00:02:11.730> hoping<00:02:12.300> would<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.750> new<00:02:13.050> games

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
have been hoping would be in new games

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.290 
have been hoping would be in new games
which<00:02:13.680> just<00:02:14.010> hasn't<00:02:14.280> happened<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.819> treyarch

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
which just hasn't happened like treyarch

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.750 
which just hasn't happened like treyarch
put<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.780> custom<00:02:16.650> emblem<00:02:17.040> editor<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.670> I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
put in the custom emblem editor and I

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.970 
put in the custom emblem editor and I
know<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:18.030> ghosts<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.659> lot<00:02:18.810> more

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
know that ghosts there's a lot more

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.869 
know that ghosts there's a lot more
choice<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.010> terms<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.519> building<00:02:20.700> your

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
choice in terms of building your

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.449 
choice in terms of building your
character<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:22.019> this<00:02:22.230> definitely<00:02:22.470> takes<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
character but this definitely takes that

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.350 
character but this definitely takes that
sort<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.730> customers

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360

some of the other well-known characters

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.800 
some of the other well-known characters
I<00:02:38.010> don't<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.640> any<00:02:38.880> idea<00:02:39.270> what<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.690> about

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
I don't have any idea what it's about

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.320 
I don't have any idea what it's about
and<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.740> know<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.040> there's<00:02:41.190> also<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.550> zombies

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
and I know that there's also a zombies

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.880 
and I know that there's also a zombies
mode<00:02:42.600> which<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.020> this<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.260> called<00:02:43.470> robot

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
mode which and this is called robot

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.480 
mode which and this is called robot
zombies<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.180> think<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.720> first<00:02:46.290> map<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
zombies and I think the first map is a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.330 
zombies and I think the first map is a
it's<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.210> reused<00:02:48.690> black<00:02:49.110> ops<00:02:49.350> map<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.220> it's

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
it's a reused black ops map but it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.430 
it's a reused black ops map but it's
called<00:02:50.550> cyborg<00:02:51.060> rising<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:51.900> zombies<00:02:52.200> but

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
called cyborg rising so it's zombies but

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.460 
called cyborg rising so it's zombies but
the<00:02:52.590> zombies<00:02:53.010> are<00:02:53.040> robots<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.970> I've<00:02:54.930> thrown

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
the zombies are robots and I've thrown

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.960 
the zombies are robots and I've thrown

don't<00:03:07.890> think<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.190> play<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.459> on<00:03:08.520> Mac

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
don't think you can play it on Mac

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.460 
don't think you can play it on Mac
either<00:03:09.150> i<00:03:09.330> think<00:03:09.570> it's<00:03:09.660> only<00:03:09.959> windows<00:03:10.260> based

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
either i think it's only windows based

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.560 
either i think it's only windows based
at<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.860> moment<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.970> why<00:03:12.120> does<00:03:12.270> this<00:03:12.360> game

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
at the moment so why does this game

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.810 
at the moment so why does this game

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
exists well apparently activision lost

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.310 
exists well apparently activision lost

the publishing rights to call of duty in

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.500 
the publishing rights to call of duty in
China<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.040> console<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:17.790> for<00:03:18.030> 360

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
China for the console so for 360

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.990 
China for the console so for 360
Playstation<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.739> way<00:03:19.980> not<00:03:20.580> exactly<00:03:20.820> sure

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
Playstation and the way not exactly sure

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.640 
Playstation and the way not exactly sure
how<00:03:21.330> they<00:03:21.450> lost<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.780> publishing<00:03:22.140> rights<00:03:22.260> to

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
how they lost the publishing rights to

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.520 
how they lost the publishing rights to
their<00:03:22.770> own<00:03:22.950> game<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:23.900> yeah<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.110> don't<00:03:25.230> know<00:03:25.350> if

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
their own game but yeah I don't know if

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.840 
their own game but yeah I don't know if
anybody<00:03:25.830> can<00:03:25.950> shed<00:03:26.160> some<00:03:26.190> light<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:26.670> I'd

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
anybody can shed some light on that I'd

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.180 
anybody can shed some light on that I'd
be<00:03:27.000> really<00:03:27.150> getting<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.660> know<00:03:27.709> but<00:03:28.709> that's<00:03:28.980> why

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
be really getting to know but that's why

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.640 
be really getting to know but that's why
it's<00:03:29.340> PC<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.120> pc<00:03:30.450> only<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.140> it's<00:03:31.350> kind<00:03:31.560> of

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
it's PC and pc only and it's kind of

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.620 
it's PC and pc only and it's kind of
good<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:31.890> way<00:03:32.160> for<00:03:32.430> China<00:03:32.640> because<00:03:32.940> pcs<00:03:33.360> hold

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
good that way for China because pcs hold

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.810 
good that way for China because pcs hold
the<00:03:33.750> dominant<00:03:34.110> share<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.440> gaming<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.040> China

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
the dominant share of gaming in China

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.780 
the dominant share of gaming in China
anyway<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:37.049> if<00:03:37.380> in<00:03:37.830> fact<00:03:38.010> division<00:03:38.430> wanted<00:03:38.700> to

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
anyway so if in fact division wanted to

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.550 
anyway so if in fact division wanted to
make<00:03:38.970> money<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.720> Chinese<00:03:40.049> market<00:03:40.080> which

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
make money in the Chinese market which

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.259 
make money in the Chinese market which
is<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.739> reasonably<00:03:41.160> big<00:03:41.430> market<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.030> believe

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
is a reasonably big market and I believe

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.289 
is a reasonably big market and I believe
they're<00:03:42.450> pretty<00:03:42.690> big<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.200> gaming<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:44.340> pc<00:03:45.060> is

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
they're pretty big on gaming then pc is

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.360 
they're pretty big on gaming then pc is
definitely<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.870> way<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.049> go<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.769> think<00:03:47.220> also

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
definitely the way to go I think also

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.470 
definitely the way to go I think also
this<00:03:47.610> is<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> good<00:03:47.910> opportunity<00:03:48.030> for

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
this is a good opportunity for

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.620 
this is a good opportunity for
Activision<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.440> sort<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.340> test<00:03:50.730> out<00:03:51.000> this<00:03:51.330> sort

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
Activision to sort of test out this sort

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.780 
Activision to sort of test out this sort
of<00:03:51.690> free-to-play<00:03:52.580> microtransaction<00:03:53.580> based

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
of free-to-play microtransaction based

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.910 
of free-to-play microtransaction based
system<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.480> see<00:03:54.750> whether<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.170> would<00:03:55.290> work<00:03:55.590> in

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
system and see whether it would work in

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.340 
system and see whether it would work in
the<00:03:56.040> west<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.549> also<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.780> think<00:03:57.900> they're<00:03:58.170> trying

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
the west and also I think they're trying

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.770 
the west and also I think they're trying
to<00:03:58.470> gauge<00:03:58.680> how<00:03:59.370> badly<00:03:59.700> it<00:04:00.060> would<00:04:00.239> affect<00:04:00.540> their

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
to gauge how badly it would affect their

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.900 
to gauge how badly it would affect their
core<00:04:01.140> franchise<00:04:01.680> obviously<00:04:02.459> Activision

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
core franchise obviously Activision

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.340 
core franchise obviously Activision
don't<00:04:03.060> want<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.239> do<00:04:03.330> anything<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.840> risk<00:04:04.019> the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
don't want to do anything to risk the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.229 
don't want to do anything to risk the
core<00:04:04.680> call<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.070> duty<00:04:05.310> franchise<00:04:05.519> which<00:04:06.090> is

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
core call of duty franchise which is

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.670 
core call of duty franchise which is
obviously<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.660> multi-billion<00:04:07.530> dollar

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
obviously a multi-billion dollar

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.560 
obviously a multi-billion dollar
industry<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.370> each<00:04:08.580> year<00:04:08.610> comes<00:04:09.150> out<00:04:09.360> and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
industry that each year comes out and

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.199 
industry that each year comes out and
just<00:04:09.810> smashes<00:04:10.290> records<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.920> think<00:04:11.700> even<00:04:11.820> ghosts

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
just smashes records I think even ghosts

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.789 
just smashes records I think even ghosts
might<00:04:12.450> have<00:04:12.570> smashed<00:04:12.840> records<00:04:13.170> i<00:04:13.500> don't<00:04:13.680> think

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
might have smashed records i don't think

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.580 
might have smashed records i don't think
it's<00:04:13.920> sold<00:04:14.130> as<00:04:14.310> many<00:04:14.489> copies<00:04:14.760> as<00:04:15.080> black<00:04:16.080> ops<00:04:16.260> 2

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
it's sold as many copies as black ops 2

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.729 
it's sold as many copies as black ops 2
or<00:04:16.890> even<00:04:17.340> modern<00:04:18.090> warfare<00:04:18.209> 3<00:04:18.530> but<00:04:19.530> i<00:04:19.560> do

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
or even modern warfare 3 but i do

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.710 
or even modern warfare 3 but i do
believe<00:04:19.950> that<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.400> opening<00:04:20.940> or<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.299> day<00:04:21.450> one

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
believe that the opening or the day one

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.840 
believe that the opening or the day one
sales<00:04:22.109> broke<00:04:22.620> some<00:04:23.010> sort<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.280> records<00:04:23.669> anyway

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
sales broke some sort of records anyway

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.280 
sales broke some sort of records anyway
they<00:04:24.030> make<00:04:24.180> about<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.419> billion<00:04:24.750> dollars<00:04:25.140> every

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
they make about a billion dollars every

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.810 
they make about a billion dollars every
time<00:04:25.560> they<00:04:25.710> release<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:25.979> game<00:04:26.220> which<00:04:26.400> is<00:04:26.580> pretty

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
time they release a game which is pretty

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.480 
time they release a game which is pretty
good<00:04:27.169> so<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.260> big<00:04:28.290> question<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:28.800> why<00:04:29.100> don't<00:04:29.160> we

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
good so the big question is why don't we

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.070 
good so the big question is why don't we
have<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.790> in<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.090> west<00:04:30.390> now<00:04:30.720> sort<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.020> going

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
have it in the west now sort of going

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.020 
have it in the west now sort of going
over<00:04:31.740> some<00:04:31.919> of<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.070> things<00:04:32.340> like<00:04:32.520> Activision

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
over some of the things like Activision

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.640 
over some of the things like Activision
maybe<00:04:33.210> being<00:04:33.450> afraid<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.260> would<00:04:34.410> ruin

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
maybe being afraid that it would ruin

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.320 
maybe being afraid that it would ruin
their<00:04:34.950> core<00:04:35.220> business<00:04:35.250> model<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.090> perhaps

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
their core business model and perhaps

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.750 
their core business model and perhaps
there

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
there

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.910 
there
doing<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.120> test<00:04:37.360> bed<00:04:37.570> they<00:04:38.140> have<00:04:38.320> actually<00:04:38.470> said

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
doing a test bed they have actually said

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.460 
doing a test bed they have actually said
I<00:04:38.950> think<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.910> CEO<00:04:40.390> Bobby<00:04:40.630> Kotick<00:04:41.170> Bobby

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
I think the CEO Bobby Kotick Bobby

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.800 
I think the CEO Bobby Kotick Bobby
Kotick<00:04:42.130> I<00:04:42.400> believe<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.060> he<00:04:43.360> said<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:43.780> the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
Kotick I believe that he said that the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.810 
Kotick I believe that he said that the
game<00:04:44.020> may<00:04:44.470> be<00:04:44.500> globally<00:04:45.220> available<00:04:45.310> depending

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
game may be globally available depending

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.620 
game may be globally available depending
on<00:04:46.150> how<00:04:46.270> successful<00:04:46.510> it<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.260> in<00:04:47.530> China<00:04:47.950> and

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
on how successful it is in China and

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.240 
on how successful it is in China and
yeah<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.660> don't<00:04:50.380> know<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.770> doesn't<00:04:50.920> fill

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
yeah I don't know that that doesn't fill

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.580 
yeah I don't know that that doesn't fill
me<00:04:51.370> with<00:04:51.400> hope<00:04:51.790> because<00:04:52.300> typically<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.110> Asian

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
me with hope because typically the Asian

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.020 
me with hope because typically the Asian
markets<00:04:53.920> haven't<00:04:54.190> been<00:04:54.280> huge<00:04:54.550> in<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.820> first

stuff<00:06:08.920> that<00:06:08.950> they<00:06:09.130> have<00:06:09.340> to<00:06:09.460> jump<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:09.910> lots<00:06:10.090> of

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
stuff that they have to jump and lots of

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.670 
stuff that they have to jump and lots of
testing<00:06:10.600> and<00:06:10.750> all<00:06:10.810> that<00:06:10.960> sort<00:06:11.140> of<00:06:11.230> stuff<00:06:11.320> and

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
testing and all that sort of stuff and

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.740 
testing and all that sort of stuff and
if<00:06:11.770> it's<00:06:11.890> a<00:06:11.980> free<00:06:12.130> free-to-play<00:06:12.670> model<00:06:12.910> then<00:06:13.480> I

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
if it's a free free-to-play model then I

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.180 
if it's a free free-to-play model then I
think<00:06:13.930> that<00:06:14.050> would<00:06:14.140> be<00:06:14.200> directly<00:06:14.920> in

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
think that would be directly in

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.910 
think that would be directly in
competition<00:06:15.910> with<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.210> paid<00:06:16.840> version<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.830> I

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
competition with the paid version and I

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.260 
competition with the paid version and I
don't<00:06:18.100> activision<00:06:18.760> would<00:06:18.850> want<00:06:19.030> to<00:06:19.120> do<00:06:19.240> that

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
don't activision would want to do that

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.180 
don't activision would want to do that
at<00:06:19.570> all<00:06:19.750> but<00:06:20.020> even<00:06:20.380> though<00:06:20.470> I'm<00:06:20.500> not<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:20.770> PC

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
at all but even though I'm not a PC

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.650 
at all but even though I'm not a PC
player<00:06:21.430> I<00:06:21.460> would<00:06:21.760> definitely<00:06:21.910> like<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.330> see

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
player I would definitely like to see

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.330 
player I would definitely like to see
this<00:06:22.810> game<00:06:23.020> available<00:06:23.290> in<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.800> West<00:06:24.010> I<00:06:24.190> have

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
this game available in the West I have

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.070 
this game available in the West I have
played<00:06:24.580> call<00:06:24.850> of<00:06:24.880> duty<00:06:25.180> on<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.390> pc<00:06:25.750> and<00:06:25.780> it<00:06:25.990> is

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
played call of duty on the pc and it is

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.540 
played call of duty on the pc and it is
a<00:06:26.110> whole<00:06:26.320> lot<00:06:26.500> of<00:06:26.590> fun<00:06:26.740> even<00:06:27.010> though<00:06:27.160> i<00:06:27.190> really

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
a whole lot of fun even though i really

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.760 
a whole lot of fun even though i really
suck<00:06:27.790> with<00:06:28.000> the<00:06:28.060> mouse<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.270> keyboard<00:06:28.660> I<00:06:29.080> don't

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
suck with the mouse and keyboard I don't

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.200 
suck with the mouse and keyboard I don't
think<00:06:29.800> Activision<00:06:30.400> really<00:06:30.610> have<00:06:30.760> anything<00:06:30.970> to

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
think Activision really have anything to

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.880 
think Activision really have anything to
worry<00:06:31.450> about<00:06:31.540> I<00:06:31.780> don't<00:06:32.170> think<00:06:32.440> that<00:06:32.650> the

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
worry about I don't think that the

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.620 
worry about I don't think that the
release<00:06:33.130> of<00:06:33.280> this<00:06:33.370> game<00:06:33.580> outside<00:06:33.820> China<00:06:34.390> would

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
release of this game outside China would

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.450 
release of this game outside China would
negatively<00:06:34.870> affect<00:06:35.200> the<00:06:35.740> core<00:06:35.920> franchise

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
negatively affect the core franchise

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.120 
negatively affect the core franchise
particularly<00:06:37.360> if<00:06:37.510> it's<00:06:37.660> only<00:06:37.810> on<00:06:38.080> pc<00:06:38.560> i<00:06:38.770> think

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
particularly if it's only on pc i think

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.560 
particularly if it's only on pc i think
it<00:06:39.220> would<00:06:39.310> actually<00:06:39.370> get<00:06:39.790> more<00:06:40.090> people<00:06:40.420> who

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
it would actually get more people who

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.390 
it would actually get more people who
don't<00:06:40.870> play<00:06:41.050> call<00:06:41.410> of<00:06:41.440> duty<00:06:41.590> into<00:06:42.160> call<00:06:42.370> of

don't play call of duty into call of

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.370 
don't play call of duty into call of

price tag here in australia keeps a lot

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.399 
price tag here in australia keeps a lot

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
of casual players out of it

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.929 
of casual players out of it
and<00:06:50.529> I<00:06:50.739> think<00:06:50.800> that<00:06:51.189> a<00:06:51.219> lot<00:06:51.429> of<00:06:51.489> people<00:06:51.580> that

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:51.939 
and I think that a lot of people that

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:53.489 
and I think that a lot of people that
might<00:06:52.119> get<00:06:52.330> into<00:06:52.599> call<00:06:52.779> of<00:06:52.809> duty<00:06:53.139> generally

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:53.499 
might get into call of duty generally

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:54.689 
might get into call of duty generally
just<00:06:53.679> sort<00:06:54.069> of<00:06:54.099> let<00:06:54.309> it<00:06:54.339> go<00:06:54.519> by<00:06:54.669> because

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:54.699 
just sort of let it go by because

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.070 
just sort of let it go by because
they're<00:06:55.149> like<00:06:55.239> I<00:06:55.449> don't<00:06:55.479> really<00:06:55.839> feel<00:06:55.929> like

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
they're like I don't really feel like

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.449 
they're like I don't really feel like
investing<00:06:56.649> that<00:06:56.769> much<00:06:56.949> but<00:06:57.129> if<00:06:57.219> it<00:06:57.309> was<00:06:57.399> a

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:57.459 
investing that much but if it was a

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.029 
investing that much but if it was a
free-to-play<00:06:57.999> kind<00:06:58.300> of<00:06:58.449> model<00:06:58.749> and<00:06:58.929> you<00:06:59.830> could

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
free-to-play kind of model and you could

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.309 
free-to-play kind of model and you could
you<00:07:00.189> know<00:07:00.309> buy<00:07:00.550> extra<00:07:01.089> perks<00:07:01.419> and<00:07:01.779> I<00:07:01.989> don't<00:07:02.229> I
