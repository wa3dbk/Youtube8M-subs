00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.870
 now all painted white speak 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.180
 snowfall and that is a standard here 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.939
 fought the enemy two kind of this my 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.890
 drive the bc 25 dollars 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.840

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.380

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.780
 that a 14 medium tank of the french 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.489
 If one of us has more of a car 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.470
 charging system and when finished 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.120
 upstream five grenades, a 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.379
 quick shot intended to go 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.379
 He also has only 30 grenades on board 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.990
 and occasionally 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.290
 I enjoy him most of the time me 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:06.780
 I'm not necessarily the big medium fan 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.620
 or friend but what the hell let that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.220
 start games 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.560
 it's a car warehouse and that can be 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.640
 become quite interesting and to another 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.190
 also this bachelor de jong is one 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.190
 Classic speak 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.370
 whether at cbs or other 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.620
 affairs he is always a good one 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.020
 choice 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.810
 especially people who have previously been in medium 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.090
 can play or very much like to play 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.030
 in their hands this is a devil sting 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.130
 I try my best and I have to 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.780
 I'm also saying to you earlier and 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.330
 much better 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.020
 on the topic of driving medium 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.729
 Now I'm just here 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:02.490
 by rushing anything big providers daily 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.490
 We want to be as fast as possible 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.120
 but the thing use that here no 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.769
 opponent is good there is one 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.010
 he's just shooting himself with others 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.670
 People we will deal with and 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.150
 give it a miss a long time 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.150
 switched off 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.300
 kyrgiakos auto lahrs believes grad 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.770
 shot 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.770
 Let's go with two 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.030
 and we would even take our time to 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.280
 reload 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.960
 I shows the opponents of when I 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.690
 I think that's what I do again and again 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.530
 happy to have your own team 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.800
 know 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.430
 that is just can not count on me 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.220
 or if I behave in a typical way 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.540
 talk about games or withdraw me 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.910
 to know that is no offer he is on 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.709
 load and then that's it too 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.910
 one or the other sometimes understand that 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.910
 I behave somehow funny 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:27.180
 yes , I only have this vehicle 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:29.310
 standard ammunition on board or with left 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.860
 I did not want to shoot because he is me 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.470
 but I sucked there 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.519
 maybe another vehicle 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.780
 that could stand there for 90s could 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.120
 so have the thing at 95 he 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.950
 always to shoot at the few minutes 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.950
 when going 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.329
 honestly 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.250
 I have a bit in front of him 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.250
 respect 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.829
 if I'm honest 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.320
 respect is not good at summer 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.320
 I am still full life for it 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.280
 just the speed 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.280
 Exploitation I thought to myself 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.330
 big vehicle switched off 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.340
 once on the chain 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.400
 weak points do not move against now 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.880
 What should I do when I'm loading my 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.320
 team moves forward 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.050
 and with that the thing is won 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.110
 It has not been a nice game though 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.870
 you have seen something 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.259
 Risked one comes simply with the opponent 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.259
 by 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.060
 means the flank was actually 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.879
 not defended I'm just 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.240
 slipped through and have the opportunity 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.889
 The human being has to be packed 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.050
 sometimes that was just one 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.280
 superior badge third class 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.819
 so nothing special 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.620
 not a great achievement but at the 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.840
 evaluation if I'm in the top 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.810
 Third, I say so big so completely 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.370
 it was not bad then apparently 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:52.569
 eight shots fired seven direct 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:55.629
 strike five effective strike in 1557 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.740
 over 300 meters distance of 792 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.620
 done harm 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.750
 a hit I received an opponent 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.909
 discovers four enemies damaged two 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.779
 shamelessly annihilates players 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:10.750
 support 617 points 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:14.080
 then thanks to premium 20 1511

 Credits net profit without a great 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.110
 we still have 8500 66 credits 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.389

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:27.069
 and since, and was doubling for combat are 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:29.770
 she researched all 2022 research points 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:31.750
 fast nothing special fights that 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.500
 Other people can spend a lot of money 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.779
 better but you were live speaking 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.960
 recorded live as you just as well 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:41.150
 times 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.300
 by washing can because the opponent one 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.180
 flank completely neglected one must 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.960
 Feel it is possible or not 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.310
 I was lucky 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.020
 And that does not happen to me either 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.080
 day that the opponent a flank completely 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.780
 give up what should I have won 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.229
 had my fun and I'll say 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:08.810
 so battles from it fits one already 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:10.610
 made a sea and victory 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.449
 I want to say goodbye to that 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.449
 google can
