00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820
 my topic you are in front of both 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:13.259
 flowers 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:17.460
 We wait for the time to pick it up 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.740
 we first place schavan throws the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 lance and every enemy lux begins with the 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.750
 heavy gear and everything goes like this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.539
 everyone quickly gets you everything out 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.510
 nobody knows who we're going to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.840
 the current and the opponent again 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.559
 only dogs a lot then surface match 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.620
 The advice must be European the first time 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.230
 listened to and all celebrate in the chat 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.610
 but we have the opponents again 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.489
 grossly underestimated 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.270
 They jump baby monkeys out of the high 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.180
 grass 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.040
 a double here is a triple existence 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.720
 that does not exclude shit on the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.550
 Fehlmann I 'll turn the page up 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.470
 I think the type of the top line is a type 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.010
 would finally be used so high onslaught 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.570
 resch green lanterns I'll go the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.740
 time is right 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:17.030
 but so close does their ultimo ignite 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.030
 propaganda games part 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.440
 and everything goes so fast every home 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.040
 Legally no one knows to go on little 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.380
 on cause for electricity and 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.470
 the enemy again my dogs a lot 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.490
 surface then I grab me the advice must 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.490
 European a double rank good and all 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.100
 celebrate in chat but we have the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.260
 opponents once again underestimated 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.410
 they jump like the monkeys 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.080
 the high grass out a triple here 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.940
 you do not even walk square 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.530
 honest you can not get away 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.180
 I wanted to get an airbag there 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.980
 I already could not do what 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.690
 nothing is more with the ultima 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.310
 schavan as a dragon what do you want to do there 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.350
 against such a kite and find with 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 the 4s could freak out we have it 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.830
 you recognized that was never more for us 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.830
 play with walls ups
