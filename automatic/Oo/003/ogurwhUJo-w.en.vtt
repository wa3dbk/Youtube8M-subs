00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
I got to be careful of you know how much

I got to be careful of you know how much
weight<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.300> try<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.719> focus

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
weight that I use I try to really focus

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.450

more<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> volume<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.039> pushing<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.309> blood

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
more on the volume and pushing the blood

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.429

through<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
different style pull downs really get my

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179

on<00:01:55.010> a<00:01:55.070> couple<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.430> days<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.850> drop<00:01:56.060> my<00:01:56.090> carbs

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
on a couple of days and I drop my carbs

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.050 
on a couple of days and I drop my carbs
out<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:57.470> know<00:01:57.590> less<00:01:57.770> than<00:01:57.920> 50<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.250> day<00:01:58.310> but<00:01:59.000> I

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
out to you know less than 50 a day but I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.250 
out to you know less than 50 a day but I
do<00:01:59.120> keep<00:01:59.300> my<00:01:59.420> calories<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.780> little<00:01:59.960> bit<00:02:00.080> higher

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
do keep my calories a little bit higher

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.380 
do keep my calories a little bit higher
that<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.130> did<00:02:01.310> previously<00:02:01.700> try<00:02:02.120> to<00:02:02.180> keep<00:02:02.330> a

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
that I did previously try to keep a

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.450 
that I did previously try to keep a
little<00:02:02.480> more<00:02:02.630> size<00:02:02.900> on<00:02:03.140> than<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.380> did<00:02:03.560> I<00:02:03.740> came<00:02:04.250> in

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
little more size on than I did I came in

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.740 
little more size on than I did I came in
real<00:02:04.640> lean<00:02:04.790> for<00:02:04.970> Junior<00:02:05.150> Nationals<00:02:05.540> which<00:02:05.630> was

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
real lean for Junior Nationals which was

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.480 
real lean for Junior Nationals which was
a<00:02:05.840> great<00:02:06.020> thing<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.440> want<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.890> come<00:02:07.010> in<00:02:07.130> just<00:02:07.340> as

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
a great thing I want to come in just as

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.400 
a great thing I want to come in just as
lean<00:02:07.700> for<00:02:07.820> North<00:02:07.970> Americans<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:09.260> I<00:02:09.290> have<00:02:09.380> a

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
lean for North Americans but I have a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.170 
lean for North Americans but I have a
little<00:02:09.619> bit<00:02:09.710> more<00:02:09.860> weight<00:02:10.070> on<00:02:10.310> this<00:02:10.730> time<00:02:10.940> to

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
little bit more weight on this time to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.340 
little bit more weight on this time to
keep<00:02:11.300> that<00:02:11.420> little<00:02:11.600> bit<00:02:11.750> more<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.960> size<00:02:12.140> when

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
keep that little bit more the size when

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.500 
keep that little bit more the size when
I<00:02:12.410> get<00:02:12.560> on<00:02:12.650> stage<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.880> give<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:14.330> bit

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
I get on stage to give that a little bit

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.570 
I get on stage to give that a little bit
more<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.870> larger<00:02:15.710> appearance<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.340> speak

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
more of a larger appearance so to speak

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.630 
more of a larger appearance so to speak
as<00:02:17.360> far<00:02:17.540> as<00:02:17.660> training<00:02:18.020> goes<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.920> haven't<00:02:19.400> really

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
as far as training goes I haven't really

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.490 
as far as training goes I haven't really
changed<00:02:19.790> my<00:02:19.970> training<00:02:20.300> too<00:02:20.480> much<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:20.930> far<00:02:21.290> as

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
changed my training too much as far as

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.800 
changed my training too much as far as
what<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:21.800> did<00:02:22.040> previously<00:02:22.420> I've<00:02:23.420> actually<00:02:23.600> gone

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
what I did previously I've actually gone

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.030 
what I did previously I've actually gone
a<00:02:23.870> little<00:02:24.080> bit<00:02:24.170> more<00:02:24.320> higher<00:02:24.500> volume<00:02:24.920> though

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
a little bit more higher volume though

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.440 
a little bit more higher volume though
so<00:02:25.580> like<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.760> said<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.240> go<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> little

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
so like I said I like to go a little

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.360 
so like I said I like to go a little
more<00:02:26.630> higher<00:02:26.750> volume<00:02:27.110> anyway<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:28.280> I've

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
more higher volume anyway but I've

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.830 
more higher volume anyway but I've
actually<00:02:28.490> increased<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.210> this<00:02:29.390> time<00:02:29.630> with

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
actually increased that this time with

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.290 
actually increased that this time with
everybody<00:02:30.380> part<00:02:30.710> legs<00:02:31.490> even<00:02:31.820> I've<00:02:31.940> tried<00:02:32.210> to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
everybody part legs even I've tried to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.050 
everybody part legs even I've tried to
go<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.960> little<00:02:33.620> um<00:02:33.860> higher<00:02:34.070> volume<00:02:34.520> even<00:02:34.910> though

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
go a little um higher volume even though

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.970 
go a little um higher volume even though
it's<00:02:35.150> don't<00:02:35.720> show<00:02:36.020> on<00:02:36.200> stage<00:02:36.470> for<00:02:36.710> us<00:02:36.740> men's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
it's don't show on stage for us men's

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.800 
it's don't show on stage for us men's
with<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.250> guys<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.760> found<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.660> really

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
with you guys I found that it really

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.480 
with you guys I found that it really
brings<00:02:39.260> out<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.440> lot<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> leanest<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.400> my

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
brings out a lot of the leanest of my

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.370 
brings out a lot of the leanest of my
body<00:02:40.670> as<00:02:40.850> well<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.270> hitting<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.960> know<00:02:42.080> squats

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
body as well so hitting you know squats

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.170 
body as well so hitting you know squats
and<00:02:42.560> leg<00:02:42.650> presses<00:02:43.040> at<00:02:43.190> 20<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.610> 30<00:02:43.790> reps<00:02:43.940> at<00:02:44.120> a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
and leg presses at 20 to 30 reps at a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:56.230 
and leg presses at 20 to 30 reps at a
time<00:02:52.959> yeah<00:02:53.959> as<00:02:54.140> far<00:02:54.350> as<00:02:54.730> bringing<00:02:55.730> things<00:02:55.940> up

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
time yeah as far as bringing things up

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.370 
time yeah as far as bringing things up
you<00:02:56.360> know<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.570> biggest<00:02:56.840> thing<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.110> focusing

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
you know the biggest thing is focusing

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.550 
you know the biggest thing is focusing
on<00:02:57.410> my<00:02:57.500> back<00:02:57.680> only<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.880> even<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.690> out<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.989> guess<00:03:00.260> I

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
on my back only to even it out I guess I

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.910 
on my back only to even it out I guess I
have<00:03:01.040> some<00:03:01.510> imbalances<00:03:02.510> in<00:03:02.540> my<00:03:02.690> muscle<00:03:03.020> as<00:03:03.739> far

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
have some imbalances in my muscle as far

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.860 
have some imbalances in my muscle as far
as<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.130> goes<00:03:04.310> from<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.760> my<00:03:05.120> symmetry<00:03:05.660> wise

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
as that goes from so my symmetry wise

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.600 
as that goes from so my symmetry wise
I've<00:03:06.200> tried<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.530> even<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.920> out<00:03:06.980> as<00:03:07.220> best<00:03:07.430> as

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
I've tried to even that out as best as

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.340 
I've tried to even that out as best as
possible<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.150> find<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.480> with<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.200> higher

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
possible and I find that with the higher

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.510 
possible and I find that with the higher
volume<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.739> helps<00:03:09.980> out<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.100> little<00:03:10.280> bit

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
volume that helps out a little bit

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.460 
volume that helps out a little bit
everything<00:03:11.180> else<00:03:11.450> I've<00:03:11.630> liked<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.989> size<00:03:12.260> of

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
everything else I've liked the size of

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.870 
everything else I've liked the size of
it<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.680> want<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.040> simply<00:03:13.310> keep<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.700> size

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
it I want to just simply keep the size

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.610 
it I want to just simply keep the size
I'm<00:03:14.270> gonna<00:03:14.420> have<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.750> bring<00:03:14.900> up<00:03:15.080> too<00:03:15.230> much<00:03:15.440> of

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
I'm gonna have to bring up too much of

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.880 
I'm gonna have to bring up too much of
it

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
it

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.830 
it
my<00:03:16.370> back<00:03:16.520> was<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.730> number<00:03:17.000> one<00:03:17.120> focus<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:17.570> from

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
my back was a number one focus so from

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.800 
my back was a number one focus so from
junior<00:03:18.260> nationals
