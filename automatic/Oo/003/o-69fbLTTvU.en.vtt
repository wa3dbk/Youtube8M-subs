ghosts I know it has been at quite a
while<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.910> I'm<00:00:14.969> actually<00:00:15.089> trying<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.690> use<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
while but I'm actually trying to use a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.800 
while but I'm actually trying to use a
new<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> new<00:00:16.650> killer<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.609> new<00:00:17.910> perk<00:00:18.300> other

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
new a new killer a new perk other

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.990 
new a new killer a new perk other
minerals<00:00:19.470> could<00:00:19.650> wiretap<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:20.670> if<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.850> guys

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
minerals could wiretap then if you guys

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.429 
minerals could wiretap then if you guys
have<00:00:21.150> used<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.630> think<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:22.080> basically

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
have used it but I think it's basically

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.630 
have used it but I think it's basically
meant<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.660> basically<00:00:24.660> use<00:00:24.920> every<00:00:25.920> SATCOM<00:00:26.460> on

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
meant to basically use every SATCOM on

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.390 
meant to basically use every SATCOM on
the<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.510> map<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:28.109> your<00:00:28.470> own<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.010> hopefully

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the on the map as your own so hopefully

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.209 
the on the map as your own so hopefully
if<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.449> plates<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.439> other<00:00:31.529> another

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
if I plates this and other another

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.250 
if I plates this and other another
enemies<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.759> got<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.180> know<00:00:33.270> maybe<00:00:33.570> two

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
enemies have got like you know maybe two

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.690 
enemies have got like you know maybe two
or<00:00:34.290> three<00:00:34.440> sack<00:00:34.920> comes<00:00:35.070> down<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.399> well<00:00:35.520> then

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
or three sack comes down as well then

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.130 
or three sack comes down as well then
I'd<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:35.940> an<00:00:36.030> advanced<00:00:36.329> UAV<00:00:36.510> which<00:00:36.840> i<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
I'd get an advanced UAV which i think is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.209 
I'd get an advanced UAV which i think is
going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.380> pretty<00:00:37.530> useful<00:00:37.800> when<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> are

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
going to be pretty useful when you are

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.400 
going to be pretty useful when you are
playing<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.850> team<00:00:39.420> deathmatch<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.050> let's<00:00:40.200> try

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
think our best chance is trying to look

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.590 
think our best chance is trying to look
for<00:00:59.280> people<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.730> side<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> map<00:01:00.300> over

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
for people on that side the map over

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.760 
for people on that side the map over
there<00:01:01.730> as<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> guy<00:01:03.000> over<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.979> we<00:01:04.979> got<00:01:05.100> him

there as a guy over there we got him

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.570 
there as a guy over there we got him
jump<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.310> actually<00:01:08.400> using

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
jump down here I'm not actually using

stalker<00:01:08.970> by<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.689> looks<00:01:09.869> like

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
stalker by the way so if it looks like

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
stalker by the way so if it looks like
I'm<00:01:10.049> aiming<00:01:10.470> pretty<00:01:10.710> slowly<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.760> basically

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
I'm aiming pretty slowly it's basically

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 
I'm aiming pretty slowly it's basically
because<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.330> am<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.710> competitive

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
because I am it's because in competitive

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.800

you<00:01:14.369> don't<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.670> store<00:01:14.970> care<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.479> figured

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you don't have store care and I figured

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
you don't have store care and I figured
you<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.229> still<00:01:16.950> couldn't<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.310> make

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you know I still couldn't really make

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
you know I still couldn't really make
too<00:01:17.850> much<00:01:18.090> difference<00:01:18.150> i<00:01:18.689> guess<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.140> be

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
too much difference i guess it can be

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.510 
too much difference i guess it can be
annoying<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.650> you're<00:01:19.770> trying<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> know

kills<00:05:58.080> which<00:05:58.380> I<00:05:58.650> think<00:05:59.520> it<00:05:59.640> is<00:05:59.669> probably<00:05:59.880> going

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
kills which I think it is probably going

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.960 
kills which I think it is probably going
to<00:06:00.180> be<00:06:00.240> a<00:06:00.300> bit<00:06:00.540> unlikely<00:06:00.870> in<00:06:01.260> all<00:06:01.380> honesty<00:06:01.970> it's

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
to be a bit unlikely in all honesty it's

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.370 
to be a bit unlikely in all honesty it's
pretty<00:06:03.360> difficult<00:06:03.570> to<00:06:03.840> try<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.110> get<00:06:04.229> the

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
pretty difficult to try and get the

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.200 
pretty difficult to try and get the
amount<00:06:04.890> of<00:06:04.919> kills<00:06:05.130> I<00:06:05.400> thought<00:06:05.610> we<00:06:05.729> can't<00:06:06.030> get

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
amount of kills I thought we can't get

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.350 
amount of kills I thought we can't get
it<00:06:06.300> now<00:06:06.450> ah<00:06:07.010> we<00:06:08.010> could<00:06:08.160> have<00:06:08.250> had<00:06:08.400> it<00:06:08.430> there<00:06:08.669> 28
