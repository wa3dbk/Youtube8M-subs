00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.690
 the description next to the source of the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.130
 news that knows with all dotcom well 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.140
 like the boys 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.540
 if there is an art director here 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.730
 senior forget to throw the offer because 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.920
 work in microsoft has to have 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.170
 his little things is to say that the important 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.990
 of the job offer is not the illusion 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.910
 yes but what is not written in it 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.880
 because every time Microsoft hires 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.170
 workers for a franchise 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.510
 important that has been announced with the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.430
 priority is usually referred to 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.770
 her by name for example if you 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.370
 speaks of forza heart halloween software 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.770
 because it refers to the name or 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.460
 less to the study that is involved 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.440
 but the lack of the data that I am 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.210
 mentioning now indicates that the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.580
 important franchise has not yet been 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.000
 announced and that microsoft then wants 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.310
 keep it secret plus the offer 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.040
 he mentions that he must master in depth 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.240
 of 2d and 3d so the franchise 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.990
 could have a mixture of both styles 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.450
 what is microsoft doing I do not know when 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.030
 we will do it it is too early for it to be 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.580
 announced at e3 but I 'm sure that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.750
 we will see it this way throughout the year 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.489
