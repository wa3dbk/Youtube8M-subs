00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 I bathe garcia got into trouble 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.069
 point in man and who opposes flashed 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.680
 but successfully this not concerned but 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.250
 backing away that I keep there as at 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.230
 left 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.920
 you people its forms at 80 hd I hope 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.880
 that you are well 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.320
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.790
 video that's going to be pretty short so like 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.119
 you all know I'm on vacation 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.770
 at the moment I see you this video 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.810
 so this is a video that will talk to you 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.830
 league debrief 1 in the direction where down 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.000
 it's true that it's something that 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.620
 is not badly expected on this channel 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.940
 so it will not be the paris debrief anymore 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.350
 holy germain it will be debrief league 1 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.170
 as you know I'm on vacation 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.220
 so I will inevitably start at the 3rd 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.080
 day because when I come back from vacation 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.210
 in fact it will be the 3rd day of league 1 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.940
 I think as I go on vacation 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.800
 maybe I'll register and do 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.090
 the first the first jets it's up to 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.880
 say the first day the second 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.470
 day straight down during my 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.570
 holiday in the evening after the matches the 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.820
 summaries and so knows how it goes 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.899
 spend this season I'll be alone I 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.460
 know that I talked about doing a 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.790
 team and it's with every supporter of 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.710
 club 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.050
 I contacted people I 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.219
 contacted people is there so y'a 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.360
 my phone ringing I do not know if 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.320
 you hear I contacted 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.879
 people and unfortunately these 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.110
 people made me miss this is at 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.450
 to say that I actually contacted them 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.440
 the feeling went well I had spoken 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.090
 with them and that's what happened 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.530
 it is precisely that people have 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.670
 failed in the sense that they gave me 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.590
 says that they actually did not go 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.420
 to be available and so it's 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.920
 I had three out of four people there 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.119
 finally on the four people who 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.280
 I contacted there are three who have 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.740
 do it so bah so here 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.060
 unfortunately it will not be it will not be 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.409
 possible so I have not continue to 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.939
 contact other people I did not 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.920
 not bother besides their 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.270
 send a message of excuses so I 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.560
 apologize for what sent me 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.630
 stuff now like that it's done 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.799
 so you had actually it will be under the 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.729
 same format that I had done that the 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.439
 league of champions that is to say that I 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.000
 go debrief and every game so that 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.659
 will not be a particular club but this 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.670
 will be the match 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.159
 talking about opportunities etc I'll go in 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.080
 in the details and I will try to do 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.430
 it's pretty short anyway because 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.140
 that it's good I'm limited by the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.340
 time so that will make small debriefs of 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.170
 30 40 minutes 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.210
 I will obviously put in 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.950
 descriptions the match times it's 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.509
 to say what minute I'm talking about this and 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.729
 such match like that the people who do not 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.590
 not interested in hearing about them 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.060
 of them for example I will talk about 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.420
 psg match there are supporters of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.920
 marseille 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.720
 they may have nothing to do with this 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.769
 match where Parisians who have nothing 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.370
 to fuck I eat from Marseille the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.630
 lyonnais etc 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.100
 finally you see what I mean 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.299
 so I 'll put the minutes in the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.910
 descriptions I know it takes 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.080
 good time 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.250
 and these goals did a trick 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.320
 professional until the end so we 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.330
 assumes and that's so it'll be 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.010
 available on monday I think it will be 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.690
 available Mondays of the blow because that it 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.430
 will ask me the time at 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.960
 employment et cetera right after the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.200
 match I 'll do that on Sunday night just 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.520
