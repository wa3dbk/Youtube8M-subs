 today victim of one of my 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.710
 diabolical experiences vast you are 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.859

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:25.250
 science yes he m yes i'm going to press 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:25.250
 the lever as to be desired 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:47.220
 said umih hi it's going very very well 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:48.809
 I hid in the pure heart to make 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:55.550
 a little rotten intro where I laughed 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:57.900
 as is it going to give 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.850
 suicide for science it was very 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.850
 happy i'm fine i so in china 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:19.979
 today still it would not be 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:25.200
 polished not to say hello yes I 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:29.039
 so we'll teach you how to create this 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.149
 trap then what is very very simple 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.250
 commitment 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.220
 it may sound complicated but it's 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.009
 very simple it happened to me and my 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.670
 evil sidekick 1 on the ground of 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.500
 modeling to build then it takes 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:50.130
 to start dropping group here 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.050
 never, no, it's not a dropper 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.259
 what I'm saying to me was a set of 17 draws 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:02.270
 what did you take the belgians and 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.270
 I am burnt finally takes his rights 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.310
 you put in a safe in 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 preparation you need for that so 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.870
 of the red stone dispensaries 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.880
 torches and a half where serious torches 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.760
 I'm going torch 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.030
 Ben it is related to the yam torch area for 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.260
 but behind you know no no there is 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.270
 need torches to make this trap 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.250
 m for example be done in the in 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.250
 putting 5 never again 5 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.480
 but red stone on it we need 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.370
 normal blocks we did not expect any 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:50.959
 normal blocks yeah that's fine thank you 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.959
 so suddenly when we are going to put that there 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.840
 time I go m in creative he is golden 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.950
 but no I do not know which number c I 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.079
 so ask in time I wish you 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.549
 put a stack on the floor and what 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.530
 I said it would also need balls 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.900
 of fire yes just to show that these 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.920
 shots as we can do with full 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.030
 high stuff that balls of feurs 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.010
 you can do it with potions 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.349
 to do it with rule monsters 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.299
 you can put anything on fire 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.629
 up people but that in 1 but it's not 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:28.709
 serious 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:29.940
 so the space hero levers so here 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.530
 we had organized well but 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.069
 apparently because you have to do 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.379
 I'm doing my tutorial 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:43.019
 could have given him lee does anything 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.980
 these saona stops here it is true that 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.199
 blocks we have to put everyone back 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.060
 so here we do not make a dispensary the 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.900
 number that you want I put the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.190
 red stone on it very important you 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.209
 put torches on three of the ten 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.349
 spencer very important too 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:05.040
 three of the ten sponsors no more not 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:07.230
 unless otherwise it will not work look 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.310
 when I'm going to activate this lever so 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.019
 lever no three must be put everywhere 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.709
 do not have to 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:19.859
 yes but the news all if I want I 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.699
 put everywhere then change and when 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.200
 we will activate the lever 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:27.940
 it will prevent the torches from stopping 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.700
 and it's going to be like summer been telling you 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.200
 What demand and therefore we can in 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.940
 serve for drop and items and 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.210
 the use of this trap which is very 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.190
 nice is the height and then 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.720
 of your spells had already shown him the 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.430
 way in a video and a small 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.520
 platform that you do like that where we go 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:55.770
 put droppers to tnt on it's 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:05:17.350
 very nice to dream sailors 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:17.680
 frankly 54.3 Copts and the pick of the 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.340
 dream 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.710
 look at the dream pickaxe so I was 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.820
 well memorized I show you how 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.380
 deep commented here are torches 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.760
 toulon but I do not need to put 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.920
 tanche Toulon otherwise it's this one 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.790
 passing that no interest put 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.900
 longer it's just buyers who 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.760
 Directly against me but you are 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.780

 and of course by 10am the number you 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.460
 just do not forget that the rule of 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.020
 redstone that makes that after that 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:57.550
 end of fifteen redstone it takes a 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:06:07.500
 repeater way what do you see I 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:07.500

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.270
 system that's the end of this video 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.530
