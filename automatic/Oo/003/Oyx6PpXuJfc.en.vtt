tests using a key and knife and after

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.270 
tests using a key and knife and after
that<00:00:37.020> we're<00:00:37.290> also<00:00:37.410> gonna<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> ban<00:00:38.040> test

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
that we're also gonna have a ban test

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.030 
that we're also gonna have a ban test
and<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:39.059> how<00:00:39.090> much<00:00:39.510> flex<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.410> each<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.800> can

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and see how much flex that each one can

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.700 
and see how much flex that each one can
give<00:00:41.250> before<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.180> started<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.510> wanna<00:00:42.719> go

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
give before we get started I wanna go

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350 
give before we get started I wanna go
over<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.100> little<00:00:44.430> bit<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> difference<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
over a little bit of a difference in

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.389 
over a little bit of a difference in
finish<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.590> tell<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:46.950> away<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
finish you can tell right away that the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.720 
finish you can tell right away that the
girl<00:00:47.550> glass<00:00:47.820> 4<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.450> definitely<00:00:49.410> thinner<00:00:49.730> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
girl glass 4 is definitely thinner and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.470 
girl glass 4 is definitely thinner and
more<00:00:50.969> flexible<00:00:51.570> than<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> girl<00:00:52.530> glass<00:00:52.770> 3

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
more flexible than the girl glass 3

more flexible than the girl glass 3

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
looks raised you're thinning could

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.599

barely and see it right there
already<00:00:59.609> here<00:01:01.340> doesn't<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.520> flex<00:01:02.789> that

already here doesn't really flex that
much<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:05.100> seems<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> be<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.970> glass

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
video so let's get started with this

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.920 
video so let's get started with this
scratch<00:01:32.400> test<00:01:32.700> we're<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> start<00:01:33.840> off

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
scratch test we're going to start off

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.590 
scratch test we're going to start off
going<00:01:34.140> relatively<00:01:34.829> soft<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.790> both<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.450> them

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
going relatively soft on both of them

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:51.289 
going relatively soft on both of them
let<00:01:37.409> me<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.770> anything<00:01:38.159> comes<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:50.149> now<00:01:51.149> this

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
let me see if anything comes up now this

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.420

get<00:04:56.700> out<00:04:56.729> of<00:04:56.910> mark<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.330> have<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.870> say<00:04:58.020> that<00:04:58.200> that

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
get out of mark I have to say that that

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.469 
get out of mark I have to say that that
is<00:04:58.470> pretty<00:04:58.680> impressive<00:04:59.000> okay<00:05:00.000> now<00:05:00.180> it's<00:05:00.360> time

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
is pretty impressive okay now it's time

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.850 
is pretty impressive okay now it's time
to<00:05:00.510> move<00:05:00.780> on<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.140> bond<00:05:01.320> test<00:05:01.590> and

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
to move on to the bond test and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.190 
to move on to the bond test and
flexibility<00:05:02.520> test<00:05:02.729> I'm<00:05:03.419> gonna<00:05:03.690> push<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:04.080> both

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
flexibility test I'm gonna push it both

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.630 
flexibility test I'm gonna push it both
of<00:05:04.229> these<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.800> limits<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.310> see<00:05:05.460> what's

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
of these to the limits and see what's

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.219 
of these to the limits and see what's
the<00:05:05.760> breaking<00:05:06.090> point<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:06.810> I'm<00:05:06.930> gonna<00:05:07.050> see<00:05:07.169> if

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
the breaking point and I'm gonna see if

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.360 
the breaking point and I'm gonna see if
there's<00:05:07.289> any<00:05:07.500> comparison<00:05:07.770> between<00:05:08.010> both<00:05:08.340> of

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
there's any comparison between both of

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.630 
there's any comparison between both of
them<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:08.789> do<00:05:09.180> have<00:05:09.479> some<00:05:09.690> winter<00:05:09.900> gloves<00:05:10.050> on

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
them I do have some winter gloves on

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.430 
them I do have some winter gloves on
some<00:05:11.640> protection<00:05:12.030> is<00:05:12.150> better<00:05:12.390> than<00:05:12.600> none<00:05:12.780> so

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
some protection is better than none so

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.950 
some protection is better than none so
let's<00:05:13.650> get<00:05:13.770> started

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
let's get started

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.930 
let's get started
all<00:05:15.960> right<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:16.289> that<00:05:16.440> broke<00:05:16.860> right<00:05:17.190> away<00:05:17.250> it

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
all right so that broke right away it

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.070 
all right so that broke right away it
barely<00:05:18.210> even<00:05:18.419> flexed

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
barely even flexed

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.000 
barely even flexed
all<00:05:19.919> right<00:05:20.100> here<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.490> just<00:05:21.620> just<00:05:22.620> completely

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
all right here that just just completely

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.700 
all right here that just just completely
broke<00:05:23.690> right<00:05:24.690> now<00:05:24.810> we<00:05:24.870> can<00:05:24.990> try<00:05:25.200> on<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.530> girl

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
broke right now we can try on the girl

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.060 
broke right now we can try on the girl
glass<00:05:26.010> for<00:05:26.510> and<00:05:27.510> it<00:05:27.720> does<00:05:27.930> give<00:05:28.200> some<00:05:28.229> way<00:05:31.070> so

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
glass for and it does give some way so

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.409 
glass for and it does give some way so
there<00:05:32.220> is<00:05:32.370> a<00:05:32.400> really<00:05:32.729> big<00:05:32.760> difference<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.360> I

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
there is a really big difference and I

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.360 
there is a really big difference and I
think<00:05:33.450> a<00:05:33.660> lot<00:05:33.840> of<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.260> has<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.500> do<00:05:34.740> with<00:05:34.770> how

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
think a lot of that has to do with how

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.310 
think a lot of that has to do with how
thin<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:36.210> new<00:05:36.390> one<00:05:36.570> is<00:05:36.690> compared<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.200> old

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
thin the new one is compared to the old

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.469 
thin the new one is compared to the old
one<00:05:37.500> now<00:05:38.490> I<00:05:38.550> am<00:05:38.760> gonna<00:05:38.880> break<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:39.270> to<00:05:39.419> the

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
one now I am gonna break this to the

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.300 
one now I am gonna break this to the
limits<00:05:39.780> so<00:05:40.169> we'll<00:05:40.320> see<00:05:40.470> what's<00:05:40.890> the<00:05:41.010> breaking

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
limits so we'll see what's the breaking

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.280 
limits so we'll see what's the breaking
point<00:05:41.520> on<00:05:41.640> this

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:56.020 

see<00:05:48.290> if<00:05:48.380> you<00:05:48.440> could<00:05:48.560> go<00:05:48.650> all<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.800> way<00:05:54.940> tell<00:05:55.940> us

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
see if you could go all the way tell us

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.290 
see if you could go all the way tell us
very<00:05:56.090> flexible<00:05:56.810> all<00:05:56.900> right<00:05:57.050> here<00:05:58.150> let's<00:05:59.150> see

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
very flexible all right here let's see

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.730 
very flexible all right here let's see
if<00:05:59.390> we<00:05:59.510> get<00:05:59.660> to<00:05:59.720> touch<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.260> backs<00:06:00.440> of<00:06:00.680> each

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
if we get to touch the backs of each

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:10.450 
if we get to touch the backs of each
other<00:06:08.050> all<00:06:09.050> right<00:06:09.230> and<00:06:09.350> then<00:06:09.440> just<00:06:09.470> completely

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
other all right and then just completely

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.730 
other all right and then just completely
share<00:06:10.760> it<00:06:10.910> you<00:06:11.000> got<00:06:11.150> glass<00:06:11.390> everywhere<00:06:12.020> but

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
share it you got glass everywhere but

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.440 
share it you got glass everywhere but
you<00:06:12.800> tell<00:06:12.950> it's<00:06:13.100> a<00:06:13.130> lot<00:06:13.430> more<00:06:13.640> flexible<00:06:13.880> than

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
you tell it's a lot more flexible than

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.360 
you tell it's a lot more flexible than
in<00:06:14.570> this<00:06:14.720> with<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.410> girl<00:06:15.620> of<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.830> last<00:06:16.010> three

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
in this with the girl of the last three

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.460 
in this with the girl of the last three
and<00:06:17.090> that's<00:06:17.270> a<00:06:17.390> huge<00:06:17.690> difference<00:06:17.870> right<00:06:18.260> there

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
and that's a huge difference right there

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.500 
and that's a huge difference right there
I<00:06:18.500> must<00:06:18.830> say<00:06:19.010> it's<00:06:19.850> overall<00:06:20.210> there<00:06:20.390> really

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
I must say it's overall there really

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.060 
I must say it's overall there really
wasn't<00:06:20.780> that<00:06:20.960> big<00:06:21.140> of<00:06:21.200> a<00:06:21.320> difference<00:06:21.470> in<00:06:21.980> the

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
wasn't that big of a difference in the

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.530 
wasn't that big of a difference in the
scratch<00:06:22.370> test<00:06:22.610> between<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.090> girls<00:06:23.300> last

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
scratch test between the girls last

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.870 
scratch test between the girls last
three<00:06:23.900> and<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.560> fourth<00:06:24.800> one<00:06:25.040> but<00:06:25.580> there<00:06:25.730> was<00:06:25.850> a

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
three and the fourth one but there was a

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.730 
three and the fourth one but there was a
huge<00:06:26.270> difference<00:06:26.540> in<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:26.930> flexibility<00:06:27.590> in

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
huge difference in the flexibility in

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.350 
huge difference in the flexibility in
the<00:06:27.860> bent<00:06:28.070> test<00:06:28.340> with<00:06:28.520> a<00:06:28.580> girl<00:06:28.730> glass<00:06:28.970> for

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
the bent test with a girl glass for

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.780 
the bent test with a girl glass for
compared<00:06:30.140> to<00:06:30.200> the<00:06:30.320> previous<00:06:30.650> model<00:06:30.860> you<00:06:31.610> guys
