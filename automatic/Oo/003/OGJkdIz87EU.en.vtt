00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello people i am lucy from the lucy channel 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.270
 red and I'll show you three today 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.160
 We variants a normal there 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.019
 can spice up for the first two 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.429
 variants, it does not matter what 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.620
 a do you do yourselves you can as well 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 I have a pillow with making such a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.699
 little messi or just no 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.470
 Use pillows that is just after yours 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.180
 taste and for the third variant 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.449
 a cushion already be necessary or 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.980
 also 1 3 and pillow from socks and yes 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.359
 I would say we start directly 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.320
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.320
 when a video 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.530
 Variant one is a plaited plait 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.089
 around the head 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.710
 it's just important for that 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.559
 they issued a rove from the village 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.750
 Last and then just very easy 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.559
 once divided into three parts and completely 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.559
 normal braids 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.660
 and this plaited plait is laid 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.940
 then just as it looks nice just around 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.310
 around there and you can, of course 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.869
 even thicker take so what 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.420
 braided just stands out more 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.860
 or even several broken strands 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.350
 You can easily do it like that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.570
 you want and ultimately you are stuck 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.729
 the whole thing with just one or two h 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.390
 needles and already is the hairstyle 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.390
 finished 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.640
 the second variant is one 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.380
 hair bow before printing that is one 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.330
 a bit more difficult than the first one 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.700
 but I think she's pretty good 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.440
 you have to be a strand again 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.870
 then release the parts from the dock 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.550
 Two parts and puts them once so around the 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.170
 death aroma between the really one 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.720
 make loop and now comes the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.810
 difficult part and the loops 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.700
 to shape the whole field super fast 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.610
 Just come back and I can 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.070
 just recommend the strands 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.110
 once to turn in because then they 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.420
 simply stiffer are the first loop 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.860
 then stuck with a hairpin 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.210
 and there comes the second in 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.210
 the same technique 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.560
 and already the hair bow is driving 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.269
 Now you can do it all a bit 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.519
 Nice to pluck it like that 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.560
 like and possibly with several 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.110
 somehow pinning hairpins and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.110
 already the second hairstyle is ready 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.060
 Variant number three is the hair tips 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.670
 catch friendly dutt variation for it 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 then use with a high pot on 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.040
 and saw there pillows or our de ibot 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.530
 Cushion from socks and stick it that way 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.230
 over the braid over when we use it 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.640
 we're done laying our hair over it 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.440
 complete through boxes so that it 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.730
 it's easy to feel covered 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.890
 You do not necessarily have a mirror 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.120
 look at it and we fix it all 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.519
 then with a hair tie that always looks 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.769
 a little bit funny but they are standing 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.650
 Now we will survive like that 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.650
 we turn and we turn it very easily 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.870
 on the side of dutt lang so once 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.519
 turn the strands in and then the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.420
 twisted strands around it 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.769
 fix 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.630
 That could always be when you go to 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.060
 example stages have with many 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.280
 Bobby pins make me rich 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.260
 actually always at the end of two or three 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.940
 piece and that is also this variant 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.500
 which I like to wear because we are 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.450
 just pretty simple and the hair 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.799
 not quite so stressed and so 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.370
 we already have the third variant 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.370
 by 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.920
 yes that was my video now i hope so 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.140

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.550

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.370
