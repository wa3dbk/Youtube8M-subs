about<00:00:04.319> trusting<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.190> process<00:00:05.400> I've<00:00:06.359> been

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
about trusting the process I've been

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.000 
about trusting the process I've been
working<00:00:06.750> out<00:00:06.839> for<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.230> two<00:00:07.589> years

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
working out for about two years

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.060 
working out for about two years
consistently<00:00:08.840> five<00:00:09.840> six<00:00:10.170> days<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> week<00:00:10.620> if<00:00:11.010> not

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
consistently five six days a week if not

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.660 
consistently five six days a week if not
seven<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:13.230> longest<00:00:13.650> break<00:00:13.830> off<00:00:14.040> taking<00:00:14.490> is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
seven the longest break off taking is

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.000 
seven the longest break off taking is
probably<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.210> week<00:00:15.509> when<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.929> tore<00:00:16.199> my<00:00:16.230> ACL<00:00:16.379> when

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
probably a week when I tore my ACL when

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.090 
probably a week when I tore my ACL when
I<00:00:17.070> tore<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.279> ACL<00:00:17.400> again<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.240> when<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> went<00:00:19.859> on

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
vacations so yeah it's only been those

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.849 
vacations so yeah it's only been those
weeks<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.580> I've<00:00:23.699> taken<00:00:23.910> off<00:00:24.240> um<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.350> those

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
are good to take the weeks off but it's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.750 
are good to take the weeks off but it's
all<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:28.140> trusting<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> process<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
all about trusting the process it's a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.389 
all about trusting the process it's a
long<00:00:30.000> process<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.410> shape<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.099> fit

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
long process to get in shape and get fit

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.740 
long process to get in shape and get fit
and<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> body<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.180> you've<00:00:33.420> always

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and get the body that you've always

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
and get the body that you've always
wanted<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.290> I've<00:00:35.040> been<00:00:35.130> working<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.460> two

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
wanted and I've been working out two

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.430 
wanted and I've been working out two
years<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.090> thought<00:00:36.420> I'd<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> six-pack<00:00:37.110> by

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
years I thought I'd have a six-pack by

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590 
years I thought I'd have a six-pack by
now<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.219> don't<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.700> mean<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> if

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
now and I don't I mean you can see it if

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.440 
now and I don't I mean you can see it if
I<00:00:39.690> flex<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.440> only<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.800> top<00:00:41.010> four<00:00:41.450> that's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
I flex but it's only the top four that's

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.790 
I flex but it's only the top four that's
not<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> thought<00:00:42.930> I'd<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.500> now<00:00:43.649> it's

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
not what I thought I'd have my now it's

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.610 
not what I thought I'd have my now it's
not<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.070> wanted<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.719> if<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.379> trust

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
not what I wanted and if I just trust

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.340 
not what I wanted and if I just trust
this<00:00:46.739> process<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.460> 23<00:00:48.059> years<00:00:48.090> maybe<00:00:48.960> I'll<00:00:49.170> get

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
this process in 23 years maybe I'll get

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
this process in 23 years maybe I'll get
closer<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.860> where<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.039> want<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
closer to where I want to be but the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.420 
closer to where I want to be but the
time<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> pass<00:00:52.500> anyway<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.190> my
