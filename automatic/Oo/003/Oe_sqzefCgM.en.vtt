down there for the cups sit on ain't

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.950 
down there for the cups sit on ain't
nothing<00:00:37.680> too<00:00:38.100> special<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.270> works<00:00:39.540> far<00:00:39.780> as

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
here and put voltmeter right there and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.340 
here and put voltmeter right there and
down<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.370> four<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.719> accessory

voltmeter in right now I just got it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.149 
voltmeter in right now I just got it
pretty<00:01:17.189> much<00:01:17.400> taped<00:01:18.240> off<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:19.320> electrical

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
pretty much taped off with electrical

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.359 
pretty much taped off with electrical
tape<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.360> display<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.650> around<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.159> we

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
tape on the display but around here we

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
tape on the display but around here we
got<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:23.759> smooth<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:27.140> basically<00:01:28.140> got

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
got it all smooth then and basically got

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.749 
got it all smooth then and basically got
it<00:01:28.799> got<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.220> level<00:01:30.380> all<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> did<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:31.979> went<00:01:32.579> in

know pretty much flush with the little

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.999 
know pretty much flush with the little
slope<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:48.259> hot<00:01:49.259> glued<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.829> little

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
slope here hot glued it on little

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
slope here hot glued it on little
corners<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.659> enough<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> then

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
in here and bond out it up and got it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.910 
in here and bond out it up and got it
pretty<00:01:59.130> much<00:01:59.369> smooth

pretty much smooth
sanded<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.180> syph<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:04.369> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
sanded the syph we can get there the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.449 
sanded the syph we can get there the
actual

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
actual

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.160 
actual
plastic<00:02:08.459> itself<00:02:08.910> kind<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.989> when

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
plastic itself kind of get that so when

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.199 
plastic itself kind of get that so when
I<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> paint<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.880> be<00:02:12.090> all

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
I go to paint it it's going to be all

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.540 
I go to paint it it's going to be all
painted<00:02:15.209> except<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.660> little<00:02:15.780> display<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:16.680> just

painted except a little display so just
be<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> voltage<00:02:18.510> reading<00:02:19.140> there<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:19.709> as<00:02:20.340> far<00:02:20.610> as

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
be a voltage reading there but as far as

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.410 
be a voltage reading there but as far as
that<00:02:20.819> goes

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
that goes

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.440 
that goes
should<00:02:22.230> be<00:02:22.410> putting<00:02:23.099> four<00:02:23.730> accessory

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
should be putting four accessory

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.540 
should be putting four accessory
switches<00:02:24.870> here<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.620> those<00:02:25.860> just<00:02:26.160> be<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> little

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
switches here and those just be a little

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.880 
switches here and those just be a little
flip<00:02:26.849> ones<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:28.580> should<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.670> done<00:02:29.849> with<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.890> all

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
flip ones and should be done with it all

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:40.940 
flip ones and should be done with it all
right<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:34.470> got<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:36.080> IC<00:02:39.440> got<00:02:40.440> these<00:02:40.650> I'm

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
right we got the IC got these I'm

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.530 
right we got the IC got these I'm
working<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:44.549> as<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.819> can<00:02:44.940> see<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.209> mean
