00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
toughness all the time so if you have

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.180 
toughness all the time so if you have
adversity<00:01:07.260> during<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> game<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
adversity during the game you have a

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.320 
adversity during the game you have a
couple<00:01:08.430> drops<00:01:08.550> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> game<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.240> be

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
couple drops in the game going to be

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.210 
couple drops in the game going to be
able<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> stop<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> clear<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.350> catch<00:01:11.040> the

able to stop and clear and catch the
next<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:12.510> tuned<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.870> grow<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
next one so we're tuned to grow in that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.720
