00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.119
 You have not started listening to the general road, but in fact this car 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:31.919
 3 men game including lux for shooting now 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.900
 And Haha yer as the other three men is bitten by roughly one person 69 is also weekly holiday 0 weight Day 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.370
 I Nema um 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.340
 It runs normally It is strange to say that establishment is usual but actually it is more 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.940
 The Fu say Do I wonder if the time from that house 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:51.079
 I thought it was a home, but there is no problem 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.030
 I can want you to follow the flow of traffic and there is no shortage at all 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.030
 I think rather 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.190
 It was at all when it comes to power 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.900
 I can't speed up 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.530
 There is a place 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:11.770
 It's a ride but at a turn speed 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.490
 I think Fu that kana not it a little harder for you when compared others You're verification vehicles 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.970
 that 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:23.780
 The company 's cozy wind is part of it, such as damper tuning . 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.090
 After all that is spent if you spend the money 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.049
 Ori coach 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.580
 Well we are going to do it but this bear still a trend around the take the plunge 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.670
 I get the impression that I'm not saying 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.170
 What's more 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:43.070
 It's quiet but it sounds from outside 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.430
 I think that there is an impression that comes in relatively 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:53.540
 And this is also a thank-you party or something like that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.540
 I get the impression that I think I'm using something as efficient as possible 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.350
 It is this car It is idling stop attached and is less than 7 kilometers an hour 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.350
 It's about stopping even while driving 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.940
 I came and I had a little move 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:15.840
 Depending on this, it's fuel but I'm going to save 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.650
 Who is by, for example, also use such as the addition to the brake amendment 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.650
 The idea of ​​trying to reduce the fuel appears firmly 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.750
 I'd started to run and yes now restart also releasing the foot from the brake and the other course 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:37.159
 Vibration It is Toka sound of the time is that even though not take 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:42.290
 Also received the impression that has been kept to a first limit these things 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:42.739
 This part is also where I feel that high level of Japanese technological ability is this part 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.170
 Ne 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.989
 fool 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.989
 6 Ways really still full Pont another part at the top with respect to such parts are 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.500
 Then the color of the meter panel changes 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.530
 Green is the most now even though I'm green state 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.190
 To be in the state a year ago 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.270
 Step into the fur from here and it's blue 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:15.470
 It changes, but with gradation from blue to green 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:19.990
 It has become in such a way that us represents the sophomore state 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.990
 I 'm running through the capital high school now 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.860
 I feel like I have inherited the impression I received from that last heatospheric department 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.400
 That 's a toy 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.650
 It's a stiff ride, this one is really that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:41.360
 I have a feeling that there is a limit 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:45.740
 But we have gained a large seam of the now Metropolitan been told example it is this 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.000
 When I'm worked perhaps be said that it is there attitude is black is it is a firm other than 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.830
 I think 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.030
 Oh dear 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.850
 The crash collection itself has a flat feel 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.570
 I think it is preferable in my part 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.000
 Mechanical noise but who is the acceleration 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.160
 Road noise 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.360
 I took it 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.830
 It about Anou 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.350
 So you about to say Ah attached to the body and something significantly 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.569
 It does not mean that I am standing, I say that the rank is not a surprising place 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.109
 I think so 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.459
 Hard ring That very high fluffy feeling 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.000
 From Oda house 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.530
 It is handling of feeling 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.360
 That main meeting is not really this Miraysu 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:34.910
 Before I really got on , I was riding while thinking that it would be a car that passed 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.910
 It is surprising but is that Well excuse me for saying 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.490
 I say normal or that 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.280
 I received the impression that I had a standard trait 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.830
 Of course 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.620
 You are stupid, for example, ah 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.320
 It is a rear seat headrest 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:58.000
 In addition, the I 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.900
 The end and the hard part of the ride It is still after looking at the detail 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.249
 I think it seems like there is a little missing part, but after all 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:11.359
 Well, considering the price 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:11.359
 I think it seems to be a car that has been made to a great extent 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:27.020
 Booby official 22 stacked coupe, so Aichi partial nude 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:30.400
 When I think about it, I think 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:35.050
 It should be from now on 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.390
 The Fu that freely not You're by Oshi to go white Do What a Boomers go 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.140
 think 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.230
 Well in short functionality as a tool 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.800
 It in the tax section 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.800
 I received the impression that such a car that is well realized
