00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
bottom bracket you've got two holes one

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.219 
bottom bracket you've got two holes one
there<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> an

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
there one there and this is an

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.609 
there one there and this is an
adjustable<00:01:04.700> two<00:01:05.700> pin<00:01:06.000> spanner<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.350> see

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
adjustable two pin spanner and you see

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.260 
adjustable two pin spanner and you see
it<00:01:08.430> moves<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.880> need<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it moves like that and you need that to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.789 
it moves like that and you need that to
actually<00:01:12.720> adjust<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.110> tension<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
actually adjust the tension on the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.640 
actually adjust the tension on the
bottom<00:01:14.070> bracket<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> we'll<00:01:17.070> start<00:01:17.369> off<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
bottom bracket so we'll start off the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.899 
bottom bracket so we'll start off the
bottom<00:01:19.650> bracket<00:01:19.710> itself<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> held<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.759> with

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
bottom bracket itself is held in with

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
bottom bracket itself is held in with
two<00:01:21.090> pinch<00:01:21.390> bolts<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.140> start<00:01:22.770> off<00:01:22.979> by<00:01:23.159> undoing

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
two pinch bolts so start off by undoing

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:41.340 
two pinch bolts so start off by undoing
these<00:01:23.790> pinch<00:01:24.270> bolts

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.750 

there<00:01:42.350> are<00:01:42.470> actually<00:01:42.860> quite<00:01:43.070> tight<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.610> needs

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
there are actually quite tight and needs

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.400 
there are actually quite tight and needs
to<00:01:43.850> be<00:01:43.970> tightened<00:01:44.240> got<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.540> get<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.110> bottom

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
to be tightened got to get this bottom

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.200 
to be tightened got to get this bottom
bracket<00:01:49.660> so<00:01:50.660> that's<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.930> bottom<00:01:51.260> bracket

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
bracket so that's the bottom bracket

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.390 
bracket so that's the bottom bracket
actually<00:01:53.380> loose<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.780> now<00:01:57.050> we're<00:01:57.650> just<00:01:57.920> this

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
actually loose so now we're just this

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.490 
actually loose so now we're just this
this<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.210> ten<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.900> thirty<00:02:00.350> millimeter<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:03.260> pin

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
this is ten to thirty millimeter to pin

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.730 
this is ten to thirty millimeter to pin
spanner<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:05.090> measured<00:02:05.420> these<00:02:05.630> two<00:02:06.410> holes

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
spanner and I measured these two holes

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.430 
spanner and I measured these two holes
here<00:02:06.950> they're<00:02:07.690> twenty<00:02:08.690> nine<00:02:08.869> millimeters

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
here they're twenty nine millimeters

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.690 
here they're twenty nine millimeters
apart<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.310> we<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.610> put<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:11.560> one<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:13.580> there

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
apart so we just put that one in there

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.310 
apart so we just put that one in there
so<00:02:14.120> that's<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.360> spanner<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.020> there<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.959> then<00:02:18.170> we

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
so that's a spanner in there and then we

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.000 
so that's a spanner in there and then we
could<00:02:18.470> just<00:02:18.500> turn<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:21.050> if<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.830> match

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
could just turn and if you just match

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.870 
could just turn and if you just match
see<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.280> chain<00:02:22.520> moving<00:02:23.620> as<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:25.400> simply

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
see the chain moving as you just simply

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.140 
see the chain moving as you just simply
turn<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.510> bottom<00:02:26.780> bracket<00:02:27.200> with<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.920> two<00:02:28.910> pin

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
turn the bottom bracket with the two pin

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.979 
turn the bottom bracket with the two pin
spanner<00:02:29.420> simple<00:02:29.989> as<00:02:30.050> that

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
spanner simple as that

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.860 
spanner simple as that
to<00:02:32.989> adjust<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:35.090> shouldn't<00:02:35.450> need<00:02:35.630> to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
to adjust it you shouldn't need to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.640 
to adjust it you shouldn't need to
adjust<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:37.600> cross<00:02:38.600> alignment<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> bottom

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
adjust the cross alignment of the bottom

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.250 
adjust the cross alignment of the bottom
bracket<00:02:39.739> if<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.760> do<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.299> quite<00:02:41.630> simple<00:02:42.110> just

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
bracket if you do is quite simple just

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.250 
bracket if you do is quite simple just
use<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.860> mallet<00:02:43.450> fitted<00:02:44.450> either<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.930> way<00:02:45.230> or

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
use the mallet fitted either that way or

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.140 
use the mallet fitted either that way or
on<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.549> other<00:02:46.670> side<00:02:50.350> we<00:02:51.730> adjusted<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> bottom

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
on the other side we adjusted the bottom

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.350 
on the other side we adjusted the bottom
bracket<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:53.720> simply<00:02:54.489> do<00:02:55.489> up<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.760> pinch<00:02:56.030> bolts

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
bracket so simply do up the pinch bolts

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:05.620
