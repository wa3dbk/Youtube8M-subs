it's hard to imagine a 12-string playing
easier<00:02:23.280> than<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:23.700> terms<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.030> its<00:02:24.150> action

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
easier than this in terms of its action

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.390 
easier than this in terms of its action
and<00:02:24.900> its<00:02:25.440> neck<00:02:25.650> dimensions<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.310> everything

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and its neck dimensions and everything

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400 
and its neck dimensions and everything
so<00:02:26.850> let<00:02:27.270> me<00:02:27.360> finger<00:02:27.660> pick<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> little<00:02:28.020> bit<00:02:28.260> you

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
so let me finger pick a little bit you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.140 
so let me finger pick a little bit you
can<00:02:28.560> hear<00:02:28.740> how<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.890> sounds<00:02:29.400> when<00:02:29.730> I'm<00:02:29.880> playing

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
can hear how it sounds when I'm playing

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:56.120 
can hear how it sounds when I'm playing
a<00:02:30.180> little<00:02:30.210> bit<00:02:30.450> softer<00:02:30.900> than<00:02:30.930> before

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.140 

so<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.220> can<00:02:57.310> hear<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:57.790> quite

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
so you can hear that it's quite

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150 
so you can hear that it's quite
responsive<00:02:58.900> even<00:02:59.110> at<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.470> lower<00:02:59.770> end<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.069> the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
responsive even at the lower end of the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.010 
responsive even at the lower end of the
dynamic<00:03:00.370> range<00:03:00.700> whether<00:03:01.540> your<00:03:01.690> finger

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
dynamic range whether your finger

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.690 
dynamic range whether your finger
picking<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.470> or<00:03:02.620> strumming<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.400> really<00:03:03.550> has

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
picking it or strumming it it really has

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.089 
picking it or strumming it it really has
a<00:03:03.760> nice<00:03:04.000> full<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.930> rich<00:03:05.140> sound<00:03:05.470> I'm<00:03:05.739> tuned<00:03:05.980> to

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
a nice full and rich sound I'm tuned to

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.240 
a nice full and rich sound I'm tuned to
standard<00:03:06.520> pitch<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:08.200> didn't<00:03:08.770> tune<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.010> down

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
standard pitch so I didn't tune it down

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.740 
standard pitch so I didn't tune it down
to<00:03:09.550> make<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.790> guitar<00:03:09.910> easier<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.420> play<00:03:10.599> up

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
to make the guitar easier to play up

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.120 
to make the guitar easier to play up
with<00:03:10.930> less<00:03:11.110> strength<00:03:11.380> tension<00:03:11.739> on<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.950> top

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
with less strength tension on the top

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.400 
with less strength tension on the top
which<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.400> really<00:03:12.459> what<00:03:12.760> it's<00:03:12.880> designed<00:03:13.000> for

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
which is really what it's designed for

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.960 
which is really what it's designed for
let's<00:03:14.410> also<00:03:14.620> have<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.860> quick<00:03:15.099> listen<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.730> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
very natural responds great bass let me

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.449 
very natural responds great bass let me
play<00:03:45.659> it<00:03:45.719> with<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.109> pic<00:03:46.379> due<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.129> nature<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
play it with a pic due to the nature of

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.839 
play it with a pic due to the nature of
the<00:03:48.120> es<00:03:48.420> system<00:03:48.689> that<00:03:49.680> doesn't<00:03:49.859> use<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.400> pickup

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
the es system that doesn't use a pickup

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.580 
the es system that doesn't use a pickup
under<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.269> saddle<00:03:51.659> the<00:03:51.689> attack<00:03:52.079> tends<00:03:52.349> to<00:03:52.500> be

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
under the saddle the attack tends to be

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.589 
under the saddle the attack tends to be
very<00:03:52.829> nice<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.340> rich<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:53.879> let's<00:03:54.090> find<00:03:54.510> that

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
very nice and rich so let's find that

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:10.190 
very nice and rich so let's find that
out

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.740 

so<00:04:11.200> that's<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.590> new<00:04:11.740> Taylor<00:04:12.040> 150<00:04:12.820> if<00:04:13.570> you've

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
so that's the new Taylor 150 if you've

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.790 
so that's the new Taylor 150 if you've
been<00:04:13.900> in<00:04:13.960> the<00:04:13.990> market<00:04:14.140> for<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.530> Taylor
