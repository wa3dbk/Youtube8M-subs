00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.660
 the object of studying the causes of 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.400
 consequences of accidents that carry out 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.320
 german car club a dc 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.150
 is a study of how it looks 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.279
 head-on collision between small 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.830
 car and SUV with 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.350
 a large volume of 2 voleva declares 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.360
 That the xc90 has a protection system over 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.190
 small party vali so 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.960
 the upcoming test can be called battle and 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.630
 David against goliath which will be 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.340
 assessed state of volkswagen golf. 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.199
 collisions of both candidates with 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.360
 accuracy is set in advance 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.340
 one vehicle starts 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.350
 movement outside the ground is another inside 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.940
 this is done to ensure that each of 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 they managed to accelerate to the necessary 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.410
 speed of 50 kilometers per hour 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.860
 blow looks 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.690
 devastating but all the passengers were able 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.940
 to experience it thanks to the existing 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 golf safety device successfully 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.960
 faced but about the promised vulva protection 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.790
 other traffic participants to speak 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.800
 especially not slow 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.630
 shooting shows two crucial details 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.790
 front axle golf is breaking 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.440
 due to impact impact force other than 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.270
 addition in the lion rises to the front 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.280
 part of the volkswagen for the passenger 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.140
 volkswagen gull under went to 20 thousand 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.899
 meters evil cabin this situation is not 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.759
 poses a danger to the same but creates 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:28.500
 to high risk of damage in the area 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:36.780
 physics next test this time 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:39.030
 the opponent is the Saratov despite 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.660
 on the incredible damage of such an accident 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.310
 all passengers would survive too 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.140
 both cases serious damage 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.149
 winston were almost inevitable 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.280
 It should be noted such a disadvantage kia 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.800
 sorento as inflexible narrow frame chassis 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.959
 which is bent at the board in such 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.090
 golf has no support 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.369
 Pro breaks soft front fabrics 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.229
 body damage increases 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.490
 drivers on faces physicist 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.660
 golf load in this 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.849
 case several places 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.360
 the hood moves to the salon just on 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.360
 80 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.569
 so specialists 1c requires from 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.610
 off-road manufacturers only in 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.620
 future push cars of construction 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.300
 providing uniform stiffness 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.489
 front facade at all times 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.110
 collision damage zone should 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.000
 divide into a softer area for 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.040
 protection of other participants in the accident and 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.019
 immediately behind her more solid 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.880
 area to protect the driver himself 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.650
 SUV from this it follows that 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.360
 need to take constructive 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.340
 SUV modernization measures 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.380
 allowing in collision to protect 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.380
 smaller vehicles
