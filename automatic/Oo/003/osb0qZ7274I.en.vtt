00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.000 
this concept just like the JT almost
like<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> racing<00:02:13.430> car<00:02:13.870> cymbal<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.530> wanted

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
like a racing car cymbal and I wanted

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.410 
like a racing car cymbal and I wanted
something<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.280> pop<00:02:16.520> off<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.910> black<00:02:17.060> nickel

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
something to pop off the black nickel

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.210 
something to pop off the black nickel
finish<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.410> thought<00:02:18.590> red<00:02:18.860> would<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
finish and I thought red would be the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.310 
finish and I thought red would be the
perfect<00:02:19.430> color<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.210> I'm<00:02:20.300> really<00:02:20.510> happy<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.020> at

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
perfect color so I'm really happy to at

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.380 
perfect color so I'm really happy to at
the<00:02:21.410> end<00:02:21.500> result<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.250> couldn't<00:02:22.910> be<00:02:22.970> happy<00:02:23.240> where

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
the end result I couldn't be happy where

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.210 
the end result I couldn't be happy where
Tom<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:23.720> came<00:02:23.900> upon<00:02:24.050> my<00:02:24.290> signature<00:02:24.680> snare<00:02:24.740> drum

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
Tom I came upon my signature snare drum

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.800 
Tom I came upon my signature snare drum
it<00:02:25.520> has<00:02:25.640> everything<00:02:26.060> I've<00:02:26.180> always<00:02:26.270> wanted<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
it has everything I've always wanted the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.310 
it has everything I've always wanted the
drum<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.470> has<00:02:27.650> look<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.490> sound<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:29.780> don't

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
drum it has look this sound I don't

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.320 
drum it has look this sound I don't
think<00:02:30.470> I<00:02:30.530> would<00:02:31.010> ever<00:02:31.040> play<00:02:31.340> anything<00:02:31.610> else<00:02:31.820> so

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
think I would ever play anything else so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:03:30.510 
think I would ever play anything else so
this<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.870> definitely<00:02:33.050> an<00:02:33.350> anthem<00:02:33.710> for<00:02:33.860> me

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.580
