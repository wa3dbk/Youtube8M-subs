so now hopefully I've got that bottom

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.429 
so now hopefully I've got that bottom
hot<00:00:18.099> enough<00:00:18.400> I<00:00:18.550> can<00:00:18.840> paddle<00:00:19.840> it<00:00:20.080> in<00:00:20.200> a<00:00:20.230> little

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
hot enough I can paddle it in a little

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
hot enough I can paddle it in a little
bit<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:22.210> lightly<00:00:22.570> press<00:00:22.990> that<00:00:23.230> button<00:00:23.500> in

you take this wooden paddle and just
make<00:00:27.849> sure<00:00:27.880> that<00:00:28.029> bottom<00:00:28.539> is<00:00:28.630> flat<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.230> it'll

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
make sure that bottom is flat so it'll

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.270 
make sure that bottom is flat so it'll
sit<00:00:30.340> on<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.550> table

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.970 

that's<00:00:34.730> all<00:00:34.940> right<00:00:35.410> this<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.440> an<00:00:36.710> interesting

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
that's all right this is an interesting

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.549 
that's all right this is an interesting
little<00:00:37.309> bit<00:00:37.610> about<00:00:38.300> this<00:00:38.570> piece<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:39.230> looks

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
little bit about this piece it looks

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.650 
little bit about this piece it looks
like<00:00:39.739> those<00:00:39.920> little<00:00:40.100> dots<00:00:40.370> or<00:00:40.730> maybe<00:00:40.940> black<00:00:41.300> or

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
like those little dots or maybe black or

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.780 
like those little dots or maybe black or
dark<00:00:41.930> blue<00:00:42.219> they're<00:00:43.219> actually<00:00:43.640> that

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
dark blue they're actually that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.840 
dark blue they're actually that
brilliant<00:00:44.269> red<00:00:44.620> but<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.769> frequency<00:00:46.399> of<00:00:46.430> red

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
brilliant red but the frequency of red

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.689 
brilliant red but the frequency of red
is<00:00:47.360> at<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.870> temperature<00:00:48.170> more<00:00:48.890> like<00:00:49.100> 800

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
is at a temperature more like 800

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.130 
is at a temperature more like 800
degrees<00:00:50.229> above<00:00:51.229> that<00:00:51.500> red<00:00:52.309> in<00:00:52.699> glass<00:00:53.360> doesn't

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
degrees above that red in glass doesn't

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.990 
degrees above that red in glass doesn't
appear<00:00:54.559> red<00:00:54.829> it<00:00:55.100> comes<00:00:55.370> out<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.550> different

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
appear red it comes out a different

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.750 
appear red it comes out a different
color<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.110> when<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:57.350> piece<00:00:57.530> cools<00:00:57.890> down<00:00:58.250> the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
color so when this piece cools down the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.910 
color so when this piece cools down the
red<00:00:58.940> will<00:00:59.149> actually<00:00:59.449> come<00:00:59.690> out<00:00:59.870> again<00:01:00.290> so

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
red will actually come out again so

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.009 
red will actually come out again so
sometimes<00:01:01.280> what<00:01:01.460> you're<00:01:01.610> looking<00:01:01.969> at<00:01:02.149> isn't

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
sometimes what you're looking at isn't

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.090 
sometimes what you're looking at isn't
exactly<00:01:03.079> what<00:01:03.500> you're<00:01:03.620> going<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.799> get<00:01:04.040> when

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
exactly what you're going to get when

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.320 
exactly what you're going to get when
it's<00:01:04.430> done

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.590 

bunting

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
so now so I'm going to take one more

so now so I'm going to take one more
heat<00:01:15.369> Nick's<00:01:16.210> going<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.509> bring<00:01:16.720> me<00:01:16.840> another

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
heat Nick's going to bring me another

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.560 
heat Nick's going to bring me another
punty<00:01:17.579> this<00:01:18.579> time<00:01:18.790> he's<00:01:18.970> going<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.119> make<00:01:19.299> it<00:01:19.479> on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
punty this time he's going to make it on

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.600 
punty this time he's going to make it on
a<00:01:19.600> little<00:01:19.930> bit<00:01:20.020> bigger<00:01:20.259> of<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.590> rod<00:01:20.830> so<00:01:21.369> it's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
a little bit bigger of a rod so it's

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.870 
a little bit bigger of a rod so it's
easier<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:22.060> hold<00:01:22.210> all<00:01:22.479> this<00:01:22.630> weight<00:01:22.899> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
easier to hold all this weight and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.279 
easier to hold all this weight and
you'll<00:01:24.880> make<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.270> connection<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.899> little<00:01:26.170> bit

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
you'll make the connection a little bit

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:45.340 
you'll make the connection a little bit
bigger<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:27.039> also<00:01:27.430> help<00:01:27.610> hold<00:01:27.970> all<00:01:28.240> this<00:01:28.420> weight

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.070 

yeah<00:01:45.979> earlier<00:01:46.580> you<00:01:46.790> saw<00:01:46.970> Nick<00:01:47.299> using<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:47.840> wet

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080

yeah earlier you saw Nick using this wet
newspaper<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.950> help<00:01:49.159> shape<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.930> it's<00:01:50.930> kind<00:01:51.080> of

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
newspaper to help shape it it's kind of

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.109 
newspaper to help shape it it's kind of
fun<00:01:51.500> it's<00:01:51.770> like<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:52.009> can't<00:01:52.220> really<00:01:52.400> grab

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
fun it's like you can't really grab

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.120 
fun it's like you can't really grab
glass<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:53.869> this<00:01:54.020> is<00:01:54.170> about<00:01:54.350> as<00:01:54.560> close<00:01:54.799> as<00:01:55.009> you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
glass but this is about as close as you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.820 
glass but this is about as close as you
can<00:01:55.220> get<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.490> grabbing<00:01:56.030> glass<00:01:56.380> what<00:01:57.380> happens

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
can get to grabbing glass what happens

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.700 
can get to grabbing glass what happens
is<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.729> water<00:01:58.759> in<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.390> newspaper<00:01:59.930> when<00:02:00.590> it

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
is the water in the newspaper when it

is the water in the newspaper when it
touches<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.070> glass<00:02:01.430> turns<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:02.090> steam<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.229> it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
touches the glass turns to steam and it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.279 
touches the glass turns to steam and it
kind<00:02:03.619> of<00:02:03.710> floats<00:02:04.159> in<00:02:04.490> your<00:02:04.670> hand<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.299> then<00:02:06.020> if

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
kind of floats in your hand and then if

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.410 
kind of floats in your hand and then if
you<00:02:06.470> use<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.830> too<00:02:06.979> long<00:02:07.190> as<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.670> saw<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.060> starts

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
you use it too long as you saw it starts

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.140 
you use it too long as you saw it starts
to<00:02:08.569> smoke<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.259> burn<00:02:09.890> up<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.670> that's<00:02:10.850> when<00:02:10.970> you

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150

a<00:02:31.970> little<00:02:32.269> hot

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.430 

if<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.130> tap<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.430> off<00:02:38.700> too<00:02:38.910> soon<00:02:39.210> he's<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:39.810> juicy

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
if I tap it off too soon he's so juicy

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.230 
if I tap it off too soon he's so juicy
there<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.950> will<00:02:41.100> just<00:02:41.250> flop<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.910> them<00:02:42.090> so

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
there that it will just flop on them so

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.850 
there that it will just flop on them so
we<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.600> wait<00:02:42.720> till<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:43.110> connection<00:02:43.680> is

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
we have to wait till that connection is

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.540 
we have to wait till that connection is
a<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:44.730> bit<00:02:44.880> firm<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.890> needs<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.520> a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
a little bit firm it needs to be a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.280 
a little bit firm it needs to be a
little<00:02:47.640> bit<00:02:47.970> flexible<00:02:48.360> because<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:49.140> it's

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
little bit flexible because if it's

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.470 
little bit flexible because if it's
stiff<00:02:49.650> apart<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.400> tap<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:50.970> pipe<00:02:51.270> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
stiff apart and I tap on the pipe it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.950 
stiff apart and I tap on the pipe it
will<00:02:51.600> break<00:02:51.810> off<00:02:52.050> their<00:02:52.080> also<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.480> knowing

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
will break off their also so knowing

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.340 
will break off their also so knowing
when<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.170> tap<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.710> off<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.220> when<00:02:56.370> not<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.640> is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
when to tap it off and when not to is

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.960 
when to tap it off and when not to is
it's<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.800> can't<00:02:59.040> someone<00:02:59.400> will<00:02:59.550> say<00:02:59.700> well<00:02:59.850> how

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
it's you can't someone will say well how

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.660 
it's you can't someone will say well how
long<00:03:00.240> do<00:03:00.480> i<00:03:00.570> wait<00:03:00.890> while<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.040> wait<00:03:02.220> until<00:03:02.400> it's

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
long do i wait while you wait until it's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.730 
long do i wait while you wait until it's
ready<00:03:02.880> if<00:03:03.300> it's<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.570> big<00:03:03.750> beast<00:03:03.990> its<00:03:04.230> longer<00:03:04.650> if

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
ready if it's a big beast its longer if

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.190 
ready if it's a big beast its longer if
it's<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.950> small<00:03:05.100> piece<00:03:05.490> it's<00:03:05.700> faster<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:07.080> you're

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
it's a small piece it's faster so you're

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.500 
it's a small piece it's faster so you're
constantly<00:03:07.470> having<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.100> kind<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.490> watch<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
constantly having to kind of watch the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.450 
constantly having to kind of watch the
glass<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.410> see<00:03:10.650> what<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.010> doing<00:03:11.100> and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
glass and see what it's doing and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.320 
glass and see what it's doing and
respond<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:13.130> so<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.730> looks<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.060> he's

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
respond to that so it looks like he's

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.680 
respond to that so it looks like he's
ready<00:03:15.360> yeah<00:03:16.370> it's<00:03:17.370> getting<00:03:17.640> there<00:03:17.670> I'm<00:03:18.510> going

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
to this time since I have a bigger piece

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.700 
to this time since I have a bigger piece
I<00:03:20.850> got<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.390> get<00:03:21.480> more<00:03:21.720> cooling<00:03:22.350> on<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.620> I'm

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
I got to get more cooling on so I'm

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.310 
I got to get more cooling on so I'm
actually<00:03:22.800> going<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.130> apply<00:03:23.310> water<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
actually going to apply water to the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.750 
actually going to apply water to the
neck<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.200> I'm<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.470> letting<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:28.800> water<00:03:28.950> drip

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
neck so I'm just letting the water drip

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640 
neck so I'm just letting the water drip
down<00:03:29.940> both<00:03:30.300> sides<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.750> my<00:03:30.870> tools<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.530> makes

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
down both sides of my tools so it makes

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.180 
down both sides of my tools so it makes
a<00:03:31.800> cold<00:03:32.040> spot<00:03:32.370> bring<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.270> up<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.510> rail

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
a cold spot bring it up to the rail

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:44.290 
a cold spot bring it up to the rail
cracks<00:03:35.190> off

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.930 

so<00:03:44.900> now<00:03:45.080> i<00:03:45.380> have<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.710> heat<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.100> lip<00:03:46.400> up<00:03:46.610> enough

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
so now i have to heat that lip up enough

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.660 
so now i have to heat that lip up enough
that<00:03:47.120> i<00:03:47.210> can<00:03:47.240> get<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.870> move<00:03:48.280> but<00:03:49.280> before<00:03:49.430> i

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
that i can get it to move but before i

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.310 
that i can get it to move but before i
open<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.120> all<00:03:50.300> the<00:03:50.330> way<00:03:50.450> i'm<00:03:50.900> going<00:03:50.990> to<00:03:51.080> put

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
on that little hole where it cracked off

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.090 
on that little hole where it cracked off
i'm<00:04:04.610> going<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:04.850> cover<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.600> with<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.780> ribbon<00:04:06.710> of

i'm going to cover it with a ribbon of
darker<00:04:07.760> colored<00:04:08.090> glass<00:04:08.450> so<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.920> piece<00:04:10.130> will

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
darker colored glass so the piece will

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.630 
darker colored glass so the piece will
have<00:04:10.520> a<00:04:10.550> colored<00:04:11.270> lip<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.960> it<00:04:12.160> you<00:04:13.160> need<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.490> do

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
have a colored lip to it you need to do

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.370 
have a colored lip to it you need to do
that<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> beginning<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:14.990> that<00:04:15.020> you<00:04:15.230> don't

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
that in the beginning so that you don't

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.500 
that in the beginning so that you don't
have<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.650> stretch<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.250> around<00:04:16.670> a<00:04:16.850> big<00:04:17.060> vase<00:04:17.299> you

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
have to stretch it around a big vase you

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.849 
have to stretch it around a big vase you
just<00:04:17.690> stretch<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:17.959> around<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.380> little<00:04:18.410> hole

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
just stretch it around a little hole

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.650 
just stretch it around a little hole
it's<00:04:19.190> easier<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.609> get<00:04:19.730> it<00:04:19.850> on<00:04:20.000> evenly

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.600 

my<00:04:25.200> whole<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.620> little<00:04:25.890> bit<00:04:26.010> cold<00:04:26.280> today

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
my whole is a little bit cold today

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.160 
my whole is a little bit cold today
because<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.150> didn't<00:04:27.330> give<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.540> enough<00:04:27.630> time<00:04:27.750> to

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
because I didn't give it enough time to

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.410 
because I didn't give it enough time to
warm<00:04:28.350> up<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.890> because<00:04:29.850> we're<00:04:30.030> leaving<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
warm up and because we're leaving the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.660 
warm up and because we're leaving the
doors<00:04:30.690> open<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:31.380> much<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.800> keeps<00:04:32.070> losing<00:04:32.340> its

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
doors open so much it keeps losing its

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.320 
doors open so much it keeps losing its
heat

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:49.820 

that'll<00:04:39.020> be<00:04:39.110> good

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.710 

just<00:04:54.310> cuz<00:04:54.550> I'm<00:04:54.669> never<00:04:54.850> gonna<00:04:55.030> get<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.419> spin

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
just cuz I'm never gonna get it to spin

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.519 
just cuz I'm never gonna get it to spin
out<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:55.960> at<00:04:56.229> that<00:04:56.440> goal<00:04:56.880> I'm<00:04:57.880> almost<00:04:58.180> done

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.580 
control the diameter of that rope as it
lays<00:05:29.200> on<00:05:30.210> get<00:05:31.210> around<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:32.080> then<00:05:32.320> you<00:05:32.350> can

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
lays on get around and then you can

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.050 
lays on get around and then you can
strip<00:05:32.830> it<00:05:32.860> off<00:05:33.100> or<00:05:33.400> in<00:05:33.490> this<00:05:33.580> case<00:05:33.640> I'm<00:05:34.030> just

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
strip it off or in this case I'm just

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.400 
strip it off or in this case I'm just
going<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.300> use<00:05:34.420> that<00:05:34.450> last<00:05:34.810> little<00:05:34.990> bit<00:05:35.230> to

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
going to use that last little bit to

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.710 
going to use that last little bit to
make<00:05:35.530> a<00:05:35.590> little<00:05:35.950> transition<00:05:36.910> down<00:05:37.300> into<00:05:37.630> the

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
make a little transition down into the

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.300 
make a little transition down into the
body<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.200> piece<00:05:38.440> this<00:05:38.770> part<00:05:39.010> is<00:05:39.040> always

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
body of the piece this part is always

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.260 
body of the piece this part is always
fun<00:05:39.490> i<00:05:39.520> call<00:05:39.760> this<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.060> Ray<00:05:40.210> Charles

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
fun i call this the Ray Charles

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.420 
fun i call this the Ray Charles
technique<00:05:41.260> because<00:05:41.830> you<00:05:41.950> can<00:05:42.100> do<00:05:42.220> it<00:05:42.310> with

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
technique because you can do it with

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.620 
technique because you can do it with
your<00:05:42.550> eyes<00:05:42.640> closed<00:05:45.030> it<00:05:46.030> just<00:05:46.180> adds<00:05:46.390> a<00:05:46.510> little

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
your eyes closed it just adds a little

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.050 
your eyes closed it just adds a little
line<00:05:46.900> quality<00:05:47.200> into<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:47.890> and<00:05:48.550> then<00:05:48.700> we'll<00:05:48.820> just

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
line quality into it and then we'll just

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.019 
line quality into it and then we'll just
break<00:05:49.720> that<00:05:49.930> off

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:53.029 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.399 

and<00:05:54.029> then<00:05:54.180> reheat<00:05:54.659> now<00:05:54.960> we<00:05:55.020> can<00:05:55.319> actually

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
and then reheat now we can actually

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.760 
and then reheat now we can actually
start<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.830> open<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.369> peas

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
open so I spin it real fast and then we

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.250 
open so I spin it real fast and then we
stopped<00:07:05.080> and<00:07:05.890> we<00:07:05.950> let<00:07:06.190> it<00:07:06.310> ruffle<00:07:07.020> and<00:07:08.020> then<00:07:08.170> we

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
stopped and we let it ruffle and then we

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.810 
stopped and we let it ruffle and then we
spin<00:07:08.530> it<00:07:08.650> a<00:07:08.740> little<00:07:08.890> bit<00:07:09.100> just<00:07:09.310> to<00:07:09.400> open<00:07:09.700> up

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
spin it a little bit just to open up

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.930 
spin it a little bit just to open up
that<00:07:09.970> ruffle<00:07:10.860> and<00:07:11.860> that's<00:07:12.100> the<00:07:12.340> basics<00:07:12.820> of

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
that ruffle and that's the basics of
