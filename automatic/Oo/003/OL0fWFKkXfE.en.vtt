00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240

little<00:00:24.600> car<00:00:25.130> I'll<00:00:26.130> note<00:00:26.699> two<00:00:27.000> things<00:00:27.349> the<00:00:28.349> last

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
little car I'll note two things the last

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.040 
little car I'll note two things the last
one<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.099> realized<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> air-conditioner

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
one I realized that the air-conditioner

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.620 
one I realized that the air-conditioner
takes<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.410> while<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.940> kind<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> kick<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
takes a while to kind of kick in and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.540 
takes a while to kind of kick in and
cool<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> car<00:00:34.500> off<00:00:35.870> now<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.829> it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
cool the car off now I know that it's it

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
cool the car off now I know that it's it
happened<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.660> same<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.170> reverse<00:00:40.530> it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
happened it's the same in the reverse it

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.220 
happened it's the same in the reverse it
also<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.460> same<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> heat<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:43.050> takes

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
also is the same with the heat it takes

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
also is the same with the heat it takes
a<00:00:43.379> while<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.040> car<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:46.250> begin

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
a while for the car to up and begin

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.690 
a while for the car to up and begin
heating<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> inside<00:00:49.250> that's<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> an

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
heating the inside that's kind of an

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
heating the inside that's kind of an
inherent<00:00:51.180> problem<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.660> small<00:00:51.780> cars<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.350> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
inherent problem with small cars and I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.250 
inherent problem with small cars and I
think<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.100> car<00:00:53.510> Nissan<00:00:54.510> should<00:00:54.809> note<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
think in this car Nissan should note it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
think in this car Nissan should note it
could<00:00:55.440> probably<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.860> fixed<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.399> by<00:00:56.610> putting

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
could probably be fixed just by putting

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.709 
could probably be fixed just by putting
a<00:00:57.239> slightly<00:00:57.510> larger<00:00:57.780> blower<00:00:58.230> motor<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:59.719> other

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
a slightly larger blower motor in other

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.360 
a slightly larger blower motor in other
than<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.050> though<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> great<00:01:02.160> little

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
than that though this is a great little

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
than that though this is a great little
car<00:01:02.670> for<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.420> price<00:01:03.629> you're<00:01:03.809> paying<00:01:03.870> you're

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.140 
car for the price you're paying you're
paying<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.369> an<00:01:05.489> entry<00:01:05.790> level<00:01:05.909> vehicle

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
paying this is an entry level vehicle

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.590 
paying this is an entry level vehicle

shifter<00:05:03.849> of<00:05:03.969> course<00:05:04.180> this<00:05:04.419> is<00:05:04.569> a<00:05:04.599> CVT<00:05:05.050> it's<00:05:05.830> a

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
shifter of course this is a CVT it's a

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.179 
shifter of course this is a CVT it's a
good<00:05:06.159> little<00:05:06.340> cbt<00:05:06.909> best<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.800> best<00:05:08.919> on<00:05:09.129> the

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:09.189 
good little cbt best the best on the

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:10.980 
good little cbt best the best on the

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
market maybe not but I think that has

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.439 
market maybe not but I think that has
more<00:05:11.199> to<00:05:11.259> do<00:05:11.469> with<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.860> small<00:05:12.759> engine<00:05:13.180> than<00:05:13.300> it

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
more to do with the small engine than it

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.769 
more to do with the small engine than it
does<00:05:13.599> with<00:05:13.779> the<00:05:14.189> transmission<00:05:15.189> itself<00:05:15.779> this

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
does with the transmission itself this

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.260 
does with the transmission itself this
car<00:05:17.020> drives<00:05:17.289> pretty<00:05:17.620> well<00:05:17.800> for<00:05:18.099> such<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.279> low

it's very very nice and these little

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.100 
it's very very nice and these little
pinstripes<00:05:49.270> are<00:05:49.479> kind<00:05:49.629> of<00:05:49.659> cool<00:05:50.789> and<00:05:52.110> speaker

there<00:05:53.349> speaker<00:05:53.979> in<00:05:54.129> the<00:05:54.219> back<00:05:54.509> the<00:05:55.529> stereo

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
car and I think it's the shape of the

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.360 
car and I think it's the shape of the
car<00:06:00.789> as<00:06:01.000> much<00:06:01.149> as<00:06:01.330> it<00:06:01.509> is<00:06:01.659> the<00:06:01.990> how<00:06:02.979> well<00:06:03.189> was

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
car as much as it is the how well was

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.909 
car as much as it is the how well was
this<00:06:03.729> stereo<00:06:04.029> is<00:06:04.210> done<00:06:04.360> in<00:06:05.289> a<00:06:05.409> car<00:06:05.589> like<00:06:05.770> this

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
this stereo is done in a car like this

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.540 
this stereo is done in a car like this
you<00:06:06.129> do<00:06:06.310> need<00:06:06.520> a<00:06:06.580> good<00:06:06.849> stereo<00:06:07.149> because

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
you do need a good stereo because

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.649 
you do need a good stereo because
frankly<00:06:09.550> there<00:06:09.729> is<00:06:09.849> a<00:06:09.879> lot<00:06:10.120> of<00:06:10.270> road<00:06:10.419> noise<00:06:10.449> and

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
frankly there is a lot of road noise and
