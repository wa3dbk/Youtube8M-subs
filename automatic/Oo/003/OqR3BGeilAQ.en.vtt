about<00:02:45.260> her<00:02:45.530> when<00:02:45.680> we're<00:02:45.860> doing<00:02:45.980> something

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
about her when we're doing something

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.789 
about her when we're doing something
like<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:46.670> everybody<00:02:47.660> knows<00:02:47.900> somebody<00:02:48.260> who's

like this everybody knows somebody who's
affected<00:02:49.129> by<00:02:49.489> it<00:02:49.549> so<00:02:49.910> it's<00:02:50.090> something<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.599> we

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
affected by it so it's something that we

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.720
