passing yards over to you such and such

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.500 
passing yards over to you such and such
you<00:02:31.920> know<00:02:32.040> whatever<00:02:32.670> happened<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.360> them

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
you know whatever happened to them

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.360 
you know whatever happened to them
actually<00:02:33.720> putting<00:02:34.050> time<00:02:34.349> into<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.310> you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
actually putting time into that so you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.460 
actually putting time into that so you
can<00:02:35.519> see<00:02:35.700> they<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.569> team<00:02:36.750> comparison

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
can see they have the team comparison

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.110 
can see they have the team comparison
here<00:02:39.709> before<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.799> start<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.220> game<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
here before the start of the game the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.539 
here before the start of the game the
Patriots<00:02:42.540> at<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.870> time<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.560> guess<00:02:44.310> they<00:02:44.430> had

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
Patriots at this time I guess they had

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.100 
Patriots at this time I guess they had
no<00:02:44.730> running<00:02:45.120> game<00:02:45.150> no<00:02:45.930> kicking<00:02:46.319> game<00:02:48.110> but

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
no running game no kicking game but

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.259 
no running game no kicking game but

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.170 
again and that's I don't want to say
that<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> best<00:02:52.049> game<00:02:52.319> ever<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:53.180> don't

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
that this is the best game ever I don't

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.339 
that this is the best game ever I don't
want<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.360> say<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.810> can<00:02:54.930> see<00:02:55.079> again
