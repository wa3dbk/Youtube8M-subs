00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
changes it looks exactly the same as it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.039 
changes it looks exactly the same as it
did<00:01:08.640> before<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:09.990> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
did before but what you have to do is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
did before but what you have to do is
you<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> swipe<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.920> from<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.460> side<00:01:11.520> and

you have to swipe in from this side and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.340 
you have to swipe in from this side and
it<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> little<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:12.990> tricky<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it can be a little bit tricky to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.810 
it can be a little bit tricky to
actually<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> activate<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> can

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
actually get it to activate as you can

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.179

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.660 
and you get these options so and pin
large<00:01:33.570> app<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.460> one

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
large app up and down so with this one

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.039 
large app up and down so with this one
we'll<00:01:35.790> move<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.840> see

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
we'll move it up and as you can see

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
we'll move it up and as you can see
again<00:01:37.530> yes<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.100> happening<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.520> right

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
again yes it's happening on the right

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
again yes it's happening on the right
position<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.329> does<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:39.840> move<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.229> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
position and it does actually move up so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.410 
position and it does actually move up so
I'm<00:01:40.920> gonna<00:01:41.009> move<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:41.430> down<00:01:41.700> again<00:01:42.180> into

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
I'm gonna move that back down again into

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780 
I'm gonna move that back down again into
its<00:01:42.780> original<00:01:43.320> position<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.250> again<00:01:44.490> very

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
its original position so it's again very

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.480 
its original position so it's again very
easy<00:01:45.060> quite<00:01:45.630> intuitive<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.350> use<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.280> think

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
easy quite intuitive to use and I think

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.700 
easy quite intuitive to use and I think
it<00:01:47.579> does<00:01:47.729> look<00:01:47.759> pretty<00:01:48.210> much<00:01:48.420> spot-on<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.560> what

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
it does look pretty much spot-on so what

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.859 
it does look pretty much spot-on so what
it<00:01:49.829> does<00:01:50.040> from<00:01:50.850> Microsoft<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.750> also

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it does from Microsoft and you can also

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.969 
it does from Microsoft and you can also
see<00:01:52.110> what<00:01:52.200> page<00:01:52.350> actually<00:01:52.530> change<00:01:52.890> your

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
see what page actually change your

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.440

username<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> make<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> little<00:01:54.270> bit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
username just to make it a little bit

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.219 
username just to make it a little bit
more<00:01:54.630> authentic

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
more authentic

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.200 
more authentic
so<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> actually<00:01:55.860> changed<00:01:56.310> mine<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.520> Matt<00:01:57.030> so
