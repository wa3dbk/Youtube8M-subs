there<00:00:30.419> for<00:00:30.750> summer<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.259> I<00:00:31.800> think<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.250> know<00:00:32.340> in

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
there for summer and I think you know in

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.979 
there for summer and I think you know in
looking<00:00:32.879> at<00:00:33.090> some<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> silhouettes<00:00:33.750> as

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
looking at some of the silhouettes as

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.049 
looking at some of the silhouettes as
well<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.379> think<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.730> way<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.030> things

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
well I think the the way that things

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.360 
well I think the the way that things
work<00:00:36.390> hard<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> also<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.950> way<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> things

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
work hard and also the way the things

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.330 
work hard and also the way the things
were<00:00:38.489> moving<00:00:38.700> absolutely<00:00:39.629> beautiful<00:00:43.340> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
were moving absolutely beautiful that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.010 
were moving absolutely beautiful that
was<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> very<00:00:44.550> Hollywood<00:00:45.149> collection<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:45.870> was

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
was a very Hollywood collection what was

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110 
was a very Hollywood collection what was
your<00:00:46.140> taker<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.010> glamorous<00:00:47.310> and<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> was

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
your taker it was glamorous and it was

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
your taker it was glamorous and it was
refined<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.200> actually<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.250> was

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
refined and I actually think that it was

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
refined and I actually think that it was
probably<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.880> lot<00:00:51.060> more<00:00:51.090> elegant<00:00:51.630> than<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:51.900> we

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
probably a lot more elegant than what we

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750 
probably a lot more elegant than what we
sometimes<00:00:52.470> tend<00:00:52.950> to<00:00:53.040> see<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.220> Hollywood<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
sometimes tend to see in Hollywood I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
sometimes tend to see in Hollywood I
think<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.120> more<00:00:54.180> old<00:00:54.510> Hollywood<00:00:55.050> glamour

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
think it's more old Hollywood glamour

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.740 
think it's more old Hollywood glamour
but<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> certain<00:00:56.340> modern<00:00:56.850> tailoring<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
but with a certain modern tailoring that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.600 
but with a certain modern tailoring that
I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.320> quite<00:00:58.500> reflective<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.399> Armani

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
I think is quite reflective of Armani

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.979 
I think is quite reflective of Armani

I<00:01:22.950> think<00:01:23.459> when<00:01:23.999> you<00:01:24.090> see<00:01:24.359> pieces<00:01:24.869> from

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
I think when you see pieces from

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
I think when you see pieces from
different<00:01:26.399> decades<00:01:26.999> or<00:01:27.270> there<00:01:27.569> were<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.990> pair

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
different decades or there were a pair

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.199 
different decades or there were a pair
of<00:01:28.319> shoes<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.670> reminded<00:01:29.670> me<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.789> addressed

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
of shoes that reminded me of addressed

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.209 
of shoes that reminded me of addressed
that<00:01:30.359> I'd<00:01:30.479> seen<00:01:30.719> that<00:01:30.899> he<00:01:30.990> did<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.529> the<00:01:31.619> 80s<00:01:31.649> and

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
that I'd seen that he did in the 80s and

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:33.649 
that I'd seen that he did in the 80s and
you<00:01:32.579> know<00:01:32.670> things<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.029> this<00:01:33.209> and<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:33.569> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you know things like this and when you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.819 
you know things like this and when you
see<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.959> pieces<00:01:34.289> and<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.469> think<00:01:34.679> that<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
see the pieces and you think that you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.529 
see the pieces and you think that you
could<00:01:34.950> wear<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.189> today<00:01:35.459> I<00:01:35.789> think<00:01:36.119> that's<00:01:36.299> what

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
could wear it today I think that's what

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.289

makes<00:01:36.749> mr.<00:01:37.079> Armani<00:01:37.560> who<00:01:38.100> he<00:01:38.219> is<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> he<00:01:39.029> really

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
makes mr. Armani who he is and he really

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.559 
makes mr. Armani who he is and he really
is<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> maestro<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:41.240> really<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.389> the
