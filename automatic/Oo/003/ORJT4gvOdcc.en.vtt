see you down at the end of the hall or

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.270 
see you down at the end of the hall or
you<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.079> add<00:02:42.290> more<00:02:42.530> power<00:02:42.769> by<00:02:43.040> hitting

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
you can just add more power by hitting

you can just add more power by hitting
the<00:02:43.370> ball<00:02:43.519> harder<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:43.940> generate<00:02:44.299> all<00:02:44.450> those

image it's an African elephant on the
plains<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.510> Kenya<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.769> I'm<00:03:37.010> feeling<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.519> fired

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
plains of Kenya so I'm feeling is fired

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.110 
plains of Kenya so I'm feeling is fired
let's<00:03:38.599> splat<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:40.250> see<00:03:40.579> there's<00:03:40.790> my<00:03:40.970> big

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
let's splat so you see there's my big

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.089 
let's splat so you see there's my big
canvas<00:03:41.630> that's<00:03:42.260> where<00:03:42.590> we're<00:03:42.709> going<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:42.889> paint

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
canvas that's where we're going to paint

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.569

our<00:03:43.250> background<00:03:44.440> light<00:03:45.440> blue<00:03:46.510> I'm<00:03:47.510> going<00:03:47.720> to

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
our background light blue I'm going to

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.250 
our background light blue I'm going to
slop<00:03:49.579> around<00:03:49.609> some<00:03:50.239> paint<00:03:50.540> with<00:03:50.780> my<00:03:50.900> bucket

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
slop around some paint with my bucket

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.089 
slop around some paint with my bucket
throw<00:03:51.530> here<00:03:52.599> that's<00:03:53.599> my<00:03:53.750> sky<00:03:54.139> and<00:03:54.950> then<00:03:55.040> I

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
throw here that's my sky and then I

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.759 
throw here that's my sky and then I
think<00:03:55.310> I'll<00:03:55.430> put<00:03:55.609> a<00:03:55.989> great<00:03:56.989> big<00:03:57.019> cloud<00:03:57.440> up<00:03:57.650> in

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
think I'll put a great big cloud up in

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.449 
think I'll put a great big cloud up in
the<00:03:57.889> sky<00:03:58.099> white<00:03:59.379> so<00:04:00.379> throw<00:04:00.709> another<00:04:00.859> bucket<00:04:01.220> up
