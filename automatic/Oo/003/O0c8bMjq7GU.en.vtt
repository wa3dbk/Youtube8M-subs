really good fish drive as well but
that's<00:02:12.710> that<00:02:13.400> doesn't<00:02:13.670> happen<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.940> lot<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.720> in

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
that's that doesn't happen a lot is in

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.060 
that's that doesn't happen a lot is in
the<00:02:15.410> ocean<00:02:16.070> there<00:02:16.280> are<00:02:16.430> plenty<00:02:16.790> good<00:02:17.090> fish<00:02:18.070> so

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
the ocean there are plenty good fish so

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.380 
the ocean there are plenty good fish so
as<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.280> see<00:02:19.430> here<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:19.820> looking<00:02:20.120> them<00:02:20.270> all

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
as you see here just looking them all

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.780 
as you see here just looking them all
time<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:20.960> eat<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.320> catch<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.650> fish<00:02:21.830> and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
time it can eat it to catch the fish and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.570 
time it can eat it to catch the fish and
then<00:02:22.940> I'm<00:02:23.470> then<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.590> can<00:02:24.740> sprint<00:02:25.160> between

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
then I'm then you can sprint between

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.830 
then I'm then you can sprint between
destinations<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.650> get<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:28.040> quicker<00:02:28.840> it's

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
destinations so get there quicker it's

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.790 
destinations so get there quicker it's
got<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.140> doubt<00:02:30.380> there<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.050> go<00:02:33.200> down<00:02:33.590> here

there's lots of ocean but if you go to
the<00:02:36.080> right<00:02:36.290> kind<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.760> level<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.850> can<00:02:38.030> see<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
the right kind of level you can see the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.360 
the right kind of level you can see the
fishes<00:02:38.600> shadow<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.530> water<00:02:39.709> from<00:02:40.130> here

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
object out the boundaries and then back

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.510 
object out the boundaries and then back
through<00:02:57.330> again<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:58.320> sort<00:02:58.770> fly<00:02:59.160> down<00:02:59.370> which

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
through again you sort fly down which

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.790 
through again you sort fly down which
slid<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.020> stay<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.260> top<00:03:01.440> there<00:03:01.650> too

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
long then I'm you can get stuck and it

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.490 
long then I'm you can get stuck and it
takes<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.440> while<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:04.770> out<00:03:06.230> yeah<00:03:07.230> will<00:03:07.350> cry
