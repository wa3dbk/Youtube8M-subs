00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.700 
explained in the talent cirqueo video
it's<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.550> about<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.120> trichomes<00:00:54.630> the<00:00:55.440> more

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it's all about the trichomes the more

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.980 
it's all about the trichomes the more
trichomes<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.550> lens<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.910> head<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.750> whiter

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
trichomes the lens your head the whiter

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.890 
trichomes the lens your head the whiter
it<00:00:58.260> appears<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.430> less<00:00:59.640> trichomes<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
it appears the less trichomes the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.310 
it appears the less trichomes the
greener<00:01:01.200> it<00:01:01.380> is<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.580> let's<00:01:02.940> start<00:01:03.240> with<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
greener it is so let's start with the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.950 
greener it is so let's start with the
first<00:01:04.530> plant<00:01:04.890> tillandsia<00:01:05.610> blue<00:01:06.480> balsa

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
first plant tillandsia blue balsa

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.650 
first plant tillandsia blue balsa
tillandsia<00:01:07.710> by<00:01:08.100> balsa<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> obviously<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.270> green

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
tillandsia by balsa is obviously a green

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.830 
tillandsia by balsa is obviously a green
species<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.920> green<00:01:11.250> leaves<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.630> bulb

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
species with green leaves and the bulb

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.290 
species with green leaves and the bulb
is<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.560> bit<00:01:13.710> grayish<00:01:14.550> because<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.120> has

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
is a little bit grayish because it has

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.170 
is a little bit grayish because it has
more<00:01:15.600> trichomes<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> bulbs<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
more trichomes to the bulbs and to the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.760 
more trichomes to the bulbs and to the
leaves<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.380> plant<00:01:19.770> enjoys<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.030> shady

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
leaves and this plant enjoys a shady

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.290 
leaves and this plant enjoys a shady
shady<00:01:22.770> place<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.400> garden<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.180> your

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
shady place in your garden or in your

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.260 
shady place in your garden or in your
terrarium<00:01:25.400> never<00:01:26.400> put<00:01:26.640> them<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.940> full<00:01:27.180> Sun<00:01:29.270> so

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
terrarium never put them in full Sun so

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.050 
terrarium never put them in full Sun so
the<00:01:30.720> second<00:01:31.080> plant<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the second plant is going to be to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
the second plant is going to be to
lengthier<00:01:33.540> Bootsy<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.050> it<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> also<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.520> green

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
lengthier Bootsy I it is also a green

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.050 
lengthier Bootsy I it is also a green
variety<00:01:36.300> and<00:01:36.600> therefore<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:38.850> like

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
variety and therefore it it would like

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420 
variety and therefore it it would like
to<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> shady<00:01:39.810> place<00:01:40.050> but<00:01:40.800> as<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.190> can<00:01:41.370> see

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to have a shady place but as you can see

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.590 
to have a shady place but as you can see
already<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:43.590> leaves<00:01:43.830> are<00:01:44.130> quite

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
already that the leaves are quite

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.050 
already that the leaves are quite
greyish<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.800> plant<00:01:47.100> enjoys<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.760> little

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
greyish and the plant enjoys a little

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.570 
greyish and the plant enjoys a little
bit<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:48.420> light<00:01:48.930> than<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.620> lengthy<00:01:49.979> Abu<00:01:50.250> Musa

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
bit more light than to lengthy Abu Musa

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.649 
bit more light than to lengthy Abu Musa
the<00:01:53.580> third<00:01:53.820> plant<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.530> tillandsia<00:01:55.530> pruin<00:01:56.310> Ossa

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
the third plant is tillandsia pruin Ossa

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.460 
the third plant is tillandsia pruin Ossa
although<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.960> still<00:01:58.670> considered<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.240> be

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
although it is still considered to be

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.560 
although it is still considered to be
more<00:02:01.470> or<00:02:01.620> less<00:02:01.650> green<00:02:02.040> variety<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:03.150> you

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
more or less green variety but as you

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.360 
more or less green variety but as you
can<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> has<00:02:04.350> already<00:02:04.590> plenty<00:02:05.100> of

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
can see it has already plenty of

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.809 
can see it has already plenty of
trichomes<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.650> in<00:02:07.650> these<00:02:07.890> trichomes

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
trichomes to it and in these trichomes

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.070 
trichomes to it and in these trichomes
protect<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.599> plant<00:02:09.899> from<00:02:10.050> intense

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
protect the plant from intense

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.350 
protect the plant from intense
right<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.680> plant<00:02:12.070> already<00:02:13.030> enjoys<00:02:13.330> a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
right so this plant already enjoys a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.550 
right so this plant already enjoys a
fair<00:02:13.870> amount<00:02:13.990> of<00:02:14.410> light<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:19.540> next<00:02:19.840> species<00:02:20.050> is

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
fair amount of light the next species is

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.000 
fair amount of light the next species is
tillandsia<00:02:21.390> McNew<00:02:22.390> sienna<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.080> tillandsia

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
tillandsia McNew sienna and tillandsia

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.910 
tillandsia McNew sienna and tillandsia
McNew<00:02:24.460> Siana<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:25.090> what<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.690> call<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.320> great<00:02:26.650> tool

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
McNew Siana is what I call a great tool

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.220 
McNew Siana is what I call a great tool
NCR<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.060> covered<00:02:28.480> all<00:02:28.720> over<00:02:28.780> with

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
NCR it is covered all over with

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.430 
NCR it is covered all over with
trichomes<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.840> therefore<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:32.080> needs<00:02:32.110> a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
trichomes and therefore it needs a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.400 
trichomes and therefore it needs a
bright<00:02:32.790> position<00:02:33.790> don't<00:02:34.420> put<00:02:34.720> them<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:35.260> dark

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
bright position don't put them in a dark

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.950 
bright position don't put them in a dark
position<00:02:35.980> they<00:02:36.340> they're<00:02:37.210> going<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.480> grow<00:02:37.600> ugly

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
position they they're going to grow ugly
