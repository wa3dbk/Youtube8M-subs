00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
what I'm going to do is spin it around

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.490 
what I'm going to do is spin it around
oh<00:00:28.849> maybe<00:00:29.849> three<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.599> four<00:00:30.900> times<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:33.500> one

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
oh maybe three or four times and one

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.850 
oh maybe three or four times and one
thing<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> pay<00:00:35.040> close<00:00:35.370> attention<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:37.730> is<00:00:38.730> that

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
thing to pay close attention to is that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.130 
thing to pay close attention to is that
you<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.160> embed<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> nicely<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.719> don't

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you really embed it nicely but I don't

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.229 
you really embed it nicely but I don't
go<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.680> maybe<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> last<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.940> or<00:00:45.210> two

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
go up to maybe the last one or two

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
go up to maybe the last one or two
threads<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.100> reason

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
threads and I do that for a reason

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.330 
threads and I do that for a reason
because<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.989> does<00:00:49.230> get<00:00:49.410> stringy<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
because if this does get stringy you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.729 
because if this does get stringy you
don't<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> coming<00:00:51.449> back<00:00:51.870> into<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
don't want it coming back into the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
don't want it coming back into the
showerhead<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.430> creating<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> clog<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.360> that's

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
showerhead and creating a clog so that's

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
showerhead and creating a clog so that's
why<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> stopped<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.710> short<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.239> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
why I stopped a little bit short here so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.619 
why I stopped a little bit short here so
the<00:00:57.360> next<00:00:57.629> step<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.359> put<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the next step is to actually put the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.560 
the next step is to actually put the
shower<00:01:00.930> head<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:02.809> oops<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.570> want

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570

washer here and you can hit you can get
away<00:02:32.849> with<00:02:33.150> hand<00:02:33.390> tightening<00:02:33.900> these<00:02:34.110> I've

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
away with hand tightening these I've

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.330 
away with hand tightening these I've
done<00:02:35.190> several<00:02:36.030> installations<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.860> hand

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
done several installations and just hand

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.509 
done several installations and just hand
tightening<00:02:38.819> them<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.510> good<00:02:39.720> enough<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:41.069> you

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
tightening them is good enough so you

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.100 
tightening them is good enough so you
got<00:02:41.700> one<00:02:41.940> end<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.360> hose<00:02:42.480> go<00:02:42.720> into<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
showerhead and then you got another one

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.729 
showerhead and then you got another one
going<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> shower<00:02:46.079> handle<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.400> again<00:02:48.739> make

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
hose is going to be kinked a little bit

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.020 
hose is going to be kinked a little bit
and<00:03:25.799> that's<00:03:26.459> normal<00:03:27.030> but<00:03:27.180> over<00:03:27.540> time<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:29.730> will

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and that's normal but over time it will

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.870 
and that's normal but over time it will
get<00:03:30.540> some<00:03:30.780> slack<00:03:31.109> in<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.859> I'll<00:03:32.459> show<00:03:32.849> you

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.520 
this bad boy up and I'll show you how it
works<00:03:41.069> so<00:03:41.340> turn<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.180> water<00:03:42.419> on<00:03:44.810> okay<00:03:45.840> already

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
works so turn the water on okay already

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.680 
works so turn the water on okay already
we've<00:03:46.829> got<00:03:47.069> good<00:03:47.370> pressure<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.299> it's

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
we've got good pressure and it's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.289 
we've got good pressure and it's
operating<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.560> lot<00:03:50.100> better<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:50.970> there's<00:03:51.239> a

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
operating a lot better so there's a

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.440 
operating a lot better so there's a
little<00:03:51.540> handle<00:03:51.989> on<00:03:52.199> the<00:03:52.350> side<00:03:52.620> of<00:03:53.070> the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
little handle on the side of the

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.140 
little handle on the side of the
tuition<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:55.670> handle<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.980> horizontal

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
tuition the handle in this horizontal

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.140 
tuition the handle in this horizontal
location<00:03:59.440> operates<00:04:00.440> just<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:01.640> showerhead

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
location operates just the showerhead

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.720 
location operates just the showerhead
itself<00:04:02.750> let's<00:04:03.709> see<00:04:03.890> what<00:04:04.010> happens<00:04:04.400> when<00:04:04.610> you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
itself let's see what happens when you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.910 
itself let's see what happens when you
go<00:04:04.879> to<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.420> vertical<00:04:05.900> section<00:04:06.379> if<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.709> go<00:04:06.860> to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
go to the vertical section if you go to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.430 
go to the vertical section if you go to
the<00:04:07.129> vertical<00:04:07.459> section<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.750> looks<00:04:09.050> like

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
the vertical section it looks like

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.880 
the vertical section it looks like
here's<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.420> vertical<00:04:11.420> location<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.830> just

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
here's the vertical location it just

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:20.430 
here's the vertical location it just
operates<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:16.120> hand<00:04:17.120> shower<00:04:17.450> like<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:18.760> okay

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
operates the hand shower like so okay

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.840 
operates the hand shower like so okay
now<00:04:21.440> let's<00:04:22.190> see<00:04:23.950> if<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.010> turn<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.669> whole

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
now let's see if you turn it the whole

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.060 
now let's see if you turn it the whole
way<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.330> right<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:29.030> operates<00:04:29.630> both<00:04:30.070> the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
way to the right it operates both the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.260 
way to the right it operates both the
showerhead<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:34.070> shower<00:04:34.370> handle<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.210> you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
showerhead and the shower handle so you

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.690 
showerhead and the shower handle so you
can<00:04:35.360> use<00:04:35.720> both<00:04:35.990> at<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.620> same<00:04:36.889> time<00:04:37.250> pretty

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
can use both at the same time pretty

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.379 
can use both at the same time pretty
sweet

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
sweet

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.370 
sweet
I<00:04:39.580> think<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:41.389> missus<00:04:41.720> is<00:04:41.840> going<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.080> be<00:04:42.200> pretty

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
I think the missus is going to be pretty

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.150 
I think the missus is going to be pretty
happy<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:42.800> again<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:44.330> got<00:04:44.770> completely<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:46.040> the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
happy so again you got completely to the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.550 
happy so again you got completely to the
right<00:04:46.190> operates<00:04:47.120> both<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.050> showerhead<00:04:48.380> and

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
right operates both the showerhead and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.250 
right operates both the showerhead and
the<00:04:48.860> shower<00:04:49.100> handle<00:04:49.750> vertical<00:04:50.750> position

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
the shower handle vertical position

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.860 
the shower handle vertical position
should<00:04:52.070> just<00:04:52.310> operate<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.150> shower<00:04:53.389> handle

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
should just operate the shower handle

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.620 
should just operate the shower handle
and<00:04:54.550> then<00:04:55.550> completely<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.540> left<00:04:58.630> operates

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
and then completely to the left operates

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.020 
and then completely to the left operates
just<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.350> showerhead<00:05:00.740> so<00:05:01.190> pretty<00:05:01.820> cool

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
just the showerhead so pretty cool
