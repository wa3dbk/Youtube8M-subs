and<00:02:03.829> I<00:02:04.399> keep<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:04.969> on<00:02:05.210> when<00:02:05.929> I'm<00:02:06.049> not<00:02:06.229> using

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
and I keep this on when I'm not using

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.669 
and I keep this on when I'm not using
the<00:02:07.999> eyeshadow<00:02:08.780> because<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.080> think<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.380> kind<00:02:09.590> of

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
the eyeshadow because I think it kind of

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.990 
the eyeshadow because I think it kind of
keeps<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:10.039> packed<00:02:10.429> in

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
keeps it packed in

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.510 
keeps it packed in
nice<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.360> tightly<00:02:11.630> because<00:02:12.320> this<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:13.040> so

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
nice and tightly because this is so

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.940 
nice and tightly because this is so
finely<00:02:14.270> milled<00:02:14.510> when<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.960> touch<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.650> and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
finely milled when you touch this and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.010 
finely milled when you touch this and
rub<00:02:16.670> your<00:02:16.820> finger<00:02:17.210> around<00:02:17.480> there<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.780> feels

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
rub your finger around there it feels

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.010 
rub your finger around there it feels
like<00:02:18.200> you're<00:02:18.350> touching<00:02:18.710> suede<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.360> soft

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
like you're touching suede it's so soft

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.860 
like you're touching suede it's so soft
and<00:02:21.410> smooth<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.310> love<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.390> goes<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.750> my

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
and smooth I love this it goes on my

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.130 
and smooth I love this it goes on my
eyes<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.440> color<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:24.980> have<00:02:25.220> right<00:02:25.460> now<00:02:25.490> is

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
eyes the color that I have right now is

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.210 
eyes the color that I have right now is
let<00:02:27.140> me<00:02:27.230> see<00:02:27.350> if<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.500> can<00:02:27.620> get<00:02:27.740> just<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.980> dab<00:02:28.190> of

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
let me see if I can get just a dab of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.100 
let me see if I can get just a dab of
this<00:02:28.520> on<00:02:28.670> my<00:02:28.820> finger<00:02:29.240> here<00:02:29.390> I'll<00:02:29.540> also<00:02:29.780> show

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
this on my finger here I'll also show

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.900 
this on my finger here I'll also show
you<00:02:30.200> some<00:02:30.410> pictures<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.770> it<00:02:31.040> but<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:31.610> have<00:02:31.640> to

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
you some pictures of it but you have to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.520 
you some pictures of it but you have to
be<00:02:32.000> really<00:02:32.270> gentle<00:02:32.570> with<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:33.110> because<00:02:33.320> I

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
be really gentle with this because I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.960 
be really gentle with this because I
really<00:02:33.830> think<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.250> if<00:02:34.340> you're<00:02:34.490> not<00:02:34.670> careful

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
really think that if you're not careful

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.670 
really think that if you're not careful
you<00:02:35.240> can<00:02:35.360> come<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.630> dig<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> big<00:02:36.110> hole<00:02:36.140> in<00:02:36.380> this

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you can come and dig a big hole in this

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.220 
you can come and dig a big hole in this
because<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.400> soft<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.150> again<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:39.200> I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
because it's so soft and again like I

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.720 
because it's so soft and again like I
said<00:02:39.350> what<00:02:39.590> I'm<00:02:39.680> not<00:02:39.830> using<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.340> put<00:02:40.550> this

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
said what I'm not using it I put this

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.080 
said what I'm not using it I put this
top<00:02:41.600> back<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.140> there<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.590> seal<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.040> all<00:02:43.160> up<00:02:43.400> but

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
top back on there and seal it all up but

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.500 
top back on there and seal it all up but
the<00:02:44.239> extreme<00:02:44.690> expresso<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.850> this<00:02:46.850> shade<00:02:47.180> right

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
the extreme expresso is this shade right

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.930 
the extreme expresso is this shade right
here<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:48.470> I'll<00:02:48.890> actually<00:02:49.130> take<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.640> photograph

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
here and I'll actually take a photograph

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.940 
here and I'll actually take a photograph
and<00:02:50.390> put<00:02:50.600> on<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.930> piece<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.260> paper<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.770> can

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
and put on a piece of paper so you can

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.890 
and put on a piece of paper so you can
really<00:02:52.070> get<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.310> good<00:02:52.370> look<00:02:52.640> at<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:53.000> but<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.570> on

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
really get a good look at it but it on

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.530 
really get a good look at it but it on
it<00:02:54.230> has<00:02:54.530> no<00:02:54.800> shimmer<00:02:55.070> because<00:02:55.640> right<00:02:55.910> now<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.390> am

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
it has no shimmer because right now I am

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.660 
it has no shimmer because right now I am
wearing<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.530> there<00:02:57.830> is<00:02:57.980> no<00:02:58.160> shimmer<00:02:58.459> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
wearing it and there is no shimmer to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.880 
wearing it and there is no shimmer to
this<00:02:58.820> it's<00:02:59.540> buildable<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.650> put<00:03:00.860> a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
this it's buildable so you can put a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.590 
this it's buildable so you can put a
little<00:03:01.190> bit<00:03:01.340> on<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.820> just<00:03:01.910> get<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.420> bit

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
little bit on and just get a little bit

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.600 
little bit on and just get a little bit
of<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> shadow<00:03:02.930> or<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.380> can<00:03:03.530> really<00:03:03.920> pile<00:03:04.310> this

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
of a shadow or you can really pile this

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.750 
of a shadow or you can really pile this
on<00:03:04.820> and<00:03:05.060> get<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.180> really<00:03:05.540> nice<00:03:05.900> smokey<00:03:06.739> eye<00:03:06.950> the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
on and get a really nice smokey eye the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.780 
on and get a really nice smokey eye the
only<00:03:08.239> thing<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.810> don't<00:03:08.900> like<00:03:09.470> about<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.459> I

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
only thing I don't like about this is I

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.250 
only thing I don't like about this is I
have<00:03:11.030> tried<00:03:11.330> several<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:12.260> shadow<00:03:12.650> brushes<00:03:13.100> and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
have tried several I shadow brushes and

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.900 
have tried several I shadow brushes and
none<00:03:15.260> of<00:03:15.290> them<00:03:15.680> it's<00:03:16.220> kind<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.549> little<00:03:16.700> hard

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
none of them it's kind of a little hard

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.850 
none of them it's kind of a little hard
to<00:03:17.090> apply<00:03:17.330> for<00:03:17.780> some<00:03:17.959> reason<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.500> gets<00:03:18.709> a

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
to apply for some reason it gets a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.310 
to apply for some reason it gets a
little<00:03:18.950> smudgy<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:20.120> found<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.630> my<00:03:20.780> finger

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
little smudgy and I found that my finger

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.470 
little smudgy and I found that my finger
is<00:03:21.350> probably<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.519> best<00:03:22.820> way<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.090> apply

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
is probably the the best way to apply

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.140 
is probably the the best way to apply
this<00:03:23.600> at<00:03:23.989> least<00:03:24.140> for<00:03:24.470> me<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.890> can<00:03:25.489> kind<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.820> avoid

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
this at least for me I can kind of avoid

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.870 
this at least for me I can kind of avoid
getting<00:03:26.420> kind<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:27.019> patchy<00:03:27.430> looks<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
getting kind of patchy looks to the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.130 
getting kind of patchy looks to the
eyeshadow<00:03:29.420> it's<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.690> little<00:03:29.870> bit<00:03:29.989> more

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
eyeshadow it's a little bit more

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.380 
eyeshadow it's a little bit more
smoother<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:30.980> don't<00:03:31.190> have<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:31.790> smudgy<00:03:32.299> as

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
smoother and I don't have the smudgy as

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.330 
smoother and I don't have the smudgy as
I<00:03:32.480> do<00:03:32.540> when<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.870> try<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.200> use<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.560> brush<00:03:33.769> so<00:03:34.100> I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
I do when I try to use the brush so I

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.800 
I do when I try to use the brush so I
don't<00:03:34.760> know<00:03:34.850> if<00:03:34.910> it's<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.239> warmth<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.750> my

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
don't know if it's the warmth of my

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.780 
don't know if it's the warmth of my
finger<00:03:36.470> or<00:03:36.680> what<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:36.980> is<00:03:37.010> but<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.400> just<00:03:37.610> have

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
finger or what it is but I just have

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.880 
finger or what it is but I just have
