right of that little lip thing and then
throw<00:03:27.650> as<00:03:27.890> soon<00:03:28.130> as<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.310> crosshair<00:03:28.700> purses<00:03:29.060> the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
throw as soon as a crosshair purses the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.490 
throw as soon as a crosshair purses the
crosses<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> first<00:03:30.530> wire<00:03:31.160> there<00:03:31.550> we<00:03:31.640> go<00:03:32.500> move

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
crosses the first wire there we go move

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.770 
crosses the first wire there we go move
there<00:03:34.280> we<00:03:34.430> go<00:03:34.550> oh<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:35.180> was<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.300> close<00:03:35.450> one

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
there we go oh that was a close one

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.970 
there we go oh that was a close one
yeah<00:03:36.170> sometimes<00:03:36.470> it's<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.800> little

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
yeah sometimes it's a little

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.170 
yeah sometimes it's a little
inconsistent<00:03:37.610> I'd<00:03:37.730> recommend<00:03:38.150> just

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
inconsistent I'd recommend just

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.140 
inconsistent I'd recommend just
practicing<00:03:38.780> a<00:03:38.840> lot<00:03:39.640> sometimes<00:03:40.640> it<00:03:40.790> messes<00:03:40.880> up

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
practicing a lot sometimes it messes up

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.030 
practicing a lot sometimes it messes up
since<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.570> a<00:03:41.600> running<00:03:41.959> smoke<00:03:42.230> but<00:03:42.620> uh<00:03:42.650> yeah

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
since it is a running smoke but uh yeah

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.250 
since it is a running smoke but uh yeah
I'd<00:03:43.489> recommend<00:03:43.910> practicing<00:03:44.060> them<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:45.110> end

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
I'd recommend practicing them that end

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.110 
I'd recommend practicing them that end
up<00:03:45.350> working<00:03:45.530> them<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.070> then<00:03:46.670> the<00:03:46.790> other<00:03:46.820> one<00:03:47.090> I

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
up working them and then the other one I

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.610 
up working them and then the other one I
like<00:03:47.269> line<00:03:47.600> up<00:03:47.750> here<00:03:48.910> point<00:03:49.910> here<00:03:50.440> then<00:03:51.440> run

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
like line up here point here then run

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.740 
like line up here point here then run
for<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.830> second<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.190> throw<00:03:52.630> bounces<00:03:53.630> off<00:03:53.720> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
for a second and throw bounces off the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.570 
for a second and throw bounces off the
blue<00:03:54.019> thing<00:03:54.290> then<00:03:54.800> over<00:03:54.980> here<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.310> lands<00:03:55.459> on

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
blue thing then over here and lands on

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.120 
blue thing then over here and lands on
