00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:24.369
 Rain on the surface of the nail pushes up 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:30.340
 It's beautiful because it says to remove the watermelon bar that sticks to the surface thinly 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:34.910
 It will be a very important part of improving finish and gel retention 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:40.370
 I'd think let's remove immediately thin skin 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:46.620
 I will put on the remover I hear in 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:50.570

 Where is the point to note here? Yes the point to water here is a steep angle 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.820
 In about the 45-degree damage the convex life Bangs I 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.190
 I will proceed 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.580
 Rice or Ne 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:15.880
 As anyone with a thin skin picks up on the surface of the nail like this, this is firmly cleaned 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.390
 Please hit and raise this remains 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.200
 Even if I paint the gel, I am painting something on the river 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.370
 0 Easy to finish Finish is also an area 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.370
 It becomes 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.530
 2 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530
 Hmm 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.810
 Te leadership 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.810
 Not 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.119
 Clean the surface of the nail 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.810
 I will take a thin film full of rain that could not be removed 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.370
 What is the point of Poly 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.610
 It is not raining too much 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.440
 I'll polish only a clean extra Migakugake 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.460
 Yes 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.460

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.700
 Well-it became clear- 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.030
 Then I will scratch the surface of the nail 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.430
 District that is wound 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.150
 We will totally eliminate it so as not to cut too much 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.150
 goo 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:04.670
 By putting a scratch, you will have better holding of gel nails 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:09.330
 Too much scraping will make the nails thinner 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.210

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.040
 It seems that this work is so important 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.280
 I cut it lightly, but around the nail is addressed firmly 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.800
