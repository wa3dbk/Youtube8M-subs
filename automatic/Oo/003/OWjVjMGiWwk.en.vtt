hello<00:00:00.810> everyone<00:00:01.260> and<00:00:01.410> welcome<00:00:02.429> during<00:00:03.360> the

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hello everyone and welcome during the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.749 
hello everyone and welcome during the
last<00:00:03.629> week<00:00:03.780> or<00:00:04.049> so<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.560> set<00:00:05.100> my<00:00:05.250> focus<00:00:05.460> on

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
last week or so I set my focus on

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.579 
last week or so I set my focus on
improving<00:00:06.120> myself<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.990> trying<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.410> analyze

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
improving myself and trying to analyze

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.560 
improving myself and trying to analyze
situations<00:00:08.069> where<00:00:08.849> something<00:00:09.269> could<00:00:09.450> have

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
situations where something could have

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.749 
situations where something could have
gone<00:00:09.690> better<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.230> have<00:00:10.980> checked<00:00:11.219> everything

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
gone better I have checked everything

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.339 
gone better I have checked everything
that<00:00:12.059> might<00:00:12.269> give<00:00:12.420> me<00:00:12.450> at<00:00:12.690> least<00:00:12.719> slight

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
that might give me at least slight

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.220 
that might give me at least slight
advantage<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:14.190> thought<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.509> using<00:00:15.870> smart

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
advantage I thought that using smart

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.070 
advantage I thought that using smart
cast<00:00:16.500> will<00:00:17.070> take<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.670> higher<00:00:17.850> level<00:00:18.080> well

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
cast will take it to a higher level well

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.670 
cast will take it to a higher level well
the<00:00:19.199> answer<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.400> rather<00:00:21.060> complicated

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
the answer to that is rather complicated

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.200 
the answer to that is rather complicated
you<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:22.920> there<00:00:23.130> are<00:00:23.189> actually<00:00:23.369> three<00:00:23.970> types

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
you see there are actually three types

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.450 
you see there are actually three types
of<00:00:24.390> casting<00:00:24.869> people<00:00:25.289> usually<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.949> about<00:00:26.220> two

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of casting people usually know about two

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.029 
of casting people usually know about two
of<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.449> normal<00:00:27.810> casting<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.769> smart

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
of them the normal casting and the smart

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.490 
of them the normal casting and the smart
casting<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:30.480> there<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.900> also<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.230> hybrid

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
casting but there is also a hybrid

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.310 
casting but there is also a hybrid
option<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.850> option<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.110> bottom

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
option that option is at the very bottom

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.430 
option that option is at the very bottom
of<00:00:34.649> your<00:00:34.710> menu<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.480> some<00:00:36.480> reason<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.200> very

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
of your menu for some reason it is very

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.639 
of your menu for some reason it is very
well<00:00:37.620> hidden<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:39.000> allows<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.840> aim<00:00:40.050> while

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
well hidden this allows you to aim while

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.650 
well hidden this allows you to aim while
firing<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.430> same<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.420> smart

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
firing the same way you do with smart

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.010 
firing the same way you do with smart
cast<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> will<00:00:44.040> come<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> later<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
cast but I will come to it later so the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
cast but I will come to it later so the
difference<00:00:46.410> between<00:00:46.530> smart<00:00:47.190> cast<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> normal

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
difference between smart cast and normal

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.139 
difference between smart cast and normal
cast<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:49.010> if<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.070> are<00:00:50.250> normal<00:00:50.730> casting

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
cast is this if you are normal casting

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.810 
cast is this if you are normal casting
you<00:00:51.480> press<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> button<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.469> try<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> aim<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you press the button you try to aim and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.900 
you press the button you try to aim and
then<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.510> click<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> fire<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.160> smartass

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
then you click to fire if you smartass

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.150 
then you click to fire if you smartass
the<00:00:57.360> skill<00:00:57.629> will<00:00:57.870> fire<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.770> press<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the skill will fire as you press the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.889 
the skill will fire as you press the
button<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> current<00:01:00.149> location<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.719> your

button to the current location of your

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.860 
button to the current location of your
cursor<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.100> obviously<00:01:02.760> smart<00:01:03.059> casting<00:01:03.510> will

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
cursor so obviously smart casting will

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.260 
cursor so obviously smart casting will
help<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.290> fire<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.739> abilities<00:01:05.280> faster<00:01:05.820> but

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
help you fire your abilities faster but

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.929 
help you fire your abilities faster but
at<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> cost<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.229> aim<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.799> play<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> game

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
at the cost of your aim I play this game

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
at the cost of your aim I play this game
for<00:01:09.210> four<00:01:09.479> years<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.439> never<00:01:10.740> used

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
for four years and I have never used

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.700 
for four years and I have never used
smart<00:01:11.369> cut<00:01:11.549> before<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.270> felt<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.140> trying<00:01:13.470> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
smart cut before I felt like trying to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
smart cut before I felt like trying to
get<00:01:13.950> used<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.580> will<00:01:14.939> confuse<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
get used to it will confuse me in the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.980 
get used to it will confuse me in the
long<00:01:16.110> run<00:01:16.380> which<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:18.060> true<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.720> not

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
long run which is actually true it's not

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.950 
long run which is actually true it's not
that<00:01:19.350> easy<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.490> pick<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:21.000> so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that easy to actually just pick it up so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740 
that easy to actually just pick it up so
instead<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.680> use<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> option<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.240> smart<00:01:24.509> cast

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
instead I use the option to smart cast

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
instead I use the option to smart cast
only<00:01:24.990> some<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.680> abilities<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.060> do

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
only some of my abilities you can do

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.060 
only some of my abilities you can do
this<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:27.900> checking<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.439> lightning<00:01:28.829> sight

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
this by checking the lightning sight

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.580 
this by checking the lightning sight
just<00:01:29.400> below<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> keybindings

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
just below the keybindings

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.859 
just below the keybindings
by<00:01:31.590> doing<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.610> slowly<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.360> used<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
by doing this you can slowly get used to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.899 
by doing this you can slowly get used to
using<00:01:34.079> smart<00:01:34.590> cast<00:01:34.890> without<00:01:35.520> getting

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
using smart cast without getting

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.690 
using smart cast without getting
confused<00:01:36.030> too<00:01:36.570> much<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.860> reason<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.369> try<00:01:38.640> to

confused too much the reason I try to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
confused too much the reason I try to

back<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> hybrid<00:02:03.869> option<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.409> talked

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
back to the hybrid option that I talked

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.910 
back to the hybrid option that I talked
about<00:02:04.920> earlier<00:02:05.570> how<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> works<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.530> when

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
about earlier how it works is that when

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.400 
about earlier how it works is that when
you<00:02:08.069> press<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.580> button<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.030> hold<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.229> can

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
you press the button and hold it you can

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.850 
you press the button and hold it you can
see<00:02:10.649> where<00:02:10.920> you're<00:02:11.129> aiming

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
see where you're aiming

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.850 
see where you're aiming
it<00:02:12.820> will<00:02:13.090> fire<00:02:13.390> after<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.260> actually<00:02:14.650> release

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
it will fire after you actually release

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.730 
it will fire after you actually release
the<00:02:15.190> button<00:02:15.490> there<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.750> effect<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
the button there is a effect that you

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.080 
the button there is a effect that you
should<00:02:17.950> probably<00:02:18.070> know<00:02:18.430> if<00:02:18.730> you're<00:02:18.910> using

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
should probably know if you're using

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.320 
should probably know if you're using
this<00:02:19.390> option<00:02:20.070> because<00:02:21.070> how<00:02:21.610> most<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
this option because how most of the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.810 
this option because how most of the
games<00:02:22.540> are<00:02:22.750> designed<00:02:23.200> these<00:02:23.380> days<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:24.010> human

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
games are designed these days a human

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.060 
games are designed these days a human
brain<00:02:24.970> will<00:02:25.450> focus<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:26.110> how<00:02:26.290> fast<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.740> press

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
brain will focus on how fast you press

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.130 
brain will focus on how fast you press
the<00:02:27.250> button<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.730> not<00:02:28.150> how<00:02:28.360> fast<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.810> release

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the button and not how fast you release

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.490 
the button and not how fast you release
it<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.550> if<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.940> comes<00:02:31.090> down<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.450> how<00:02:31.870> fast<00:02:32.230> you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
it so if it comes down to how fast you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.890 
it so if it comes down to how fast you
actually<00:02:32.830> shoot<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.250> skills<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.450> almost

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
actually shoot the skills it is almost

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.020 
actually shoot the skills it is almost
the<00:02:35.110> same<00:02:35.290> as<00:02:35.560> if<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:35.770> use<00:02:35.950> normal<00:02:36.580> gusting

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the same as if you use normal gusting

better hybrid system
most<00:02:43.720> people<00:02:44.110> use<00:02:44.230> normal<00:02:44.620> casting<00:02:45.040> with

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
most people use normal casting with

most people use normal casting with
smart<00:02:45.700> casting<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.270> their<00:02:46.480> shift<00:02:46.690> key<00:02:47.070> meaning

smart casting on their shift key meaning

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.160 
smart casting on their shift key meaning

that if you hold shift your spell's will
fire<00:02:50.410> as<00:02:50.680> if<00:02:50.890> they<00:02:51.010> were<00:02:51.130> smart<00:02:51.370> casted<00:02:51.910> he<00:02:52.900> on

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
a huge difference is it but you can

all<00:03:19.000> works<00:03:19.269> let's<00:03:19.989> have<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.170> look<00:03:20.410> at<00:03:20.650> when<00:03:21.010> it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
all works let's have a look at when it

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.490 
all works let's have a look at when it
is<00:03:21.280> an<00:03:21.489> advantage<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.299> when<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.110> just<00:03:23.410> a

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
is an advantage and when it is just a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.310 
is an advantage and when it is just a
matter<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.860> preference<00:03:24.540> first<00:03:25.540> one<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:25.989> want<00:03:26.230> to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
matter of preference first one I want to

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.350 
matter of preference first one I want to
mention<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.950> rise<00:03:27.340> because<00:03:27.880> he<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.209> a

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
mention this rise because he is a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.350 
mention this rise because he is a
perfect<00:03:28.900> example<00:03:29.130> rise<00:03:30.130> same<00:03:30.700> as<00:03:30.880> most<00:03:31.120> other

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
perfect example rise same as most other

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.430 
perfect example rise same as most other
mages<00:03:31.630> uses<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.739> cue<00:03:33.100> system<00:03:33.370> for<00:03:33.850> his<00:03:33.970> skills

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
mages uses a cue system for his skills

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.350 
mages uses a cue system for his skills
so<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.620> doesn't<00:03:35.950> actually<00:03:36.070> matter<00:03:36.459> what<00:03:37.090> kind

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
so it doesn't actually matter what kind

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.380 
so it doesn't actually matter what kind
of<00:03:37.450> casting<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.049> are<00:03:38.200> using<00:03:38.590> if<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.519> cast<00:03:39.730> Uwe

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
of casting you are using if you cast Uwe

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.170 
of casting you are using if you cast Uwe
using<00:03:41.049> normal<00:03:41.380> casting<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.670> same<00:03:42.940> as

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
using normal casting it is the same as

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.180 
using normal casting it is the same as
if<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.390> smashed<00:03:43.870> your<00:03:44.019> keyboard<00:03:44.500> using<00:03:44.890> smart

if you cast Ward's you can see the color

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.599
