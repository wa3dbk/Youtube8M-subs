00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
war against one hive so this one is

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.410 
war against one hive so this one is
about<00:00:11.940> eight<00:00:12.360> hours<00:00:12.559> to<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> end<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.980> war<00:00:14.420> we

basically that's the update I'm gonna
put<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:43.200> course<00:00:43.800> many<00:00:44.570> many<00:00:45.570> more<00:00:45.809> attacks

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
put of course many many more attacks
later<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> damage<00:00:48.510> that

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
later you can see here the damage that

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.010 
later you can see here the damage that
one<00:00:49.020> hive<00:00:49.230> done<00:00:49.469> us<00:00:50.329> that's<00:00:51.329> that's<00:00:51.930> pretty

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
one hive done us that's that's pretty

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.910 
one hive done us that's that's pretty
much<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:54.050> my<00:00:55.050> base<00:00:55.230> by<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.469> way<00:00:55.620> got

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
much it and my base by the way got

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
much it and my base by the way got
attacked<00:00:56.219> four<00:00:57.000> times<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.980> pretty

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
attacked four times so that's pretty

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.720 
attacked four times so that's pretty
good<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.989> 24<00:01:00.989> their<00:01:01.590> last<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> world

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
good for 24 their last one in the world

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.760 
good for 24 their last one in the world
and<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> damage<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.790> done

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
and this is the damage that we have done

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.890 
and this is the damage that we have done
on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.460> hive<00:01:08.670> basis<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> let's<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.479> matak

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
on the one hive basis so let's see matak

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.289 
on the one hive basis so let's see matak
that's<00:01:13.170> probably<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> most<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.640> interesting

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that's probably the most not interesting

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.780 
that's probably the most not interesting
attack<00:01:15.930> because<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> last<00:01:16.650> base<00:01:17.150> but

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
attack because it's the last base but

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.020 
attack because it's the last base but
you<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> wait<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.170> rest<00:01:23.030> so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you will have to wait for the rest so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.450 
you will have to wait for the rest so
stay<00:01:24.930> tuned<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.740> clean<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.070> attack<00:01:26.310> by

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
stay tuned that's a clean up attack by

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.999 
stay tuned that's a clean up attack by
the<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.729> someone<00:01:26.939> failed<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.650> know

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the way someone failed on it and I know

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.819 
the way someone failed on it and I know
the<00:01:29.340> Tesla<00:01:29.759> locations<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.590> basically<00:01:31.590> that's

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the Tesla locations and basically that's

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.890 
the Tesla locations and basically that's
that's<00:01:32.250> pretty<00:01:32.310> much<00:01:32.610> what<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> needed<00:01:33.180> I'm

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900

honestly didn't do this attack for about
seven<00:01:40.350> months<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.860> something<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.460> but

seven months or something like that but

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.990 
seven months or something like that but
this<00:01:42.930> base<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.229> totally<00:01:43.799> welcome<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> we

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this base is totally welcome in it we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.020 
this base is totally welcome in it we
put<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.899> air<00:01:46.170> defenses<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.670> core

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
put all of this air defenses in the core

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
put all of this air defenses in the core
queen<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.840> close<00:01:49.320> enough<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.920> core<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
queen is close enough to the core and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.260 
queen is close enough to the core and
she<00:01:50.729> will<00:01:50.850> jump<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> location<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.729> my

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
she will jump to the location of my

she will jump to the location of my
heroes<00:01:54.630> logo<00:01:55.110> will<00:01:55.350> by<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.649> way<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.009> not

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
heroes logo will by the way it's not

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.800 
heroes logo will by the way it's not
logo<00:01:56.490> wipe<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> bit<00:01:57.899> wrong<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:59.810> I'm

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
logo wipe so I was a bit wrong so I'm

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.539 
logo wipe so I was a bit wrong so I'm
going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.110> add<00:02:01.229> allies<00:02:01.560> probably<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.250> attack

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
going to add allies probably this attack

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.429 
going to add allies probably this attack
later<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.390> gonna<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.780> now<00:02:03.960> there<00:02:04.320> are

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
later not gonna do that now there are

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.719 
later not gonna do that now there are
there<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.710> small<00:02:05.009> things<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
there are small things that you get a

there are small things that you get a
consider<00:02:06.180> my<00:02:06.780> bbqing<00:02:07.290> by<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.530> way<00:02:07.710> goes

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
consider my bbqing by the way goes

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.050 
consider my bbqing by the way goes
go<00:02:09.420> shopping<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:11.250> almost<00:02:11.460> freaked<00:02:11.910> me

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
go shopping and that almost freaked me

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.840 
go shopping and that almost freaked me
out<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.450> somehow<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.930> got<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.350> anyway<00:02:14.040> so

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
out but somehow I got this anyway so

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.130 
out but somehow I got this anyway so
there<00:02:15.300> are<00:02:15.390> small<00:02:15.600> things<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.960> gotta

there are small things you gotta

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.840 
there are small things you gotta
consider<00:02:16.440> here<00:02:16.740> for<00:02:16.950> example<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.460> stour

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
consider here for example that we stour

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.510 
consider here for example that we stour
on<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.270> top<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.200> was<00:02:19.740> waiting<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.340> take

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
on the top that I was waiting to take

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.610 
on the top that I was waiting to take
out<00:02:20.730> before<00:02:21.360> send<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.810> wall<00:02:21.960> breakers<00:02:22.350> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
out before send the wall breakers and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.310 
out before send the wall breakers and
those<00:02:22.980> small<00:02:23.460> issues<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:25.140> gotta

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
those small issues that you gotta

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.980 
those small issues that you gotta
consider<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:25.980> you're<00:02:26.070> attacking<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.990> it

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
consider when you're attacking and it

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.350 
consider when you're attacking and it
might<00:02:28.380> may<00:02:28.590> make<00:02:29.040> your<00:02:30.320> your<00:02:31.320> attack<00:02:31.590> feel<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
might may make your your attack feel and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.060 
might may make your your attack feel and
one<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.570> attacks<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:34.110> my<00:02:34.320> base<00:02:34.560> actually

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
one of the attacks on my base actually

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.240 
one of the attacks on my base actually
feel<00:02:35.280> because<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.670> put<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> waste<00:02:36.240> our<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:38.130> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
feel because I put a waste our in in a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.370 
feel because I put a waste our in in a
place<00:02:38.490> where<00:02:38.880> wall<00:02:39.180> breakers<00:02:39.600> most<00:02:40.110> likely

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
place where wall breakers most likely

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.350 
place where wall breakers most likely
will<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.860> used<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.730> killed<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> wall

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
will be used and it killed the wall

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.930 
will be used and it killed the wall
breakers<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.740> attack<00:02:44.010> totally<00:02:44.430> feels<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
breakers and the attack totally feels so

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.780 
breakers and the attack totally feels so
notice<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.600> I've<00:02:45.720> got<00:02:46.310> three<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.670> air

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
notice that I've got three of the air

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.730 
notice that I've got three of the air
defenses<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.540> start<00:02:48.810> sending<00:02:49.170> balloons<00:02:49.500> in

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
defenses and I start sending balloons in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.210 
defenses and I start sending balloons in
all<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> areas<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.210> are<00:02:52.050> clean<00:02:52.590> from<00:02:52.950> air

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
all of the areas that are clean from air

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.850 
all of the areas that are clean from air
defenses<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.970> now<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.810> fourth<00:02:55.260> air<00:02:55.560> defense

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
defenses and now the fourth air defense

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.300 
defenses and now the fourth air defense
is<00:02:55.950> going<00:02:56.130> down<00:02:56.370> queen<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.880> fully<00:02:57.150> alive<00:02:57.570> so

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
is going down queen is fully alive so

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.010 
is going down queen is fully alive so
this<00:02:59.310> base<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.960> going<00:03:00.960> down<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.660> wish<00:03:03.660> me<00:03:03.690> luck

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
this base is going down and wish me luck

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.890 
this base is going down and wish me luck
for<00:03:04.320> my<00:03:04.500> second<00:03:04.860> attack<00:03:05.100> hopefully<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.610> goes

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900
