montmartre<00:02:41.140> paper<00:02:41.500> can<00:02:41.829> really<00:02:42.250> pop<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.519> bit<00:02:42.760> of

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
montmartre paper can really pop a bit of

montmartre paper can really pop a bit of
a<00:02:42.910> hiding<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:44.319> could<00:02:44.500> use<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.739> fair<00:02:45.069> bit<00:02:45.250> of

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
a hiding so you could use a fair bit of

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.289 
a hiding so you could use a fair bit of
pressure<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:47.769> can<00:02:47.980> use<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> blending<00:02:48.760> stump<00:02:48.819> as

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
pressure you can use a blending stump as

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.500 
pressure you can use a blending stump as
well<00:02:49.510> for<00:02:49.810> tight<00:02:50.079> corners<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.709> edges<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.799> our

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
well for tight corners and edges so our

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.240 
well for tight corners and edges so our
turquoise<00:02:55.510> has<00:02:55.750> been<00:02:55.989> blended<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.980> I'm
