4 fountain and I reverse it this seems

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.029 
4 fountain and I reverse it this seems
to<00:00:40.089> be<00:00:40.179> the<00:00:40.300> one<00:00:40.420> that's<00:00:40.539> so<00:00:41.140> yummy<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.829> slip

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
to be the one that's so yummy to slip

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.569 
to be the one that's so yummy to slip
into<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.809> it's<00:00:44.079> it's<00:00:44.440> kind<00:00:44.559> of<00:00:44.769> it<00:00:45.039> but<00:00:45.460> it's

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
into so it's it's kind of it but it's

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.650 
into so it's it's kind of it but it's
mechanically<00:00:46.239> it's<00:00:46.329> actually<00:00:46.539> quite

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
mechanically it's actually quite

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.560 
mechanically it's actually quite
different<00:00:46.839> than<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.109> anti-japan<00:00:47.499> patent

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
different than the anti-japan patent

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.180 
different than the anti-japan patent
click<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.690> this<00:00:49.780> way<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.530> one's<00:00:50.769> actually

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
click it this way this one's actually

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.819 
click it this way this one's actually
going<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.489> be<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:52.719> bits<00:00:52.870> in<00:00:53.019> front<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.469> behind

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
going to be two bits in front to behind

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.369 
going to be two bits in front to behind
to<00:00:54.159> in<00:00:54.309> front<00:00:54.609> to<00:00:54.909> behind<00:00:55.359> front<00:00:55.839> front<00:00:56.199> back

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
to in front to behind front front back

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.009 
to in front to behind front front back
back<00:00:56.559> front<00:00:57.280> front<00:00:57.670> back<00:00:57.940> so<00:00:58.420> it's<00:00:58.539> more<00:00:58.839> like

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
back front front back so it's more like

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.709 
back front front back so it's more like
the<00:00:59.140> two<00:00:59.170> by<00:00:59.440> two<00:00:59.469> by<00:00:59.679> two<00:00:59.739> by<00:00:59.920> two<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.719> she's

the two by two by two by two and she's

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.320 
the two by two by two by two and she's
been<00:01:01.870> patent<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.909> it's<00:01:03.909> actually<00:01:04.180> quite<00:01:04.300> easy

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
been patent and it's actually quite easy

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.640 
been patent and it's actually quite easy
to<00:01:04.600> learn<00:01:04.809> because<00:01:05.019> we're<00:01:05.260> going<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.409> do<00:01:05.590> it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
to learn because we're going to do it
