00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
multi medium transfer on to metal you

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.789 
multi medium transfer on to metal you
can<00:00:12.129> do<00:00:12.459> a<00:00:12.789> multi<00:00:13.570> medium<00:00:13.869> transfer<00:00:14.350> on<00:00:14.530> to<00:00:14.770> a

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
can do a multi medium transfer on to a

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.830 
can do a multi medium transfer on to a
variety<00:00:15.039> of<00:00:15.459> surfaces<00:00:15.730> everything<00:00:16.630> from

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
variety of surfaces everything from

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.120 
variety of surfaces everything from
canvas<00:00:17.140> to<00:00:17.619> wood<00:00:17.890> to<00:00:18.850> paper<00:00:19.530> but<00:00:20.530> I<00:00:20.830> thought

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
canvas to wood to paper but I thought

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.060 
canvas to wood to paper but I thought
it'd<00:00:21.400> be<00:00:21.430> fun<00:00:21.850> to<00:00:22.060> show<00:00:22.300> you<00:00:22.360> a<00:00:22.750> transfer<00:00:23.380> on<00:00:23.710> to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
it'd be fun to show you a transfer on to

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
it'd be fun to show you a transfer on to
metal<00:00:24.610> so<00:00:25.510> here<00:00:25.930> I<00:00:25.960> have<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.710> piece<00:00:27.070> of<00:00:27.100> metal

directly into the medium and just make

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.789 
directly into the medium and just make
sure<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.340> it's<00:01:51.549> got<00:01:51.880> good<00:01:52.419> adhesion<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.560> all

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
sure that it's got good adhesion to all

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.279 
sure that it's got good adhesion to all
areas<00:01:54.459> so<00:01:54.759> press<00:01:55.090> down<00:01:55.119> but<00:01:55.749> you<00:01:55.869> don't<00:01:56.109> need

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
areas so press down but you don't need

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.199 
areas so press down but you don't need
to<00:01:56.349> brayer<00:01:57.340> or<00:01:58.319> really<00:01:59.319> burnish<00:01:59.829> it<00:02:00.099> and<00:02:00.639> then

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
to brayer or really burnish it and then

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.819 
to brayer or really burnish it and then
you<00:02:01.389> want<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.749> make<00:02:01.989> sure<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.349> this<00:02:02.499> dries

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
you want to make sure that this dries

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.309 
you want to make sure that this dries
all<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.340> way<00:02:03.489> so<00:02:03.759> ideally<00:02:04.389> I<00:02:04.569> like<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:05.109> wait

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
all the way so ideally I like to wait

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.709 
all the way so ideally I like to wait
till<00:02:05.590> overnight<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:06.819> could<00:02:06.999> wait<00:02:07.179> an<00:02:07.359> hour<00:02:07.509> or

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
till overnight you could wait an hour or

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.910 
till overnight you could wait an hour or
two<00:02:08.880> but<00:02:09.880> best<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.140> longer<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.710> let<00:02:11.860> it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
two but best is the longer you let it

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.339 
two but best is the longer you let it
dry<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.340> more

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
dry the more

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.319 
dry the more
the<00:02:13.860> better<00:02:14.069> results<00:02:14.670> you're<00:02:14.819> going<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.180> have

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
the better results you're going to have

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.270 
the better results you're going to have
because<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:16.170> number<00:02:16.469> one<00:02:16.620> thing<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.159> go

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
because the number one thing that can go

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.490 
because the number one thing that can go
wrong<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.909> not<00:02:17.939> letting<00:02:18.689> it<00:02:18.810> dry<00:02:19.140> all

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
wrong with it is not letting it dry all

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.750 
wrong with it is not letting it dry all
the<00:02:19.560> way<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.909> here's<00:02:21.269> one<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:21.659> already<00:02:22.109> dry

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
the way so here's one that's already dry

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.209 
the way so here's one that's already dry
so<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:23.969> for<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.359> next<00:02:24.390> step<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:26.010> going

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
so now for the next step I'm just going

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.039 
so now for the next step I'm just going
to<00:02:26.280> take<00:02:26.489> my<00:02:26.640> mist<00:02:26.909> or<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.269> just<00:02:27.569> has<00:02:27.750> water

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
to take my mist or this just has water

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.920 
to take my mist or this just has water
in<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.469> and<00:02:28.620> I'm<00:02:29.189> going<00:02:29.579> to<00:02:29.640> mist<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.950> now<00:02:32.159> I

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
in it and I'm going to mist it so now I

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.190 
in it and I'm going to mist it so now I
letting<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.109> water<00:02:34.650> soak<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.930> copy

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
letting that water soak in to the copy

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.740 
letting that water soak in to the copy
and<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.099> see<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.489> it's<00:02:38.760> making<00:02:39.359> that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
and you can see that it's making that

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.690 
and you can see that it's making that
copy<00:02:40.049> image<00:02:40.500> show<00:02:40.769> through<00:02:41.129> but<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.459> still

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
copy image show through but we still

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.509 
copy image show through but we still
have<00:02:41.970> paper<00:02:42.269> on<00:02:42.629> there<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> need<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.129> do

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519

is<00:02:44.879> start<00:02:45.269> rubbing<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.319> off<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.159> you<00:02:47.579> want

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
is start rubbing this off and I you want

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
to be really careful some times people

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.780 
to be really careful some times people
want<00:02:51.389> to<00:02:51.510> use<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.989> washcloth<00:02:52.799> or<00:02:53.310> something

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
want to use a washcloth or something

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.030 
want to use a washcloth or something
like<00:02:53.939> that<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.780> find<00:02:55.139> just<00:02:55.379> my<00:02:55.530> fingers

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
like that but I find just my fingers

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.940 
like that but I find just my fingers
work<00:02:56.310> best<00:02:56.669> for<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.120> paper<00:02:57.359> removal<00:02:58.019> process

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
work best for the paper removal process

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.050 
work best for the paper removal process
so<00:02:59.879> now<00:03:00.359> I'm<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.959> rubbing<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.939> removing<00:03:02.939> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
so now I'm just rubbing and removing the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.009 
so now I'm just rubbing and removing the
pulp<00:03:03.389> and<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:05.730> can<00:03:05.909> see<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.389> the<00:03:06.510> image<00:03:06.870> is

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
pulp and you can see that the image is

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.960 
pulp and you can see that the image is
starting<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.620> reveal<00:03:07.769> what<00:03:08.220> there's<00:03:08.400> still<00:03:08.700> a

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
starting to reveal what there's still a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.039 
starting to reveal what there's still a
lot<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.480> pulp<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:10.019> there<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.189> just<00:03:11.549> keep

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
lot of pulp on there so just keep

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.770 
lot of pulp on there so just keep
spraying<00:03:13.049> with<00:03:13.290> water<00:03:13.849> and<00:03:14.849> rubbing<00:03:15.389> this

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
spraying with water and rubbing this

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.189 
spraying with water and rubbing this
process<00:03:16.379> takes<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.950> little<00:03:17.489> time<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.810> get<00:03:18.959> all

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
process takes a little time to get all

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:24.559 
process takes a little time to get all
that<00:03:19.530> paper<00:03:19.889> removed<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:23.549> can<00:03:23.579> see<00:03:24.000> now<00:03:24.239> I

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
that paper removed and you can see now I

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.930 
that paper removed and you can see now I
have<00:03:24.870> removed<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.680> about<00:03:26.010> all<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.639> paper

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
have removed just about all of the paper

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.349 
have removed just about all of the paper
and<00:03:27.299> what<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:28.019> have<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.859> image<00:03:29.849> that's<00:03:30.180> on

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
and what we have is a image that's on

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.969 
and what we have is a image that's on
metal<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.989> looks<00:03:31.049> very<00:03:31.500> much<00:03:31.739> like<00:03:31.769> a

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
metal that looks very much like a

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:36.319 
metal that looks very much like a
tintype<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.389> you<00:03:33.479> could<00:03:33.870> use<00:03:34.109> this<00:03:34.409> in<00:03:35.329> jewelry

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
tintype so you could use this in jewelry

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.559 
tintype so you could use this in jewelry
if<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.720> wanted<00:03:37.199> and<00:03:37.760> just<00:03:38.760> about<00:03:38.940> any<00:03:39.180> kind<00:03:39.449> of

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
if you wanted and just about any kind of

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.509 
if you wanted and just about any kind of
project<00:03:40.109> and<00:03:40.229> it<00:03:40.379> makes<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.799> look<00:03:40.979> really

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
project and it makes it look really

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.509 
project and it makes it look really
interesting<00:03:42.449> being<00:03:42.659> on<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.959> metal<00:03:43.349> again<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
interesting being on the metal again you

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.559 
interesting being on the metal again you
can<00:03:44.729> also<00:03:44.940> do<00:03:45.329> this<00:03:45.540> technique<00:03:46.019> on<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.829> wood

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
can also do this technique on to wood

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.750 
can also do this technique on to wood
canvas<00:03:48.569> fabric<00:03:49.409> just<00:03:49.949> about<00:03:50.190> anything<00:03:50.549> that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
canvas fabric just about anything that

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.000 
canvas fabric just about anything that
you<00:03:51.060> can<00:03:51.239> glue<00:03:51.479> multi<00:03:51.900> medium<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.409> you<00:03:52.620> can<00:03:52.829> do

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
you can glue multi medium to you can do

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.280 
you can glue multi medium to you can do
this<00:03:53.190> transfer<00:03:53.819> too<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.479> hope<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.989> enjoyed

this transfer too so I hope you enjoyed

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.590 
this transfer too so I hope you enjoyed
this<00:03:55.500> fun<00:03:55.829> little<00:03:56.340> easy<00:03:57.109> transfer<00:03:58.109> technique
