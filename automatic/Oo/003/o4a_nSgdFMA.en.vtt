00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 I'm very this video will be a little 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.540
 serious and you for my opinion on a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.030
 issue that caused controversy these 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.460
 last days in the competitive community 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.630
 of league of legends of other sports 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.299
 electronics 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.859
 I got the statement from the journalist karin 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:25.170
 duarte on sportv.com This is alright 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.539
 because the US government recently 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.029
 started to allow foreigners who 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.189
 professional players and I see that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.320
 he enters the country with the same type of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.320
 seen in professional athletes 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.270
 foreigners under there begins to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.730
 discussion, I agree with you too 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.920
 You think you can not give these guys 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 athlete not we know that much 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.090
 soccer player also likes to play 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.010
 video game 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.070
 but I believe that watching out on 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.250
 front is considered the sport is not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.559
 a good party before she opens her mouth 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.320
 It's a channel for saying such a thing. 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.239
 this declaration becomes public and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.580
 free so that the hearing concord does not 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.070
 as the main sport of this channel 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.470
 football, then obviously it's to do 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.500
 some commentary subjugating sports 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.720
 electronics and inter using soccer and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.049
 other sports that involve a lot of 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.810
 physical effort but come on what makes 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.820
 something a sport or I will not make a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.890
 comparison between a popular sport that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.950
 is football and electronic sport that is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.799
 shorter than the first flagged league 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.619
 have fixed rules in football 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.720
 lack within the penalty area in the role you 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.700
 can not use any type of hack 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.540
 according to this practice it has to be 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.579
 subordinate an official body to fifa to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.060
 uefa cbf etc 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.070
 lol to right games third is a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 competitive activity the championship 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.090
 brazilian championship champeons 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.670
 league 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.659
 soon has the regional championships 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.140
 world championships 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.960
 4ยบ the athlete whom life with this is 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.800
 with sponsorships or with prizes from 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.560
 competitions I think I do not even need 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.870
 I do not need to give another example 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.830
 fact is that darling carina duarte 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:20.270
 quoted that sitting is not a sport 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.610
 is then illustrious journalist xadres no 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.950
 can be considered sport and the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.710
 motoring, then it can not be 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.470
 considered a sport and yet for 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.830
 athletes competing with wheelchairs 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.530
 they are not athletes are not competing for 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.740
 to be seated so it is so 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.570
 just sitting there not 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.880
 decharacterizes sports and sports 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.980
 of the physical moat is not the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.960
 main feature since there are 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.210
 many other sports that are 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.880
 benefited much more by the effort 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.640
 cognitive perception by reasoning 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.230
 and by motor coordination there yes I 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.840
 I talked about motorsport 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.270
 some people may think so 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.550
 tiredness and effort and I do not deny this 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.950
 there is a tiredness and effort 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.710
 the guys take several turns but same 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.470
 so even so knows athletes too 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.640
 they get tired, too, because in 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.330
 your championships 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.150
 they may have to play 20 hours in 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.520
 two days three days I did not say good 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.550
 everything I want but to close the video 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.670
 lady karim the tv tries too hard 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.520
 to try to use the video games of all 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.100
 the forms blaming them for being one of the 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.440
 major evils is blamed for 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.530
 any crime or murder in a 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.680
 reason again you try to attack 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.140
 video games for fear of losing each 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.420
 more and more black public because the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.190
 television is being used to 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.780
 entertainment such as non-video 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.910
 the globe exists 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.100
 we are the virtual generation the generation of 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.660
 internet, we do not have an audience for you 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.060
 we will not even give 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.120
 that's it I discovered by the tone of this video 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.580
 and it's complicated you see a stop that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 Do you like being attacked for free? 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.550
 in all possible ways then it is 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.959
 Subscribe to the channel 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.170
 Do you agree or disagree with what I 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.980
 I said short video and that's it mate
