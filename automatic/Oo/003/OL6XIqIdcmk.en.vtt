00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
became really apparent that it's

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.260 
became really apparent that it's
important<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.890> have<00:02:36.040> those<00:02:36.190> things<00:02:36.520> stored<00:02:37.060> up

to<00:02:42.850> make<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.030> delicious<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.780> learned<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.320> couple

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
to make it delicious I learned a couple

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.930 
to make it delicious I learned a couple
of<00:02:44.620> things<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:45.010> learned<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> variety<00:02:45.850> is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
of things I learned the variety is

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.360 
of things I learned the variety is
important<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:47.110> we<00:02:47.200> don't<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.280> know

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
important that we don't have to you know

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.920 
important that we don't have to you know
that<00:02:48.580> having<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.910> variety<00:02:49.240> new<00:02:49.360> food<00:02:49.600> storage

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
that having a variety new food storage

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.730 
that having a variety new food storage
is<00:02:50.110> very<00:02:50.290> critical<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.810> we<00:02:53.170> had<00:02:53.560> that

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
is very critical and and we had that

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.560 
is very critical and and we had that
this<00:02:53.920> week<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.700> was<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.850> nun<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.390> was<00:02:55.540> a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
this week and so it was a nun it was a

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.150 
this week and so it was a nun it was a
non-issue<00:02:55.960> but<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.350> felt<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:56.770> if<00:02:56.950> we<00:02:57.070> were

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
non-issue but I felt like if we were

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.500 
non-issue but I felt like if we were
reading<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.400> same<00:02:57.640> thing<00:02:57.880> over<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.180> over<00:02:58.300> and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
reading the same thing over and over and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.330 
reading the same thing over and over and
over<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:58.960> stop<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.950> would<00:03:00.100> have<00:03:00.190> gotten

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
over and not stop that would have gotten

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.740 
over and not stop that would have gotten
pretty<00:03:00.610> old<00:03:00.820> pretty<00:03:01.060> quick<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:03.420> basically<00:03:04.420> I

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
pretty old pretty quick I basically I

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.910 
pretty old pretty quick I basically I
guess<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:05.050> learned<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.410> we<00:03:05.500> could<00:03:05.710> live<00:03:05.890> off

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
guess I learned that we could live off

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.540 
guess I learned that we could live off
food<00:03:06.280> storage<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.850> we<00:03:06.940> would<00:03:07.090> be<00:03:07.120> just<00:03:07.390> fine
