elements that help you with your

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.929 
elements that help you with your
modeling<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.070> things<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.880> I'm

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
modeling and things like that so I'm

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.730 
modeling and things like that so I'm
going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.150> show<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.300> how<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.390> hide<00:00:25.019> an<00:00:25.260> object

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
going to show you how to hide an object

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.920 
going to show you how to hide an object
freeze<00:00:26.189> an<00:00:26.369> object<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.000> make<00:00:27.570> an<00:00:27.810> object

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
freeze an object and make an object

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.349 
freeze an object and make an object
see-through<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:29.010> slightly<00:00:29.580> invisible<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.300> you

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
see-through or slightly invisible so you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.600 
see-through or slightly invisible so you
can<00:00:30.570> work<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.349> find<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.250> easy<00:00:32.369> when

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
can work with it I find that easy when

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.580 
can work with it I find that easy when
you're<00:00:32.730> working<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.480> rig<00:00:33.899> than<00:00:34.350> when

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you're working with a rig than when

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
you're working with a rig than when
you're<00:00:34.710> animating<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.250> things<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.700> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you're animating and things like that so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.000 
you're animating and things like that so
red<00:00:36.690> I've<00:00:36.809> got<00:00:36.960> three<00:00:37.170> objects<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
red I've got three objects here just a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
red I've got three objects here just a
really<00:00:38.309> basic<00:00:38.460> scene<00:00:39.000> I'm<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> go

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
really basic scene I'm just going to go

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.569 
really basic scene I'm just going to go
through<00:00:40.559> some<00:00:40.770> basics<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.430> can

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
through some basics so you can

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
through some basics so you can
right-click<00:00:41.820> any<00:00:42.239> object<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.140> you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
right-click any object and you get you

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.940 
right-click any object and you get you
your<00:00:44.010> task<00:00:44.280> pane<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.680> here

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
your task pane and what you can do here

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.750 
your task pane and what you can do here
is<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.030> freeze<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:49.079> selection<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.520> when

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is you can freeze a selection so when

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
is you can freeze a selection so when
you're<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.120> about<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.480> seen<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you're going about you seen if you you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.260 
you're going about you seen if you you
know<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> don't<00:00:53.070> select<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.670> object<00:00:53.789> if

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
know you don't select an object if

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
know you don't select an object if
you've<00:00:54.390> got<00:00:54.480> many<00:00:54.690> parts<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> certain<00:00:55.770> model

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you've got many parts to a certain model

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.410 
you've got many parts to a certain model
that<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.160> making<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> don't<00:00:57.239> want<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
that you making and you don't want to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.000 
that you making and you don't want to
have<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.629> click<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.109> freeze<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
have to click it you can freeze it and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
have to click it you can freeze it and
it<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.850> always<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.210> frozen<00:01:00.620> until<00:01:01.620> otherwise

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it will always be frozen until otherwise

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.009 
it will always be frozen until otherwise
you<00:01:02.280> say<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.730> freeze<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> will

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you say on freeze all and it will

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.910 
you say on freeze all and it will
unfreeze<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.040> actual<00:01:05.400> selected<00:01:05.909> object

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
unfreeze the actual selected object

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
unfreeze the actual selected object
which<00:01:07.920> makes<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.369> easy<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.580> work<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:08.880> now

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
which makes it easy to work with now

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
which makes it easy to work with now
another<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:11.100> don't<00:01:11.310> want<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.700> in

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
another one if you don't want this in

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.210 
another one if you don't want this in
you've<00:01:12.150> seen<00:01:12.360> all<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.990> time<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:14.040> can

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you've seen all the time you can

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
you've seen all the time you can
actually<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:15.000> hide<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.540> selection<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
actually just hide that selection so in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.289 
actually just hide that selection so in
your<00:01:17.220> scene<00:01:17.430> instead<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.820> being<00:01:17.850> frozen

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
your scene instead of it being frozen

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.899 
your scene instead of it being frozen
it's<00:01:19.110> out<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> way<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.610> still

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
it's out of the way and you can still

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
it's out of the way and you can still
work<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.420> everything<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> could

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and you can click on hide all and it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
and you can click on hide all and it
will<00:01:25.590> bring<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.950> objects<00:01:26.310> back<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.060> last

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

one<00:01:27.479> I'm<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> show<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.380> how<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.400> actually

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
one I'm going to show is how to actually

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.050 
one I'm going to show is how to actually
make<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.509> object<00:01:30.720> invisible<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
make your object invisible and all you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.800 
make your object invisible and all you
need<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.810> hold<00:01:34.079> alt<00:01:34.470> +<00:01:34.890> X<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:36.299> I'll<00:01:36.479> make

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
need to do is hold alt + X and I'll make

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.620 
need to do is hold alt + X and I'll make
your<00:01:37.350> object<00:01:37.590> see-through<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:39.240> similar

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
your object see-through it looks similar

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.200 
your object see-through it looks similar
to<00:01:39.930> frozen<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.130> still<00:01:41.520> move<00:01:42.150> your

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
to frozen but you can still move your

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.969 
to frozen but you can still move your
object<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.189> makes<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:45.030> actual<00:01:45.420> mesh

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
object but it just makes the actual mesh

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.200 
object but it just makes the actual mesh
slightly<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.130> transparent<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.060> see

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
slightly more transparent so you can see

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.270 
slightly more transparent so you can see
through<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.450> doesn't<00:01:48.810> affect<00:01:49.079> rendering<00:01:49.680> but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
through it doesn't affect rendering but

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.770 
through it doesn't affect rendering but
you<00:01:50.369> press<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.700> X<00:01:50.909> again<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.450> bring<00:01:51.479> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
