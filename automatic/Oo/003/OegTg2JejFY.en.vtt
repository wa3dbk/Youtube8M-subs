00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.620
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.199
 spectators today to a round 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.090
 nonsense says yes I always say to one 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.350
 Round because I usually only a few 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.910
 player and no 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.410
 Today is a server presentation 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.220
 and this time it does not mean server 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.949
 but it's the one of six games 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.669
 or not so extreme so frieze earlier 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.770
 that means that humira point is nice 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.460
 and below is also the teamspeak in 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.460
 the tablet user 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.000
 I am still and he is on the way 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.550
 the folder of iss not ready so 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.090
 So every case or 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.949
 luciano if he is still okay what is yes 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 that there are many things here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.520
 but not all or 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 not all work yet i go 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.460
 First of all, the team comes to a close 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.210
 just move from left to right 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.600
 right and top down once ssg 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.799
 coming soon 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.799
 it is later then there are 11 and once 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:23.970
 yes, no one is in here and there he is 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.439
 gone and I show you so if you 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.479
 here is a joint once the bathroom rises 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:37.020
 another player not satisfied 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:38.280
 not read again and then you wait 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 stop here on the player but was her 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.130
 rating not so then I give here yet 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.030
 differently, there are still beginning players 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.520
 I see pedro in there already 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.770
 be ok next week and countries 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.540
 probably upon them all yet 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.000
 I do not know here probably 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.479
 come once you have it ffh here is 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.500
 probably no god I can 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.409
 only bad reading there are two must 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.920
 his six are here I enter 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.110
 Romero in there are here and that is 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.850
 a good choice like games times who is it 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.130
 also speak and cut too 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:23.640
 standard and here it is ffh and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:32.610
 so you can live to fight what I know 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:36.600
 not everything so nice, for example 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.010
 if you kill someone then 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.709
 you never get the word if you 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.280
 someone kills the points if you 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.239
 dies falls gets five points 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.239
 loses 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:28.130
 Well ok, then there is a fire here 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:28.130

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:41.110

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.959

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.780

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:58.970
