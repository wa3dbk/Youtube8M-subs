00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
in May we actually originally thought we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.969 
in May we actually originally thought we
were<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.960> having<00:01:07.080> four<00:01:07.470> pieces<00:01:07.770> of

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.600 
were going to be having four pieces of
DLC<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.689> were<00:01:09.770> loving<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> check<00:01:11.100> they

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
DLC and they were loving to check they

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.800 
DLC and they were loving to check they
were<00:01:11.960> two<00:01:12.960> maps<00:01:13.260> no<00:01:13.770> Ashley<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.460> maps<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.360> we

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
were two maps no Ashley for maps so we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.010 
were two maps no Ashley for maps so we
were<00:01:16.229> sort<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:17.299> surprised<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.720> actually

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
were sort of surprised when we actually

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.890 
were sort of surprised when we actually
got<00:01:19.259> enjoy<00:01:19.560> getting<00:01:19.680> seven<00:01:20.130> pieces<00:01:20.310> dlc<00:01:20.909> dlc<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
got enjoy getting seven pieces dlc dlc I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.420 
got enjoy getting seven pieces dlc dlc I
think<00:01:22.740> we've<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.189> missions<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:25.070> 5<00:01:26.070> maps

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
think we've got two missions and 5 maps

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.450 
think we've got two missions and 5 maps
I<00:01:26.610> think<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.630> quite<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> reasonable<00:01:28.500> reasonable

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
I think so quite a reasonable reasonable

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940 
I think so quite a reasonable reasonable
amount<00:01:29.909> plus<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.540> whole<00:01:30.689> new<00:01:30.869> game<00:01:31.079> mode<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
amount plus a whole new game mode so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
amount plus a whole new game mode so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
whoo obviously going to get something

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.690 
whoo obviously going to get something
that<00:02:33.660> obviously<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.740> change<00:02:35.950> but<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
that obviously it can change but for the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.250 
that obviously it can change but for the
map<00:02:36.850> i<00:02:37.000> sort<00:02:37.240> of<00:02:37.270> want<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.480> see<00:02:37.600> high-rise<00:02:38.050> or

terminal<00:02:38.650> back<00:02:38.800> just<00:02:39.550> my<00:02:39.700> personal<00:02:40.090> opinion

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
terminal back just my personal opinion

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.260 
terminal back just my personal opinion
because<00:02:40.660> they<00:02:41.440> those<00:02:41.830> maps<00:02:42.220> were<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:42.910> people

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
because they those maps were what people

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.300 
because they those maps were what people
wanted<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.690> see<00:02:43.959> what<00:02:44.260> wanted<00:02:44.590> people<00:02:45.100> wanted

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
wanted to see what wanted people wanted

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.160 
wanted to see what wanted people wanted
to<00:02:45.340> play<00:02:45.610> they're<00:02:46.180> absolutely<00:02:46.540> awesome<00:02:46.780> for

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
to play they're absolutely awesome for

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.570 
to play they're absolutely awesome for
sniper<00:02:47.440> clips<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:47.950> everything<00:02:48.280> else<00:02:48.430> like

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
sniper clips and everything else like

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.120 
sniper clips and everything else like
that<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.970> was<00:02:49.060> really<00:02:49.300> fun<00:02:49.890> now<00:02:50.890> for<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
that it was really fun now for the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.890 
that it was really fun now for the
mission<00:02:51.280> obviously<00:02:51.850> it's<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:52.690> gonna<00:02:52.780> be<00:02:52.840> a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
mission obviously it's just gonna be a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.570 
mission obviously it's just gonna be a
special<00:02:53.290> exhibition<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.800> I'm<00:02:54.010> guessing<00:02:54.430> I

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
special exhibition and I'm guessing I

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.120 
special exhibition and I'm guessing I
currently<00:02:55.030> see<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.360> variation<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.470> mission

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
currently see a variation of a mission

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.530 
currently see a variation of a mission
it's<00:02:57.400> pretty<00:02:57.970> much<00:02:58.060> just<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.450> be<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
it's pretty much just going to be a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.660 
it's pretty much just going to be a
specialist<00:02:58.900> mission<00:02:59.340> and<00:03:00.340> obviously<00:03:00.580> for

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
specialist mission and obviously for

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.190 
specialist mission and obviously for
classified<00:03:01.209> classified<00:03:01.450> could<00:03:02.019> mean

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
classified classified could mean

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.460 
classified classified could mean
anything<00:03:02.590> classified<00:03:03.280> could<00:03:03.550> mean<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:04.510> new<00:03:05.140> gun

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
anything classified could mean a new gun

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.100 
anything classified could mean a new gun
so<00:03:06.010> maybe<00:03:06.430> you've<00:03:06.670> seen<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.060> scar-h<00:03:07.600> back

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110

don't<00:03:43.209> actually<00:03:43.480> think<00:03:43.630> it's<00:03:43.870> going<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.049> work

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
it's pretty pretty much impossible in my

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.080 
it's pretty pretty much impossible in my
opinion<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.110> make<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.799> work<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.459> just<00:03:48.940> got

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
opinion to make that work I just got

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.819 
opinion to make that work I just got
quite<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.690> nice<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:50.019> for<00:03:50.230> them<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.590> watch<00:03:50.709> this

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
going to be hard obviously that's the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.910 
going to be hard obviously that's the
