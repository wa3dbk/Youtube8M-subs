00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.610 

but<00:02:58.120> that's<00:02:58.300> kind<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.630> hard<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.900> move<00:02:59.200> up<00:02:59.349> so<00:02:59.590> I

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
but that's kind of hard to move up so I

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.250 
but that's kind of hard to move up so I
just<00:03:00.010> play<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:01.380> doesn't<00:03:02.380> sound<00:03:03.780> really<00:03:04.780> much

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
just play it doesn't sound really much

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:22.949 
just play it doesn't sound really much
of<00:03:05.290> much<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:06.010> difference<00:03:21.720> that's<00:03:22.720> why<00:03:22.900> it

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
of much of a difference that's why it

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:42.530 
of much of a difference that's why it
sounded<00:03:23.260> wrong

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:04:04.809 

and<00:03:43.540> then<00:03:43.660> you<00:03:43.780> just<00:03:43.930> go<00:03:44.290> down

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819
