over<00:00:36.960> time<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> make<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
over time and you have to make a

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.250 
over time and you have to make a
long-term<00:00:40.620> provisional<00:00:41.610> temporary<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> so

long-term provisional temporary and so

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.850 
long-term provisional temporary and so
we<00:00:43.500> decided<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> case

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
we decided to do that in this case

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
align the the implants in a proper

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.080 
align the the implants in a proper
position<00:01:21.590> especially<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.040> vent<00:01:23.549> holes<00:01:23.759> for

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
position especially the vent holes for

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.420 
position especially the vent holes for
the<00:01:24.210> screws<00:01:24.360> themselves<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.409> what<00:01:26.130> I've<00:01:26.250> done

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the screws themselves so what I've done

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.230 
the screws themselves so what I've done
is<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.700> taken<00:01:26.939> some<00:01:27.450> ion<00:01:27.780> crowns<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.240> placed

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
is just taken some ion crowns and placed

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.069 
is just taken some ion crowns and placed
them<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.780> position<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:33.960> what

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
them in position and so and then what

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.130 
them in position and so and then what
we'll<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> duplicate<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.570> this<00:01:36.570> model

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
we'll do is duplicate this this model

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.249 
we'll do is duplicate this this model
has<00:01:37.350> been<00:01:37.590> mounted<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.340> upper<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.259> so

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
has been mounted to an upper and so

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.950 
has been mounted to an upper and so
we're<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.530> duplicate<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.700> model

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
we're going to duplicate this this model

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.270 
we're going to duplicate this this model
it's<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.229> bit<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.500> cross<00:01:43.770> bite<00:01:44.070> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
it's a little bit of a cross bite in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.130 
it's a little bit of a cross bite in
this<00:01:44.460> case<00:01:45.020> as<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.439> toward<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.119> posterior

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
this case as we go toward the posterior

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.899 
this case as we go toward the posterior
so<00:01:49.140> let<00:01:49.380> me<00:01:49.470> set<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.860> aside<00:01:50.070> remember<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so let me set this aside remember this

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.999 
so let me set this aside remember this
will<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.149> duplicated<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> back<00:01:52.350> place<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
will be duplicated on the back place to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.399 
will be duplicated on the back place to
maybe<00:01:53.159> some<00:01:53.430> chimney<00:01:53.759> holes<00:01:53.939> placed<00:01:54.899> above<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
maybe some chimney holes placed above it

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.940 
maybe some chimney holes placed above it
for<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> laboratory<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.750> start<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.649> kind

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
for the laboratory to to start the kind

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.429 
for the laboratory to to start the kind
of<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.740> make<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.659> temporary<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:04.079> temporary

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
of to make the temporary this temporary

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.109 
of to make the temporary this temporary
is<00:02:04.500> going<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.740> made<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.159> material<00:02:05.700> called

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
is going to be made of a material called

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.249 
is going to be made of a material called
radical<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> composite<00:02:08.729> material<00:02:09.259> this

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
radical it is a composite material this

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.770 
radical it is a composite material this
lab<00:02:10.560> specializes<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
lab specializes in that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.960 
lab specializes in that
so<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.080> ordered<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> parts<00:02:15.280> these<00:02:15.760> are<00:02:15.819> bridge

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
so I ordered the parts these are bridge

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.910 
so I ordered the parts these are bridge
temporary<00:02:18.970> abutments<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.780> when<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.709> receive

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
temporary abutments and when you receive

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.250 
temporary abutments and when you receive
your<00:02:21.190> temporary<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:22.060> nuts<00:02:22.300> they<00:02:22.900> come<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.170> a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
your temporary but nuts they come in a

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.980 
your temporary but nuts they come in a
container<00:02:23.650> like<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:25.630> one<00:02:25.810> happens

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
container like this and this one happens

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.990 
container like this and this one happens
to<00:02:26.140> be<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.410> RSC<00:02:26.980> for<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> bone<00:02:27.580> level

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
to be the RSC for the bone level

post that's for a bridge as well and so

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.320 
post that's for a bridge as well and so
when<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.739> open<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:45.370> container<00:02:48.060> you'll<00:02:49.060> get

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
when you open the container you'll get

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.050 
when you open the container you'll get
the<00:02:49.900> individual<00:02:50.470> parts<00:02:50.980> now<00:02:51.250> I'm<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:51.519> put<00:02:51.970> an

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
the individual parts now I'm just put an

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.390 
the individual parts now I'm just put an
analog<00:02:52.450> on<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.870> begin<00:02:53.290> with<00:02:53.440> but<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:54.340> is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
analog on that begin with but this is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.640 
analog on that begin with but this is
the<00:02:54.610> part<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.940> get<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> basal<00:02:55.660> screw<00:02:56.050> here

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the part you get a basal screw here

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.580 
the part you get a basal screw here
here's<00:02:57.220> your<00:02:57.310> part<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.850> then<00:02:58.060> very<00:02:59.050> similar

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
here's your part and then very similar

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.960 
here's your part and then very similar
to<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.190> gold<00:03:00.820> waxing<00:03:01.750> coping<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.760> lab

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
to the gold waxing coping that the lab

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.790 
to the gold waxing coping that the lab
will<00:03:04.150> use<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.540> make<00:03:04.720> their<00:03:04.900> custom<00:03:05.320> abutments

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
will use to make their custom abutments

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.940 
will use to make their custom abutments
you'll<00:03:05.950> get<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.370> very<00:03:06.700> very<00:03:06.820> large<00:03:07.239> flared

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.240 

metal<00:03:11.950> skirt<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:13.570> what<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.500> found<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.130> what

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
metal skirt that what I found and what

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.800 
metal skirt that what I found and what
my<00:03:15.340> lab<00:03:15.519> has<00:03:15.730> found<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.239> gets<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.660> way

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
my lab has found is it gets in the way

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.750 
my lab has found is it gets in the way
and<00:03:17.079> you<00:03:17.380> have<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.739> trim<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.010> away<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.370> how<00:03:18.700> do

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
and you have to trim it away so how do

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.410 
and you have to trim it away so how do
you<00:03:18.880> do<00:03:19.030> that

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
you do that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.990 
you do that
well<00:03:20.350> let<00:03:20.860> me<00:03:20.890> show<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.160> first<00:03:21.459> how<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.880> gets

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
well let me show you first how it gets

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.190 
well let me show you first how it gets
in<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.299> way<00:03:22.420> then<00:03:22.630> I'll<00:03:22.750> show<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:22.959> how<00:03:23.049> we

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
in the way then I'll show you how we

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.479 
in the way then I'll show you how we
trim<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.590> away<00:03:23.799> all<00:03:24.130> right

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
trim it away all right

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.110 
trim it away all right
so<00:03:25.239> if<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.630> go<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.870> seat<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.940> here<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.060> I

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
so if I go to seat this and here and I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.690 
so if I go to seat this and here and I
start<00:03:28.450> tightening<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.170> down<00:03:29.519> okay<00:03:30.519> what

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
start tightening it down okay what

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.080 
start tightening it down okay what
happens<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.299> it's<00:03:31.540> not<00:03:31.690> seating<00:03:32.200> all<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.470> way

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
happens is it's not seating all the way

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.600 
happens is it's not seating all the way
when<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.209> took<00:03:34.420> our<00:03:34.630> impression<00:03:35.519> earlier<00:03:36.519> I

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
when we took our impression earlier I

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.699 
when we took our impression earlier I
showed<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:38.769> made<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:38.980> nice<00:03:40.709> v-shape

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
showed you that we made a nice v-shape

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.229 
showed you that we made a nice v-shape
funnel<00:03:42.660> impression<00:03:43.739> copied<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.890> right<00:03:45.850> off<00:03:46.030> of

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
funnel impression copied it right off of

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.160 
funnel impression copied it right off of
the<00:03:46.390> peak<00:03:47.110> abutments<00:03:47.650> but<00:03:48.299> unfortunately<00:03:49.299> now

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
the peak abutments but unfortunately now

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.140 
the peak abutments but unfortunately now
we<00:03:50.200> were<00:03:50.560> at<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.739> standstill<00:03:51.100> we<00:03:51.549> can't<00:03:51.880> build

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
we were at a standstill we can't build

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.210 
we were at a standstill we can't build
to<00:03:52.450> this<00:03:52.630> until<00:03:53.560> we<00:03:53.739> treat<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:55.360> metal<00:03:55.720> of<00:03:56.220> this

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
to this until we treat the metal of this

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.449 
to this until we treat the metal of this
temporary<00:03:57.790> buttman<00:03:58.150> labs<00:03:59.079> also<00:03:59.440> we'll<00:04:00.130> treat

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
temporary buttman labs also we'll treat

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.850 
temporary buttman labs also we'll treat
the<00:04:00.670> same<00:04:01.200> skirt<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.700> gold<00:04:04.560> cast<00:04:05.560> to

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
the same skirt of the gold cast to

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.090 
the same skirt of the gold cast to
copings<00:04:06.489> why<00:04:06.880> because<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.780> don't<00:04:08.560> know<00:04:08.680> why<00:04:08.859> the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
copings why because I don't know why the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.069 
copings why because I don't know why the
company<00:04:09.549> just<00:04:09.730> makes<00:04:10.030> them<00:04:10.269> very<00:04:10.510> very<00:04:10.810> wide

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
company just makes them very very wide

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.090 
company just makes them very very wide
and<00:04:11.320> I<00:04:11.380> think<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:12.160> think<00:04:13.090> it's<00:04:13.420> unnecessary<00:04:14.100> so

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
and I think I think it's unnecessary so

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.370 
and I think I think it's unnecessary so
what<00:04:15.310> we<00:04:15.430> do<00:04:15.579> is<00:04:15.760> we<00:04:15.940> tighten<00:04:16.180> down<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.900> analog

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
what we do is we tighten down the analog

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.620 
what we do is we tighten down the analog
first<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.250> then<00:04:18.880> I'll<00:04:19.239> scribe<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.959> line<00:04:20.340> with<00:04:21.340> a

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
first and then I'll scribe a line with a

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.940 
first and then I'll scribe a line with a
scalpel<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:23.160> this<00:04:24.160> case<00:04:24.400> it's<00:04:24.640> just<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.940> red<00:04:25.150> red

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
scalpel in this case it's just a red red

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.610 
scalpel in this case it's just a red red
life<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.940> describe<00:04:27.540> a<00:04:27.660> scalpel<00:04:28.170> so<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:28.500> it

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
life and describe a scalpel so that it

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.000 
life and describe a scalpel so that it
goes<00:04:28.710> all<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.040> way<00:04:29.190> through<00:04:30.260> this<00:04:31.260> area<00:04:34.010> let's

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
goes all the way through this area let's

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.050 
goes all the way through this area let's
see<00:04:35.160> if<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.340> get<00:04:35.400> an<00:04:35.670> explorer<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.420> do<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:38.060> all

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
see if I get an explorer to do that all

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.440 
see if I get an explorer to do that all
right<00:04:39.950> yeah<00:04:40.950> just<00:04:41.280> take<00:04:41.490> your<00:04:41.670> scalpel<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.360> a

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
right yeah just take your scalpel and a

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.320 
right yeah just take your scalpel and a
brand<00:04:42.780> new<00:04:42.900> 15<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.710> just<00:04:44.430> draw<00:04:44.940> your<00:04:45.150> line

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
brand new 15 and just draw your line

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.390 
brand new 15 and just draw your line
first<00:04:45.720> okay<00:04:46.200> then<00:04:46.440> after<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:46.800> draw<00:04:47.010> your<00:04:47.160> line

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
first okay then after you draw your line

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.890 
first okay then after you draw your line
now<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.120> can<00:04:48.390> trim<00:04:48.690> away<00:04:48.870> all<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.640> this

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
now you can trim away all this this

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.700 
now you can trim away all this this
unwanted<00:04:51.980> metal<00:04:52.980> okay<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.450> what<00:04:55.170> I<00:04:55.200> use<00:04:55.500> is

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
unwanted metal okay and what I use is

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.180 
unwanted metal okay and what I use is
basically<00:04:55.950> a<00:04:56.310> heatless<00:04:56.790> stone<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.980> I<00:04:58.980> use

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
basically a heatless stone and I use

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.000 
basically a heatless stone and I use
magnification<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:00.930> just<00:05:01.170> I<00:05:01.560> trim

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
magnification and it and I just I trim

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.170 
magnification and it and I just I trim
it<00:05:02.040> but<00:05:02.640> scribe<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.090> line<00:05:03.270> first<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:04.160> then

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
it but scribe the line first and then

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.580 
it but scribe the line first and then
take<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.390> screw<00:05:06.690> away<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.170> everything<00:05:07.470> away

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
take the screw away and everything away

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.930 
take the screw away and everything away
from<00:05:07.890> your<00:05:08.070> hand<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.460> then<00:05:08.580> just<00:05:08.760> go<00:05:08.910> ahead

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
from your hand and then just go ahead

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.460 
from your hand and then just go ahead
and<00:05:09.300> trim<00:05:09.540> it<00:05:09.600> now<00:05:09.900> I'll<00:05:09.990> show<00:05:10.200> you<00:05:10.230> what<00:05:10.320> that

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
and trim it now I'll show you what that

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.740 
and trim it now I'll show you what that
looks<00:05:10.890> like<00:05:13.460> I've<00:05:14.460> done<00:05:14.760> it<00:05:14.970> but<00:05:15.120> I<00:05:15.180> didn't<00:05:15.570> do

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
looks like I've done it but I didn't do

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.600 
looks like I've done it but I didn't do
it<00:05:15.870> with<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.290> analog<00:05:16.650> in<00:05:16.860> my<00:05:16.980> hand<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:17.340> did<00:05:17.520> it

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
it with the analog in my hand I did it

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.850 
it with the analog in my hand I did it
just<00:05:17.850> freehand<00:05:18.530> so<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:20.460> be<00:05:20.610> more<00:05:20.850> precise<00:05:21.860> take

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
just freehand so to be more precise take

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.170 
just freehand so to be more precise take
the<00:05:23.040> analog<00:05:23.490> put<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.360> in<00:05:24.450> place<00:05:25.250> okay<00:05:26.250> here<00:05:27.000> is

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
the analog put it in place okay here is

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.330 
the analog put it in place okay here is
the<00:05:28.020> difference<00:05:28.470> between<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:29.190> two<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:31.340> hope

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
the difference between the two I hope

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.030 
the difference between the two I hope
you<00:05:32.550> can<00:05:32.730> see<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:33.260> so<00:05:34.260> you<00:05:34.380> can<00:05:34.530> see<00:05:34.680> how<00:05:34.860> much

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
you can see that so you can see how much

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.120 
you can see that so you can see how much
you<00:05:35.220> have<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.400> trim<00:05:35.760> away<00:05:36.470> okay<00:05:37.470> so<00:05:37.770> it's<00:05:37.920> it's

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
you have to trim away okay so it's it's

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.000 
you have to trim away okay so it's it's
just<00:05:38.760> about<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.270> that<00:05:39.420> line<00:05:39.720> if<00:05:40.470> we<00:05:40.590> put<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:40.890> on

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
just about to that line if we put it on

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.670 
just about to that line if we put it on
the<00:05:41.160> analog<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:42.080> think<00:05:43.080> I'm<00:05:43.140> going<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.350> be<00:05:43.440> just

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
the analog I think I'm going to be just

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.730 
the analog I think I'm going to be just
a<00:05:43.770> little<00:05:43.800> bit<00:05:44.100> underneath<00:05:45.320> yeah<00:05:46.320> just<00:05:46.620> a

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
a little bit underneath yeah just a

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.000 
a little bit underneath yeah just a
little<00:05:46.950> bit<00:05:47.100> I<00:05:48.140> would<00:05:49.140> go<00:05:49.350> to<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.770> line

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
little bit I would go to the line

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.880 
little bit I would go to the line
because<00:05:50.540> when<00:05:51.540> they<00:05:51.660> go<00:05:51.810> to<00:05:51.840> process<00:05:52.530> your

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
because when they go to process your

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.020 
because when they go to process your
case<00:05:53.300> with<00:05:54.300> either<00:05:54.810> composite<00:05:55.530> or<00:05:55.620> acrylic<00:05:56.070> it

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
case with either composite or acrylic it

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.520 
case with either composite or acrylic it
won't<00:05:57.270> seep<00:05:57.570> down<00:05:57.810> into<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:59.870> the<00:06:00.870> lab<00:06:01.080> analog

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
won't seep down into the the lab analog

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.160 
won't seep down into the the lab analog
and<00:06:01.800> and<00:06:02.130> also<00:06:02.430> won't<00:06:02.670> seep<00:06:02.970> down<00:06:03.150> into<00:06:03.210> the<00:06:03.720> to

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
and and also won't seep down into the to

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.770 
and and also won't seep down into the to
the<00:06:04.260> mouth<00:06:04.460> you<00:06:05.460> know<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.640> the<00:06:05.880> Enel<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.660> the

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
the mouth you know to the Enel to the

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.540 
the mouth you know to the Enel to the
implant<00:06:07.140> in<00:06:07.290> the<00:06:07.350> mouth<00:06:07.500> all<00:06:07.830> right<00:06:07.980> so<00:06:08.520> a

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
implant in the mouth all right so a

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.070 
implant in the mouth all right so a
little<00:06:08.610> common<00:06:09.120> sense<00:06:09.150> here<00:06:09.570> I'm<00:06:09.690> learning<00:06:09.840> as

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
little common sense here I'm learning as

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.430 
little common sense here I'm learning as
I<00:06:10.110> go<00:06:10.320> along<00:06:10.410> with<00:06:10.800> this<00:06:11.810> these<00:06:12.810> ideas<00:06:13.230> but

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
I go along with this these ideas but

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.180 
I go along with this these ideas but
straumann<00:06:13.920> really<00:06:14.250> needs<00:06:14.520> to<00:06:14.660> to<00:06:15.890> study<00:06:16.890> their

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
straumann really needs to to study their

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.110 
straumann really needs to to study their
format<00:06:17.730> better<00:06:19.190> other<00:06:20.190> companies<00:06:20.730> you<00:06:20.880> can<00:06:21.030> do

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
format better other companies you can do

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.400 
format better other companies you can do
the<00:06:21.240> same<00:06:21.420> thing<00:06:21.750> you<00:06:21.930> know<00:06:22.050> you<00:06:22.110> take<00:06:22.350> the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
the same thing you know you take the

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.930 
the same thing you know you take the
analog<00:06:22.860> in<00:06:23.010> your<00:06:23.130> hand<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:23.550> if<00:06:23.640> you<00:06:23.730> have<00:06:23.820> to

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
analog in your hand and if you have to

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.940 
analog in your hand and if you have to
work<00:06:24.120> it<00:06:24.270> out<00:06:24.360> fine<00:06:26.690> this<00:06:27.690> is<00:06:27.870> for<00:06:28.080> a<00:06:28.110> bridge<00:06:28.380> if

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
work it out fine this is for a bridge if

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.560 
work it out fine this is for a bridge if
it<00:06:29.160> were<00:06:29.280> for<00:06:29.520> a<00:06:29.580> single<00:06:29.880> crown<00:06:30.180> you're<00:06:30.450> going

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
it were for a single crown you're going

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.050 
it were for a single crown you're going
to<00:06:30.630> make<00:06:30.720> a<00:06:30.750> temporary<00:06:31.670> there<00:06:32.670> would<00:06:32.760> be<00:06:32.790> some

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
to make a temporary there would be some

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.200 
to make a temporary there would be some
anti<00:06:33.390> rotational<00:06:34.080> seating<00:06:34.530> in<00:06:34.710> here<00:06:34.740> okay<00:06:35.730> but

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
anti rotational seating in here okay but

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.880 
anti rotational seating in here okay but
it<00:06:36.330> still<00:06:36.570> sits<00:06:37.110> pretty<00:06:37.290> well<00:06:37.530> and<00:06:37.680> by<00:06:37.770> the

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
it still sits pretty well and by the

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.260 
it still sits pretty well and by the
time<00:06:38.040> you<00:06:38.160> place<00:06:38.400> your<00:06:38.550> Basel<00:06:38.940> school<00:06:39.150> in

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
time you place your Basel school in

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.830 
time you place your Basel school in
there

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
there

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.280 
there
it<00:06:40.380> should<00:06:40.620> line<00:06:40.830> up<00:06:40.880> nicely<00:06:42.139> okay

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
it should line up nicely okay

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.980 
it should line up nicely okay
so<00:06:43.440> I<00:06:43.470> hope<00:06:43.770> this<00:06:44.070> helps<00:06:44.520> both<00:06:45.180> dentist<00:06:45.720> and

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
so I hope this helps both dentist and

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.860 
so I hope this helps both dentist and
laboratory<00:06:46.410> technicians<00:06:47.180> with<00:06:48.180> their<00:06:48.389> cases

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
laboratory technicians with their cases

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.980 
laboratory technicians with their cases
and<00:06:51.350> you<00:06:52.350> know<00:06:52.470> it's<00:06:52.710> it's<00:06:53.010> fun<00:06:53.310> when<00:06:54.300> you<00:06:54.510> when

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
and you know it's it's fun when you when

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.530 
and you know it's it's fun when you when
you<00:06:55.110> can<00:06:55.290> see<00:06:55.500> things<00:06:55.710> better<00:06:56.180> certainly<00:06:57.180> it's

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
you can see things better certainly it's

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.780 
you can see things better certainly it's
a<00:06:57.660> lot<00:06:57.810> more<00:06:57.990> fun<00:06:58.260> when<00:06:58.530> it's<00:06:58.889> predictable<00:06:59.460> in

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
a lot more fun when it's predictable in
