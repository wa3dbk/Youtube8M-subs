would and would hopefully guess flying

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.090 
would and would hopefully guess flying
around<00:02:30.120> there<00:02:30.360> it's<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.230> library<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> band

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
around there it's the library the band

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.920 
around there it's the library the band
for<00:02:32.220> library<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> key<00:02:32.910> there's<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.750> key

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
for library is the key there's a key

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.620 
for library is the key there's a key
area<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.500> needs<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.450> needs<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.540> be

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
area that needs to be needs to be

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.180 
area that needs to be needs to be
protected<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.350> pigeons<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.920> top<00:02:38.130> of

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
protected because the pigeons on top of

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.910 
protected because the pigeons on top of
the<00:02:38.280> roof<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:38.970> him<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.720> not<00:02:40.230> actually<00:02:40.560> not

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the roof so at him just not actually not

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.710 
the roof so at him just not actually not
actually<00:02:41.220> haunting<00:02:41.580> them<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:41.850> if<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.330> do<00:02:42.390> fly

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
actually haunting them but if I do fly

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.479 
actually haunting them but if I do fly
him<00:02:42.840> around<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.290> area<00:02:43.590> he<00:02:44.100> acts<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
him around the area he acts as a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.130 
him around the area he acts as a
deterrent<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.239> then<00:02:45.390> hopefully<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:46.019> that

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
deterrent so then hopefully if I do that

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.229 
deterrent so then hopefully if I do that
every<00:02:46.200> second<00:02:46.739> or<00:02:46.769> third<00:02:46.980> day<00:02:47.030> pigeons<00:02:48.030> think

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
every second or third day pigeons think

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.699 
every second or third day pigeons think
there's<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.720> hawk<00:02:48.900> hang<00:02:49.110> around<00:02:49.230> here<00:02:49.470> I'm<00:02:49.590> not

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
there's a hawk hang around here I'm not

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.199 
there's a hawk hang around here I'm not
going<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> come<00:02:50.040> here<00:02:50.130> anymore<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.670> that's

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
going to come here anymore so that's

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.880 
going to come here anymore so that's
hopefully<00:02:51.780> what<00:02:51.810> that's<00:02:52.170> going<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.380> happen<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
hopefully what that's going to happen so

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.560 
hopefully what that's going to happen so
I<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.730> get<00:02:53.850> stuck<00:02:54.060> into<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
I have to get stuck into that in the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:03.020 
I have to get stuck into that in the
next<00:02:54.690> few<00:02:55.170> weeks

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.090
