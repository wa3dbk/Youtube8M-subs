I<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.020> showed<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:23.850> makes<00:01:24.000> quick<00:01:24.299> work<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
I just showed you it makes quick work a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.620 
I just showed you it makes quick work a
Mustang<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.490> now<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.580> got<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> big<00:01:27.119> axle<00:01:27.450> nut

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
Mustang and now we got a big axle nut

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.319 
Mustang and now we got a big axle nut
here<00:01:28.009> left<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.280> takes<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> big<00:01:29.850> socket

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
here left and this takes a big socket

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.819 
here left and this takes a big socket
not<00:01:30.750> quite<00:01:30.960> sure<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.350> has<00:01:31.470> got<00:01:31.619> enough

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
not quite sure this has got enough

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
not quite sure this has got enough
torque<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:32.939> six<00:01:33.210> hundred

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
torque it's about six hundred

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.510 
torque it's about six hundred
foot-pounds<00:01:34.140> reverse<00:01:34.860> torque<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:37.520> so

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
foot-pounds reverse torque on this so

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.030 
foot-pounds reverse torque on this so
this<00:01:38.700> could<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:38.909> rusted<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:40.040> let's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
this could be rusted on there let's

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.149 
this could be rusted on there let's
really<00:01:41.220> get<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> big<00:01:41.579> guy<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.759> oh<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.950> is

three quarter inch drive and it should

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.609 
three quarter inch drive and it should
make<00:01:48.119> short<00:01:48.600> work<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:51.200> that's<00:01:52.200> quite

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
make short work of that that's quite

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.679 
make short work of that that's quite
large<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.850> might<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.090> able<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.570> of

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
large you might be able to get one of

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.270 
large you might be able to get one of
these<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:55.350> use<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.590> very<00:01:55.799> often<00:01:56.040> you

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.029 

well<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.690> sure<00:02:09.899> beats<00:02:10.170> hanging<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.860> this

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
well that sure beats hanging on this

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.010 
well that sure beats hanging on this
thing<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> breaker<00:02:11.910> bar<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> half<00:02:12.810> hour

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
thing with a breaker bar for a half hour

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
thing with a breaker bar for a half hour
now<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:14.550> gone

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
now it's gone

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.309 
now it's gone
so<00:02:17.040> that's<00:02:17.310> how<00:02:17.489> we're<00:02:17.640> getting<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.000> bar<00:02:18.319> and

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
so that's how we're getting this bar and

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
so that's how we're getting this bar and
I'll<00:02:19.440> work<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.800> tie<00:02:20.040> rod<00:02:20.330> push<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> axle<00:02:21.810> out

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
I'll work on a tie rod push the axle out

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.380 
I'll work on a tie rod push the axle out
and<00:02:22.319> I'll<00:02:23.280> free<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:26.090> ball<00:02:27.090> joint

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
and I'll free up the the the ball joint

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.920 
and I'll free up the the the ball joint
so<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.810> find<00:02:28.230> out<00:02:28.380> how<00:02:28.500> bad<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.860> is
