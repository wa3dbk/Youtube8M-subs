helicopters<00:02:04.680> which<00:02:05.340> patrol<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.329> map<00:02:06.600> which

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
helicopters which patrol the map which

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.150 
helicopters which patrol the map which
is<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.409> straight

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
is going to be straight

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.590 
is going to be straight
many<00:02:09.160> helicopters<00:02:09.640> which<00:02:10.120> patrol<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> map

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
many helicopters which patrol the map

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.750 
many helicopters which patrol the map
i'm<00:02:10.810> gonna<00:02:10.990> see<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.740> gonna<00:02:12.190> be<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:12.550> pretty

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
i'm gonna see this is gonna be a pretty

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.490 
i'm gonna see this is gonna be a pretty
good<00:02:12.910> killstreak<00:02:13.300> VI<00:02:13.480> get<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> few<00:02:13.870> helicopters

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
good killstreak VI get a few helicopters

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.140 
good killstreak VI get a few helicopters
i<00:02:14.590> guess<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:14.950> patrol<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.250> map<00:02:15.490> maybe

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
i guess that patrol the map maybe

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.120 
i guess that patrol the map maybe
they'll<00:02:16.390> be<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.960> UAV<00:02:17.350> maybe<00:02:17.890> they'll

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
they'll be like a UAV maybe they'll

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.860 
they'll be like a UAV maybe they'll
shoot<00:02:18.460> things<00:02:18.700> down<00:02:18.880> we're<00:02:19.180> not<00:02:19.300> too<00:02:19.450> sure<00:02:19.480> yet

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
shoot things down we're not too sure yet

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.660 
shoot things down we're not too sure yet
but<00:02:20.590> I'm<00:02:21.070> pretty<00:02:21.220> sure<00:02:21.400> these<00:02:21.520> the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
but I'm pretty sure these the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.400 
but I'm pretty sure these the
killstreaks<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.930> what<00:02:23.170> i'm<00:02:23.260> reading

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
killstreaks this is what i'm reading

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.990 
killstreaks this is what i'm reading
from<00:02:23.560> website<00:02:24.040> which<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.340> guessing<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.700> true

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
from website which I'm guessing is true

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.750 
from website which I'm guessing is true
so<00:02:25.810> yeah<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.680> next<00:02:26.710> kill<00:02:27.070> streak<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.460> little

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
so yeah the next kill streak is a little

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.460 
so yeah the next kill streak is a little
bird<00:02:27.910> guard<00:02:28.270> which<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.750> big<00:02:28.930> helicopter

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
bird guard which is a big helicopter

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.860 
bird guard which is a big helicopter
that<00:02:29.590> follows<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.980> from<00:02:30.610> above<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.270> protects

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
that follows you from above and protects

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.530 
that follows you from above and protects
you<00:02:32.080> which<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.770> going<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.950> be<00:02:33.010> pretty<00:02:33.190> cool<00:02:33.540> and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
you which is going to be pretty cool and

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.090 
you which is going to be pretty cool and
helicopter<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> floats<00:02:35.470> around<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.950> and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
helicopter the floats around you and

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.400 
helicopter the floats around you and
protects<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.610> shoots<00:02:36.970> off<00:02:37.120> enemies<00:02:37.450> when

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
protects you shoots off enemies when

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.660 
protects you shoots off enemies when
you're<00:02:38.530> trying<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.740> run<00:02:38.860> around<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.370> guess<00:02:39.520> it's

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
you're trying to run around I guess it's

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.620 
you're trying to run around I guess it's
going<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.880> allow<00:02:39.940> for<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.240> little<00:02:40.360> bit<00:02:40.480> more

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
going to allow for a little bit more

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.030 
going to allow for a little bit more
offensive<00:02:41.080> play<00:02:41.260> maybe<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.680> little<00:02:41.770> bit<00:02:41.950> more

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
offensive play maybe a little bit more

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.460 
offensive play maybe a little bit more
objective<00:02:42.490> play<00:02:42.700> which<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.000> nice<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.440> I

five predator missiles are fall from the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.330 
five predator missiles are fall from the
ground<00:03:03.850> which<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.090> going<00:03:04.240> to<00:03:04.300> be<00:03:04.390> pretty<00:03:04.690> sweet

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
kill streak in one or two but now the 12

kill<00:03:37.030> streak<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.390> black<00:03:37.510> ops<00:03:37.720> 15<00:03:38.709> kills<00:03:39.120> from

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
kill streak and black ops 15 kills from

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.729 
kill streak and black ops 15 kills from
spec<00:03:40.450> ops<00:03:40.660> there<00:03:40.930> was<00:03:41.020> a<00:03:41.050> 14<00:03:41.380> killstreak

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
spec ops there was a 14 killstreak

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.260 
spec ops there was a 14 killstreak
because<00:03:41.980> he<00:03:42.040> was<00:03:42.160> using<00:03:42.310> hardline<00:03:42.790> apparently

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
because he was using hardline apparently

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.840 
because he was using hardline apparently
so<00:03:43.830> 15<00:03:44.830> kills<00:03:44.980> we<00:03:45.040> have<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.190> juggernaut<00:03:45.550> suit

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
so 15 kills we have a juggernaut suit

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.510 
so 15 kills we have a juggernaut suit

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
and guessing you're going to be able to

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.210 
and guessing you're going to be able to
call<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.570> down<00:03:49.780> from<00:03:50.020> a<00:03:50.140> care<00:03:50.380> package<00:03:50.560> or<00:03:50.980> you

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
call it down from a care package or you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.890 
call it down from a care package or you

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.960 
automatically get 15 kills and you just
wear<00:03:53.230> juggernaut<00:03:53.709> as<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.100> perk<00:03:54.400> which<00:03:54.700> is<00:03:54.850> going

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
wear juggernaut as a perk which is going

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.729 
wear juggernaut as a perk which is going
to<00:03:55.030> be<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.360> don't<00:03:56.170> think<00:03:56.290> that's<00:03:56.350> gonna<00:03:56.470> be<00:03:56.620> that

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
to be I don't think that's gonna be that

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.440 
to be I don't think that's gonna be that
frustrating<00:03:57.250> because<00:03:57.400> 15<00:03:57.880> kills<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.239> going<00:03:58.390> to

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
frustrating because 15 kills is going to

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.370 
frustrating because 15 kills is going to
be<00:03:58.540> pretty<00:03:58.630> hard<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.900> get<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.170> road

kill<00:04:02.200> streaks<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.560> stack<00:04:02.860> so<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.190> might<00:04:03.310> be<00:04:03.340> not

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
kill streaks to stack so it might be not

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.070 
kill streaks to stack so it might be not
that<00:04:03.670> hard<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:04.060> won't<00:04:04.209> be<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.360> hard<00:04:04.510> but<00:04:04.750> um
