00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
method of handling them is that no

see<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.610> video<00:01:20.759> because<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.869> placed<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
see in this video because we placed it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.710 
see in this video because we placed it
close<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> dragon<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> southwest<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
believe the too far dragons would charge

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
believe the too far dragons would charge
us<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.390> leave<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:27.990> room<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.829> dodge

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
us and leave very little room to dodge

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.370 
us and leave very little room to dodge
now<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.150> thing<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.509> hadn't<00:01:30.960> noticed<00:01:31.259> is

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
now one thing that we hadn't noticed is

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.600 
now one thing that we hadn't noticed is
that<00:01:31.409> there's<00:01:31.770> actually<00:01:32.009> only<00:01:32.460> three

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that there's actually only three

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.539 
that there's actually only three
