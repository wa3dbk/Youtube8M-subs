a really great and effective way to do
it<00:00:17.940> using<00:00:18.119> channels<00:00:18.630> first<00:00:19.380> thing<00:00:19.590> we<00:00:19.680> need<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
it using channels first thing we need to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.740 
it using channels first thing we need to
do<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.160> make<00:00:20.340> sure<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.550> our<00:00:20.850> documents<00:00:21.570> set

do is make sure that our documents set
up<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.070> need<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.400> make<00:00:23.519> sure

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
up right so we just need to make sure

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.460 
up right so we just need to make sure
that<00:00:23.730> black<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.840> foreground<00:00:25.170> color

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
which it is and we should always

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
which it is and we should always
duplicate<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> background<00:00:31.040> double<00:00:32.040> click<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

let's<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.739> started<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.489> need<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> bring<00:00:44.910> up

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
let's get started we need to bring up

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.110 
let's get started we need to bring up
our<00:00:45.149> channels<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.770> through

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
our channels you can do that through

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.729 
our channels you can do that through
Windows<00:00:49.820> channels<00:00:50.820> or<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.230> tab<00:00:52.440> here

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
Windows channels or it's just a tab here

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
Windows channels or it's just a tab here
on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> right<00:00:53.039> hand<00:00:53.250> side<00:00:53.480> what<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.660> need<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
on the right hand side what we need to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380 
on the right hand side what we need to
look<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.340> highest<00:00:56.699> contrasting

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
look for is the highest contrasting

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.889 
look for is the highest contrasting
channel<00:00:57.750> red<00:00:58.559> green<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:58.949> blue

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
channel red green or blue

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.250 
channel red green or blue
there's<00:01:00.899> red<00:01:01.309> green<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.640> blue<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:04.049> looks

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
there's red green and blue and it looks

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.719 
there's red green and blue and it looks
like<00:01:04.320> that's<00:01:04.559> gonna<00:01:04.769> be<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> most<00:01:05.100> promising

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
like that's gonna be the most promising

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.840 
like that's gonna be the most promising
let's<00:01:06.659> duplicate<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.380> by<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> same<00:01:08.610> method

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
let's duplicate that by the same method

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.399 
let's duplicate that by the same method
we<00:01:09.090> did<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.360> our<00:01:09.450> layer<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:10.380> drag<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> down

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
we did with our layer just drag it down

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.370 
we did with our layer just drag it down
and<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.650> should<00:01:13.740> duplicate<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:15.380> basically

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and it should duplicate that basically

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.539 
and it should duplicate that basically
the<00:01:16.560> way<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> work<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.430> we're

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the way this is going to work is we're

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.200 
the way this is going to work is we're
going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> turn<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.540> duplicated<00:01:19.229> channel

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
going to turn this duplicated channel

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
going to turn this duplicated channel
completely<00:01:21.210> black<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.650> background

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
completely black and then the background

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.920 
completely black and then the background
is<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.909> completely<00:01:24.450> white<00:01:24.630> we're

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
is going to be completely white we're

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.149 
is going to be completely white we're
going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> subtract<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> white<00:01:25.680> background

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
going to subtract the white background

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.660 
going to subtract the white background
so<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.360> need<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.520> increase<00:01:29.520> our

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
so what we need to do is increase our

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.660 
so what we need to do is increase our
contrast<00:01:30.180> more<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> let's<00:01:32.070> bring<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.369> curves

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
contrast more so let's bring up curves

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.359 
contrast more so let's bring up curves
by<00:01:32.880> hitting<00:01:33.060> command<00:01:33.840> M<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.530> ctrl<00:01:34.890> M<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.220> you're

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
by hitting command M or ctrl M if you're

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.690 
by hitting command M or ctrl M if you're
using<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.670> PC<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.890> let's<00:01:37.890> darken<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> darks<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
using a PC and let's darken the darks a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.170 
using a PC and let's darken the darks a
bit<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.420> click<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.200> drag<00:01:43.850> let's<00:01:44.850> increase

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
bit just click and drag let's increase

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.740 
bit just click and drag let's increase
the<00:01:45.360> contrast<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.049> bit<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:48.149> looks<00:01:48.180> good<00:01:48.540> for

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the contrast a bit that looks good for

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.149 
the contrast a bit that looks good for
now<00:01:51.020> then<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.170> need<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> trace<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.860> anything

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
now then we need to trace out anything

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.010 
now then we need to trace out anything
we<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> keep<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.509> basically<00:01:54.780> we're<00:01:54.930> gonna

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
we want to keep so basically we're gonna

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020 
we want to keep so basically we're gonna
trace<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.409> our<00:01:55.560> body<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.549> around<00:01:56.880> her

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
trace out our body and then around her

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
trace out our body and then around her
face<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.110> gonna<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.320> kind<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.619> rough

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
face but this is gonna be kind of rough

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.700 
face but this is gonna be kind of rough
because<00:01:59.640> her<00:02:00.630> face<00:02:00.869> isn't<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.380> touching

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
because her face isn't really touching

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.289 
because her face isn't really touching
any<00:02:01.860> part<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> background<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.119> we<00:02:03.210> can

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
any part of the background so we can

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.580 
any part of the background so we can
just<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:03.540> kind<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.810> roughly<00:02:04.049> around<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.439> but

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
just go kind of roughly around here but

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
just go kind of roughly around here but
we<00:02:04.649> want<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> spend<00:02:05.070> most<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.000> our<00:02:06.060> time<00:02:06.240> making

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
we want to spend most of our time making

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.499 
we want to spend most of our time making
sure<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.290> our<00:02:08.129> tracing<00:02:08.700> around<00:02:08.789> her<00:02:09.090> arms

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
sure that our tracing around her arms

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.050 
sure that our tracing around her arms
and<00:02:09.720> her<00:02:10.410> body<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:11.190> close<00:02:11.489> as<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.819> want<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and her body is as close as we want to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
and her body is as close as we want to
get<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.900> gonna<00:02:13.020> speed<00:02:13.379> this

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
get it I'm gonna speed this

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.750 
get it I'm gonna speed this
for<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.950> guys<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:14.340> I'm<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.579> to<00:02:14.609> use

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
all right now that we got her traced out

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.600 
all right now that we got her traced out
and<00:03:02.620> again<00:03:02.830> we're<00:03:02.950> tracing<00:03:03.100> out<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.370> areas

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
and again we're tracing out the areas

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.190 
and again we're tracing out the areas
that<00:03:03.640> we<00:03:03.790> want<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.120> keep<00:03:04.300> we'll<00:03:04.690> keep<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.990> hair

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
that we want to keep we'll keep the hair

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
that we want to keep we'll keep the hair
but<00:03:05.350> I'll<00:03:05.410> show<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.620> how<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.770> do<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.010> here<00:03:06.160> in

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
but I'll show you how to do that here in

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.010 
but I'll show you how to do that here in
a<00:03:06.340> second

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
a second

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.500 
a second
we're<00:03:08.530> gonna<00:03:08.620> hit<00:03:08.830> command<00:03:09.700> or<00:03:09.850> control<00:03:10.330> free

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
we're gonna hit command or control free

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.320 
we're gonna hit command or control free
on<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> PC<00:03:11.020> plus<00:03:11.350> enter<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:12.819> activate<00:03:12.970> our

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
on a PC plus enter to activate our

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.670 
on a PC plus enter to activate our
tracing<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:15.450> then<00:03:16.450> we<00:03:16.660> need<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.020> fill<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.590> with

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
tracing and then we need to fill it with

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.270 
tracing and then we need to fill it with
black

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
black

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.080 
black
we're<00:03:19.239> gonna<00:03:19.330> hit<00:03:19.770> Alt<00:03:20.770> Delete<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.850> should

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
we're gonna hit Alt Delete that should

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.410 
we're gonna hit Alt Delete that should
fill<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.360> with<00:03:22.450> black<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.819> then<00:03:25.030> we<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.330> go

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
fill it with black and then we can go

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.870 
fill it with black and then we can go
ahead<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.720> deselect<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.350> command<00:03:26.830> D<00:03:26.890> let's

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
ahead and deselect it command D let's

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.120 
ahead and deselect it command D let's
increase<00:03:28.180> our<00:03:28.330> contrast<00:03:28.750> again<00:03:29.110> but<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.680> think

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
increase our contrast again but I think

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.410 
increase our contrast again but I think
we're<00:03:30.280> gonna<00:03:30.400> use<00:03:30.489> levels<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.290> command<00:03:32.290> L<00:03:33.420> so

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
we're gonna use levels so command L so

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.020 
we're gonna use levels so command L so
right<00:03:34.900> now<00:03:35.080> her<00:03:35.920> body<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.310> all<00:03:36.459> black<00:03:36.700> that's

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
right now her body is all black that's

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.090 
right now her body is all black that's
all<00:03:37.209> gonna<00:03:37.390> stay<00:03:37.660> but<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.110> can<00:03:38.590> see<00:03:38.769> she's<00:03:38.920> got

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
all gonna stay but you can see she's got

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.250 
all gonna stay but you can see she's got
some<00:03:39.220> highlights<00:03:39.580> in<00:03:39.700> her<00:03:39.760> hair<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.269> we<00:03:41.080> don't

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
want those to go away so we're gonna try

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.610 
want those to go away so we're gonna try
to<00:03:42.880> make<00:03:43.060> those<00:03:43.239> disappear<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:43.959> our<00:03:44.110> with

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
to make those disappear with our with

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.680 
to make those disappear with our with
levels<00:03:44.950> here<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:46.269> we're<00:03:46.360> gonna<00:03:46.450> make<00:03:46.569> the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
levels here so we're gonna make the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.590 
levels here so we're gonna make the
darks<00:03:46.959> even<00:03:47.230> darker<00:03:48.120> you're<00:03:49.120> gonna<00:03:49.269> turn<00:03:49.450> the

darks even darker you're gonna turn the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.250 
darks even darker you're gonna turn the
mids<00:03:49.810> down<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.050> bit

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.070 

I<00:03:57.819> see<00:03:58.819> what's<00:03:59.060> actually<00:03:59.269> hair<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.900> what's

what's not that should be pretty good
now<00:04:04.970> we're<00:04:05.599> gonna<00:04:05.689> hit<00:04:05.840> okay<00:04:08.049> okay<00:04:09.049> now<00:04:09.200> that

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
now we're gonna hit okay okay now that

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.679 
now we're gonna hit okay okay now that
the<00:04:09.409> background<00:04:09.829> selected<00:04:10.390> it's<00:04:11.390> time<00:04:11.569> to

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
the background selected it's time to

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.920 
the background selected it's time to
delete<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:12.680> all<00:04:12.829> we<00:04:12.890> need<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.129> do<00:04:13.310> is

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
delete it so all we need to do is

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.379 
delete it so all we need to do is
reactivate<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.079> RGB<00:04:15.650> channel<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.389> we're

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
reactivate this RGB channel and we're

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.020 
reactivate this RGB channel and we're
going<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.690> hide<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.109> blue<00:04:18.289> copy<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:19.039> we<00:04:19.850> can

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
going to hide the blue copy and we can

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.689 
going to hide the blue copy and we can
simply<00:04:20.389> hit<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.930> delete<00:04:21.229> button<00:04:21.260> if<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:22.490> want

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
simply hit the delete button if you want

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:23.890 
simply hit the delete button if you want
you<00:04:22.820> can<00:04:22.910> go<00:04:23.000> into<00:04:23.120> layers<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:23.570> use<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:23.690> layer

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
you can go into layers and use a layer

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.870 
you can go into layers and use a layer
mask<00:04:23.990> for<00:04:24.889> the<00:04:24.979> sake<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.160> this<00:04:25.310> tutorial<00:04:25.760> we're

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
mask for the sake of this tutorial we're

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.650 
mask for the sake of this tutorial we're
going<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.120> just<00:04:26.900> delete<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.289> background

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
going to just delete the background

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.390 
going to just delete the background
let's<00:04:29.660> go<00:04:29.750> back<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:30.020> our<00:04:30.110> layers<00:04:30.350> let's<00:04:31.310> see

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
let's go back to our layers let's see

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.340 
let's go back to our layers let's see
how<00:04:31.490> good<00:04:31.520> of<00:04:31.639> a<00:04:31.760> job<00:04:31.789> we<00:04:32.150> did<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:32.660> can<00:04:32.810> deselect

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
how good of a job we did we can deselect

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.129 
how good of a job we did we can deselect
it<00:04:33.650> now<00:04:33.680> what<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.490> usually<00:04:34.789> like<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:34.910> do<00:04:35.090> is<00:04:35.270> put

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
it now what I usually like to do is put
