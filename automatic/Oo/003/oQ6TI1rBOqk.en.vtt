thought<00:00:00.570> I'd<00:00:00.690> do<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.870> video<00:00:01.079> and<00:00:01.500> show<00:00:01.740> you<00:00:01.770> how

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
thought I'd do a video and show you how

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.680 
thought I'd do a video and show you how
most<00:00:03.049> Japanese<00:00:04.049> motorcycle<00:00:04.799> locks<00:00:05.040> work<00:00:05.690> this

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
most Japanese motorcycle locks work this

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.509 
most Japanese motorcycle locks work this
lock<00:00:06.990> here<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.350> an<00:00:07.470> ignition<00:00:07.740> lock<00:00:08.099> it's<00:00:08.340> off<00:00:08.490> a

lock here is an ignition lock it's off a
Honda<00:00:09.000> motorcycle<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.840> don't<00:00:10.230> remember<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
Honda motorcycle I don't remember the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.549 
Honda motorcycle I don't remember the
year<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.340> model<00:00:11.990> do<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.049> know<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.349> it's

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
year or the model do you know it's it's

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.930 
year or the model do you know it's it's
an<00:00:13.679> older<00:00:13.920> bike<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.280> probably<00:00:14.549> from<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> 70s

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
an older bike it's probably from the 70s

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.380 
an older bike it's probably from the 70s
or<00:00:15.330> 80s<00:00:15.770> the<00:00:16.770> actual<00:00:17.279> mechanical<00:00:18.090> locking

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
or 80s the actual mechanical locking

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.380 
or 80s the actual mechanical locking
mechanism<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:20.039> portion<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.150> lock

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
mechanism is in this portion of the lock

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.509 
mechanism is in this portion of the lock
and<00:00:21.720> then<00:00:22.410> there's<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> tail<00:00:22.890> piece<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.340> runs

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
and then there's a tail piece that runs

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.320 
and then there's a tail piece that runs
through<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> lock<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.300> operates<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.019> black

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
through the lock and operates this black

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.419 
through the lock and operates this black
electrical<00:00:27.330> switch<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> also<00:00:29.010> have

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
electrical switch and then you also have

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.510 
electrical switch and then you also have
a<00:00:29.460> steering<00:00:30.330> lock<00:00:30.570> here<00:00:30.960> which<00:00:31.920> I'll<00:00:32.070> try<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
a steering lock here which I'll try and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.410 
a steering lock here which I'll try and
show<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.510> stiff<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.420> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
show you it's a little stiff but that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
show you it's a little stiff but that
pops<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.110> locks<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:38.629> steering<00:00:40.610> I'll<00:00:41.610> go

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
pops out and locks the steering I'll go

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.549 
pops out and locks the steering I'll go
ahead<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.180> disassemble<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.140> thing<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
clips are kind of rounded so it's not

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.789 
clips are kind of rounded so it's not
difficult<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.000> out<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.489> remove<00:01:02.879> this

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
difficult to get out and you remove this

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.969 
difficult to get out and you remove this
and<00:01:04.799> inside<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.740> tail<00:01:07.740> piece

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
lock shell is the lock cylinder which

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.210 
lock shell is the lock cylinder which
you<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.430> pull<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.079> you've<00:01:41.070> got

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you can pull out here and you've got

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.210 
you can pull out here and you've got
these<00:01:41.369> wafers<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> lock<00:01:42.360> cylinder<00:01:43.220> which

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
these wafers in the lock cylinder which

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.460 
these wafers in the lock cylinder which
one<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.729> fell<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:46.100> they're<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.220> spring

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
one just fell out they're all spring

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.690 
one just fell out they're all spring
spring-loaded<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.710> spring<00:01:50.009> causes<00:01:50.520> them<00:01:50.670> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
spring-loaded a spring causes them to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.380 
spring-loaded a spring causes them to
stick<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.149> your

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
stick out like this and that is your

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
stick out like this and that is your
lock<00:01:55.079> cylinder<00:01:56.630> because<00:01:57.630> these<00:01:57.950> lock<00:01:58.950> wafers

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
lock cylinder because these lock wafers

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.429 
lock cylinder because these lock wafers
are<00:01:59.840> spring-loaded<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> they're<00:02:01.200> sticking

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
are spring-loaded and they're sticking

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.580 
are spring-loaded and they're sticking
above<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> diameter<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.869> lock<00:02:04.290> cylinder

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
above the diameter of the lock cylinder

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.940 
above the diameter of the lock cylinder
like<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:06.780> prevents<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> lock<00:02:07.710> cylinder

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
like this it prevents the lock cylinder

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.859 
like this it prevents the lock cylinder
from<00:02:08.280> turning<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.879> insert<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> wrong

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
from turning when you insert the wrong

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.029 
from turning when you insert the wrong
key<00:02:10.140> or<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.349> try<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.679> turn<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.920> lock

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
key or you try and turn the lock

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.699 
key or you try and turn the lock
cylinder<00:02:11.340> without<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> key

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
cylinder without a key

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.080 
cylinder without a key
I'll<00:02:13.069> go<00:02:13.189> ahead<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.400> take<00:02:13.519> one<00:02:13.549> of<00:02:13.790> these<00:02:13.879> out

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
I'll go ahead and take one of these out

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.080 
I'll go ahead and take one of these out
and<00:02:14.239> show<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.450> what<00:02:14.569> they<00:02:14.689> look<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:19.700> is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
and show you what they look like this is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.679 
and show you what they look like this is
the<00:02:20.420> lock<00:02:21.319> wafer<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.549> when<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.150> insert<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
the lock wafer and when you insert the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
to turn the lock cylinder so that is how

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.800 
to turn the lock cylinder so that is how
a<00:03:38.720> Japanese<00:03:39.530> lock<00:03:39.799> works<00:03:40.690> eventually<00:03:41.690> if<00:03:41.780> you

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
a Japanese lock works eventually if you

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.990 
a Japanese lock works eventually if you
use<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:42.319> lock<00:03:42.650> cylinder<00:03:43.129> enough<00:03:43.459> these

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
use this lock cylinder enough these

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.770 
use this lock cylinder enough these
wafers<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.079> key<00:03:45.349> will<00:03:45.889> wear<00:03:46.129> and<00:03:46.780> these

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
wafers and the key will wear and these

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.719 
wafers and the key will wear and these
the<00:03:48.290> key<00:03:48.470> will<00:03:48.650> no<00:03:48.769> longer<00:03:49.010> be<00:03:49.220> able<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.459> pull

these wafers down to the same diameter

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.050 
these wafers down to the same diameter
as<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.859> lock<00:03:52.069> cylinder<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.639> you'll<00:03:52.729> start<00:03:52.970> to

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
as a lock cylinder and you'll start to

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.110 
as a lock cylinder and you'll start to
experience<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.919> lock<00:03:55.190> sticking<00:03:55.790> you'll

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
experience the lock sticking you'll

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.550 
experience the lock sticking you'll
probably<00:03:56.269> have<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.569> wiggle<00:03:56.900> your<00:03:57.019> key<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.409> get

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
probably have to wiggle your key to get

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.159 
probably have to wiggle your key to get
the<00:03:57.590> lock<00:03:57.889> to<00:03:58.069> turn<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:59.019> eventually<00:04:00.019> what

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
the lock to turn and eventually what

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.659 
the lock to turn and eventually what
will<00:04:00.229> happen<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.620> it'll<00:04:00.829> wear<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.220> much<00:04:01.430> that

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
will happen is it'll wear so much that

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.920 
will happen is it'll wear so much that
you<00:04:01.760> won't<00:04:01.879> be<00:04:02.000> able<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.180> turn<00:04:02.389> the<00:04:02.540> lock<00:04:02.750> at

you won't be able to turn the lock at
all<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.379> when<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.129> happens<00:04:04.609> you'll<00:04:04.849> either
