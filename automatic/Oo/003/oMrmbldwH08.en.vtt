00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
name yeah it's a bit hard also to

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.290 
name yeah it's a bit hard also to
pronounce<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.380> way<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:33.120> pronunciation<00:02:34.120> is

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
pronounce the way the pronunciation is

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.979 
pronounce the way the pronunciation is
yeah<00:02:35.610> maybe<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:36.849> similar<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.690> French

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989

yeah maybe it's similar to the French
are<00:02:38.410> somehow<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:39.970> anyway<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:43.209> it's<00:02:47.580> V

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
are somehow but anyway it's so it's V

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:58.500 
are somehow but anyway it's so it's V
again<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.480> pronunciation<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:53.459> hey<00:02:56.340> okay<00:02:57.510> so

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.949 
again the pronunciation is hey okay so
let's<00:02:58.750> move<00:02:59.019> on<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.470> how<00:02:59.830> we<00:02:59.890> write<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:01.209> a

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
let's move on to how we write that in a

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.430 
let's move on to how we write that in a
world<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.489> at<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.640> beginning<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> world

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
world so at the beginning of the world

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.259 
world so at the beginning of the world
that's<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:09.010> just<00:03:09.190> write<00:03:09.519> one<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.030> these

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
that's you just write one of these

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.360 
that's you just write one of these
curves<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.470> then<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.579> extend<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.680> connected

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
curves and then you extend and connected

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.800 
curves and then you extend and connected
to<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:16.329> next<00:03:16.570> letter<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.269> in<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.510> middle

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
like this

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.170 
like this
connect<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.359> throw<00:03:28.570> front<00:03:28.900> by<00:03:29.200> something

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
connect the throw front by something

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.930 
connect the throw front by something
then<00:03:31.180> go<00:03:31.810> up<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.739> connect<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.579> like<00:03:33.819> this<00:03:35.940> so

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
then go up and connect it like this so

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.870 
then go up and connect it like this so
the<00:03:36.970> hook<00:03:37.329> is<00:03:37.660> basically<00:03:38.560> leaning<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> small

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
the hook is basically leaning on a small

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.030 
the hook is basically leaning on a small
tooth<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:42.040> do<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.769> one

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
tooth so you do it like this this is one

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.280 
tooth so you do it like this this is one
way<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.670> write<00:03:46.359> it<00:03:46.540> when<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.989> middle<00:03:47.260> of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
way to write it when it's the middle of

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.229 
way to write it when it's the middle of
the<00:03:47.350> word<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.430> other<00:03:48.549> way<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.850> write<00:03:49.180> it

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the word but the other way to write it

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.849 
the word but the other way to write it
in<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.600> middle<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.989> word<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.470> write<00:03:50.680> it

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
in the middle of the word I write it

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.080 
in the middle of the word I write it
here<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:52.239> you<00:03:52.329> connect<00:03:52.569> azar<00:03:52.870> front<00:03:53.670> then<00:03:54.670> you

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
here so you connect azar front then you

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.500 
here so you connect azar front then you
do<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:56.319> kind<00:03:56.709> of<00:03:56.920> shape<00:03:57.250> please<00:03:58.090> phone

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
do this kind of shape please phone

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.840 
do this kind of shape please phone
carefully<00:03:59.260> you<00:03:59.709> go<00:03:59.920> like<00:04:00.130> that

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
carefully you go like that

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.700 
carefully you go like that
go<00:04:01.660> back<00:04:02.139> go<00:04:02.790> down<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.750> into<00:04:05.500> you

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
hmm um well it looks like a hammer I

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.710 
hmm um well it looks like a hammer I
guess<00:04:13.650> I'm<00:04:14.400> not<00:04:14.610> sure<00:04:14.670> how<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.000> describe<00:04:15.150> this

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
guess I'm not sure how to describe this

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.890 
guess I'm not sure how to describe this
shape<00:04:16.400> anyway<00:04:17.400> again<00:04:17.820> I'm<00:04:17.970> gonna<00:04:18.120> write<00:04:18.390> this

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
shape anyway again I'm gonna write this

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.670 
shape anyway again I'm gonna write this
shape<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.430> like<00:04:20.790> this<00:04:21.270> see<00:04:22.050> this<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.530> when

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
shape so it's like this see this is when

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.520 
shape so it's like this see this is when
I<00:04:22.710> write<00:04:23.040> it<00:04:23.190> too<00:04:23.310> fast<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:24.690> cannot<00:04:24.930> see<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.230> gap

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
I write it too fast you cannot see a gap

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.320 
I write it too fast you cannot see a gap
just<00:04:28.530> like<00:04:29.310> like<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:31.220> so<00:04:32.220> this<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:32.970> when<00:04:33.210> it's

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
just like like so so this is when it's

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.430 
just like like so so this is when it's
in<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.570> middle<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:33.990> word

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
in the middle of the word

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.400 
in the middle of the word
let's<00:04:34.860> do<00:04:35.280> within<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.730> end<00:04:36.450> of<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.200> word

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
let's do within that end of the word

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.130 
let's do within that end of the word
it's<00:04:38.370> actually<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.180> similar<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.020> this

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
it's actually this similar to this

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.560 
it's actually this similar to this
middle<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:41.190> go<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.610> this

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
middle so you go like this

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.260 
middle so you go like this
you<00:04:42.750> have<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.290> tooth<00:04:43.850> then<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:45.090> hook<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.630> and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
you have a tooth then you hook it and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.370 
you have a tooth then you hook it and
you<00:04:48.270> continue<00:04:49.170> with<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.800> curve<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.020> it's<00:04:52.140> like

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
you continue with a curve so it's like

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.140 
you continue with a curve so it's like
this<00:04:53.450> when<00:04:54.450> it's<00:04:54.600> at<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.170> end<00:04:55.350> but<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:57.000> can

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
this when it's at the end but you can

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.950 
this when it's at the end but you can
also<00:04:57.390> do<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.230> other<00:04:58.290> way<00:04:59.000> which<00:05:00.000> is<00:05:00.240> more

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
also do it the other way which is more

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.360 
also do it the other way which is more
common<00:05:01.410> when<00:05:01.560> written<00:05:02.100> by<00:05:02.840> my<00:05:03.840> hand<00:05:04.140> goes<00:05:05.070> like

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
common when written by my hand goes like

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:14.470 
common when written by my hand goes like
this<00:05:06.500> then<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.620> go<00:05:07.800> back<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.030> forth<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:12.620> so

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
this then you go back and forth and so

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.460 
this then you go back and forth and so
here<00:05:15.480> you<00:05:15.540> go<00:05:15.690> there<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.110> go

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
here you go there you go

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.200 
here you go there you go
this<00:05:17.400> is<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:17.760> ie<00:05:18.270> which<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.200> aa<00:05:19.410> if<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:20.970> added

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
this is that ie which is aa if I added

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.830 
this is that ie which is aa if I added
that<00:05:21.540> it<00:05:21.810> would<00:05:22.020> be<00:05:23.390> right<00:05:24.390> it's<00:05:25.380> exactly

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
that it would be right it's exactly

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.160 
that it would be right it's exactly
exactly<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:29.190> same<00:05:30.950> I'll<00:05:31.950> do<00:05:32.610> this<00:05:32.970> move<00:05:33.540> just

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
exactly the same I'll do this move just

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:42.350 
exactly the same I'll do this move just
one<00:05:34.380> more<00:05:34.650> time<00:05:34.950> to<00:05:36.980> just<00:05:37.980> to<00:05:38.300> just<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:42.090> make<00:05:42.210> it

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
one more time to just to just to make it

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.840 
one more time to just to just to make it
more<00:05:42.780> clear<00:05:43.290> again<00:05:43.770> so<00:05:44.930> let<00:05:45.930> me<00:05:46.080> do<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.410> alone

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
more clear again so let me do it alone

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.950 
more clear again so let me do it alone
so<00:05:47.850> it<00:05:47.970> goes<00:05:48.300> like<00:05:48.570> this

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
so it goes like this

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.270 
so it goes like this
you<00:05:49.890> connect<00:05:50.340> it<00:05:50.610> you<00:05:51.420> go<00:05:51.600> up<00:05:52.730> back<00:05:54.080> down

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
you connect it you go up back down

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.550 
you connect it you go up back down
so<00:05:57.280> this<00:05:57.460> is<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:59.910> this<00:06:00.910> is<00:06:00.970> out<00:06:01.150> write<00:06:01.870> it<00:06:02.020> fast

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
so this is it this is out write it fast

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.320 
so this is it this is out write it fast
anyway<00:06:03.479> so<00:06:04.479> let's<00:06:04.770> pronounce<00:06:05.770> those<00:06:06.699> letters

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
anyway so let's pronounce those letters

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.510 
anyway so let's pronounce those letters
one<00:06:07.720> more<00:06:07.990> time<00:06:11.430> so<00:06:12.430> this<00:06:13.210> is<00:06:13.360> 19<00:06:13.930> the

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
one more time so this is 19 the

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.040 
one more time so this is 19 the
pronunciation<00:06:15.520> is<00:06:15.699> huh<00:06:16.210> oh<00:06:17.940> hey<00:06:18.940> just<00:06:19.780> fast

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
pronunciation is huh oh hey just fast

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:33.089 
pronunciation is huh oh hey just fast
let's<00:06:20.380> go<00:06:20.530> slow<00:06:28.919> if<00:06:29.919> you<00:06:30.930> actually<00:06:31.930> get<00:06:32.470> the

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
let's go slow if you actually get the

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.270 
let's go slow if you actually get the
sound<00:06:33.430> correct<00:06:33.960> you<00:06:34.960> will<00:06:35.199> be<00:06:35.380> like<00:06:35.620> amazing

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
sound correct you will be like amazing

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.219 
sound correct you will be like amazing
because<00:06:36.490> I've<00:06:37.479> never<00:06:37.720> seen<00:06:38.110> anyone<00:06:38.800> who<00:06:38.860> speak

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
because I've never seen anyone who speak

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:45.409 
because I've never seen anyone who speak
he<00:06:41.229> who<00:06:41.410> learned<00:06:41.680> Arabic<00:06:42.870> can<00:06:43.870> say<00:06:44.289> the<00:06:44.530> sound
