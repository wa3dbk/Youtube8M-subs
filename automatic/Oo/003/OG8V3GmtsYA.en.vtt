00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.069
 with the report that follows the suggestion of the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.830
 viewer evandro daniel 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.950
 I would like to understand the details of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 morphology our guest an expert on 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.310
 subject matter 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 gilberto loureiro de souza the biotype 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.980
 morphology of the creole goes beyond 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 measures 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.039
 the racial booth consists of five 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.170
 pillars of the typicality of the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.050
 upper row of functional type 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.809
 This year's horse management is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.239
 quality of the frog ones and the balance 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.690
 between these four things we go is the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.940
 first point is the typicity that is the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.059
 representation of the breed 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.210
 we arrived at a national exhibition of the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 horse of all races are present 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 tells all the horses moment to enter the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.629
 corridor where it has 50 with the smell of 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.239
 each side and all the cars shot in the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.309
 head out there have a single one created there 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.309
 and put your head out I have to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.369
 know that is not the Creole horse one 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.250
 well-characterized head 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.560
 identify even the sex of the animal 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.049
 a male has to have pressure but I think 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.470
 as well as the female by expressive 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.950
 has 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.820
 she has to have femininity refinement 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.939
 to the head 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.710
 usually a mirror of the skeleton of the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.240
 horse with beautiful head 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.220
 usually a balanced horse help 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.890
 to understand the morphology of the horse 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.380
 Creole is what's coming to Geran 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.850
 four-year-old mare who is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.280
 in process of dressage is not only prepared 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.610
 with horse show demonstrates its 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.490
 ability and morphology and in the field 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.540
 loose in nature without any artifice 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.600
 finishing 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.000
 he needs the confidence and say that he 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.780
 is an animal that has the ability to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.869
 to represent race 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.979
 They are to be the abundant features 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.799
 Creole horse 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.880
 but not all possess is a matter of 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.819
 lineage and has low heritability, let's 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.470
 now one of the most important points to 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.730
 top row 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.370
 we are here the southern cross loin and the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.770
 it is fundamental that the structure 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.680
 bone is correct and that there is 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.230
 reinvestment , which guarantees the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.620
 longevity of the animal as a 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.260
 saddle the moment they give in to them 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.150
 will begin to get bruised in a 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.600
 moment that only saw it hurt we can not 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.690
 studying the musculature is linked to 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.720
 handling and loading 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.910
 genetics of animals genetically the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.580
 animals that have a more muscular 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.620
 outstanding that have animals that can 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.519
 be super well nourished well 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.250
 not busy and do not show as much 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.200
 visual muscle power although the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.959
 How does it work sometimes can have more 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.870
 functional capacity of an animal that 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.459
 had a muscular relief up to exaggerated 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.739
 another thing that qualifies the line 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.810
 higher I degree of union and 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.590
 continuity ending with insertion 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.000
 of the glue can not even be a glue 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.530
 a glue with 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.690
 top collar should always be 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.989
 representing the continuity of the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.720
 lorenzo perosi one of the aspects 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.420
 most important and valued 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.329
 exposures are atoms 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.090
 the animal that comes straight lined 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:44.709
 walking hitting the paw on the floor 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.570
 and kicks forward without swinging without 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.890
 deviations in twisting 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.290
 this is the frame considered a sock for 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.320
 a team that does not have 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.870
 externally and internally 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.850
 holding the back mass in the center 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.489
 later and the distance between already 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.010
 times more will be if the horse treads and 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.470
 turn inside out and sign 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.840
 misuse of horsepower if on a horse going 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.269
 shows the structure that will be damaged 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.660
 produced that the horse was coming towards 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.970
 people notice colell 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.880
 the degree of deviation that a member has and 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.459
 we affirm it is a talk about the biotype 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.550
 work an important point are the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.580
 the angles of the pallet for example are 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.740
 directly related to the capacity of 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.800
 advance 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.630
 usually the horse projects the hand 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.860
 front 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.440
 in the continuity of the pallet angulation 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.590
 floor standing mare 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.020
 it suspends numerous times of wide 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.730
 many times the hand on the ground and 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.000
 progresses on your walking and walking 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.130
 usually do not have amenity also in 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.320
 relation to the functional biotype 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.690
 balance of the silhouette that is when the 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.960
 animal has crosses to the external and 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.120
 external to the floor the same volume because 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.190
 a horse that has that balance that 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.800
 have the logs that have the depth 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.500
 besides the characteristics Carlos 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.590
 is what needs to be done 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.130
 here with the lung heart is has a 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.690
 functional aspect of balance for those who 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.080
 it's on top of a horse 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.540
 I have found 11 the cow a certain 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.020
 angle running to the field outside and tupi 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.510
 charles with that mare she beats pushes 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.669
 if you meet horses from the 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.890
 ground with the lacquer running to the field outside 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.320
 there is a tendency that the gaucho 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.560
 formerly the slave of the knee 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.990
 It's the pause that closes and come 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.780
 keep extremely dangerous 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.570
 another particularity is the animal that has 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.330
 correct angulation of the network does not have 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:56.300
 overloads joints 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:59.250
 Jorge's year, this is not even 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.180
 overly open or overdone 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.550
 closed 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.720
 the line coming down from here has to pass 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.130
 people back here in chat 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.270
 we know the main pillars of 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.490
 morphology 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.380
 but it is important to remember that the success of 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.240
 horse is a joint action of qualities 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.639
 harmony the balance set and the 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.479
 of the regions is what makes the 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.930
 difference in our last instance in a 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.930
 morphological analysis
