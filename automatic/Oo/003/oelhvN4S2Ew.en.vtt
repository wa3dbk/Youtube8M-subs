00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.960
 Bus Coverskur Yeosu at Night Sea 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.139
 The old state is the whole country. 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.259
 With a very simple stroke 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.800
 Oh, I can play it. 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:22.349
 Earlier last week four words only 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:26.429
 Maybe we should call it a little bit 5 and a stroked form 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:31.980
 This is how it works, but the original is a bit more complicated. 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:34.920
 Well this Actz head age is something like this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.600
 What Are The original jeongbeomjin 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.600
 Focus these phrases 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.559
 5 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.469
 Coming like ride 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:03.899
 I do not know how to do this. 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:10.830
 Well before the atmosphere of the original intact haejugo so that these prior week 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:12.750
 If you Bout, but really this way for some time, and the word from memory 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.710
 I will remember 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:24.570
 That's a bit of a question. 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:29.400
 For those novices like this , the fingers are now carrying four of those black pes 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:33.680
 What did that take the code that fact'm not mean he is lucky 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.390
 Then a little bit easier to lift Yes 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.240
 Code Les's not something that's true, but is drawn one example of many 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.240
 In fact, it is easy to do because there is a form 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.920
 I can understand why you are wrong, 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.530
 Or that's worth a week or two weeks after Nago okay 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:06.680
 Little progress c code easy 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.570
 I changed a little in the form of Yes . 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.300
 I tried to change it . 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:18.890
 Deoraguyo sounds to life the result should simulate the proper sound 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:24.739
 First, what to do even if you play it so difficult is the fact that the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:29.600
 Put the code in 3 % for 4% and change it to progress code 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:36.770
 Oh, I've tried it a little easier. Oh , 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:40.610
 se edit age - another name of a very difficult name like 7s 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:45.380
 How Did that code for you to have accomplished it.I thought 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:50.390
 But I have one word about the four other Wuxi it is one that is used for the end 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:55.160
 Modification of the code that you write or deformation of the shoe that is a minor 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:59.630
 Since ancient times these dietary modifications, called fascia Apple Seven Minor 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:04.610
 If you care a little, you 'll be able to do it right away. 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.920
 In the song part, the fact is not so important , 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.849
 U 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.349
 Wherever sound alike but not so important anyway some week earlier 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.349
 To become 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:17.459
 I think I should do it a little . 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:25.050
 cf is the middle code 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:28.230
 Stop 1 at the end 4 5 5 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:34.850
 It will be the state when it is medium. 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.850
 Here haebomyeon control its music once Dell 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.330
 That was when the sound bloody good is released for a little sex or give me a gunshot 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.220
 I will 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.549
 And the tutaj is a minor seventh ed c. 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:56.819
 Well, it's a little complicated. 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:04:08.670
 Just as Mr. Tran is the second base gyaban gaebanghyeon only looking for something that 6 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:13.680
 Like, for example, and it is haejusimyeon first turn become so GO 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.229
 The fact that you can be a Seven of them is now the code that comes out of the spring song 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.660
 Once I made it like this. 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:26.940
 Well, the fact is, there's no reason to be. 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:31.400
 None of that place to sleep in a minor Tsutsui 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.400
 This control its inde neundeyo becoming a code 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:41.600
 Another piece'd doeseo Protocol 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.600
 Yes it is one jeonjaesan haejusyeoya just once to cover the same two Edit 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.729
 5 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:57.059
 4 Major Seven Years Old Sorcery Major Seven 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.199
 f When a skip is gundeseo line 1 coming from the bottom to the state what opening 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:01.699
 I gave it to him. 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.699
 In this state again 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:08.899
 It's just that he broke the stop . The state is f manager seventh s2. 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:16.519
 That's it 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.519
 So I explain this. 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:27.199
 The professor has a connection. 

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:34.469
 In addition, where after we will now very used to write three favorite sources Poker Haven 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:38.309
 Want liver where it is very mp7 better control the line two days in hell 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:42.029
 This time gives hold once wrote fits negative c7 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:44.119
 Of course, I'll catch you on top of it, but I'll stick to these two. 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.119
 A little 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.770
 Oh, this station 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:57.419
 In Palm Cane, in the c code 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:02.160
 Click here for taking up only a small shop and public grasp the form of the forehead yen 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:05.250
 If you keep it, it will be in erase code form. 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.880
 5 That's right. 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.880
 $ 2.50 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:26.310
 tera I'll be with you I'll be the ah ah ah I'm the alpha cry 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:31.979
 This is a unique code is connected to one of my few Imai Release 2 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:34.889
 Jecheon again or do you put this same host and f or laser sensors in Seattle 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:39.750
 Do not try to name it by code 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:43.169
 Yeah beats others prepared at wins 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:49.320
 What's in the minors? 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:52.169
 Tsu's name is that of Mr. Tsu, he's got the money and he's in the state f Major c Yang 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.169
 It's important in terms of 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:59.400
 I have always been a woman 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:04.050
 This will let us know just enough ah gatgoyo 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.729
 If you practice a little, you can practice with a musician . 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.310
 It's a cover. 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:15.050
 This might give the songs a bit easier, it does not just do this staggering 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.050
 There are lots of ways to steal a herd 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:22.360
 Some 5 Tom personal 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:25.120
 Here we go. 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:31.780
 It's not that awkward. 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:36.730
 Well originally I have two minor code seems to be reasonable to make the check presentation nose 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:41.820
 I am arranging and arranging, 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:45.670
 Give me a shy boy like you put it on purpose . 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:48.580
 Because I could have played irrespective of 

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:53.430
 Once more we see, uh'm in two ways 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.430
 Then you 'd better make a decision.
