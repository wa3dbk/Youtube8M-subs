I'm gonna try and plow through I
originally<00:01:49.710> thought<00:01:49.740> they<00:01:50.040> were<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> three

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
originally thought they were like three

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.679 
originally thought they were like three
separate<00:01:50.850> books<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.240> could<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.540> pick

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
separate books and you could just pick

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.179 
separate books and you could just pick
either<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.470> I'm<00:01:52.590> gonna<00:01:52.740> read<00:01:52.860> them<00:01:52.979> but

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
either or if I'm gonna read them but

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
either or if I'm gonna read them but
then<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> noticed<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> back<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.390> Cinda

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
then I noticed on the back that so Cinda

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
then I noticed on the back that so Cinda
is<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.560> book<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.340> kind

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
is in this book here so I think it kind

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.670 
is in this book here so I think it kind
of<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.240> make<00:01:57.450> sense<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> read<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.469> in

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
of would make sense if I read this in

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.679 
of would make sense if I read this in
