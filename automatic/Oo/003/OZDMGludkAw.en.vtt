tracking<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.810> chanting<00:00:22.800> knitting<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.250> just

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
tracking it chanting knitting is just

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.000 
tracking it chanting knitting is just
like<00:00:23.789> any<00:00:24.090> other<00:00:24.269> sort<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> knitting<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.740> only

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
like any other sort of knitting the only

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.029 
like any other sort of knitting the only
difference<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.630> will<00:00:27.779> use<00:00:28.080> chunky

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
difference is that you will use chunky

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.299 
difference is that you will use chunky
yarn<00:00:29.689> which<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.810> much<00:00:31.019> thicker<00:00:31.439> than<00:00:31.859> most<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
yarn which is much thicker than most of

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.600 
yarn which is much thicker than most of
other<00:00:32.460> yarns<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:34.739> will<00:00:34.860> also<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
other yarns and you will also have to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.200 
other yarns and you will also have to
use<00:00:36.059> appropriate<00:00:36.630> size<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.530> needles<00:00:38.090> as<00:00:39.090> you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
use appropriate size of needles as you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
use appropriate size of needles as you
can<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.690> these<00:00:40.410> needles<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.980> much<00:00:41.280> larger

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
can see these needles are much larger

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.319 
can see these needles are much larger
than<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.870> average<00:00:43.050> size<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:44.040> needle<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
than your average size of needle to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.260 
than your average size of needle to
demonstrate<00:00:45.960> how<00:00:46.350> chunky<00:00:46.920> knitting<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.640> just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
demonstrate how chunky knitting is just

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.350 
demonstrate how chunky knitting is just
the<00:00:48.420> same<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.989> any<00:00:49.440> other<00:00:49.710> knitting<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:51.030> going

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the same as any other knitting I'm going

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
the same as any other knitting I'm going
to<00:00:51.570> knit<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:53.570> smooth<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.590> show<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to knit this smooth to be to show you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.520 
to knit this smooth to be to show you
how<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> works<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
how it works so you can see that the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
how it works so you can see that the
needle<00:00:58.859> size<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.760> had<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.210> six<00:01:00.629> million

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
needle size that I had here six million

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.130 
needle size that I had here six million
meters<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.640> size<00:01:02.879> recommended<00:01:03.510> for

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
meters which is the size recommended for

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.580 
meters which is the size recommended for
this<00:01:04.260> particular<00:01:04.530> yarn<00:01:05.990> by<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> way<00:01:07.229> how<00:01:07.530> do

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
this particular yarn by the way how do

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.890 
this particular yarn by the way how do
you<00:01:07.860> tell<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.090> come<00:01:09.810> across

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you tell that you have come across

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.679 
you tell that you have come across
chunky<00:01:10.590> yarn<00:01:10.799> normally<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.909> mentioned<00:01:12.540> on

I'm<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> knit<00:01:31.770> across<00:01:32.540> this<00:01:33.540> row

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
I'm going to knit across this row

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:45.149 
I'm going to knit across this row
using<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.369> English<00:01:37.530> knitting<00:01:38.530> method<00:01:44.159> chunky

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
using the English knitting method chunky

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.569 
using the English knitting method chunky
arms<00:01:45.460> are<00:01:45.609> often<00:01:46.060> quite<00:01:46.270> soft<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:48.340> often

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
arms are often quite soft and they often

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.480 
arms are often quite soft and they often
not<00:01:49.000> very<00:01:49.329> twisted<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.740> what<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:50.979> have<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.189> pay

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
not very twisted so what you have to pay

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.569 
not very twisted so what you have to pay
attention<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:52.299> is<00:01:52.600> not<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.259> split<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:53.799> which<00:01:54.429> is

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
attention to is not to split it which is

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:18.690 
attention to is not to split it which is
very<00:01:54.850> easy<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.549> is<00:02:15.670> how<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:15.940> track<00:02:16.329> in<00:02:16.540> it
