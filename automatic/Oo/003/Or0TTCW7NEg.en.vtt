00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
my previous fossil which I have no idea

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:37.719 
my previous fossil which I have no idea
what<00:05:31.930> plus<00:05:32.930> yeah<00:05:33.830> last<00:05:34.160> time<00:05:34.520> I<00:05:34.850> got<00:05:35.090> fifty<00:05:36.729> my

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
what plus yeah last time I got fifty my

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.180 
what plus yeah last time I got fifty my
t-rex<00:05:38.330> fossil<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.080> hopefully<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.650> has<00:05:39.889> not

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
t-rex fossil so hopefully that has not

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.830 
t-rex fossil so hopefully that has not
happened<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:42.050> my<00:05:42.500> new<00:05:43.010> team<00:05:43.460> so<00:05:43.910> probably

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
happened to my new team so probably

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.650 
happened to my new team so probably
because<00:05:45.110> it<00:05:45.440> was<00:05:45.500> um<00:05:45.979> I'm<00:05:46.850> gonna<00:05:46.970> save<00:05:47.300> just<00:05:47.510> in

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
because it was um I'm gonna save just in

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.460 
because it was um I'm gonna save just in
case<00:05:49.180> because<00:05:50.180> you<00:05:50.300> know<00:05:50.419> there<00:05:50.930> is<00:05:51.050> certain

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
case because you know there is certain

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.550 
case because you know there is certain
types<00:05:51.590> of<00:05:51.800> fossils<00:05:52.340> that<00:05:52.639> like<00:05:53.630> they<00:05:54.380> break

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
types of fossils that like they break

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.219 
types of fossils that like they break
really<00:05:54.950> easily<00:05:55.100> and<00:05:55.729> if<00:05:56.540> you<00:05:56.660> try<00:05:56.870> doing<00:05:57.080> a

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
really easily and if you try doing a

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.920 
really easily and if you try doing a
hammer<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:58.100> metal<00:05:58.570> obviously<00:05:59.570> it's<00:05:59.720> gonna

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
hammer and metal obviously it's gonna

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.800 
hammer and metal obviously it's gonna
break<00:06:00.200> so<00:06:01.160> anyway<00:06:01.550> next<00:06:01.790> time<00:06:01.940> we<00:06:02.300> are<00:06:02.450> going

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
break so anyway next time we are going

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.690 
break so anyway next time we are going
to<00:06:03.080> revive<00:06:03.440> some<00:06:03.770> of<00:06:03.860> these<00:06:03.950> fossils<00:06:04.520> and

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
to revive some of these fossils and

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.570 
to revive some of these fossils and
hopefully<00:06:05.150> we'll<00:06:05.300> get<00:06:05.479> good<00:06:05.840> results<00:06:06.580> until

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
hopefully we'll get good results until

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.970 
hopefully we'll get good results until
next<00:06:07.700> time
