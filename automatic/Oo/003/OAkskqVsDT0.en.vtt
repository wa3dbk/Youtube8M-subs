that's<00:05:09.140> we're<00:05:09.620> at<00:05:09.740> negative<00:05:10.130> 3<00:05:10.550> negative<00:05:10.580> 2<00:05:10.930> so

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
that's we're at negative 3 negative 2 so

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.280 
that's we're at negative 3 negative 2 so
that's<00:05:12.080> where<00:05:12.260> he<00:05:12.410> is<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:13.900> you<00:05:14.900> can<00:05:15.080> teleport

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
that's where he is and you can teleport

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.970 
that's where he is and you can teleport
to<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:15.650> place<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:18.080> here<00:05:18.260> we<00:05:18.380> go<00:05:18.470> this<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:18.830> the

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
to that place so here we go this is the

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.110 
to that place so here we go this is the
npc<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.790> that's<00:05:19.940> how<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.120> make<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.480> look<00:05:21.110> okay

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
npc and that's how you make it look okay

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.600 
npc and that's how you make it look okay
now<00:05:23.120> you<00:05:23.180> go<00:05:23.360> back<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.600> npc<00:05:24.230> on<00:05:24.710> object<00:05:25.520> window

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
now you go back to npc on object window

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.240 
now you go back to npc on object window
and<00:05:28.030> there<00:05:28.180> it<00:05:28.240> is<00:05:28.330> triple<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:29.199> named<00:05:29.830> original

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
and there it is triple a named original

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.740 
and there it is triple a named original
psycho<00:05:31.229> drag<00:05:32.229> it<00:05:32.439> you<00:05:33.220> drop<00:05:33.370> it

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.150 

where<00:05:37.320> is<00:05:37.410> he<00:05:37.560> there<00:05:38.520> he<00:05:38.640> is<00:05:38.940> why<00:05:39.480> is<00:05:39.540> he<00:05:39.750> naked

where is he there he is why is he naked

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.410 
where is he there he is why is he naked
he<00:05:41.160> will<00:05:41.370> probably<00:05:41.520> put<00:05:41.880> the<00:05:42.000> armor<00:05:42.270> on

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
he will probably put the armor on

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.280 
he will probably put the armor on
in-game<00:05:43.580> or<00:05:44.580> it's<00:05:44.760> too<00:05:44.910> heavy<00:05:45.090> for<00:05:45.150> him<00:05:45.450> he<00:05:46.140> has
