Yoshi's<00:00:08.069> circuit<00:00:09.410> the<00:00:10.410> racers<00:00:10.860> start<00:00:11.280> out

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
Yoshi's circuit the racers start out

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:20.320 
Yoshi's circuit the racers start out
here<00:00:12.530> and<00:00:13.530> then<00:00:13.889> they<00:00:14.070> pass<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.940> fireballs

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.089 

then<00:00:21.330> they<00:00:21.539> go<00:00:21.750> up<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:23.420> slant<00:00:24.420> here<00:00:25.550> down<00:00:26.550> here

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
then they go up a slant here down here

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
then they go up a slant here down here
turn<00:00:29.099> another<00:00:29.849> slim<00:00:30.300> down

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
turn another slim down

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.000 
turn another slim down
then<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.610> hit<00:00:32.730> switch<00:00:33.320> they<00:00:34.320> go<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.800> way

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
then they hit switch they go this way

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.069 
then they hit switch they go this way
and<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> fireballs<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:39.660> Goomba

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and go to the fireballs and the Goomba

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.299 
and go to the fireballs and the Goomba
and<00:00:40.520> then<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:41.790> went<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.510> way<00:00:42.750> good<00:00:43.710> then

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and then if they went this way good then

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.680 
and then if they went this way good then
we'll<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.700> straight<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
we'll just go straight and you think of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.360 
we'll just go straight and you think of
it<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> goombas<00:00:51.390> um

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
it and then and then here the goombas um

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.209 
it and then and then here the goombas um
we<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.579> move<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.030> goombas<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.010> like

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
we can move the goombas and we can like

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
we can move the goombas and we can like
and<00:00:56.550> they<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.000> must<00:00:57.270> fly<00:00:57.539> like<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:59.840> then

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and they they do must fly like that then

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.969 
and they they do must fly like that then
go<00:01:00.870> straight<00:01:01.289> turn<00:01:02.250> slant<00:01:03.290> turn<00:01:04.290> again<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
go straight turn slant turn again and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.090 
go straight turn slant turn again and
then<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> swamp<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:07.380> start<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
then there's a swamp and back start to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.580 
then there's a swamp and back start to
finish

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
finish

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.899 
finish
right<00:01:10.590> now<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.950> took<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.430> let<00:01:11.700> out

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
right now we just took this let out

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.520 
right now we just took this let out
because<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:13.070> 32<00:01:14.070> much<00:01:14.250> slants<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.530> they're

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
because I'm 32 much slants and they're

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.249 
because I'm 32 much slants and they're
running<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.040> battery<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.930> that's<00:01:18.930> why<00:01:19.110> we

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
running out of battery so that's why we

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.630 
running out of battery so that's why we
just<00:01:19.460> that's<00:01:20.460> why<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:22.640> two

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
just that's why we just want one two

00:01:23.640 --> 00:03:34.949 
just that's why we just want one two
slants<00:01:25.640> three<00:01:26.640> two<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:28.380> go

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.880 

now<00:03:35.959> we<00:03:36.020> took<00:03:36.500> out<00:03:36.709> this<00:03:37.220> slant<00:03:37.720> because<00:03:38.890> Mario

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
now we took out this slant because Mario

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.809 
now we took out this slant because Mario
and<00:03:40.069> his<00:03:40.100> bald<00:03:40.430> wing<00:03:40.700> can't<00:03:41.569> go<00:03:41.900> on<00:03:42.380> slant<00:03:42.830> and

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
and his bald wing can't go on slant and

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.210 
and his bald wing can't go on slant and
we<00:03:44.120> took<00:03:44.300> out<00:03:44.480> this<00:03:44.660> slant<00:03:44.959> because<00:03:45.470> also

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
we took out this slant because also

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.240 
we took out this slant because also
Mario<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.810> well-doing<00:03:48.260> can't<00:03:48.680> go<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.560> we're

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
Mario in well-doing can't go so we're

00:03:52.250 --> 00:05:21.919 
Mario in well-doing can't go so we're
gonna<00:03:52.340> continue<00:03:52.610> with<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.030> race

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:21.929 

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:24.600 

and<00:05:22.929> that<00:05:23.110> is<00:05:23.289> all<00:05:23.469> for<00:05:23.649> this<00:05:23.739> connects<00:05:24.129> custom

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
and that is all for this connects custom

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.909 
and that is all for this connects custom
