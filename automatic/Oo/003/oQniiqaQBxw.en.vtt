00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
realized that in a couple seconds I'll

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
realized that in a couple seconds I'll
be<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> 20<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> thousandth<00:00:38.250> person<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.090> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
be the 20 a thousandth person so it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.260 
be the 20 a thousandth person so it
doesn't<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:39.660> matter<00:00:39.930> no<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.980> doesn't<00:00:41.370> 43

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270

no<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:43.230> even<00:00:43.530> three<00:00:43.739> seconds<00:00:44.070> probably<00:00:44.670> one

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
no not even three seconds probably one

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.299

and<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.450> half<00:00:45.559> millisecond<00:00:46.559> you'll<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and a half millisecond you'll be the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.420 
and a half millisecond you'll be the
first<00:00:47.550> viewer<00:00:47.760> probably<00:00:48.420> less<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.920> suggest

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
