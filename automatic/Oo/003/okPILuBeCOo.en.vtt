gonna head and checking and I probably

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.800 
gonna head and checking and I probably
will<00:05:45.100> hack<00:05:45.310> off<00:05:45.520> more<00:05:45.850> like<00:05:46.210> I'm<00:05:46.360> doing<00:05:46.630> now

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
will hack off more like I'm doing now

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.230 
will hack off more like I'm doing now
because<00:05:47.560> this<00:05:47.830> I<00:05:48.100> mean<00:05:48.460> if<00:05:48.580> you<00:05:48.670> want<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.060> Bob

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
because this I mean if you want the Bob

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.760 
because this I mean if you want the Bob
that<00:05:49.480> you<00:05:49.600> want<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:50.080> probably<00:05:50.410> were<00:05:50.530> going<00:05:50.680> to

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
that you want you probably were going to

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.770 
that you want you probably were going to
be<00:05:50.830> doing<00:05:50.980> a<00:05:51.250> lot<00:05:51.280> of<00:05:51.580> chopping<00:05:52.090> of<00:05:52.420> the<00:05:52.540> hair

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
be doing a lot of chopping of the hair

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.600 
be doing a lot of chopping of the hair
especially<00:05:53.220> depends<00:05:54.220> on<00:05:54.280> what<00:05:54.400> kind<00:05:54.430> of

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
especially depends on what kind of

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.300 
especially depends on what kind of
looking<00:05:54.820> like<00:05:54.970> well<00:05:55.240> I'm<00:05:55.300> going<00:05:55.690> for<00:05:55.900> like<00:05:56.110> a

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
looking like well I'm going for like a

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.470 
looking like well I'm going for like a
fuller<00:05:57.310> look<00:05:57.580> on<00:05:57.760> one<00:05:57.910> side<00:05:58.150> than<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.420> other

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
fuller look on one side than the other

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.230 
fuller look on one side than the other
so<00:05:59.170> that's<00:05:59.470> why<00:05:59.650> I<00:05:59.680> chopped<00:06:00.100> off<00:06:00.280> a<00:06:00.490> lot<00:06:00.820> of<00:06:00.850> my

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
so that's why I chopped off a lot of my

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.450 
so that's why I chopped off a lot of my
hair<00:06:01.570> but<00:06:02.140> yeah<00:06:02.500> just<00:06:02.800> go<00:06:02.950> back<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.340> forth

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
hair but yeah just go back and forth

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.940 
hair but yeah just go back and forth
checking<00:06:03.730> with<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.030> mirror<00:06:04.390> and<00:06:04.540> then<00:06:05.260> I<00:06:05.590> I

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
checking with the mirror and then I I

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.950
