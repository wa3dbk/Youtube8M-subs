six pound line I said simply because

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.370 
six pound line I said simply because
there's<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.640> much<00:01:08.790> weed<00:01:09.090> lilies<00:01:10.049> and

loaded Drennen pellet wiggler this is
crystal<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.070> less<00:01:20.250> obtrusive<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.820> the

version<00:01:25.740> we've<00:01:25.830> got<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> minim<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.729> is

version we've got the minim and this is
just<00:01:27.060> purely<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.810> when<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> wind<00:01:28.380> gets

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
just purely because when the wind gets
up<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.430> bit<00:01:29.549> difficult<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.970> cast<00:01:30.180> and

up is a little bit difficult to cast and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.120 
up is a little bit difficult to cast and
you<00:01:30.960> need<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> bit<00:01:31.320> more<00:01:31.350> weight<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> amend<00:01:32.070> your

just held in place of two gripper stops
either<00:01:38.310> side<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.540> allow<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> change<00:01:40.200> the

either side to allow you to change the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.130 
either side to allow you to change the
depth<00:01:40.619> without<00:01:41.159> damaging<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> line<00:01:42.140> now

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
depth without damaging the line now

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
depth without damaging the line now
because<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.530> quite<00:01:43.710> weedy<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.399> use<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> strong

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
because it's quite weedy I use a strong

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
because it's quite weedy I use a strong
hook<00:01:45.630> length<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:46.950> a

hook length like this this so that's a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.580 
hook length like this this so that's a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
different ways of like to fish it now

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.190 
different ways of like to fish it now
I'm<00:02:05.880> probably<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.240> most<00:02:06.299> effective<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
I'm probably the most effective way the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 
I'm probably the most effective way the
most<00:02:07.320> visual<00:02:07.680> way<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.950> fishing<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
most visual way of fishing is with a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.790 
most visual way of fishing is with a
crust<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> surface<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:10.530> see<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
crust on the surface so you can see the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.580 
crust on the surface so you can see the
takes<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.000> they're<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> bit<00:02:12.390> wary

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
takes but if they're a bit wary

and<00:02:13.680> you're<00:02:14.040> trying<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.340> fool<00:02:14.550> maybe<00:02:14.879> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and you're trying to fool maybe the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.360 
and you're trying to fool maybe the
bigger<00:02:15.330> fish<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.780> show<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.980> want<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> put

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
bigger fish on the show you want to put

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.339 
bigger fish on the show you want to put
a<00:02:17.400> bit<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.610> flake<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.360> I'll<00:02:18.450> slowly<00:02:18.750> sink

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
a bit of flake on and I'll slowly sink

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.589 
a bit of flake on and I'll slowly sink
through<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.590> swim<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.069> we'll<00:02:21.000> hopefully<00:02:21.239> buy

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
through the swim and we'll hopefully buy

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.729 
through the swim and we'll hopefully buy
the<00:02:21.660> extra<00:02:22.110> bite<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:23.190> when<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.120> fish<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.420> corn

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
the extra bite now when I fish in corn

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.110 
the extra bite now when I fish in corn
rather<00:02:25.739> than<00:02:25.950> hook<00:02:26.099> in<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.280> single<00:02:26.670> grain<00:02:26.879> I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
rather than hook in a single grain I

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.420 
rather than hook in a single grain I
like<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.750> fish<00:02:27.989> two<00:02:28.530> grains<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.220> corn

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430

like to fish two grains of corn
back-to-back<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.900> find<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.200> sinks<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.650> lot

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
back-to-back and I find that sinks a lot

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.400 
back-to-back and I find that sinks a lot
slower<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.480> tends<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.660> bog<00:02:33.810> me<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> bigger

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
slower and tends to bog me the bigger
