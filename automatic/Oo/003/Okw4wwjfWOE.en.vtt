star pattern if you don't know is just

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
star pattern if you don't know is just
you<00:01:32.909> know<00:01:33.000> start<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.390> this.look<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:34.400> directly

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you know start at this.look go directly

across from it with a tin look you can

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.700 
across from it with a tin look you can
even<00:01:38.130> skip<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> lug<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:38.970> don't<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:40.380> so

and again this is just

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.370 
and again this is just
finger<00:02:00.130> tightening<00:02:00.579> part<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.829> I<00:02:02.860> got<00:02:03.130> my<00:02:04.380> my

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
finger tightening part so I got my my

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.789 
finger tightening part so I got my my
looks

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
looks

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.210

half<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> time<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:33.580> use<00:02:33.790> my<00:02:33.819> ear<00:02:34.120> half<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.049> time

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
half the time I use my ear half the time

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.660 
half the time I use my ear half the time
I<00:02:35.560> use<00:02:36.340> my<00:02:36.580> field<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.209> just<00:02:37.750> feel<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:39.130> see<00:02:39.519> what

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
I use my field I just feel and see what

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.880 
I use my field I just feel and see what
the<00:02:39.730> pressure<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.150> next<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.870> each<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.739> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
the pressure is next to each of the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.910 
the pressure is next to each of the
tension<00:02:42.220> rods<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:43.290> especially<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.620> if<00:02:44.769> I'm

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
tension rods and especially like if I'm

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.400 
tension rods and especially like if I'm
in<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.370> middle<00:02:45.519> of<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.790> set<00:02:46.030> playing<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.690> I

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
in the middle of a set playing and I

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.430 
in the middle of a set playing and I
can't<00:02:47.650> do<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.920> whole<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.989> trying<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.290> listen

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
can't do the whole and trying to listen

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.770 
can't do the whole and trying to listen
to<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.709> tune<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:52.000> I'll<00:02:52.120> definitely<00:02:52.329> just

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
to the tune then I'll definitely just

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.180 
to the tune then I'll definitely just
kind<00:02:53.079> of<00:02:54.069> nonchalantly<00:02:55.440> feel<00:02:56.440> around<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.010> I

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
kind of nonchalantly feel around and I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.460 
kind of nonchalantly feel around and I
can<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.940> tell<00:02:58.120> which<00:02:58.269> ones<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:59.349> know<00:02:59.440> a

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
can I can tell which ones are you know a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:33.880 
can I can tell which ones are you know a
little<00:02:59.709> bit<00:02:59.860> looser<00:03:00.220> than<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.299> others

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.900 

and<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.640> sounds<00:03:36.030> really<00:03:36.060> good<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.950> know

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
and that sounds really good but you know

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.430 
and that sounds really good but you know
I<00:03:38.940> don't<00:03:39.330> have<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.690> much<00:03:39.900> experience<00:03:40.110> with

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
I don't have that much experience with

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.220 
I don't have that much experience with
Evans<00:03:40.800> drumheads<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.460> know<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.930> Remo

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
Evans drumheads but I know that the Remo

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.550 
Evans drumheads but I know that the Remo
drumheads<00:03:43.530> they<00:03:44.010> actually<00:03:44.850> need<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.560> be

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
drumheads they actually need to be

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.640 
drumheads they actually need to be
stretched<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.160> little<00:03:47.400> bit<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:48.690> what<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
stretched a little bit so what I

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.400 
stretched a little bit so what I
normally<00:03:50.100> do<00:03:50.460> is<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:51.300> take<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.050> pump<00:03:52.290> my

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
normally do is I just take the pump my

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.290 
normally do is I just take the pump my
hand<00:03:52.620> put<00:03:52.890> kind<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.250> almost<00:03:53.400> my<00:03:53.730> full<00:03:54.030> body

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
hand put kind of almost my full body

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.790 
hand put kind of almost my full body
weight<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:55.200> there

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
weight in there

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.790 
weight in there
but<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.160> really<00:03:56.550> don't<00:03:56.670> think<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.000> Evans<00:03:57.360> ones

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
but I really don't think the Evans ones

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.870 
but I really don't think the Evans ones
need<00:03:58.800> that<00:03:59.070> little<00:03:59.820> stretching<00:04:00.680> so<00:04:01.730> cuz<00:04:02.730> that

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
need that little stretching so cuz that

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.880 
need that little stretching so cuz that
sounded<00:04:03.330> really<00:04:03.960> good<00:04:04.200> but<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.470> reason<00:04:04.770> I've

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
sounded really good but the reason I've

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.320 
sounded really good but the reason I've
stretched<00:04:05.160> my<00:04:05.400> Remo<00:04:06.300> drumheads<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.960> just<00:04:08.330> if

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
stretched my Remo drumheads is just if

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.030 
stretched my Remo drumheads is just if
you<00:04:09.510> don't<00:04:09.780> pre<00:04:10.140> stretch<00:04:10.440> them<00:04:10.680> it's<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:10.860> lot

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
you don't pre stretch them it's a lot

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.000 
you don't pre stretch them it's a lot
like<00:04:11.300> you<00:04:12.300> know<00:04:12.420> putting<00:04:12.720> new<00:04:13.350> guitar<00:04:13.680> strings

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
like you know putting new guitar strings

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.290 
like you know putting new guitar strings
on<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.250> guitar<00:04:14.280> if<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.880> don't<00:04:15.060> actually

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
on the guitar if you don't actually

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.170 
on the guitar if you don't actually
stretch<00:04:15.870> them<00:04:16.340> but<00:04:17.340> while<00:04:17.640> you're<00:04:17.880> tuning

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
stretch them but while you're tuning

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.940 
stretch them but while you're tuning
them<00:04:18.330> and<00:04:18.510> tuning<00:04:18.750> them<00:04:18.870> up<00:04:18.989> whenever<00:04:19.860> you

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
them and tuning them up whenever you

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
them and tuning them up whenever you
start<00:04:20.130> playing<00:04:20.400> them<00:04:20.520> they're<00:04:20.640> just<00:04:20.820> going<00:04:20.910> to

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
start playing them they're just going to

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.270 
start playing them they're just going to
all<00:04:21.180> go<00:04:21.420> out<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.660> tune<00:04:21.840> it's<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.830> same<00:04:23.040> thing

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
all go out of tune it's the same thing

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.800 
all go out of tune it's the same thing
drum<00:04:23.670> heads<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.060> want<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.510> want<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.690> get

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
drum heads you want to you want to get

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.410 
drum heads you want to you want to get
them<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.080> where<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:26.010> stretching<00:04:26.670> is<00:04:26.880> done

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
them to where the stretching is done

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.180 
them to where the stretching is done
whenever<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.170> play<00:04:28.410> on<00:04:28.560> them<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.830> they<00:04:28.950> stay

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
whenever you play on them so they stay

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.950 
whenever you play on them so they stay
in<00:04:29.220> tune<00:04:29.490> when<00:04:29.700> you<00:04:29.760> play<00:04:29.940> them<00:04:30.090> but<00:04:30.780> let's

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
in tune when you play them but let's

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:42.020 
in tune when you play them but let's
check<00:04:31.200> this<00:04:31.320> out<00:04:31.530> again

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.060 

and<00:04:43.030> I'm<00:04:43.240> just<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.720> do<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:43.960> really<00:04:44.080> fast<00:04:44.200> cuz<00:04:44.770> I

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
and I'm just I do it really fast cuz I

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:56.199 
and I'm just I do it really fast cuz I
like<00:04:45.760> what<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.000> hear<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:48.060> like<00:04:49.060> this

00:04:56.209 --> 00:05:07.759 

stairs<00:05:05.329> and<00:05:06.329> that's<00:05:06.509> a<00:05:06.689> great<00:05:06.899> sounding<00:05:07.559> snare

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:07.769 
stairs and that's a great sounding snare

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:10.699 
stairs and that's a great sounding snare

the beginning I'm used to Remo
ambassador<00:05:14.279> coded<00:05:14.729> but<00:05:15.449> this<00:05:15.599> is<00:05:15.809> an<00:05:16.049> Evans<00:05:16.469> HD

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:26.999 
the way I'm tuned this man there's

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.519 
the way I'm tuned this man there's
really<00:05:27.239> no<00:05:27.829> science<00:05:28.829> behind<00:05:29.369> it<00:05:29.579> to<00:05:29.969> me

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:30.529 
really no science behind it to me

really no science behind it to me
because<00:05:31.529> the<00:05:31.739> way<00:05:31.859> I'd<00:05:32.039> soon<00:05:32.309> and<00:05:32.729> what<00:05:33.509> I

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
because the way I'd soon and what I

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.719 
because the way I'd soon and what I
picked<00:05:33.839> up<00:05:34.019> kind<00:05:34.349> of<00:05:34.439> from<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:34.919> stand<00:05:35.489> more

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
picked up kind of from a stand more

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.719 
picked up kind of from a stand more
clinic<00:05:36.179> is<00:05:36.779> you<00:05:37.199> know<00:05:37.319> well<00:05:38.069> Stanton<00:05:38.459> more

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729

cranks<00:05:39.419> his<00:05:39.839> bottom<00:05:40.289> snare<00:05:40.739> derma<00:05:41.009> head<00:05:41.249> and

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
cranks his bottom snare derma head and

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.559 
cranks his bottom snare derma head and
the<00:05:42.299> reason<00:05:42.599> he<00:05:42.689> does<00:05:42.929> that<00:05:43.229> is<00:05:43.439> to<00:05:43.979> get<00:05:44.279> as

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
the reason he does that is to get as

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.649 
the reason he does that is to get as
much<00:05:45.569> snare<00:05:46.559> sensitivity<00:05:47.459> out<00:05:48.029> of<00:05:48.239> his<00:05:48.389> snare

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
much snare sensitivity out of his snare

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.149 
much snare sensitivity out of his snare
drum<00:05:49.279> at<00:05:50.279> any<00:05:50.819> you<00:05:51.569> know<00:05:51.689> volume<00:05:52.199> or<00:05:52.949> any

drum at any you know volume or any
tuning<00:05:53.719> range<00:05:54.949> so<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:56.549> know<00:05:56.669> I<00:05:56.729> kind<00:05:56.999> of<00:05:57.199> went

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
tuning range so you know I kind of went

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.589 
tuning range so you know I kind of went
with<00:05:58.289> that<00:05:58.469> idea<00:05:58.829> and<00:05:59.069> I<00:05:59.189> do<00:05:59.459> i<00:05:59.879> do<00:06:00.059> crank<00:06:00.419> it

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
with that idea and I do i do crank it

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.009 
with that idea and I do i do crank it
pretty<00:06:01.589> high<00:06:01.769> up<00:06:01.799> there<00:06:02.029> I<00:06:03.029> mean<00:06:03.569> it's<00:06:03.719> really

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:04.019 
pretty high up there I mean it's really

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:07.189 
pretty high up there I mean it's really
tight<00:06:04.409> and<00:06:05.389> they're<00:06:06.389> all<00:06:06.539> the<00:06:06.689> same<00:06:06.719> I<00:06:07.110> don't

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
tight and they're all the same I don't

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.669 
tight and they're all the same I don't
you<00:06:07.589> know<00:06:07.679> some<00:06:07.979> people<00:06:08.129> do<00:06:08.879> these<00:06:09.059> to<00:06:09.679> tighter

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:10.679 
you know some people do these to tighter

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:13.129 
you know some people do these to tighter
than<00:06:11.459> the<00:06:11.849> rest<00:06:12.029> of<00:06:12.209> them<00:06:12.329> to<00:06:12.719> give<00:06:12.929> them<00:06:13.110> the

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
than the rest of them to give them the

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.579 
than the rest of them to give them the
sensitivity<00:06:13.860> from<00:06:13.949> their<00:06:14.159> snare<00:06:14.569> but<00:06:15.569> yeah<00:06:16.529> I

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:16.589 
sensitivity from their snare but yeah I

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:19.039 
sensitivity from their snare but yeah I
just<00:06:16.709> cranked<00:06:17.159> them<00:06:17.309> all<00:06:17.429> up<00:06:17.809> really<00:06:18.809> tight

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:19.049 
just cranked them all up really tight

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:23.509 
just cranked them all up really tight
and<00:06:19.679> again<00:06:20.689> I'll<00:06:21.689> tap<00:06:22.019> tune<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:22.529> tune<00:06:23.369> them

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:23.519 
and again I'll tap tune and tune them

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:25.699 
and again I'll tap tune and tune them
all<00:06:23.610> up<00:06:23.729> to<00:06:23.849> the<00:06:23.939> same<00:06:24.149> pitch<00:06:24.389> and<00:06:24.659> really<00:06:25.499> you

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:25.709 
all up to the same pitch and really you

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:26.929 
all up to the same pitch and really you
just<00:06:25.829> got<00:06:26.069> a<00:06:26.099> you<00:06:26.459> know<00:06:26.579> you<00:06:26.639> got<00:06:26.849> to

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:26.939 
just got a you know you got to

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:28.519 
just got a you know you got to
experiment<00:06:27.509> but<00:06:27.659> that's<00:06:27.869> kind<00:06:28.169> of<00:06:28.229> how<00:06:28.349> I<00:06:28.379> do

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529 
experiment but that's kind of how I do

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.659 
experiment but that's kind of how I do
my<00:06:28.829> snare<00:06:29.279> snare<00:06:30.119> bottom<00:06:30.419> head<00:06:30.799> just<00:06:31.799> crank<00:06:32.519> it

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
my snare snare bottom head just crank it

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.679 
my snare snare bottom head just crank it
and<00:06:33.419> you<00:06:33.869> know<00:06:34.019> one<00:06:34.349> thing<00:06:34.589> to<00:06:34.679> keep<00:06:34.799> in<00:06:34.919> mind

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:35.689 
and you know one thing to keep in mind

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.179 
and you know one thing to keep in mind
you<00:06:36.689> know<00:06:36.809> most<00:06:37.109> people<00:06:37.379> know<00:06:37.529> this<00:06:37.709> but<00:06:37.769> there

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:38.189 
you know most people know this but there

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.509 
you know most people know this but there
are<00:06:38.219> some<00:06:38.369> drummers<00:06:38.969> that<00:06:38.999> will<00:06:39.359> try<00:06:39.599> to<00:06:39.629> put

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:40.519 
are some drummers that will try to put

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.889 
are some drummers that will try to put
you<00:06:41.519> know<00:06:41.549> a<00:06:41.639> snare<00:06:42.089> drum<00:06:42.119> head<00:06:42.509> on<00:06:42.659> here<00:06:42.869> that

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:42.899 
you know a snare drum head on here that

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:45.829 
you know a snare drum head on here that
doesn't<00:06:43.529> go<00:06:44.039> on<00:06:44.429> the<00:06:44.759> snare<00:06:45.179> side<00:06:45.389> of<00:06:45.599> snare

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:45.839 
doesn't go on the snare side of snare

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.899 
doesn't go on the snare side of snare
drum<00:06:45.989> so<00:06:46.259> they'll<00:06:46.619> end<00:06:46.769> up<00:06:46.859> putting<00:06:47.039> you<00:06:47.789> know

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.039 
drum so they'll end up putting you know
an<00:06:48.539> embassador<00:06:49.729> clear<00:06:50.729> which<00:06:51.509> is<00:06:51.539> made<00:06:51.839> for<00:06:51.989> a

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:52.049 
an embassador clear which is made for a

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:54.669 
an embassador clear which is made for a
Tom<00:06:52.399> instead<00:06:53.399> of<00:06:53.489> one<00:06:53.639> of<00:06:53.729> the<00:06:53.789> really<00:06:54.059> thin

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:54.679 
Tom instead of one of the really thin

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:56.479 
Tom instead of one of the really thin
snare<00:06:55.679> side<00:06:55.889> heads

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:56.489 
snare side heads

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:59.310 
snare side heads
so<00:06:57.209> yeah<00:06:57.509> the<00:06:57.689> way<00:06:58.079> you<00:06:58.109> can<00:06:58.319> tell<00:06:58.559> is

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
so yeah the way you can tell is

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.800 
so yeah the way you can tell is
if<00:06:59.980> they're<00:07:00.250> like<00:07:00.490> paper-thin<00:07:00.910> that's<00:07:01.600> for

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
if they're like paper-thin that's for

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.210 
if they're like paper-thin that's for
the<00:07:01.870> snare<00:07:02.080> side<00:07:02.320> and<00:07:03.190> if<00:07:03.940> they're<00:07:05.010> if<00:07:06.010> they're
