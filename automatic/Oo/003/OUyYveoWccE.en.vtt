this and I'll show you how it looks when
it's<00:02:01.049> done<00:02:01.140> okay<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.909> pit<00:02:03.540> guards<00:02:03.810> populated

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it's done okay the pit guards populated

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.760 
it's done okay the pit guards populated
and<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.939> wanted<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> discuss<00:02:06.649> kind<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and I just wanted to discuss kind of the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.940 
and I just wanted to discuss kind of the
options<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.250> went<00:02:08.399> through<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.950> three

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
options I went through so three

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.220 
options I went through so three
capacitors<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:11.670> I've<00:02:11.910> got<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> pointer<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
capacitors here I've got a pointer to to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.910 
capacitors here I've got a pointer to to
a<00:02:13.530> point

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
a point

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.420 
a point
a 3/3<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:15.090> pointer<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:15.690> seven<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.430> I've

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
a 3/3 and a pointer for seven and I've

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.220 
a 3/3 and a pointer for seven and I've
used<00:02:18.319> 250k<00:02:19.319> pots<00:02:19.730> now<00:02:20.730> typically<00:02:21.450> use<00:02:21.780> five

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
used 250k pots now typically use five

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.740 
used 250k pots now typically use five
new<00:02:22.410> care<00:02:22.620> parts<00:02:22.950> with<00:02:23.099> humbuckers<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:23.970> 250k

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
parts with single coils and typically

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.170 
parts with single coils and typically
use<00:02:28.700> 0.022<00:02:29.930> capacitors<00:02:30.930> with<00:02:31.080> humbuckers<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
use 0.022 capacitors with humbuckers and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.080 
use 0.022 capacitors with humbuckers and
0.04<00:02:33.180> seven<00:02:33.630> capacitors<00:02:34.560> with<00:02:34.800> single<00:02:35.760> coils

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
0.04 seven capacitors with single coils

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.860 
0.04 seven capacitors with single coils
so<00:02:36.959> what<00:02:37.350> we<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:39.860> 250k<00:02:40.860> pots<00:02:41.160> which<00:02:41.459> are

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
so what we have is 250k pots which are

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.050 
so what we have is 250k pots which are
not<00:02:42.870> as<00:02:43.080> bright<00:02:43.319> as<00:02:45.230> 500k<00:02:46.230> pots<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.940> we<00:02:47.940> are

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
not as bright as 500k pots and we are

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.750 
not as bright as 500k pots and we are
going<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.300> go<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.720> point<00:02:49.110> O<00:02:49.260> 3<00:02:49.650> 3<00:02:49.950> which<00:02:50.700> is

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
going to go for a point O 3 3 which is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.630 
going to go for a point O 3 3 which is
sort<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.239> happy<00:02:51.510> medium<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.220> see<00:02:53.220> if<00:02:53.340> we<00:02:53.459> get

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
sort of a happy medium and see if we get

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.509 
sort of a happy medium and see if we get
our<00:02:53.760> treble<00:02:54.000> balance<00:02:54.739> right<00:02:55.739> with<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.250> so

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
our treble balance right with that so

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.250 
our treble balance right with that so
I'm<00:02:56.610> going<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.790> stick<00:02:56.970> with<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.299> guy<00:02:57.480> take

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
I'm going to stick with that guy take

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.180 
I'm going to stick with that guy take
these<00:02:58.380> two<00:02:58.530> guys<00:02:58.680> away

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
these two guys away

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.820 
these two guys away
and<00:02:59.280> once<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.299> test<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.230> end<00:03:01.350> we'll<00:03:01.590> see

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
and once we test in the end we'll see

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.750 
and once we test in the end we'll see
just<00:03:02.069> how<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.980> sounds<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.100> if<00:03:05.220> it's<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
just how it sounds and if it's not to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.220 
just how it sounds and if it's not to
our<00:03:05.880> liking<00:03:05.910> we'll<00:03:06.420> do<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> bit<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.019> switch

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
our liking we'll do a bit of a switch

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.170 
our liking we'll do a bit of a switch
over<00:03:07.970> okay

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
over okay

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
triple bleed over there to make sure it

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.310 
triple bleed over there to make sure it
doesn't<00:03:24.060> get<00:03:24.150> muddy<00:03:24.420> as<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.720> roll<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.049> volume
