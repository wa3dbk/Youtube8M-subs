reminded<00:01:01.350> me<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.579> principle<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.390> thinking

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
reminded me of the principle of thinking

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.420 
reminded me of the principle of thinking
big<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.960> hear<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
big and so we hear that a lot you got to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.210 
big and so we hear that a lot you got to
think<00:01:08.580> big<00:01:08.720> but<00:01:09.720> very<00:01:10.320> few<00:01:10.650> times<00:01:10.979> do<00:01:11.189> people

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
think big but very few times do people

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.550 
think big but very few times do people
tell<00:01:11.729> us<00:01:11.909> why<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.780> important<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.409> that's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
tell us why that's important and that's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.950 
tell us why that's important and that's
what<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.710> wanted<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.130> share<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.610> today

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
what I wanted to share with you today

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.810 
what I wanted to share with you today
see<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.320> usually<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:16.890> big<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.549> we're

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
see we usually think big when we're

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
see we usually think big when we're
doing<00:01:18.180> some<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.020> New<00:01:19.200> Year's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320 
doing some kind of a New Year's
resolution<00:01:19.520> or<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.729> kind<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.060> vision

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
resolution or some kind of a vision

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
resolution or some kind of a vision
board<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.320> we're<00:01:22.500> immersed<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.920> some

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
board or you know we're immersed in some

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.850 
board or you know we're immersed in some
learning<00:01:23.610> experience<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.290> important

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
learning experience but it's important

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.410 
learning experience but it's important
to<00:01:25.920> think<00:01:26.340> big<00:01:26.850> every<00:01:27.810> day<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.400> think<00:01:29.430> big<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
to think big every day and I think big I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.010 
to think big every day and I think big I
actually<00:01:31.200> mean<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:32.130> beyond<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.869> about

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
actually mean think beyond so it's about

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.950 
actually mean think beyond so it's about
thinking<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.540> comes

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
thinking about what is it that comes

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.460 
thinking about what is it that comes
after<00:01:37.799> your<00:01:38.040> goal<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
after your goal what is it that you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.569 
after your goal what is it that you
become<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.939> create<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> do

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
become or that you create or that you do

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.490 
become or that you create or that you do
after<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.820> achieve<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
after you achieve or get what it is that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.649 
after you achieve or get what it is that
you're<00:01:46.619> burning<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> reason

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you're burning for now so the reason

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.230 
you're burning for now so the reason
that<00:01:48.689> that's<00:01:48.930> important<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:50.240> we're

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that that's important is because we're

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.530 
that that's important is because we're
we<00:01:51.540> attend<00:01:51.930> our<00:01:52.079> energy<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.340> where<00:01:54.329> energy

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
we attend our energy to is where energy

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.800 
we attend our energy to is where energy
flows<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.509> golf

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
flows to so think about it like a golf

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.770 
flows to so think about it like a golf
swing<00:01:57.899> if<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.979> our<00:01:59.310> club<00:01:59.909> lined<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
swing if we have our club lined up to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.859 
swing if we have our club lined up to
our<00:02:01.140> golf<00:02:01.560> ball<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.100> we're<00:02:02.850> focusing<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.810> that

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
our golf ball and we're focusing on that

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.969 
our golf ball and we're focusing on that
golf<00:02:04.590> ball<00:02:05.360> then<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:07.320> rarely<00:02:07.560> actually

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
golf ball then we very rarely actually

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
golf ball then we very rarely actually
hit<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> ball<00:02:08.879> where<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.720> want<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> go

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
hit the ball where we want it to go

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.010 
hit the ball where we want it to go
that's<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.760> energy<00:02:11.970> kind<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.629> stopped

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
that's because energy kind of stopped

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.410 
that's because energy kind of stopped
there<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.770> kind<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.160> stops<00:02:14.430> at<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> ball<00:02:14.910> yes

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
there it kind of stops at the ball yes

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.230 
there it kind of stops at the ball yes
the<00:02:15.630> ball<00:02:15.810> will<00:02:16.020> go<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.500> yes<00:02:16.890> energy<00:02:17.340> will<00:02:17.940> be

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
the ball will go and yes energy will be

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.100 
the ball will go and yes energy will be
you<00:02:19.200> know<00:02:19.230> directed<00:02:19.770> towards<00:02:20.160> our<00:02:20.280> goal<00:02:21.110> but

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
you know directed towards our goal but

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.400 
you know directed towards our goal but
if<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.800> can<00:02:23.040> direct<00:02:23.460> energy<00:02:23.840> beyond<00:02:24.840> our<00:02:25.170> goal

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
if we can direct energy beyond our goal

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.560 
if we can direct energy beyond our goal
as<00:02:25.740> if<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.550> know<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.820> golf<00:02:27.060> swing<00:02:27.120> when<00:02:27.450> we

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
as if you know in a golf swing when we

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.040 
as if you know in a golf swing when we
focus<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.140> our<00:02:28.400> follow-through<00:02:29.540> then<00:02:30.540> we're

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
focus on our follow-through then we're

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.740 
focus on our follow-through then we're
actually<00:02:31.200> hitting<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.100> ball<00:02:32.430> at<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.450> sort

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
actually hitting the ball at this sort

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.340 
actually hitting the ball at this sort
of<00:02:33.950> maximum<00:02:35.780> energetic<00:02:37.040> flux<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.110> that's<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
of maximum energetic flux and that's the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.290 
of maximum energetic flux and that's the
kind<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.620> energy<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.070> will<00:02:41.460> really<00:02:41.880> help

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
kind of energy that will really help

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.530 
kind of energy that will really help
bring<00:02:42.930> our<00:02:43.230> present<00:02:44.160> burning<00:02:44.820> desires<00:02:45.150> into

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
bring our present burning desires into

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.460 
bring our present burning desires into
fruition<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.170> lot<00:02:46.320> faster<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:48.240> your<00:02:49.230> homework

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
fruition a lot faster so your homework

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.500 
fruition a lot faster so your homework
really<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.400> take<00:02:50.610> your<00:02:50.790> current<00:02:51.060> burning

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
really is to take your current burning

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.090 
really is to take your current burning
desire<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:53.030> ask<00:02:54.030> yourself<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.170> question

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
desire and ask yourself the question

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.770 
desire and ask yourself the question
then<00:02:57.030> what<00:02:57.620> once<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.850> career<00:03:00.570> or

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
then what once I have this career or

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.570 
then what once I have this career or
once<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:02.160> know<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.610> Google<00:03:03.390> dollars

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
once I you know have a Google dollars

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.030 
once I you know have a Google dollars
then<00:03:05.580> what<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.830> once<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.460> then<00:03:08.790> what

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
then what and once I have the then what

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.700 
then what and once I have the then what
then<00:03:11.040> what<00:03:11.240> so<00:03:12.240> if<00:03:12.300> we<00:03:12.390> can<00:03:12.570> always<00:03:13.050> kind<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.410> be

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
then what so if we can always kind of be

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.610 
then what so if we can always kind of be
two<00:03:14.490> or<00:03:14.760> three<00:03:15.060> steps<00:03:15.360> ahead<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:16.080> our<00:03:16.200> current

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
two or three steps ahead of our current

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.310 
two or three steps ahead of our current
desire<00:03:16.980> then<00:03:17.610> energy<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.120> flowing<00:03:18.450> through

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
desire then energy is flowing through

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.220 
desire then energy is flowing through
our<00:03:19.350> current<00:03:19.950> desire<00:03:20.400> at<00:03:21.060> sort<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.570> maximum

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
our current desire at sort of a maximum

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.820 
our current desire at sort of a maximum
flux<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.950> starting<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.850> slow<00:03:24.209> down<00:03:24.830> towards

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
flux and starting to slow down towards

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.250 
flux and starting to slow down towards
where<00:03:26.430> we're<00:03:26.670> actually<00:03:27.570> directing<00:03:27.990> it<00:03:28.110> to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
where we're actually directing it to

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.810 
where we're actually directing it to
into<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.740> future<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:30.380> try<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.410> tip<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.250> you

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
into the future so try that tip if you

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.900 
into the future so try that tip if you
want<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.360> learn<00:03:33.510> more<00:03:33.870> about<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:35.160> system<00:03:35.430> to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
want to learn more about the system to

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.420 
want to learn more about the system to
co-create<00:03:36.150> your<00:03:36.630> desires<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:37.860> step-by-step

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
co-create your desires the step-by-step

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.210 
co-create your desires the step-by-step
process<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.480> takes<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.410> close<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:41.040> gap

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
process it takes to close the gap

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.010 
process it takes to close the gap
between<00:03:41.520> what<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.090> have<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.780> what<00:03:42.810> you

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
between what you have and what you

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.840 
between what you have and what you
desire<00:03:43.380> then<00:03:44.130> you're<00:03:44.310> not<00:03:44.400> going<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.640> want<00:03:44.790> to
