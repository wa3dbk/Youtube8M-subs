00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.879 

I'm<00:03:06.430> sure<00:03:06.639> we've<00:03:06.849> all<00:03:07.000> got<00:03:07.319> pen<00:03:08.319> laying<00:03:08.650> under

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
I'm sure we've all got pen laying under

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.849 
I'm sure we've all got pen laying under
our<00:03:08.919> seat<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:11.049> doesn't<00:03:11.349> need<00:03:11.469> to<00:03:11.530> be<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.650> pen

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
our seat it doesn't need to be a pen

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.020 
our seat it doesn't need to be a pen
just<00:03:12.010> needs<00:03:12.219> to<00:03:12.310> be<00:03:12.370> something<00:03:12.549> that<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.909> can

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
just needs to be something that you can

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:26.500 
just needs to be something that you can
make<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.510> holder<00:03:13.930> with

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.080 

in<00:03:27.510> doing<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.110> lock<00:03:28.379> like<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.909> this<00:03:29.909> is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
in doing this lock like this this is

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.080 
in doing this lock like this this is
going<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.390> be<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.860> more<00:03:31.860> permanent<00:03:32.370> fix<00:03:32.790> in

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
going to be a more permanent fix in

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.569 
going to be a more permanent fix in
place<00:03:33.689> of<00:03:33.989> lock<00:03:34.680> stitching<00:03:35.250> or<00:03:36.180> whipping<00:03:37.579> this

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
place of lock stitching or whipping this

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.410 
place of lock stitching or whipping this
prevents<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.150> from<00:03:39.209> coming<00:03:39.480> apart<00:03:39.659> at<00:03:40.590> all

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
prevents it from coming apart at all

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.369 
prevents it from coming apart at all
again<00:03:42.420> this<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.720> another<00:03:42.900> one<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.110> those<00:03:43.260> this

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
again this is another one of those this

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.449 
again this is another one of those this
is<00:03:43.560> where<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:43.860> want<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.069> make<00:03:44.159> sure<00:03:44.190> there's

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
is where you want to make sure there's

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.069 
is where you want to make sure there's
no<00:03:44.579> twists<00:03:44.849> in<00:03:45.000> your<00:03:45.120> line<00:03:45.269> as<00:03:45.690> you're<00:03:45.840> doing

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
no twists in your line as you're doing

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:56.690 
no twists in your line as you're doing
this<00:03:53.209> so<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.239> stuck<00:03:54.629> that<00:03:54.659> in<00:03:55.250> just<00:03:56.250> past<00:03:56.519> the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
this so you stuck that in just past the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.280 
this so you stuck that in just past the
lock<00:03:56.879> there<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.150> couple<00:03:57.390> strands<00:03:57.720> just<00:03:57.930> pass

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
lock there a couple strands just pass

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.190 
lock there a couple strands just pass
where<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> lock<00:03:58.799> ends<00:03:59.510> you<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.959> bury

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
where the lock ends you just go to bury

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.710 
where the lock ends you just go to bury
this<00:04:04.010> you're<00:04:05.010> gonna<00:04:05.129> bring<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.400> out<00:04:05.639> at<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.329> 28

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
this you're gonna bring it out at the 28

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.990 
this you're gonna bring it out at the 28
inch<00:04:06.959> mark<00:04:07.220> which<00:04:08.220> again<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.609> is<00:04:08.760> short

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
inch mark which again this is short

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.220 
inch mark which again this is short
difference<00:04:09.299> but<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.599> for<00:04:09.720> demonstration

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
difference but just for demonstration

difference but just for demonstration
demonstration<00:04:11.010> my<00:04:11.129> 28<00:04:11.489> inch<00:04:11.670> mark<00:04:11.879> is<00:04:12.030> right

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
demonstration my 28 inch mark is right

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.129 
demonstration my 28 inch mark is right
there<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.299> looks<00:04:18.479> like<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.750> caught<00:04:18.930> one<00:04:19.109> of

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
there and it looks like I caught one of

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.330 
there and it looks like I caught one of
the<00:04:19.260> strains<00:04:19.530> there<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:19.979> just<00:04:20.100> need<00:04:20.220> to

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
the strains there so you just need to

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.960 
the strains there so you just need to
pull<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.669> back<00:04:21.919> and<00:04:22.919> again<00:04:25.669> you'll<00:04:26.669> know<00:04:26.850> if

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
pull that back and again you'll know if

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.060 
pull that back and again you'll know if
you<00:04:27.060> catch<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.360> strand<00:04:27.630> because<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.080> won't<00:04:28.260> it

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
you catch a strand because it won't it

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.219 
you catch a strand because it won't it
won't<00:04:29.220> look<00:04:29.520> right<00:04:29.690> right<00:04:30.690> where<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:30.990> pulled

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
won't look right right where you pulled

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.680 
won't look right right where you pulled
the<00:04:31.349> Strand<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.919> then<00:04:35.849> bring<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.240> out<00:04:36.449> at

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
the Strand and then bring this out at
