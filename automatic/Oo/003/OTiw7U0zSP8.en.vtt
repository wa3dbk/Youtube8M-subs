00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.400
 to have this glass of water in my 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.959
 hands the liquid had to travel to the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.299
 less than 100 kilometers from birth 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:16.100
 in the Z치ra Z치ra p치ramo and go through the 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.100
 treatment plant francisco comes 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.439
 after traveling 40 kilometers from the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 paramo of chingaza for 6 hours the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.220
 Water arrives through tunnels to the plant 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.220
 of treatment and sneijder in the calera 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.770
 after the controversy unleashed after the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.540
 publication of a report that ensures 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.070
 that the water that Bogota's drinkers drink is not 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.660
 suitable for human consumption the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.520
 viewer of the task of following the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.330
 water treatment process for 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.330
 check its quality 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.730
 here the treatment process starts 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.710
 of water is added sulfate 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.989
 aluminum and a polymer to remove their 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.579
 impurities at this point the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.129
 water in a process that takes 20 minutes 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.140
 approximately the liquid inside the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.880
 filter by the top happens to 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.340
 Through this and leaves no 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.469
 sediment 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.479
 before leaving for the shelves of 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.429
 distribution of the city to grandpa him 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.799
 add chlorine in sufficient quantities 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:23.200
 to disclose its total disinfection the 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.200
 mixing can take 45 minutes 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.940
 In this laboratory, each 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.740
 two hours the quality of the water that arrives 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.230
 from the p치ramo and the treated water 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.240
 that leaves the plant with these equipment 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.470
 the turbidity is analyzed the ph and the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.870
 conductivity among others 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.460
 characteristics to the treated water will be 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.470
 they measure the same parameters and 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.390
 amount of chlorine that contains 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.670
 records have to be compatible with 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.380
 the normativity this laboratory is the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.510
 second filter of plant quality 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.280
 besides checking the characteristics 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.680
 physical-chemical aspects of both raw water 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.960
 as of the one once again treated 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.580
 the bacteriological part is revised to 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.190
 confirm that the water does not come out 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.670
 bacteria like the e coli or with reports 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.670
 totals 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.039
 x 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.600
 finally the viewer proved that the 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.730
 water that leaves the plant comes that 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.280
 consumes almost 70% of the population 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.150
 does not have impurities and does not represent 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.150
 risks to your health
