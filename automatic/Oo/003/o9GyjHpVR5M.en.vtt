so we'll have to wait for it to bump the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
so we'll have to wait for it to bump the
charging<00:02:05.850> voltage<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.360> we'll<00:02:06.840> turn<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
charging voltage up we'll turn the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.980 
charging voltage up we'll turn the

volts hot this alternator is relatively

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.630 
volts hot this alternator is relatively
cool<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.650> might<00:02:28.800> be<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.010> little<00:02:29.310> bit<00:02:29.459> higher

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
cool so it might be a little bit higher

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.900 
cool so it might be a little bit higher

diesel but as you can see the the
charging<00:03:15.360> voltage<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.900> increasing<00:03:16.910> then<00:03:17.910> take

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
charging voltage is increasing then take

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.479 
charging voltage is increasing then take
it<00:03:18.209> all<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.360> way<00:03:18.570> up<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:19.130> fifteen<00:03:20.130> point<00:03:20.430> three

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489
