that message and you know when the
angels<00:01:47.220> proclaimed<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.850> birth<00:01:48.060> its<00:01:48.360> glory<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
people on earth that's the message that

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.940 
people on earth that's the message that
this<00:01:53.700> child<00:01:53.939> brings<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
this child brings and I think we have to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859 
this child brings and I think we have to
reconnect<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.610> message<00:01:57.119> i<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
reconnect to that message i think that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.440 
reconnect to that message i think that
you<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.790> Afghanistan

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you know just now going to Afghanistan

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.690 
you know just now going to Afghanistan
Afghanistan<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.770> more<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.159> think

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
Afghanistan is going to be more I think

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
Afghanistan is going to be more I think
we<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.969> reclaim<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.659> radical<00:02:04.049> message

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
we have to reclaim the radical message

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.969 
we have to reclaim the radical message
of<00:02:04.409> Jesus<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:06.350> those<00:02:07.350> who<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.740> loved

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
of Jesus I think of those who have loved

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.089 
of Jesus I think of those who have loved
ones<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.840> Afghanistan<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:10.979> in

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099

control over those kinds of things and
we<00:05:38.410> have<00:05:38.530> control<00:05:38.890> of<00:05:38.920> our<00:05:39.190> behavior<00:05:39.670> and<00:05:39.700> our

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
we have control of our behavior and our

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.160 
we have control of our behavior and our
what<00:05:41.740> we<00:05:41.890> believe<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.640> I<00:05:43.210> put<00:05:43.780> my<00:05:43.810> faith<00:05:44.140> in

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170
