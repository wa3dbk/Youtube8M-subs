00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.760
 That you do your own thing every day. And people enjoy the work. 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.720
 That is the beauty of doing business. 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.760
 And when you see it grow and bloom. Then you may also be happy and grateful. 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.600
 We are now going to a mowing team. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.680
 Commissioned by the province of Overijsel to maintain the roadside. 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.040
 van der Weerd Grafhorst bv is a contractors and planting company ... 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.360
 ... started in 1969 and founded by Henk van der Weerd my father. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.920
 Good afternoon, boys. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.320
 Is it hot or not? 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.040
 In 1999 I left school. Then I also started at the company. 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.480
 I went through all facets of the company. To get a good view of the company. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.320
 How does the company work and how does it work? 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.200
 You have to be passionate about this. This is just super. 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.560
 There is nothing more beautiful than mowing. 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.480
 In 2004 I took over half of the company from my father. 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.640
 Then we made the decision to continue with the ground road and hydraulic engineering. 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.800
 We are now arriving at the country. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.280
 We are currently working on haymaking. And we can win beautiful hay with this weather. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.320
 That smells nice too. Do you smell it too? 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.040
 What I am most proud of is the people who work here, the team ... 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 ... and that you do it together. Nobody excepted. 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.640
 I have an apple here for the thirst, you need that today. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.480
 A little water or a bottle of coke. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.960
 Towards the customer, we want to be a flexible and easy contractor. 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.040
 If there is a problem that we are trying to resolve the next or self-defense day. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.600
 That everyone can be satisfied afterwards. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.120
 Everywhere I go they tell me, you look like your father presies. I like that pretty much. 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.160
 My father was a figurehead and an example. 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.280
 My father was a figurehead and an example. 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 This is my workplace. My father has always been here, all those years. 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.520
 And I hope that in a few years one of my daughters or son-in-law will be here. 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.520
 For a number of years I have been doing a lot together with the municipality of Kampen 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.120
 And we have bought a piece of land. 2 and a half hectares ahead. 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.600
 Hoping to set up a new office, new buildings, new workplace. That is the goal. 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.800
 I have now arrived here at the biomass. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.000
 Two years ago I came up with the idea of ​​making fuel from roadside cuttings. 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.360
 We find sustainability very important here, because we also care for our children ... 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 ... and for everything that still follows here. Try to maintain the earth well. 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.640
 Here you have the biomass. We do it here in the drying box where it is dried. 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.880
 You can feel the air that goes through it. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.800
 We are now the first installation in the Netherlands and even in Europe that runs like this. 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.160
 And we hope it will be a great success. It is something very special. 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.240
 I am the first to think of this. 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.880
 Worked after a busy day, and to process everything and think about it ... 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.560
 ... then I like to spend the evening on the land ... and then the cows come to you. 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.760
 First my wife and children, but this comes in second place. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.400
 Then you can think quietly. And the animals are satisfied. 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.480
 That does well. 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.960
 Continue the business in the spirit of my father. 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.520
 And I hope to do that for years to come.
