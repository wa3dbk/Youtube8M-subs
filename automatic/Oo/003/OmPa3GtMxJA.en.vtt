sadly<00:00:49.600> there's<00:00:50.350> many<00:00:50.739> children<00:00:51.250> around<00:00:51.520> the

sadly there's many children around the
world<00:00:52.079> whose<00:00:53.079> path<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.579> reaching<00:00:54.820> their<00:00:55.059> full

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
potential is blocked before they even

us about the problem that you're trying
to<00:01:04.449> solve<00:01:04.660> with<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.230> saving<00:01:05.590> brains

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
to solve with the saving brains

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.800 
to solve with the saving brains
initiative<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.210> saving<00:01:07.600> brains

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
initiative so the saving brains

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.899 
initiative so the saving brains
initiative<00:01:08.350> was<00:01:08.590> trying<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.159> address<00:01:09.490> the

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
initiative was trying to address the

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.670 
initiative was trying to address the
unfulfilled<00:01:10.360> potential<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.409> world's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
unfulfilled potential of the world's

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.370 
unfulfilled potential of the world's
children<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:13.119> global<00:01:13.450> community<00:01:13.869> has<00:01:13.900> been

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
children the global community has been

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.320 
children the global community has been
pretty<00:01:14.710> good<00:01:14.830> in<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.280> last<00:01:15.460> decade<00:01:16.060> of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
pretty good in the last decade of

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.050 
pretty good in the last decade of
reducing<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.619> death<00:01:17.829> of<00:01:18.100> childhood<00:01:18.820> deaths

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
reducing the death of childhood deaths

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.649 
reducing the death of childhood deaths
from<00:01:19.479> about<00:01:20.259> 12<00:01:20.560> million<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.400> under<00:01:21.909> 8<00:01:22.210> million

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
from about 12 million to under 8 million

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.929 
from about 12 million to under 8 million
and<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:23.530> we're<00:01:23.680> making<00:01:23.920> progress<00:01:24.400> on<00:01:24.729> that

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
and so we're making progress on that

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.609 
and so we're making progress on that
front<00:01:25.180> it's<00:01:25.390> still<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> massive<00:01:25.930> number<00:01:26.259> and

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
front it's still a massive number and

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.109 
front it's still a massive number and
there's<00:01:26.740> still<00:01:26.890> more<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.159> needs<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.790> be<00:01:27.850> done

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
there's still more that needs to be done

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.889 
there's still more that needs to be done
but<00:01:28.360> we're<00:01:28.540> getting<00:01:28.780> there<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.159> same<00:01:30.369> time

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
but we're getting there at the same time

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.179 
but we're getting there at the same time
what<00:01:31.899> happens<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.439> all<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.740> children<00:01:32.979> that

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
what happens to all the children that

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.840 
what happens to all the children that
actually<00:01:33.490> survive<00:01:35.070> past<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.399> age<00:01:36.579> of<00:01:36.790> five

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
actually survive past the age of five

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.050 
actually survive past the age of five
and<00:01:37.500> how<00:01:38.500> have<00:01:38.710> they<00:01:38.740> coped<00:01:39.189> with<00:01:39.460> all<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.850> the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
and how have they coped with all of the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.719 
and how have they coped with all of the
effects<00:01:40.689> of<00:01:40.899> poverty<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:42.070> get<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.490> point

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
effects of poverty to get to that point

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.560 
effects of poverty to get to that point
and<00:01:43.090> what<00:01:43.540> we<00:01:43.659> see<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.320> there's<00:01:44.560> actually

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
and what we see is that there's actually

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.569 
and what we see is that there's actually
a<00:01:46.570> none<00:01:47.140> fulfillment<00:01:48.009> of<00:01:48.189> their<00:01:48.340> cognitive

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
a none fulfillment of their cognitive

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.120 
a none fulfillment of their cognitive
potential<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.780> essentially<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.649> is<00:01:50.770> locking

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
potential and essentially it is locking

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.819 
potential and essentially it is locking
both<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.939> individual<00:01:52.630> children<00:01:52.899> as<00:01:53.290> well<00:01:53.799> as

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
both the individual children as well as

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.980 
both the individual children as well as
their<00:01:54.100> societies<00:01:54.759> in<00:01:54.969> their<00:01:55.090> countries<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:55.630> a

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
their societies in their countries in a

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.840 
their societies in their countries in a
perpetual<00:01:56.590> cycle<00:01:56.799> of<00:01:57.159> poverty<00:01:57.640> and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
perpetual cycle of poverty and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.450 
perpetual cycle of poverty and
underdevelopment<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:59.829> are<00:01:59.920> the<00:01:59.979> causes<00:02:00.189> of

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
underdevelopment what are the causes of

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.800 
underdevelopment what are the causes of
that<00:02:01.170> blocked<00:02:02.219> cognitive<00:02:03.219> potential<00:02:03.579> yeah<00:02:04.479> so

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
that blocked cognitive potential yeah so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.630 
that blocked cognitive potential yeah so
the<00:02:05.229> ones<00:02:05.469> that<00:02:05.740> are<00:02:05.890> out<00:02:05.920> there<00:02:06.369> at<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
the ones that are out there at the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.700 
the ones that are out there at the
moment<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.119> we<00:02:07.210> think<00:02:07.479> are<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:08.200> most

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
moment that we think are the most

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.800 
moment that we think are the most
important<00:02:09.340> would<00:02:09.610> be<00:02:09.640> malnutrition<00:02:10.540> and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
important would be malnutrition and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.110

initiative<00:03:59.560> well<00:04:00.560> it's<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.769> complex<00:04:01.129> problem

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
initiative well it's a complex problem

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.580 
initiative well it's a complex problem
so<00:04:02.180> we'd<00:04:02.359> like<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.569> take<00:04:02.780> an<00:04:03.079> integrated
