here<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.829> time<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.100> calibrate<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.520> probe<00:00:35.790> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
here it's time to calibrate a probe and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.420 
here it's time to calibrate a probe and
then<00:00:36.570> also<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> PHS<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> second<00:00:38.250> one

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
then also with the PHS to the second one

profile they're running when you see all
of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> graphs<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
of the graphs up here you can see the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
of the graphs up here you can see the
status<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.110> different<00:01:10.470> items<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
status of some different items so if you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.160 
status of some different items so if you
click<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> will<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.540> show

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
click on it what this will do is show

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.800 
click on it what this will do is show
the<00:01:13.380> status<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> certain<00:01:14.250> items<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.540> set

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the status of certain items you can set

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.980 
the status of certain items you can set
up<00:01:15.900> different<00:01:16.229> pages<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.790> can

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
up different pages so that you can

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.240 
up different pages so that you can
isolate<00:01:18.990> things<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.409> different<00:01:19.799> spaces

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
isolate things like different spaces

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.060 
isolate things like different spaces
almost<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> desktop<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:21.450> aquarium

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
almost like a desktop and your aquarium

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.380 
almost like a desktop and your aquarium
you<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.159> beat<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> status<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.119> palms

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you know beat the status of your palms

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.420 
you know beat the status of your palms
or<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.170> status<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.619> their<00:01:25.770> protein<00:01:26.189> skimmer

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
or the status of their protein skimmer

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.179 
or the status of their protein skimmer
so<00:01:26.970> we'll<00:01:27.090> load<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.689> different<00:01:28.590> graphs<00:01:28.799> for

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
so we'll load the different graphs for

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.710 
so we'll load the different graphs for
the<00:01:29.400> different<00:01:29.759> probes<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.540> have

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the different probes that you have

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.649 
the different probes that you have
connected<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.560> aquarium<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.329> this

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
connected to your aquarium so here this

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.789 
connected to your aquarium so here this
is<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.439> load<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
is actually going to load with the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.410 
is actually going to load with the
temperature<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.700> see<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> large

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
temperature is and you can see the large

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.870 
temperature is and you can see the large
swing<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.430> apex

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
swing that you have with an apex

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
swing that you have with an apex
temperature<00:01:39.270> probe<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.560> select<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.040> by

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
temperature probe you can select it by

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.399 
temperature probe you can select it by
one<00:01:41.430> day<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.329> look<00:01:42.570> back<00:01:42.750> over<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
one day or you can look back over the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.590 
one day or you can look back over the
previous<00:01:43.950> seven<00:01:44.520> days<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.420> click

on what the temperature
swing<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.000> obviously<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.599> go<00:02:09.720> back

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
swing is then obviously if you go back

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.839

a sunset configuration here is where you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.990 
a sunset configuration here is where you
can<00:02:39.629> set<00:02:39.930> up<00:02:40.049> though<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.829> displayed<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.310> the

you can also configure your outlets
different<00:02:47.670> modules<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:49.019> instance<00:02:49.109> if

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
different modules like for instance if

different modules like for instance if
fuss<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.129> have<00:02:50.340> vortec<00:02:50.760> pumps<00:02:51.090> on<00:02:51.180> this

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
fuss and so I have vortec pumps on this

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.349 
fuss and so I have vortec pumps on this
aquarium<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.470> could<00:02:52.650> use<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:52.859> w<00:02:53.250> XM<00:02:53.640> module<00:02:54.060> and

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
aquarium you could use a w XM module and

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.630 
aquarium you could use a w XM module and
you<00:02:54.780> can<00:02:54.959> set<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.620> up<00:02:55.680> remotely<00:02:56.099> or<00:02:56.340> even

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
you can set that up remotely or even

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.660 
you can set that up remotely or even
update<00:02:57.120> firmware<00:02:58.010> XML<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.340> shows<00:02:59.640> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
update firmware XML here shows the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.990 
update firmware XML here shows the
different<00:03:00.180> RSS<00:03:00.690> feeds<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:02.000> controller

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
different RSS feeds of the controller

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.170 
different RSS feeds of the controller
and<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.680> see<00:03:04.859> that<00:03:05.099> recently<00:03:06.060> we

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
and so here you can see that recently we

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.569 
and so here you can see that recently we
had<00:03:06.359> a<00:03:06.390> power<00:03:06.599> outage<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.440> it'll<00:03:08.280> tell<00:03:08.459> you

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
had a power outage and it'll tell you

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.220 
had a power outage and it'll tell you
the<00:03:08.700> time<00:03:08.909> in<00:03:09.120> which<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.299> occurred<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.109> then

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
the time in which it occurred and then

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.530 
the time in which it occurred and then
when<00:03:10.379> power<00:03:10.590> was<00:03:10.890> restored<00:03:11.150> here<00:03:12.150> it'll<00:03:12.299> also

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
when power was restored here it'll also

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.479 
when power was restored here it'll also
show<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.930> what<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> temperature<00:03:13.950> probe<00:03:14.220> was

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
show you what the temperature probe was

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.220 
show you what the temperature probe was
pH<00:03:15.389> pH<00:03:15.959> 2<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.709> then<00:03:16.859> also<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.400> amperage<00:03:17.819> draw

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
pH pH 2 and then also the amperage draw

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.170 
pH pH 2 and then also the amperage draw
so<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.829> first<00:03:20.430> edition<00:03:20.910> will<00:03:21.060> go

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
so this is the first edition will go

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.819 
so this is the first edition will go
into<00:03:21.329> things<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.720> little<00:03:21.750> bit<00:03:22.049> more<00:03:22.410> detail

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
into things a little bit more detail

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.860
