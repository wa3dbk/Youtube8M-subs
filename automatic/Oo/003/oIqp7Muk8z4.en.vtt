00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
get in some action here the frame rate

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.979 
get in some action here the frame rate
does<00:00:51.469> seem<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:51.920> bounce<00:00:52.190> around<00:00:52.370> 30<00:00:52.850> on<00:00:53.659> this

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
does seem to bounce around 30 on this

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:23.550 
does seem to bounce around 30 on this
setting<00:00:54.469> when<00:00:55.280> you're<00:00:55.429> in<00:00:55.519> action

so as you can see the graphics do stay
around<00:01:25.630> 30<00:01:25.990> frames<00:01:26.259> per<00:01:26.409> second<00:01:26.920> or<00:01:28.320> higher<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
around 30 frames per second or higher so

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:43.960 
around 30 frames per second or higher so
you<00:01:31.390> get<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.540> smooth<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.960> can<00:01:32.409> replace

the<00:04:44.849> lowest<00:04:45.120> graphical<00:04:46.050> setting<00:04:46.409> we<00:04:47.159> crank<00:04:47.699> it

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
the lowest graphical setting we crank it

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:57.410 
the lowest graphical setting we crank it
up<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.000> let's<00:04:48.810> say<00:04:48.930> medium

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
you can see drops on significantly which

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.190 
you can see drops on significantly which
is<00:05:01.290> kind<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.650> weird<00:05:01.860> but<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:03.180> does<00:05:03.510> that<00:05:03.780> for

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
is kind of weird but it does that for

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.350 
is kind of weird but it does that for
some<00:05:04.380> reason<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:08.130> seems<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.550> run<00:05:08.730> out<00:05:08.790> really

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
some reason it seems to run out really

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.110 
some reason it seems to run out really
smooth<00:05:09.660> at<00:05:10.290> around<00:05:10.440> 40<00:05:10.740> frames<00:05:10.950> per<00:05:11.190> second<00:05:11.550> as

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
smooth at around 40 frames per second as

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.750 
smooth at around 40 frames per second as
far<00:05:12.330> as<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.540> see<00:05:12.750> because<00:05:12.990> at<00:05:13.470> around<00:05:14.010> 30<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
far as I see because at around 30 the

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.690 
far as I see because at around 30 the
game<00:05:14.940> feels<00:05:15.270> slow<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.840> leggy<00:05:16.370> but<00:05:17.370> we'll<00:05:17.550> put

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
game feels slow and leggy but we'll put

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.700 
game feels slow and leggy but we'll put
it<00:05:17.820> down<00:05:17.940> on<00:05:17.970> low<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.330> going<00:05:18.960> engage<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:19.530> some

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
it down on low and going engage in some

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.830 
it down on low and going engage in some
action<00:05:20.160> so<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.580> can<00:05:20.730> see<00:05:20.970> if<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.390> frame<00:05:21.630> rate

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
action so you can see if the frame rate

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:32.330 
action so you can see if the frame rate
dips<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:22.620> little<00:05:22.860> bit<00:05:22.980> which<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.120> probably<00:05:24.360> will

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.670 

so<00:05:32.910> we'll<00:05:33.120> go<00:05:33.240> ahead<00:05:33.360> here<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.080> try<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.320> get<00:05:34.560> in

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
so we'll go ahead here and try to get in

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:51.270 
so we'll go ahead here and try to get in
some<00:05:34.889> action

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.620 

and<00:05:52.280> you<00:05:52.370> can<00:05:52.520> see<00:05:52.670> the<00:05:52.700> framerate<00:05:53.030> pretty

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
and you can see the framerate pretty

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.240 
and you can see the framerate pretty
much<00:05:53.780> stay<00:05:53.990> solid<00:05:54.350> around<00:05:54.890> 50

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:11.250 

which<00:06:02.250> is<00:06:02.370> kind<00:06:02.550> of<00:06:02.640> nice

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.910 

so<00:06:11.830> this<00:06:11.950> game<00:06:12.130> completely<00:06:12.580> analogous<00:06:13.180> the

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
so this game completely analogous the

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.630 
so this game completely analogous the
this<00:06:14.920> game<00:06:15.130> on<00:06:15.340> low<00:06:15.850> settings<00:06:20.370> so<00:06:21.370> thanks<00:06:21.580> for

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
this game on low settings so thanks for

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.100 
this game on low settings so thanks for
watching<00:06:22.000> this<00:06:22.090> has<00:06:22.300> been<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:22.510> demonstration

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
watching this has been a demonstration

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.770 
watching this has been a demonstration
of<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.440> alienware<00:06:23.890> m11x<00:06:24.270> benchmarking<00:06:25.270> tests

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
of the alienware m11x benchmarking tests

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.760 
of the alienware m11x benchmarking tests
and<00:06:26.070> all<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:27.280> games<00:06:27.550> seem<00:06:27.820> to<00:06:27.970> run<00:06:28.680> very<00:06:29.680> well

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
and all the games seem to run very well

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.260 
and all the games seem to run very well
on<00:06:30.400> this<00:06:30.640> tiny<00:06:31.530> laptop<00:06:32.530> I<00:06:32.800> barely<00:06:33.730> even<00:06:33.880> call

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
on this tiny laptop I barely even call

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.790 
on this tiny laptop I barely even call
it<00:06:34.300> a<00:06:34.450> notebook<00:06:34.660> just<00:06:35.200> because<00:06:35.590> the

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
it a notebook just because the

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.630 
it a notebook just because the
performance<00:06:36.400> system<00:06:36.730> kicks<00:06:36.970> out<00:06:38.250> I'm<00:06:39.250> liking

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
performance system kicks out I'm liking

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.350 
performance system kicks out I'm liking
it<00:06:39.790> very<00:06:39.850> much<00:06:40.210> and<00:06:40.800> it<00:06:41.800> is<00:06:41.950> actually<00:06:42.180> done<00:06:43.180> me

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
it very much and it is actually done me
