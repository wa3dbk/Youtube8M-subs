00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.110
 the zte skate or this phone that is 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.400
 a card is the core of the system 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.350
 operative 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.030
 with a card the improved what we can 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.330
 get is higher performance 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.040
 about the phone that lasts us 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.130
 things 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.090
 shopping chapter by china I have 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.909

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.060

 I asked along so good because we will 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.280
 take a look as you can see all the 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.009
 covers are removed I'll explain a 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.900
 little story just when I was 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.570
 making the first attempt of the video 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.240
 I went to cut the top and as such 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.430
 I was cutting what he has done like that and almost 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 I shot the camera to the ground then so as not to 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.390
 judging bad I prefer to do it better so 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.080
 so we're not going to do anything 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.480
 good 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.160
 we discovered here a couple of things do not 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.060
 he knows it's good so let's go 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.930
 talking a little about them 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.930
 first of all 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.069
 a case for a samsung galaxy not out 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.849
 vale var 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.849
 for my friend 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.570
 good 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.570
 it's fine it's cool 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.810
 I like it 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.379
 well we put it in the box and they are 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.860
 things that are for then not only 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.840
 I'm going to give them a package, we take a look 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.530
 previous and then already then again again 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.530
 to the box 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.570
 well then I'll close it here 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.010
 we have a microusb cable which 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.810
 all these things that I will be teaching 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.900
 I'm going to leave the links below 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.750
 then here we have an HDMI cable for a 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.640
 sony ericsson xperia neo v goes from hdmi to 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.280
 mini hdmi or we can connect the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.440
 xperia neo v on TV or any 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.810
 phone that has that entry very 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.150
 well a very cheap price a euro 50 or 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.069
 so it seems to me that it cost the truth that 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.170
 very well then here we have a few 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.020
 headphones for iphone are not for me 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.800
 they are for the one with the ipod touch 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.200
 and good 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.480
 I do not know if it can be appreciated very well but 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.520
 It is very well finished, that is, they are like 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.160
 from the original iphone is fine 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.560
 finished yes sir it seems a bit 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.800
 I miss that the box comes like this 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.810
 let's say for the by joining but good 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.810
 assembled we already have it 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.940
 I like I like to buy things from China 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.240
 you already know 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.030
 It is one of the things that characterize 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.520
 the people who buy things from girls 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.740
 things like that then here we have a thing of 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.660
 which I'm happy to have bought 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.150
 it is a back part of the iphone 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.500
 transparent as on the iphone has been 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.650
 quite criticized I will not talk much 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.659
 about it 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.849
 then we have a skin for the iphone 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.409
 which I will not talk much and then 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.220
 here we have a little thing that does not look very 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:22.660
 well that is the diffuser or dispenser of 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.070
 flash of the iphone that the cases 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.259
 pirates or carcasses that we are buying 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.050
 Well, they do not wear it, so you have to 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.400
 buy it separately and we paste it and 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.169
 we get the flash to disperse 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.689
 how do you play 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.249
 and then you want or not of what yes that 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:42.459
 I'm going to talk about this case 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:45.260
 what is the spectral shell for iphone 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:48.680
 4 or 4 times 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.000
 normally it usually costs about 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.170
 around 920 euros on the page for 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.420
 change you find it for two euros 65 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.720
 I suppose it will be original of course what 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.720
 It seems 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.920
 passing a bit of the subject 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:14.880
 here we have a micro usb charger for 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:19.320
 the car useful things useful things 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.690
 another charger for a Nokia in this case 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.460
 the in 70 puts but good is rather 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.770
 universal as the one who says and this is 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.310
 the jewel in the crown what made it 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.169
 that made the package weigh so much 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.240
 it's a sheath 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.889
 for 10-inch tablets in this case 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.889
 for the galaxy tab that good 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.300
 I ordered two because it has two tablets 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.389
 they are not the galaxy is far from 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.909
 but but in theory they are going to serve a lot 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.200
 That's what he told me, we'll see, he's already 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.360
 in theory 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.940
 it's your responsibility that comes here 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.970
 with a cablecito and everything is very well a 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.500
 nice finish a silicone keyboard does not 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.990
 is a hard keyboard is keyboard 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.680
 silicone very well a few finishes 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.200
 good skin 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.270
 Y 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.830
 and the truth that pretty well done 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.130
 so good the goal again in the 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.130
 box 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.760
 there we are now 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:23.550
 and then goodbye as last 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.770
 we have here a card adapter 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.500
 which is also for him 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.960
 finally one thing that I am 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.270
 sending lately when I ask for things 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.610
 so pretty large orders send me 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.460
 a kind of catalog of things that 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.039
 they have there on the page 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.319
 when I asked for quite large order 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.360
 they give you the opportunity to catch it 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.990
 I took it well because of curiosity 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.910
 namely he is bringing already caught once 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.880
 I was cool and I said it's a second 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.190
 so nothing if you liked it again 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.919
 another chapter of shopping by china 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.370
 why not keep watching our channel to 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.949
 despite the disorder 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.740
 I have not said it but we have the 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:08.680
 partner with an english company 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.210
 full screen that good we'll see what 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.699
 conditions gives us as you can see the 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.699
 banner is changed since everything works 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:17.440
 perfection so nothing guys if 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:19.540

 is that this case is well chingón 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.960
