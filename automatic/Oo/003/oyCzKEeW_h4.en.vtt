 sorry the forced exit works the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.200
 handset 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:44.450
 you were in the animus animus it sounds 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.660
 you were in to access a memory 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.890
 of helix with the name of shake corman 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.060
 you work for abstergo entertainment 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.230
 ok, it sounds like something I'm telling you 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.680
 during your session something happened that is 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.440
 affecting the entire building 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.550
 let's find your boss you will not have 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.500
 forgotten about her 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.920
 melanie lemay a winner very very 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.920
 cheerful 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.140
 take your communicator do not hesitate to use 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.140
 radio now let's get out of here 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.500
 follow me hurry up 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.310
 in case you had any doubt to this chaos what 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 have you provoked 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.860
 because security everything will turn out well 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.860
 it's positive 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.840
 but what the hell is a file going on 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.729
 called shake shape that hid a 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.560
 kind of virus your job is to avoid 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.439
 that this happens we must contain those 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.179
 memories and we could destroy them not 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.700
 sign error that does not work are 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.729
 memories but sorry lady of 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.429
 mails inside is not a request since it has 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.979
 heard worth I need that package you 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.689
 it seems fine to the e-mail or the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.520
 this may seem strange but 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.049
 will work is for people who 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.539
 we hire to improve our 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.520
 security Mr. Soler and Miss 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.979
 for me it's costing me call me values 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.590
 and see how everyone is doing and prepare a 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.000
 press release to everything they tell you 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.000
 okay, let's go 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.859
 technically you are not responsible 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.569
 of this but you are the one who released the virus 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.239
 so it's only fair that you help me 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.069
 clean it see says we receive the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.950
 genetic memories of yale for it 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.420
 we must access from the ics the ix 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.349
 is dropped you have to restart the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.349
 basement servers 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.840
 God who designed this virus is a 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:37.180
 genius not only restricts us access to 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.829
 the cloud but it adapts to load 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.720
 the operating systems that regulate the 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.940
 building 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.100
 Meilan and the elevators do not work 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.980
 we're trapped 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.840
 I do not know if I'll have them repaired as soon as 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.590
 possible there is a functional server in 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.900
 this floor will have to be worth it for now 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.670
 the people of the coast have reports of 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.879
 the advances made with the memories 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.670
 of 6 because that I know is a nobody 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.790
 anyone if it is reported that it is Kim I 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.590
 I suspect that this situation is then 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.930
 will offer us an unexpected reward 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.930
 scream the server area of â€‹â€‹this floor 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.360
 it's a wireless signal that flashes 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.280
 great now you can access the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.030
 systems come to connect me with your 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.620
 image 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.510
 when restorer is the server 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.430
 will connect choose your animus station 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.960
 in theory it will solve the problem towards 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.550
 videos you do with the segments of the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.620
 core now is when the thing gets 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.120
 you'll have to move the circles 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.400
 so that each segment is 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.580
 aligned by a the keyword is 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.110
 each one only for each segment of the 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.850
 Core is worth when everything is fine 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.080
 lit the system will restart 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.080
 then the test 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.150
 with good work this nucleus was not very 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.880
 complicated but there is still a lot 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.880
 do to restart the hardware of the 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.880
 man 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.610
 the murderers would try to make you believe 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.339
 that the mualimin was a great mentor 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.259
 corrupted by the greed that conspired 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.819
 with the Templars to obtain a fruit 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.919
 of Eden 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.649
 I think I was a leader 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.949
 astute and calculating a man who used to 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:37.749
 your best altair and bendahan killer for 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.179
 eliminate the conspirators in order 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:42.950
 to stay himself with the fruit and 

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:45.830
 use it to bring world peace 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.020
 although it is clear that the moalim was not 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.210
 a Templar I find interesting 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.830
 emphasize that his vision of peace was 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.070
 more in the line of philosophy 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.170
 templar than in the murderers in 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.230
 the past both sides chased the 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:03.170
 same objective peace the difference was 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.500
 the way we decided to get it if 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.420
 Altair would not have killed the Mualem 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.780
 preventing him from carrying out his plan maybe 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.490
 today we would already be faced not 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.410
 it was until high and reformed the 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.840
 brotherhood with his new ideals of 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.690
 free will when the conflict is 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.560
 intensified and spread throughout the 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.720
 world certainly if the wise call of 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.810
 the mountain can see things from 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.250
 our point of view the same can be 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.250
 say of the murderers 

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:44.539
 Okay, I do not know if you should have seen 

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:47.419
 this 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:49.689
 you should return the spirit 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.819
 come 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:53.799
 in theory when the servers are 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.929
 assets you can restore the seasons 

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:57.909
 of your colleagues' work only if 

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:59.889
 you want to help them clear today if 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.769
 you want to be stealthy could you 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.769
 until finding more the little gifts 

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:04.769
 digital 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.920
 hey one of your classmates I leave you the 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.690
 communicator next to the elevator they serve 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.490
 devices thrown out there do not hesitate in 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.590
 catch them we may find some 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.630
 track 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.180
 now that we have unlocked the 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:23.020
 memories of 6 crowns we can make a 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.020
 great discovery 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.240
 I know you have questions about your new 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.430
 mission and about me for now all when 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.000
 I'll tell you that the story of if it contains 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.840
 all the answers if it was funny a 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.840
 great understanding
