00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
it was because I thought I turned in a

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:12.170 
it was because I thought I turned in a
paper<00:04:06.650> but<00:04:07.819> apparently<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:08.849> didn't<00:04:09.379> so<00:04:10.760> um<00:04:11.760> it

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
was done but I just didn't get turned in

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.640 
was done but I just didn't get turned in
and<00:04:14.790> because<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.569> that<00:04:15.659> paper<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.229> got<00:04:16.380> an<00:04:16.440> F<00:04:16.590> in

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
and because of that paper I got an F in

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.729 
and because of that paper I got an F in
that<00:04:16.859> class<00:04:17.099> which<00:04:17.519> was<00:04:17.549> X<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.659> my<00:04:19.139> math<00:04:19.380> is

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that class which was X and my math is

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.159 
that class which was X and my math is
because<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.639> didn't<00:04:21.060> get<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.269> help<00:04:21.449> that<00:04:21.720> I

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
because I didn't get the help that I

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.060 
because I didn't get the help that I
needed<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:24.050> have<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.169> retake<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.650> but<00:04:25.889> the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
needed so I have to retake that but the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.790 
needed so I have to retake that but the
part<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.639> about<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.800> obviously

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
part of you is about is like obviously

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.629 
part of you is about is like obviously
if<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.520> don't<00:04:29.900> if<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:30.960> fail<00:04:31.289> a<00:04:31.320> class<00:04:31.680> most

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
if you don't if you fail a class most

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.710 
if you don't if you fail a class most
likely<00:04:32.909> it's<00:04:33.150> because<00:04:33.270> you<00:04:33.539> didn't

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
likely it's because you didn't

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.320 
likely it's because you didn't
understand<00:04:34.289> it<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:35.190> why<00:04:35.340> would<00:04:35.550> they<00:04:35.669> why

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
understand it so why would they why

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.710 
understand it so why would they why
would<00:04:36.570> they<00:04:36.659> push<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.470> next<00:04:37.830> class

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
would they push you on to the next class

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
would they push you on to the next class

which is where you need to know the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.870 
which is where you need to know the
information<00:04:40.889> you<00:04:41.460> learned<00:04:41.669> in<00:04:41.789> the<00:04:41.849> first

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
information you learned in the first

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.450 
information you learned in the first
class<00:04:42.590> which<00:04:43.590> always<00:04:43.770> safe<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.099> feel<00:04:44.250> that

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
class which always safe you feel that

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.850 
class which always safe you feel that

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.640 
why would they push you to the next
class<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.539> then<00:04:48.630> have<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:49.050> retake<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.440> first
