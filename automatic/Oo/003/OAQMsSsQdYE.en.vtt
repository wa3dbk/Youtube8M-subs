00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.430 
like to wear cat eyes to school with
just<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.800> liquid<00:01:53.400> black<00:01:53.580> eyeliner<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.690> this<00:01:55.200> is

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
just a liquid black eyeliner but this is

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.560 
just a liquid black eyeliner but this is
much<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.770> forgiving<00:01:56.490> than<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.820> black<00:01:57.210> liner

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
much more forgiving than a black liner

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.960 
much more forgiving than a black liner
because<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:59.100> those<00:01:59.220> early<00:01:59.610> mornings

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
because I know on those early mornings

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.580 
because I know on those early mornings
where<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.210> decide<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.690> do<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> cat<00:02:01.170> eye<00:02:01.200> for

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
where you decide to do a cat eye for

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.499 
where you decide to do a cat eye for
whatever<00:02:01.890> reason<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.670> screw<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.210> it's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
whatever reason and you screw it up it's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.300 
whatever reason and you screw it up it's
actually<00:02:04.080> one<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.440> worst<00:02:04.710> feelings<00:02:05.159> in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
actually one of the worst feelings in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.160 
actually one of the worst feelings in
the<00:02:05.759> entire<00:02:06.000> world<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:06.720> something<00:02:07.020> like

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the entire world but with something like

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
the entire world but with something like
this<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.100> make<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> tiny<00:02:08.670> mistake<00:02:09.119> it's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
this if you do make a tiny mistake it's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.150 
this if you do make a tiny mistake it's
extremely<00:02:09.959> forgiving<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.830> won't<00:02:11.009> really

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
extremely forgiving and you won't really

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
extremely forgiving and you won't really
be<00:02:11.250> able<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.580> notice<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.180> then<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> just
