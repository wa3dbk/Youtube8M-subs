wait<00:04:03.549> for<00:04:03.700> your<00:04:03.790> device<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.239> finish<00:04:04.540> booting

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
wait for your device to finish booting

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.449 
wait for your device to finish booting
up<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.049> will<00:04:05.200> appear<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.530> be<00:04:05.709> boot<00:04:06.040> looping

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
up it will appear to be boot looping

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.550 
up it will appear to be boot looping
just<00:04:06.670> wait<00:04:06.940> you<00:04:07.660> can<00:04:07.780> take<00:04:07.959> five<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.350> ten

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
just wait you can take five to ten

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.069 
just wait you can take five to ten
minutes<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.360> reason<00:04:10.600> it's<00:04:10.720> taking<00:04:10.780> so

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
minutes so the reason it's taking so

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.690 
minutes so the reason it's taking so
long<00:04:11.110> is<00:04:11.320> it's<00:04:11.560> totally<00:04:11.860> wiped<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.310> data<00:04:12.519> or

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
long is it's totally wiped the data or

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.220 
long is it's totally wiped the data or
it's<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.000> process<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.570> wiping<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.049> data

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
it's in the process of wiping the data

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.289 
it's in the process of wiping the data
and<00:04:14.350> that<00:04:14.440> takes<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.950> few<00:04:15.340> minutes<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:15.910> it<00:04:16.150> will

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
and that takes a few minutes so it will

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.780 
and that takes a few minutes so it will
actually<00:04:16.750> appear<00:04:17.049> like<00:04:17.320> your<00:04:17.560> screen<00:04:18.010> is<00:04:18.430> boot

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
actually appear like your screen is boot
