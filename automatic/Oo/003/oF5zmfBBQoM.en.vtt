00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.430
 hello everyone today we are going to make a 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.650
 Classic appetizer some mussels 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.590
 steam for it you are going to see the step to 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.360
 step how easy it is you can see the trick 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.550
 in the channel how to clean the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.830
 mussels and we get down to work 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.740
 when we have the clean mussels in 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.510
 the pot we split a lemon if you like 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.380
 much the flavor as a big lemon 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.380
 we slip it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:40.450
 and we leave the lemon inside the pot 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.450
 we do the same with the other half 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.280
 and we put in the pot 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.280
 and we put a couple of bay leaves 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.840
 one of water thread 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.840
 we light the fire 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.710
 and we will have it on fire 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.540
 until the mussels have 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.970
 open when we have all the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.420
 Open mussels will be finished 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.420
 if any lack to open that we throw it 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.880
 because it means that it's not good 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.729
 calculate about ten minutes good friends 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.540
 after cooking the mussels we have 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.540
 pot 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.020
 and what are we going to do when we will have 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.720
 all the mussels like that we 're going 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.990
 putting removing the broth in a good 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990
 worst 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.180
 and then when we have them all 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:42.090
 placed the only thing we have to do 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:45.689
 is to put lemon and throw over 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 a little bit of the broth that you have thrown 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.930
 steamed you have stayed 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.800
 wide open 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.940
 and now we can only enjoy one 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:04.460
 stage of the freshest I'll take a 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.460
 couple of spoons to help me 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.540
 when we have them whole of the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.840
 of clay is to keep the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.720
 hot 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.629
 but you can serve whatever you want there 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.700
 many sites that are served directly 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.239
 in the pot a broth is put on tablecloths and 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.239
 we are taking 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.580
 have been no more than 10 minutes and as 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.890
 you see 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.890
 this smells throat 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.060
 we are only 2 left 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.920
 and now that we have left we have the lemon and 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.700
 a bit of cadiz 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.700
 we add 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.950
 a little broth 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.079
 and now you can serve them at the table with 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.180
 a lemon cut into quarters and that each 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.140
 one if you really like the lemon take 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.140
 before giving it 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.090
 the mussel put a little lemon 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.090
 until the next friends 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.330
 he's super good
