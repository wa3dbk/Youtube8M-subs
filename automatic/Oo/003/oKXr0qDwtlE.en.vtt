it's<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> pretty<00:02:19.150> clean<00:02:19.420> stage<00:02:20.400> nice<00:02:21.400> use<00:02:21.730> of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
it's a pretty clean stage nice use of

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.510 
it's a pretty clean stage nice use of
the<00:02:21.880> traits<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.710> trait<00:02:23.980> will<00:02:24.130> hit<00:02:24.340> even

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
the traits and the trait will hit even

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.250 
the traits and the trait will hit even
off<00:02:24.730> block<00:02:24.940> port<00:02:25.210> here<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.480> there's<00:02:25.630> no<00:02:25.810> hits

done<00:02:26.470> or<00:02:26.710> blocks<00:02:27.010> done<00:02:27.220> either<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.730> think<00:02:28.270> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
done or blocks done either I think the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.350 
done or blocks done either I think the
tree<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.570> right<00:02:28.720> now<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.020> kind<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.260> broken<00:02:30.360> and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
tree it right now is kind of broken and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.490 
tree it right now is kind of broken and
that's<00:02:31.480> frame<00:02:31.690> advance<00:02:31.960> what<00:02:32.140> he's<00:02:32.230> doing

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that's frame advance what he's doing

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500 
that's frame advance what he's doing
good<00:02:33.280> use<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.670> interactive<00:02:33.910> all<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.300> again

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
good use the interactive all that again

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.760 
good use the interactive all that again
stuff<00:02:34.690> out<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.960> pressure<00:02:35.140> he<00:02:35.350> knew<00:02:35.560> that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770
