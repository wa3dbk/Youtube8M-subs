00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.610 
ahead and loads alright we actually went
ahead<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.940> loaded<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.780> videos<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.500> it

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
ahead and loaded up the videos and it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.970 
ahead and loaded up the videos and it
took<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.160> little<00:02:35.490> while<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.270> actually<00:02:36.360> took<00:02:36.980> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
took a little while it actually took a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.210 
took a little while it actually took a
few<00:02:38.640> minutes<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.120> load<00:02:39.420> everything<00:02:39.600> up<00:02:40.220> which

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
few minutes to load everything up which

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.130 
few minutes to load everything up which
is<00:02:41.370> pretty<00:02:41.640> surprising<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.390> think<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.990> has

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
is pretty surprising I think that has

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.840 
is pretty surprising I think that has
something<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.740> with<00:02:43.950> having<00:02:44.220> an<00:02:44.430> SD<00:02:44.820> card

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
something to do with having an SD card

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.620 
something to do with having an SD card
in<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:46.380> that's<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.100> card<00:02:47.370> might<00:02:47.790> cause

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
in there that's the card might cause

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.330 
in there that's the card might cause
problems<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.530> don't<00:02:49.740> have<00:02:49.950> an<00:02:50.070> SD

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
problems but if you don't have an SD

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.330 
problems but if you don't have an SD
card<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.760> should<00:02:51.030> load<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.330> pretty<00:02:51.870> quickly<00:02:52.590> so

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
card it should load up pretty quickly so

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.130 
card it should load up pretty quickly so
as<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:53.730> see<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.090> can<00:02:54.270> see<00:02:54.510> all<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
as you can see you can see all the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.820 
as you can see you can see all the
videos<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.500> are<00:02:55.740> on<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.220> device<00:02:56.370> here<00:02:57.000> and
