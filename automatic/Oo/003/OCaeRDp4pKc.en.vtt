2530 yard of a Dias around you but now
that<00:00:43.410> I've<00:00:43.590> introduced<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> sensor<00:00:44.550> grenade

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
that I've introduced the sensor grenade

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.030 
that I've introduced the sensor grenade
thing<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> lot<00:00:45.690> different<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
thing it is a lot different think of it

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.010 
thing it is a lot different think of it
like<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.310> centric<00:00:47.579> Rene<00:00:47.760> from<00:00:48.000> Bad<00:00:48.210> Company<00:00:48.510> 1

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
like the centric Rene from Bad Company 1

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.540 
like the centric Rene from Bad Company 1
and<00:00:49.290> Bad<00:00:49.410> Company<00:00:49.649> 2<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.040> think<00:00:50.250> wasn't<00:00:50.430> bad

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and Bad Company 2 I think wasn't bad

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
and Bad Company 2 I think wasn't bad
company<00:00:50.820> 2<00:00:50.970> you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.930> throw<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
company 2 you can throw it and then it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.229 
company 2 you can throw it and then it
would<00:00:52.920> show<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.399> enemies<00:00:53.730> around<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
would show the enemies around the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.479 
would show the enemies around the
location<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.469> plan<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> down<00:00:56.040> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
location it's not you plan it down you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
location it's not you plan it down you
throw<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.000> ahead<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.630> and<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.170> shows<00:00:58.350> where

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
throw it ahead of you and it shows where

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.319 
throw it ahead of you and it shows where
the<00:00:58.649> enemies<00:00:58.920> are<00:00:58.950> gonna<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.210> move

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the enemies are gonna be as you move

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
the enemies are gonna be as you move
forward<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:01.170> call<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.590> black<00:01:01.770> ops<00:01:02.070> 2<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
forward now call it a black ops 2 it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060 
forward now call it a black ops 2 it
really<00:01:03.030> works<00:01:03.570> differently<00:01:04.079> than<00:01:04.350> any<00:01:04.799> sort

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
really works differently than any sort

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
really works differently than any sort
of<00:01:05.129> essential<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.119> personally<00:01:06.600> seen

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
of essential that I have personally seen

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
of essential that I have personally seen
before<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.499> it's<00:01:07.770> pretty<00:01:07.889> cool<00:01:08.159> thinks<00:01:08.429> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
before I think it's pretty cool thinks a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.949 
before I think it's pretty cool thinks a
little<00:01:08.609> bit<00:01:08.819> of<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.969> nice<00:01:09.179> twist<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.719> it<00:01:09.749> a

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:09.959 
little bit of a nice twist to it a

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.480 
little bit of a nice twist to it a
little<00:01:10.319> less<00:01:10.619> camper<00:01:10.979> friendly<00:01:11.249> but<00:01:11.399> it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
little less camper friendly but it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.039 
little less camper friendly but it's
really<00:01:11.759> nice<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.090> aggressive<00:01:12.689> gameplay

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
really nice for aggressive gameplay

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.349 
really nice for aggressive gameplay
let's<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.740> into<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.009> thing<00:01:14.149> according<00:01:15.149> to

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
let's get into this thing according to

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:16.879 
let's get into this thing according to
the<00:01:15.450> create<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.719> class<00:01:15.990> menu<00:01:16.319> the<00:01:16.530> sensor

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:16.889 
the create a class menu the sensor

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:19.190 
the create a class menu the sensor
grenade<00:01:17.219> detects<00:01:17.999> enemy<00:01:18.479> soldiers<00:01:18.899> within

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
grenade detects enemy soldiers within

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.349 
grenade detects enemy soldiers within
line<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.469> sight<00:01:19.619> now<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.639> the<00:01:20.789> one<00:01:21.029> unique

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
line of sight now that is the one unique

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.819 
line of sight now that is the one unique
thing<00:01:21.600> about<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.990> new<00:01:22.109> sensor<00:01:22.439> grenade<00:01:22.709> it

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
thing about this new sensor grenade it

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.550 
thing about this new sensor grenade it
will<00:01:22.950> only<00:01:23.459> detect<00:01:23.880> enemy<00:01:24.389> soldiers<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.350> are

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
will only detect enemy soldiers that are

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.099 
will only detect enemy soldiers that are
within<00:01:25.829> the<00:01:26.700> radius<00:01:26.969> of<00:01:27.389> the<00:01:27.569> sensor<00:01:27.840> grenade

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
within the radius of the sensor grenade

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.199 
within the radius of the sensor grenade
and<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.889> are<00:01:28.979> actually<00:01:29.670> within<00:01:29.850> a
