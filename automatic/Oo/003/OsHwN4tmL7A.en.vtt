00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 in this video roberto loski will show 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.259
 how is the green pruning done on this vine 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.150
 production has been over for 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.500
 approximately 15 days and now is the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.690
 ideal time for green pruning 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.540
 we realize that everywhere 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.279
 vegetation on the tip is 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 working is intense 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.920
 that's it's coming to say that the concrete and 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.130
 vegetation and this provides a good 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.170
 provocation cry this let's get it and go 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.540
 here again on this 2nd or 3rd wire in 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.380
 general that second wire or pick up and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.550
 make this cut here in the second a a 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:47.039
 the only one looking for the most 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.410
 production is more productive and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.510
 it is quality and I will do 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 cut the whole grape 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.480
 it is not done down because there it is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.570
 more difficult to vote the gem here in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.239
 down while here at this stage 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.979
 this long door at the moment is more 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.960
 interesting to know that klose was 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.420
 explaining that the same day you did 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.729
 pruning removed all vegetation from the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.100
 from above you need to pass a product 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.439
 right just where the cut was made 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.960
 how is this product actually the product 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.930
 What is its name that is diluted? 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.299
 in the water 20% is there 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.299
 and why this product is passed us 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.290
 Let's get it and pass it here. 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.759
 cut at the ends of the branches we 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.710
 we can get the cut and the gem that we 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.570
 we call it a productive yolk and many 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.380
 times have to go once 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.479
 Ideally, do it on the same day and see 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.790
 well why then pass this product on 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.450
 first thing it will help to break 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.590
 the dormancy of the slope or 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.500
 help budding and if we do not 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.229
 help if this is dangerous to the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.880
 annotation in all these other gems and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.659
 that we do not want these 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.030
 other gems here sprout with bud of 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.400
 production and only this then we 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.620
 we help with this product so it goes 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.080
 get more homogeneous 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.379
 vote and it will be much easier to 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.379
 if you work 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.970
 ae
