00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.580
 of heritage of humanity 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.429

 patrimony registered there is no website there 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.680
 so 49 there is the site in saying when you 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.530
 many times send someone to take it 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.350

 sell it I know on ebay on the black market 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.059
 maybe here we could look at it 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.949
 solve the debt problem 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.619
 public because we have a debt 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.780
 public we also excel in 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:00.570
 in europe there is no one before that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.339
 there is a breach but that makes us the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.210
 greece a whisker makes us took it to 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.430
 we Italians should be 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.090
 happy no one gets a funny guy like that 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.060

 divided by debt, there are 30 thousand 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.830
 euro per head including children who 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.800

 as reader the photo drawings I say because it is 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.659
 a debt that we actually say 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430
 that we Italians have a debt to ourselves 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.810
 we have always been used to being born with 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.310
 debt on the rump 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.360

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.939
 of millions 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.120
 millions 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:29.389
 we can does that made a check a 30 60 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.000
 90 122 changes read however the cash or 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:33.859
 ai lance I had cause face makes it 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.769
 if you don't take it take it to that site 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.480
 because maybe in the sense that it was there 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.400
 we have so many take a non site 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.870
 We can pay you in cash take 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.810
 nature what nature offers 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.879
 take a nice site that we have given ourselves 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.500
 take colosseum virus from the trio is 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.620
 collapsed windows never put 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.419
 but who cares says but you know some 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.180
 detractor because between you that is 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:03:00.950
 always a detractor some vice versa 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.260
 detractor of these defeatists has 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.549
 however we give the Colosseum too much 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.099
 representative and okay then will want 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.849
 to say that this was I will do it 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.650
 take that I know matera stones 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.810
 maybe one at a time we pull them 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.000
 maybe one called him a full and wives 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.400
 user debt or if you are not stones they are 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.040
 too old then we can give 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.870
 the palace of caserta before it becomes 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.150
 a pile of rubble that the chair 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.290
 to this here if you take the palace of 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.659
 caserta we can make an exception 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.519
 we also give him the excavations of pompeii 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.639
 so much we knew they were missing 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.470
 most Italians are from an old one 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.689
 old woman an old Pompeian woman from 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.430
 first now that it seems that already at the time of 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.840
 Traiano was planted with its own basil 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.819
 where then pompeii was born 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.269
 then for usucapion to the sauce for which 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.189
 who cares and if you take pompeii that 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.739
 we can give the salerno reggio calabria 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.849
 both ends up as a vaffa because not 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.849
 we want to know more 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.599
 but yes but let's give it 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.599
 that
