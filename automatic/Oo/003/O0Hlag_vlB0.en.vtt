00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.990
 this year 11 state schools of goias 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.420
 passed the management to the military police 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 and became military schools 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.839
 among the reasons is the poor performance 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.640
 of students 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.949
 after changing the frequency of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.340
 students increased and tranquility 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.439
 for teachers to work 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 an environment that was marked by 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.619
 violence since January of this year 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.270
 state school fernando person in 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.850
 valparaiso city goiana surroundings of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.660
 brasília adopted police management 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.239
 military 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.410
 in less than a year the processing can 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.719
 to be seen 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.870
 for the teacher who witnessed the two 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.360
 realities change favored all 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.809
 teachers were afraid of the students and this 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 can it be a lot at work for students to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.539
 monthly to take note I was already threatened 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.250
 nor read then much has changed in that sense 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.149
 that now consult the same student class has 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 to run behind 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.799
 until today we have a frequency of 98 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.810
 percent of students while in the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.860
 second semester there is usually a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.610
 school dropout rate is very large on average 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.850
 of 30% already in that time discipline and 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.759
 hierarchy are military principles for 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 many students at this school were difficult 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.299
 follow the rules 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.380
 they know exactly what their 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.380
 duties and rights 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.200
 work does everything right the duty to 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.539
 Everyday home, you have homework. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.850
 the collection on homework here 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.770
 does not gain an easy point in another college is 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.590
 everything to base you have to study to do 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.619
 test to earn points and 50% of vacancies 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.090
 of the military colleges of Goiás are 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.890
 sons of the military 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.740
 the other half is filled by the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.450
 community through a lottery and the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.130
 dispute is great 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.640
 the students who were already in school 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.549
 had priority and for 240 vacancies 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.619
 that will be available over two thousand 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.229
 people signed up for who 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.220
 you can enroll your child this is a 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.269
 conquest 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.489
 today she has no limits I did not give 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.650
 not that the father no family not 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.709
 that only family responsibility 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.739
 however the school has been a complement 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.900
 strong in this area of behavior but the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.840
 rules-based education system 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.519
 military fighter polemic this 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.610
 specialist in violence in schools 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.280
 does not approve the participation of militarism 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.260
 in educational institutions 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.810
 we had a lot of dictatorship time 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.889
 In this country we know that the rules 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.480
 military 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.549
 I think we can not take this. 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.220
 for schools means we have to 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:53.400
 think preventive measures 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.400
 Effective Projects Programs
