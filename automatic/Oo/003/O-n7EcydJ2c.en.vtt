00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.859
 This is my glamor stool 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.900
 This is not a complete version but already 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.599
 more or less close to the end 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.070
 crooked of course braids but long ago did not hold 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.379
 hands burn on the machine I have it already 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 spoke and so thank you Denis for 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.140
 provided equipment review we have 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 here is the relative news from 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.500
 msr you can almost say that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.940
 jetboil replicas and although not quite let's 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.640
 let's figure it out so the pan with lid 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.800
 case and cap cap besides 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 what performs the protective function of the radiator 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:48.510
 it still has a milliliter gradation and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.390
 mind the cap itself is soft with three slots 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.640
 for steam in order that you can 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.370
 it was not removing the cover pour out of this 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:06.869
 the burner is a convenient stand for single 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:09.990
 cylinders pan and burner inside 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.770
 pans have gradation of milliliter i 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.659
 am sam the maximum amount which for 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.790
 security cookie so you can 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.850
 boil this in your hands not 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.159
 sprayed it somewhere 06 milliliters well 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.409
 that is, 0 6 liters or 600 milliliters 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.900
 further if you pour you as it were 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.700
 can already when boiling water will 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.280
 spill over the edges even with 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.400
 the presence of the cap but in principle liter here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 can get inside gets small 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.990
 a can that is quite small 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.689
 gas very interesting made pen 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.390
 she's such a hard case in itself he 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.720
 not neoprene like other burners but he 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:57.990
 as if plastic dressed in a rag 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:03.840
 this is very unusual it seems that he is not 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:08.190
 does not understand though he acts very much 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.739
 on the cunning is not such a plastic latch 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.160
 here it can be removed and washed in the pan 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.520
 and for example put it on 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.510
 unusually comfortable as a pen 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.610
 a mug can use a radiator 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.980
 of rather unusual form it is somewhat 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.959
 leveled so to speak for the best 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:38.010
 transfer boiling pot on the burner 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.959
 fixed simply by turning securely when 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.879
 this is unlike any there 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.019
 format or korea is very much 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.660
 positions that is to get into the clip 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.980
 mounting is much easier now and the burner 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:57.450
 she has such a convenient flip back 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.739
 Irina for gas supply that's when you do not need 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.050
 as if you are transporting, you remove everything 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.060
 in general, the system has no suspension and also 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.970
 but my opinion is a small minus the fact that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.620
 there is no piezo igniter and that is to say 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.860
 lighter or whatever 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.330
 fire to set fire to this minus here on 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.209
 the comfort itself is so thin 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.760
 the thread that is hot that is 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.300
 the flame when you set fire at all 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.370
 visible and so as not to burn yourself as well 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.230
 need to get accustomed to this thread she 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.599
 blushes literally there after a few 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.879
 seconds it takes getting used to but i can't 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.190
 say in principle that it is a bad device 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.650
 burner incompatible with normal 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.230
 an adapter for sangi so be 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.099
 attentive but let's check for 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.420
 how much does it boil half a liter of water 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:50.420
 my can take a tramp ovsky 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:56.300
 all seasons half a liter of water from the tap 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:59.260
 light the fire as we see the fire 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:04.510
 absolutely not visible and here 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.510
 the thread right there almost turned red 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:16.519
 It took literally 45 seconds to cover already 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.859
 sweaty and so the water starts to boil 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.500
 this is evident from the changed droplets on 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.000
 the lid appeared part now a saucepan 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.260
 start jumping up and the noise has changed 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.260
 all the water finally began to boil 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.090
 three minutes 6 seconds 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.010
 half a liter of water to full boil 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.290
 good result but just like that and 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.200
 succinctly we conducted the test as a whole to me 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.900
 burner on the exterior liked it and 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.580
 workmanship also does not cause 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.389
 no complaints the only thing 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.419
 the absence of 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.419
 piezo ignition somehow makes a little 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.880
 strain something but of course speed and 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.660
