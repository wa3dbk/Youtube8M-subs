00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.820
 daniel williams a very fine dog in 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.400
 choose to reference that is the secret is the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.530
 Serve in sanaa is a good evolution 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.780
 series or us in the first two 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.370
 games the couto team in craft is that it was 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.229
 an unknown the first driver a 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.809
 man is in the middle of no accident 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.850
 superpower is a book later a 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.120
 game for a control could absorb 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.159
 more per month and that we have delsin or 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.320
 is a new driver living in an area 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.409
 completely frightened we now have 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.900
 atom and it is basically a sponge 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.390
 by taxi, that is, it can absorb 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.390
 all special attacks of each 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.490
 driver to use his pleasure 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.689
 No blood I believe the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.609
 french 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.920
 but you will need ends up being a 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:14.140
 child of us now have access soon 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.630
 determines a much larger city with a 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.789
 time and more goals to accomplish and 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.130
 things to do and history too 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.500
 expand our Japanese in four months with 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.079
 that the story is enlarged also give 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.329
 a touch more emotional ie the note 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.340
 that there is greater attention to the 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.409
 moves the catching discussions is the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.590
 develop from the outside and from the 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.530
 it is also to give life to this seattle that was 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.140
 used to the game and knowing 4 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.789
 finally receive a great title 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.270
 Let's try to figure out how to do it. 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.240
 care for the boy won playing the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.950
 other ie this is a super fandom 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.409
 heroes in wearing that house thing and 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.359
 everything like gta will I can 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.079
 help you consider using your 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.020
 powers 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.659
 after the first two in combat ah and 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.340
 also to try to do those missions 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.899
 secondary that arise when 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.749
 interact with other characters 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.850
 choose then forget to side ally 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.380
 Bath or do things there's 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.900
 bad is a choice that they have for example 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.220
 but in terms of changing if this idea 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.080
 to explore the city find 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.110
 fragments 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.450
 andrÃ© is interacting with 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.280
 other in pcs is and libertad for example 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.960
 control city what are the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.670
 true enemies of the show 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.440
 after four because you write too much 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.570
 well involves the graffiti of the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.430
 visual experience because it is the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.930
 was created by cervantes to spend 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.270
 quite attractive but it's not just the city 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.190
 in itself are also the characters is also 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.980
 environment, that is, we already have the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.600
 goalkeeper's umbrella and so forth. 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.940
 which are pretty strong things that would have 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.100
 quite an impact and ashley cole if any 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.390
 time I called there by type stock the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.220
 that were things like they were leaving 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.530
 really impressed and show that the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.810
 scheme goes on sane and already a new game 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.709
 and enjoy the new graphics 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.540
 generation 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.060
 and will this new generation 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.870
 thrilled with the final game for those who 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.790
 this child 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.709
 Congratulations to all who know for whom all 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.870
 others but people will think is father 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.850
 of more of the same but also but even 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.459
 It's not always always too much. 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.040
 and here is a case the allegedly expanded 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.530
 that idea of being the driver and being a 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.170
 superhero subject in a trap too 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.640
 exploit our will and it is undoubtedly 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.190
 some the game is the first study that 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.790
 like the action and has a position 4 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.320
 I was so sorry I had to thank you. 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.600
 all that maybe side make a 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.260
 replacement on our youtube channel and 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.060
 visit our website www.laforet.pt or 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.640

 the Secretary-General on the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.380
 cinema and games have kagame and with vision
