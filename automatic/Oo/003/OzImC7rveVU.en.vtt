00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 they also want new ones full of energy 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.410
 years your resistance starts to increase 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.580
 and you can lose a few pounds 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.469
 do three things 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.910
 you can opt for a popular diet 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.440
 low in calories 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.910
 and in that way you become a quick fix 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.260
 aim to achieve 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.730
 you could do your diet 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.880
 compensate by going a lot 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 exercise and the last way is to get one 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.269
 natural lifestyle and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.010
 your diet and lifestyle 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.960
 change 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.880
 I prefer the latter option 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 why that's the only thing you do 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 lasting result 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.570
 before i go any further i will be myself first 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.100
 let me introduce i'm whole from zeeland 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.840
 from with to so goes out 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.200
 the platform focused on organic food 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 and of course the movie knows how to please 15 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.020
 years this has been working hard 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.300
 then I did the training 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 orthomolecular medicine 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.600
 this study is about a diet 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.340
 can be used for healing in 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.309
 Instead'm medications for his show 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.899
 you at my where different doctors 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.730
 therapists and dietitians involved 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.140
 Of course an acquaintance heard that I 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.539
 just do not know why anyone 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.700
 doing my second thought was this must 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.619
 Everyone know like the concept is that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.360
 jonas would arise to this knowledge 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.790
 open to public at large 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.619
 to bring because namely health 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.530
 labels a nice slogan on packaging 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.330
 unfortunately do not always tell the truth 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 but a crash back to the snow 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.700
 diet is not all dancing day 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.460
 irradiation 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.840
 that the well-known yo-yo effect results and 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.820
 if you compensate your diet in the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.530
 gym fool yourself 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 you can sort one king with another 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.479
 like or even strike each other 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 Compensation behavior is not the solution 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.780
 adjust a diet 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.689
 unsuitable if you quickly get that kilo of shirt 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.689
 card hit but just that into you if you 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.549
 goes for lasting results 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.960
 You can then choose to be alone 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.579
 the other day rigorous all about 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.009
 ingredients from your diet 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.990
 change or you can focus on one 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.780
 food components such as for example 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.149
 fats or carbohydrates such as sugars i 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.860
 am for the latter option that the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.820
 minute changes in diet 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.159
 easy to keep full and why 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.890
 long for sugar then I also have one 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.810
 refined 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.819
 you don't care what you do 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.980
 do one yourself in your coffee or tea 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.420
 nutrient medium side vacuum cleaner and 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.980
 chemical sweeteners 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620
 almost all food products that you 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.840
 can find the supermarket 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.610
 yes with the omission of sugar for this 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.610
 in bali by far the most result 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.490
 been sugar-free for two years 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.520
 to live through the course you can 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.680
 below that matter than 9000 people went to you 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.660
 for one were the second assessing 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.700
 the lilies among business 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.739
 the valuable experiences feedback there 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 worked in recent months and renew the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.800

 say the 200 version my new one 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.930
 version it will be mine now 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.160
 naturally sugar degrees we discontinued diet 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.540
 or nutritional value for everyone 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.730
 being qualified 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.230
 after all every body is in it 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.700
 optimize a healthy one 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.440
 lifestyle is a personal one 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.350
 voyage of discovery in which I am one step ahead 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.019
