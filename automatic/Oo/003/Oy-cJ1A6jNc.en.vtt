00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.059
 the juice of an orange a little brandy 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.059
 and a little bit of sugar first thing 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.380
 We do is put to cook the pasta we 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.380
 to put a liter of water 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.030
 and cover until it starts to boil 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.730
 once the water has started to boil 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.840
 we put a good bit of salt 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.840
 and we enter peace 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.750
 and we will count when it starts to boil 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.240
 again 7 minutes and we will turn off good 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.759
 Well, once it's cooked, we're going to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 drain , we have the drained pasta 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.759
 We've left it for 10 minutes but if you 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 like more to dente let her 7 now what 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.590
 first thing we will do is peel and cut 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.590
 our vegetables we will peel the cucumber 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.560
 and then we will remove the pepper 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.920
 and now we will not cut in cubes 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.960
 and we will do the same with hair 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.090
 and now we will do the same with the tomato what 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.600
 we will peel and remove all 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.600
 nuggets 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.160
 once we have removed the seeds 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.380
 that he just took them off because it 's 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.900
 very unpleasant when you find them 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.250
 in the salad but let's go 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.250
 you can remove them or not 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.220
 we cut it also in squares 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.690
 Well, we have all the vegetables here 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.690
 and let's mix 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.819
 let's take a little salt 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.939
 and we mix 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.190
 let's also throw the oregano 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.530
 and now let's make the pink sauce like 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.840
 you see here I have the orange juice come on 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.310
 to throw 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.310
 a little mayonnaise 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.349
 as well as 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.819
 four tablespoons and let's move 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.819
 and now let's take the tomato 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.330
 let's beat a little with the shakes 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.680
 to mix it well 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.610
 we take the brandy and we are going to take a 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.610
 little sugar 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.350
 That's how I am 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.890
 now we are going to add a little bit of 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.890
 Pepper 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.480
 and the sauce is ready as you see 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.610
 we already have everything mixed and now we 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.160
 let's put the pink sauce that already 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.730
 we have a good list so let's go 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.730
 the sauce on top and we will mix 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.540
 if you have pink sauce left as is my case 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.030
 you can keep it in a little jar of 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.670
 glass in the fridge and you hold three or 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.120
 four days you can spend or in another 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.370
 salad or pasta that you make 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.290
 Normally we have already finished so 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.470
 let's try to see how we have 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.470
 left 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 It is very nice if you liked it 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.060
 up if you've loved adding it 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.020
