00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:12.850
 Now I will show the option that is plywood 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:19.150
 Yes, I took no pity sheet of the whole 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:22.630
 dissolve I took 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.530
 taped from two 9 plywood from see yes in 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:31.690
 press squeezed that is what happened 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:36.879
 small offset but also to us 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:39.100
 be them now you can 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.230
 a jigsaw of dates or there will be some sort 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.719
 irregularities i'll show you how with 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.730
 using a router 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.730
 make this plane perfect 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:01:01.600
 make the price cutters cutters 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:12.700
 Yes, what kind of threat from the bearing can 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:17.610
 take a base of indifference look at you 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.619
 there is one flat side 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.380
 turn the cutter to measure on and so knows 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.369
 about even the prize was here 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.490
 I donâ€™t even need to change the lock 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.820
 need to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.409
 45 millimeters 45 and a half idle 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:41.009
 at 45 here I have an offset 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:48.509
 small just note here 45 but 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:55.439
 here here is a little more here 47 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:02:00.810
 mark and so you direct I screwed to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:04.259
 table that it was all clearly possible 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:12.090
 whatever opinion and shed use 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:17.880
 and all that is the prize is exposed this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:20.120
 moment of course over habit here like 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.120
 keep failing shiva 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 law 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.030
 but 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.110
 for whom 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.110
 to be afraid 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.680
 arms 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.290
 got the perfect plane like after 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.290
 saws 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.640
 This if you have no circulars can here 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:12.910
 so edge processing i think showed 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:15.490
 All this is quite understandable if you 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:33.100
 there is also no jointer meaning you can 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:35.160
 in this way even glue together the perfect 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.700
 plane 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:45.520
 this ideal plane depends on 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.280
 evenness your direction can 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.459
 use ted building rules 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.440
 time hard enough to watch then 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.100
 there is a longer 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.810
 and you need here from that is to march in 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.010
 the middle did not walk if the middle is walking 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.900
 try to press some more 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.050
 can essentially a clamp here 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.550
 in the middle 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:16.120
 attached processed this part to clamp 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.359
 removed twisted it here further 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.769
 continue I think everything was clear to everyone 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.769
 thank you for your attention
