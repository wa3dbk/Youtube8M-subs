00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that they did 30 years ago when I was

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
that they did 30 years ago when I was
just<00:01:49.619> growing<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> kid<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.299> know

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
just growing up as a kid and so you know

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.300 
just growing up as a kid and so you know
without<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.659> community<00:01:52.320> spirit<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.890> people

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
without a community spirit and people

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.350 
without a community spirit and people
working<00:01:53.579> together<00:01:53.729> nothing<00:01:54.210> gets

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
working together nothing gets

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.149 
working together nothing gets
accomplished<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.259> think<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.740> town<00:01:55.979> in

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
accomplished and I think this town in

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.740 
accomplished and I think this town in
particular<00:01:56.430> has<00:01:56.820> always<00:01:57.060> found<00:01:57.210> ways<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.450> get

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
particular has always found ways to get

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.319 
particular has always found ways to get
things<00:01:57.990> done<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:59.250> guess<00:01:59.820> as<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> kid<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
things done and I guess as a kid that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.780 
things done and I guess as a kid that
really<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:01.200> molded<00:02:01.770> ingrained<00:02:02.189> into<00:02:02.399> me<00:02:02.640> at<00:02:02.729> a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
really was molded ingrained into me at a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.880 
really was molded ingrained into me at a
