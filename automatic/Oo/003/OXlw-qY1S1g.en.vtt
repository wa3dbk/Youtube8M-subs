00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
like juice so but that thing was such a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.720 
like juice so but that thing was such a
pain<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.380> never<00:00:19.650> used<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> thought

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
pain that I never used it so I thought

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
pain that I never used it so I thought
I'd<00:00:20.880> try<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.660> basically<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.710> know

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
I'd try this one so basically you know

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.970 
I'd try this one so basically you know
that<00:00:22.949> piece<00:00:23.189> goes<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.449> has<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.529> GE

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that piece goes on this has that the GE

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
that piece goes on this has that the GE
a<00:00:26.900> super<00:00:27.900> hard<00:00:28.080> plastic<00:00:28.650> auger<00:00:30.289> whatever

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
a super hard plastic auger whatever

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
a super hard plastic auger whatever
difference<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.859> makes<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.239> goes<00:00:33.450> in

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
difference that makes so that goes in

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.350 
difference that makes so that goes in
then<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.500> want<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:34.860> filter<00:00:35.610> screen<00:00:36.030> there's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
then you want your filter screen there's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.950 
then you want your filter screen there's
the<00:00:36.420> solid<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> certain<00:00:37.920> uses<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.430> for

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
the solid one for a certain uses but for

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.760
