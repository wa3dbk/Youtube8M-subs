going to show you what to do now if

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.850 
going to show you what to do now if
basically<00:02:05.399> do<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.700> press<00:02:06.540> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
basically do this press a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.310 
basically do this press a
and<00:02:08.729> press<00:02:09.090> B<00:02:10.070> then<00:02:11.070> press<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.140> then<00:02:13.140> hold

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
and press B then press one and then hold

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.310 
and press B then press one and then hold
down<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:14.420> B<00:02:15.420> by<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.660> way<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.080> trigger

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
down to B by the way is the trigger

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:28.270 
down to B by the way is the trigger
button

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:41.309 

so<00:02:29.240> let<00:02:29.390> me<00:02:29.450> try<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.630> again

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.000 

now<00:02:42.250> this<00:02:42.489> isn't<00:02:42.670> working<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.739> think<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
now this isn't working and I think the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.229 
now this isn't working and I think the
reason<00:02:45.280> why<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.430> isn't<00:02:45.609> working<00:02:45.849> is<00:02:46.060> because

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
reason why it isn't working is because

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
reason why it isn't working is because
I've<00:02:46.359> already<00:02:46.510> got<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.870> option<00:02:47.200> available

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
I've already got the option available

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.459 
I've already got the option available
but<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:48.760> in<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.180> sequence<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.930> basically

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:50.469 
but it's in that sequence that basically

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.009 
but it's in that sequence that basically
will<00:02:50.890> get<00:02:51.069> you<00:02:51.219> a<00:02:51.250> prompt<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:51.939> it<00:02:52.689> will<00:02:52.840> make

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
will get you a prompt and it will make

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.569 
will get you a prompt and it will make
this<00:02:53.200> available<00:02:53.650> actually<00:02:54.159> they're<00:02:54.430> probably

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
this available actually they're probably

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.849 
this available actually they're probably
prompt<00:02:54.879> to<00:02:55.030> automatically<00:02:55.629> so<00:02:55.870> since<00:02:56.680> this

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
prompt to automatically so since this

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:04.530 
prompt to automatically so since this

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
guys the prompts to begin with for the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.000 
guys the prompts to begin with for the
four<00:04:39.720> ahead<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:40.050> this<00:04:40.170> works<00:04:40.440> but<00:04:40.710> like<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.950> said

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
four ahead of this works but like I said

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.620 
four ahead of this works but like I said
that<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.640> button<00:04:41.820> sequence<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.480> that's

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
that is the button sequence and that's

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.940 
that is the button sequence and that's
the<00:04:42.750> way<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:42.900> do<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.230> if<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.410> hold<00:04:43.650> down<00:04:43.710> the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
the way to do it if you hold down the

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.220 
the way to do it if you hold down the
buttons<00:04:44.310> it<00:04:44.850> doesn't<00:04:45.480> work<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.750> only<00:04:45.870> button

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
buttons it doesn't work the only button

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.930 
buttons it doesn't work the only button
you'll<00:04:46.320> need<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.590> hold<00:04:46.800> down<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:47.910> just

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
you'll need to hold down is to so just

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.450 
you'll need to hold down is to so just
remember<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.660> trick<00:04:48.900> it's<00:04:49.890> this<00:04:50.160> button

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
remember the trick it's this button

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.770 
remember the trick it's this button
first<00:04:50.700> then<00:04:51.230> this<00:04:52.230> button<00:04:53.150> then<00:04:54.150> this<00:04:54.420> button

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
first then this button then this button

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.530 
first then this button then this button
and<00:04:54.990> then<00:04:55.680> hold<00:04:55.980> this<00:04:56.250> button<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:57.120> other<00:04:57.270> ones

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
and then hold this button the other ones

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.230 
and then hold this button the other ones
don't<00:04:57.810> hold<00:04:58.020> them<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.880> basically<00:04:59.880> that's<00:05:00.090> how

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
don't hold them and basically that's how

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.030 
don't hold them and basically that's how
you<00:05:00.330> get<00:05:00.480> your<00:05:00.630> connectivity<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.380> then<00:05:01.920> the

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
you get your connectivity and then the

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.010 
you get your connectivity and then the
little<00:05:02.220> transfer<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:02.820> des<00:05:03.120> will<00:05:03.330> broke<00:05:03.570> now

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020
