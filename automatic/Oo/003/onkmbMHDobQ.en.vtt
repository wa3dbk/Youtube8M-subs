and<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.299> the<00:02:08.660> reason<00:02:08.959> they<00:02:09.019> won<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> game

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
and and the reason they won the game

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.350 
and and the reason they won the game
it's<00:02:10.069> clearly<00:02:10.280> because<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.789> special<00:02:11.180> teams

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
it's clearly because the special teams

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.120 
it's clearly because the special teams
and<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.630> first<00:02:11.900> thing<00:02:12.049> I<00:02:12.170> said<00:02:12.230> after

DeShawn's<00:02:13.670> touchdown<00:02:14.239> was<00:02:14.660> special<00:02:15.140> teams

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
DeShawn's touchdown was special teams

those moments first of all I'd like to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.180 
those moments first of all I'd like to
sort<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.510> get<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.200> feeling<00:02:21.440> what<00:02:21.769> was<00:02:21.920> going

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
sort of get the feeling what was going

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.860 
sort of get the feeling what was going
on<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.489> your<00:02:22.579> head<00:02:22.790> with<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.090> onside<00:02:23.510> kick

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
on in your head with the onside kick

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.660 
on in your head with the onside kick
because<00:02:24.319> that<00:02:24.500> certainly<00:02:24.950> was<00:02:25.129> a<00:02:25.160> momentum

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
because that certainly was a momentum

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.199 
because that certainly was a momentum

better<00:03:08.599> is<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.500> kind<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.709> advice<00:03:09.950> you

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
better is that the kind of advice you

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.740 
better is that the kind of advice you
would<00:03:10.220> give<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.549> Kevin<00:03:10.849> Cobb<00:03:11.030> if<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.359> had<00:03:11.569> him

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
would give the Kevin Cobb if you had him

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.240 
would give the Kevin Cobb if you had him
and<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.959> were<00:03:12.019> coaching<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.530> like<00:03:12.769> Kevin<00:03:12.980> Cobb

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.379 
throws the wall accurate yeah the number
one<00:03:18.709> way<00:03:18.859> you<00:03:18.919> evaluate<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.730> quarterback<00:03:20.209> is

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
one way you evaluate a quarterback is

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.200 
one way you evaluate a quarterback is
what<00:03:20.569> happens<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.169> ball<00:03:21.349> when<00:03:21.530> Ellie
