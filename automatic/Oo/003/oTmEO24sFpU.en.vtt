00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.300 
stuff around the back is it's tough but
I'm<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.080> know<00:01:16.110> tough<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.619> ty<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> got<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I'm you know tough on ty so you got to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.380 
I'm you know tough on ty so you got to
really<00:01:17.430> look<00:01:17.580> after<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.299> we've

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
really look after it but I think we've

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.960 
really look after it but I think we've
got<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> very<00:01:18.810> small<00:01:19.439> allocation<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> ties<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
got a very small allocation of ties this

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.580 
got a very small allocation of ties this
year<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.420> we've<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.869> quite<00:01:22.080> careful<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
year so we've got to be quite careful of

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.890 
year so we've got to be quite careful of
how<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.770> use<00:01:23.040> them<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.369> um<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.540> will

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
how we use them but um I think it will

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.270 
how we use them but um I think it will
be<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.560> test<00:01:25.799> our<00:01:25.950> definitely

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
be right and this test our definitely

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
be right and this test our definitely
help<00:01:26.460> us<00:01:26.640> building<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.540> also<00:01:28.530> when
