line now that this is straight from both
angles<00:02:00.759> I'll<00:02:01.759> simply<00:02:02.119> click<00:02:02.270> in<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.539> center

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
angles I'll simply click in the center

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.919 
angles I'll simply click in the center
circle<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.829> move<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:04.549> handle<00:02:04.909> down<00:02:05.060> again<00:02:05.899> I

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
circle and move this handle down again I

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.979 
circle and move this handle down again I
can<00:02:06.169> hold<00:02:06.319> shift<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.159> slide<00:02:07.459> this<00:02:07.639> down

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
can hold shift so that I slide this down

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:13.510 
can hold shift so that I slide this down
straight

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.470 

now<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:14.700> that's<00:02:14.820> all<00:02:15.000> set<00:02:15.240> up<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.450> place

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
now that that's all set up in place

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.190 
now that that's all set up in place
let's<00:02:16.260> go<00:02:16.440> ahead<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.710> make<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> blade
