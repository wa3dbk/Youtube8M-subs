00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.520
 you're fine we end up for a 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.740
 new video and the top 10 he 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.599
 episode 5 special killstreaks so some 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.599
 pretty epic clips on black ops black 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.279
 ops of and mw3 so we start at the 10th 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.079
 place with blurry flo playing on arcade 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.939
 hate and will make us a little rib 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.619
 fidh in screen at the automatic turret 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.989
 he plays on arcade does not need you 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.760
 specify that he placed two turrets 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.020
 at the level of the spawn enemies what is 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.700
 really disgusting but look at them 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.110
 block altogether can no longer anything 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.239
 do and we do a little quadruple 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.020
 elimination to the canvas so it's very 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.030
 very well played we start 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.650
 quietly at this top 10 to the ninth 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.660
 place we are on our tons on black 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.700
 ops and he will make us doctor sparco 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.320
 a small quadruple elimination at the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.730
 Walkyrie Rocket That's Always Its 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.230
 small effect is always low 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.390
 knowing that the roccat talk irina no no 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.680
 plus a super formidable cystic so 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.540
 this is a small quadruple 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.010
 always very much good pleasure 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.350
 we remain in action we are still 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.879
 on black ops and I propose you one of 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.560
 my old old clip one is in search 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.990
 and destruction and yes I play at the catho 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.790
 in the case is 114 I'm sorry but 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.860
 we are in search and I run a b 52 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.499
 and I simply realize a full 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.179
 steam on norton so at the same time a b 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:19.159
 52 on moncton you're pretty sure 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.840
 to kill all the enemies look on 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.130
 see that down to the fidh quits then 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.020
 sorry for the quality but it's the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.639
 studio mode quality of black ops which 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.130
 was just rotten at home 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.810
 to go 7th place we stay we stay 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.100
 always one on the coop this first of 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.450
 name and this time we change my 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.039
 first on lynch we play with 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.329
 wikileaks who will launch his shot from 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.409
 mortar look at me that's it 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.319
 just amazing 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.420
 a tripe a simple lining a hit 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.539
 perfect surgical and say 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.130
 the expression a 6 in 1 at the typing of 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.200
 mortar in demolition that's all 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.579
 just very very beautiful besides this 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.779
 martin's strike makes think a little 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.130
 little to the lightning strike of the east coast 

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:54.170
 that is to say you can choose three 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 positions and and there is really 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.009
 perfect is nothing wrong it's great 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.560
 like clip go sixth place one is 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.509
 always and again on black ops one is 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.069
 with martha rios on after this time 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.749
 who is going to throw us a napalm shot 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.369
 for fearsome I want to look at it 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:11.190
 a 5 in indirect to heart 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.450
 the first wholesale passage of the plane from 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.099
 hunt but beware it's not over 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.269
 did it tic where he gladly did that 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.370
 always happy Saint Quentin 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.299
 and we still chained two kills and one 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.330
 third for the road 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.829

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.239
 sir so look at himself he has of 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.709
 hard to realize 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.629
 the behemoths that was really 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.129
 fearsome on w3 kill I needed I 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.569

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.819
 August is very lucky was going 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.680
 fifth place one is with a member of 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.170
 the team oxide 7 years old 13 who play in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.489
 territory war on black ops 2 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.319
 then the name of the acquirer does not come back 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.549
 that I think it's over blur it's going 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.560
 start a small lightning strike and you 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.299
 doubt hand 601 in territory war 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.650
 it's always good fun but 1.6 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.989
 in a particular that is to say who kills 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.760
 six and a half with the first strike 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.049
 he's going to do no he's with the second 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.849
 and the third but the first we 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.859
 does a 6 in 1 it's simply 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.380

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.669
 effect a predator he will launch and 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.440
 look there he'll see a multitude of 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.060
 red dots is said oh it's Christmas 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.680

 6 in 1 to the predators in doubles and three 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.810
 it's just extremely rare 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.519
