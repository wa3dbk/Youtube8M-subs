00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 but once in 1918 there is little left and that is what I am here and me 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.530
 am affleck 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.400
 davis was 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.880
 coat of arms compliment from people 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.679
 how do you get such a policy 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.820
 I do that so beautiful yes I am very happy to show owners 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.619
 I have had pubic injury that has been approached in a different way and is now being studied 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.380
 well then i want to be myself 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.199
 yet again looking for ways to get people around the eyebrows so naturally 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.410
 possible to do and that is strong but successful 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.930
 but I do not know whether the most beautiful thing is because I am sahar and I am young 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.470
 found eriksen and business this theater will lie between 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.750
 we know what you think about it 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.140
 yes I would like to express your opinion 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.310
 lady gaga start with too little influence 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.210
 two years later that evening this once again extended this from the water and that 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.790
 is I no longer want 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.100
 this unpleasant experience of finding is justified 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.330
 that's what the foundation says 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.370
 so it is s al nahyan say yes that will rise 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.270
 86 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.990
 The movie is just like putting economy on your face 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.539
 only then a few years 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.080
 for this I have a very important role, I look at the essence 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.700
 3 already one and a half and space 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.920
 yes putting that also seems to be the best option is therefore not in their own way 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.689
 only this person has been arrested 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.270
 but I'll check it out 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.780
 a flexible 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.590
 scratch year a fact 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.220
 bent again twice after this first season, so it is also very nice 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.910
 this is also to be safeguarded 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.550
 a number from last year were warned to be delivered carefully 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.710
 the out therefore no different I had already tried the pit has been picked up the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.390
 essence is nice and busy 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.390
 it's the supers party leader 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.360
 very fine the only drawback is that you are here 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.290
 the shortest times was postponed to next season 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.820
 The house is also not a fisherman 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 recommended 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.960
 chairman 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.290
 without an ounce, protests were made against anita c 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.490
 only the plaintiffs in the interim proceedings between postponed 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.660
 it is, of course, also a systematic approach from top chef 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.899
 moment for a long time already purchased and two sets of 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.879
 settlement if it's good 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.180
 tessa from medellin and this is a shame this is in the jar and I find your head 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.809
 yes it enters a separate box and it looks like a mutation 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.619
 now a class is gathered only to keep citizens real 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.409
 not really live itself 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.430
 He is not very good about this 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.029
 a nice winner time for a really very difficult find 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.089
 after this I would not express this characteristic 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.389
 yes for another, the differences are the opinions about that 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.080
 but suddenly I don't get that much more money out of hendrik 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.639
 Vermeersch year comes every time stepped out of this trips variant of k3 circus 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.539
 turns 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:02.889
 referee schumacher who distance the collision and you make sure it is right 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.989
 remain tangible 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.849
 that is good employment 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.299
 what i have always owned you 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.299
 as we actually said bottle of champagne 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.909
 then start buying for a while 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.909
 don't ask me why we use this 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.189
 mean i'm going to put there too 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.189
 that measure still does not matter 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.719
 that does not have to be done in one go 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:41.689
 a little more about the pressing effect and the wiser he is not going up 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.360
 towards the end of the singles 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.319
 they don't follow his own rules 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.329
 different because yes I could also keep some sort of miniature time here and there 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:51.550
 to be 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.910
 a bit overrated 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.699
 feyenoord 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.699
 francs of three-window frames 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.339
 and what I can do is to put the same line on the other side because 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:10.339
 no one can see well in midfield have not done right 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.509
 Twente appeared again 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.099
 money and some supervisors 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.039
 and it is now 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.129
 and what I am going to do now is arkel at the end of April 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.029
 we just have to go all the way here 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.029
 we don't have to do it all at once 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.740
 and how far to the outside Armenia has some free I sit 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.710
 here against erwin persons 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.469
 but then you go more and more 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.430
 tackled from 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.039
 4 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.159
 I'm not right on you 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.159
 we are increasingly moving away from it 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.069
 that is the concern the first player I did not return against 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.460
 what I can do if you reach this sort of consensus 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.900
 I just sit down my friends 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.900
 to buy the reptile of their own homes 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:33.559
 only one point 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.469
 the mayor from the back to his own use 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.830
 as said 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.629
 that hollow leather 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.059
 not just but there are so many say about it 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:54.170
 Berlin 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.170
 for inter 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.789
 I didn't do that, don't keep your eyes yet 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.490
 especially closed on the roads 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.669
 because it may be that they have been wet and if you are already late on the 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.270
 Tuesday night a patella work on the ice to dampen that failed 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.699
 without land 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.699
 how to proceed further and look the other way actually the same 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.999
 do not you see 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.339
 so arise 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.039
 it is ultimately the 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.189
 to help 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:44.430
 and in that mine 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.919
 the damage 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.669
 and in between an hour of course to check if the lines are right 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.219
 and the second one succeeded when it dried up we are on our way to the 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:57.289
 crisis and you have and then you can see very well if it is right 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.919
 this is the up-close news articles 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.319
 that is actually only a small part comes from a closed book 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:29.599
 thank you very much view music next time anyway
