cocktails on the dovetail machine okay

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.080 
cocktails on the dovetail machine okay
so<00:00:38.200> they<00:00:38.380> do<00:00:38.560> our<00:00:39.240> Dugdale<00:00:40.710> machines<00:00:41.710> all

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
so they do our Dugdale machines all

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.880 
so they do our Dugdale machines all
preset<00:00:43.090> for<00:00:43.330> us<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:45.700> slide<00:00:45.970> everything<00:00:46.240> in<00:00:46.890> we

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
preset for us we slide everything in we

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.110 
preset for us we slide everything in we
line<00:00:48.130> it<00:00:48.160> up<00:00:48.400> make<00:00:50.430> sure<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.580> we're<00:00:51.730> clamped

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
line it up make sure that we're clamped

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.110 
line it up make sure that we're clamped
in<00:00:52.300> there<00:00:53.080> all<00:00:53.230> reset<00:00:53.710> with<00:00:54.490> a<00:00:54.520> collar<00:00:54.820> on<00:00:55.090> it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
in there all reset with a collar on it

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.900 
in there all reset with a collar on it
that<00:00:55.690> fits<00:00:56.080> into<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.560> each<00:00:56.620> groove<00:00:56.950> so<00:00:57.760> we're

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
that fits into the each groove so we're

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.310 
that fits into the each groove so we're
going<00:00:58.000> to<00:00:58.090> go<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:58.930> we're<00:00:59.050> just<00:00:59.170> going<00:00:59.290> to

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
going to go and we're just going to

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.620 
going to go and we're just going to
follow<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.710> groove<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.970> take<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.330> wheel

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
follow the groove and take that wheel

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:17.230 
follow the groove and take that wheel
and<00:01:02.110> make<00:01:02.260> our<00:01:02.410> dough

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.150 

all<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.660> got<00:01:18.840> some<00:01:18.870> slots<00:01:19.440> here<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
all right so we got some slots here and

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.360 
all right so we got some slots here and
then<00:01:21.120> these<00:01:21.480> these<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> duck<00:01:22.980> tails

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
then these these are the duck tails

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.220 
then these these are the duck tails
because<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.000> also<00:01:24.330> correspond<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
because they also correspond with the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.460 
because they also correspond with the
slots<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:25.980> look<00:01:26.160> like<00:01:26.310> dovetails

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
slots because they look like dovetails

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.710 
slots because they look like dovetails
there<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.550> just<00:01:30.300> put<00:01:30.570> some

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
there you go and then you just put some

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.940 
there you go and then you just put some
glue<00:01:30.870> he's<00:01:31.530> gaining<00:01:32.840> just<00:01:33.840> brush<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.620> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
glue he's gaining just brush it on and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.490 
glue he's gaining just brush it on and
then<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.630> need<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.870> brush<00:01:37.050> it<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.320> both

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
then do you you need to brush it on both

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.070 
then do you you need to brush it on both
pieces<00:01:37.800> of<00:01:37.979> wood<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.300> I<00:01:39.510> do<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
pieces of wood to that it's I do it I

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.300 
pieces of wood to that it's I do it I
mean<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:40.590> might<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.860> screwed<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> up

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
mean they might have screwed it up

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.080 
mean they might have screwed it up
putting<00:01:41.550> in<00:01:41.760> and<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.810> dunk<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.880> up

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
putting in and the dunk is this up

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.719 
putting in and the dunk is this up
strong<00:01:45.509> once<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.930> tried<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.680> never<00:01:47.460> really

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
strong once it's tried I never really

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.609 
strong once it's tried I never really
break<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.060> punch<00:01:53.720> just<00:01:54.720> put<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.050> together<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
break the punch just put it together and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:10.639 
break the punch just put it together and
it<00:01:55.800> takes<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.460> persuasion<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:10.470> when

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
it takes a little persuasion so when

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.229 
it takes a little persuasion so when
we're<00:02:10.770> doing<00:02:10.890> our<00:02:11.250> glue<00:02:11.489> what<00:02:11.970> we're<00:02:12.090> trying

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
we're doing our glue what we're trying

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.420 
we're doing our glue what we're trying
to<00:02:12.390> do<00:02:12.570> then<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.620> try<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.830> make<00:02:13.980> everything<00:02:14.220> out

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
to do then we try to make everything out

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.789 
to do then we try to make everything out
of<00:02:14.459> one<00:02:14.760> board<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:16.019> whenever<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.440> all<00:02:16.590> goes

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
of one board so whenever it all goes

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.550 
of one board so whenever it all goes
into<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.220> piece<00:02:17.459> edge<00:02:17.640> made<00:02:17.850> work<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.810> all

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
into the piece edge made work for it all

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.770 
into the piece edge made work for it all
the<00:02:19.950> grain<00:02:20.160> matches<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.209> looks<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:21.660> it

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
the grain matches so it looks like it

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.360 
the grain matches so it looks like it
was<00:02:21.900> all<00:02:21.989> kind<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.260> one<00:02:22.470> board<00:02:22.769> everything

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
was all kind of one board everything

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.910 
was all kind of one board everything
pulls<00:02:23.670> in
