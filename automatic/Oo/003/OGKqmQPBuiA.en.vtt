this<00:02:34.270> comes<00:02:34.570> with<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:40.510> nice<00:02:41.580> map<00:02:42.660> from<00:02:44.370> The

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
this comes with it's nice map from The

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.450 
this comes with it's nice map from The
Hobbit<00:02:45.550> oh<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:53.710> could<00:02:53.890> have<00:02:53.980> made<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.310> bit

yeah<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.660> was<00:02:58.840> hoping<00:02:58.990> this<00:02:59.200> map<00:02:59.410> would<00:02:59.560> be<00:02:59.680> a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
yeah I was hoping this map would be a

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.790 
yeah I was hoping this map would be a
lot<00:02:59.950> nicer<00:03:00.660> how<00:03:01.660> does<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.870> say<00:03:02.080> in<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.650> back

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
lot nicer how does it say in the back

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.490 
lot nicer how does it say in the back
just<00:03:03.250> some<00:03:03.430> dwarf<00:03:03.820> runes<00:03:04.240> but<00:03:05.080> that's<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.350> a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
just some dwarf runes but that's just a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.260 
just some dwarf runes but that's just a
waste<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.860> paper<00:03:06.010> that's<00:03:06.460> just<00:03:06.670> such<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.000> waste

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
waste of paper that's just such a waste

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.140 
waste of paper that's just such a waste
just<00:03:07.570> having<00:03:08.470> nothing<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> top<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.459> was

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
just having nothing on the top I was

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.120 
just having nothing on the top I was
going<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.330> compete<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.130> pocket

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
going to compete it to this pocket

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:22.150 
going to compete it to this pocket
edition<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.580> whole<00:03:12.730> bet<00:03:12.880> go<00:03:13.709> see

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.950 

can<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.250> get<00:03:23.370> them<00:03:23.550> both<00:03:23.730> also<00:03:24.510> open<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.840> like

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
can I get them both also open it be like

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.120 
can I get them both also open it be like
this<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:27.140> guess<00:03:28.140> it's<00:03:28.290> exactly<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.740> same<00:03:28.890> match

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
this I guess it's exactly the same match

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.100 
this I guess it's exactly the same match
the<00:03:29.310> extra<00:03:29.550> Scott<00:03:29.760> runes<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.960> make<00:03:31.050> it

the extra Scott runes on it to make it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.240 
the extra Scott runes on it to make it
look<00:03:31.230> further<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:34.530> it's<00:03:34.710> got<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:34.950> parchment

look further and it's got that parchment

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.460 
look further and it's got that parchment
kind<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.790> effect<00:03:38.000> some<00:03:39.000> maps<00:03:39.410> kind<00:03:40.410> of

kind of effect some maps kind of

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.670 
kind of effect some maps kind of
disappointing

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
disappointing

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.970
