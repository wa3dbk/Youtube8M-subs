00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 so for the first run you will need 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:11.210
 it is necessary to fall asleep coins precisely doctor 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.259
 on mode many make a mistake they 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.320

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.930
 coin acceptor start there 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.520
 pushing coins is wrong 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.130
 the sensor does not recognize them and accordingly 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.710
 the device writes that there is no change and will have 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.429
 will put them back in there now 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.070
 I will show how to do it right after 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.050
 of how the machine is loaded now 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.500

 do you have to press the first button 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.510
 this is the operator menu hold 2 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.590
 seconds you will hear a distinctive sound 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.550
 the machine says error 21 as I said 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:07.110
 previously you need to go home menu 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:11.490
 manual download so here we go down 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.650
 menu see cash click ok see 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.640
 manual loading click again ok 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.530
 writes here incomprehensible numbers now with us 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.549
 coin acceptors 2131 ruble 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.450
 in your case there will be 0 but starting 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.299
 load coins 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.329
 he will show them the coins 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.049
 from here where is the surrender written as if you are 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.549
 buy a product so here's your 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.549
 coin top five 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.250
 shows 5 and shows 201 means u 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.680
 we are already there two hundred and one such coin 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.649
 and accordingly we continue to thrust 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.470
 coins 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:59.299
 try another 500 also try 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.299
 Now for the top ten let's say 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:18.660
 a dozen went so recognize try 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:22.970
 one back and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.800
 and so on twos 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.790
 automatic how to say takes on delivery 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.290
 do not give twos therefore thrust 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.690
 coin acceptors do not need they will 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.660
 go here 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.489
 Accordingly, the task immediately on these 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.489
 try yes I do not worry this is the norm 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:51.750
 here something got out there accordingly 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:55.040
 many so look at the task we advise you 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.299
 somewhere around 300 rubles 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.790
 put for the first boot at the very 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.799
 In fact, the more the better 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.440
 if I'm not mistaken in each of the stupid should 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.739
 be at least 7 coins in each denomination 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:14.160
 so you can not restart them 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:20.430
 sorry, maybe after that just 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:25.650
 click back accordingly each time 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.100
 asleep and now we wait for it to load in 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.989
 our case will be written to bear the amount 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.030
 if all of you will be written 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.390
 city ​​sum means everything is done right 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.390
 the machine recognized everything if it was after all 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.140
 nothing has changed then advise when 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.840
 every procedure which 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.510
 executed do reset errors but we 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.010
 This is shown in another video therefore 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.010
 principle, we will not show
