go into all the science of it and will
go<00:00:24.960> into<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.199> bit<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> science<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.490> I

go into a bit of the science of it but I

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.830 
go into a bit of the science of it but I
want<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> make<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.150> simple<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.660> possible

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
buying I'm going to start off with the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.350 
buying I'm going to start off with the
airbox<00:00:33.390> okay<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.140> air<00:00:34.260> box<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.920> box<00:00:35.520> that's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
airbox okay the air box is box that's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
airbox okay the air box is box that's
underneath<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.110> fuel<00:00:37.469> tank<00:00:37.739> because<00:00:38.070> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
underneath the fuel tank because that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.910 
underneath the fuel tank because that
massive<00:00:38.670> fuel<00:00:39.360> tank<00:00:39.600> there<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.800> all

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
massive fuel tank there it's not all

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
massive fuel tank there it's not all
fuel<00:00:41.250> under<00:00:41.489> there<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.809> you'd<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.110> able

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
fuel under there if it was you'd be able

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.130 
fuel under there if it was you'd be able
to<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> lot<00:00:43.739> further<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.960> there's<00:00:45.960> usually

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to go a lot further but there's usually

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920 
to go a lot further but there's usually
an<00:00:46.530> air<00:00:46.710> box<00:00:46.950> either<00:00:47.250> under<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.760> or<00:00:48.539> under

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
an air box either under there or under

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.740 
an air box either under there or under
that<00:00:49.020> panel<00:00:49.379> there<00:00:49.559> at<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> back<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.750> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that panel there at the back but the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.600 
that panel there at the back but the
better<00:00:51.960> bikes<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.620> sport<00:00:52.890> gear<00:00:52.980> bikes<00:00:53.250> will

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
better bikes the sport gear bikes will

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.299 
better bikes the sport gear bikes will
have<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.120> underneath<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.690> fuel<00:00:54.930> tank<00:00:55.309> now

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
have it underneath the fuel tank now

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.920 
have it underneath the fuel tank now
what<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> air<00:00:57.420> box<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
what you want to do with the air box is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.349 
what you want to do with the air box is
make<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.410> climate<00:00:59.039> okay<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.969> air<00:01:00.120> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
make a little climate okay so the air is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
make a little climate okay so the air is
coming<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.840> from<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> front<00:01:01.859> or<00:01:02.070> under<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
coming in from the front or under the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.759 
coming in from the front or under the
seat<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.090> some<00:01:03.329> bikes<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.170> we've<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.530> quite<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
seat on some bikes and we've got quite a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.230 
seat on some bikes and we've got quite a
hot<00:01:04.890> pocket<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.640> probably<00:01:06.000> under<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
hot pocket so it's probably under the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.649 
hot pocket so it's probably under the
seat

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
seat

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.980 
seat
I<00:01:06.689> guess<00:01:07.080> done<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.510> it's<00:01:09.510> coming<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
I guess done all that it's coming in

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.789 
I guess done all that it's coming in
from<00:01:10.710> under<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> fuel<00:01:11.820> tank<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.560> going

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
from under the fuel tank and it's going

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.280 
from under the fuel tank and it's going
down<00:01:13.920> into<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.189> carbs<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.450> okay

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
down into the carbs which are here okay

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.910 
down into the carbs which are here okay
now<00:01:17.250> you'll<00:01:17.520> notice<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.330> carbs

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
now you'll notice that on your carbs

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
now you'll notice that on your carbs
that<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.640> linked<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.060> throne<00:01:21.479> okay

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
that they are linked to your throne okay

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
that they are linked to your throne okay
it<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.400> twist<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.880> makes<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.420> go

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
it was up here you twist it makes it go

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.200 
it was up here you twist it makes it go
faster<00:01:24.540> Wow<00:01:25.560> yeah<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:26.670> does<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.000> work

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
faster Wow yeah but how does that work

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.230 
faster Wow yeah but how does that work
okay<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.439> air<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.880> air<00:01:30.000> box

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
okay so the air that's in your air box

okay so the air that's in your air box
and<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.600> nice<00:01:30.810> little<00:01:31.110> climate<00:01:32.150> it's<00:01:33.150> been

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
and it's nice little climate it's been

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.960 
and it's nice little climate it's been
pulled<00:01:34.860> into<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.150> carps<00:01:36.890> by<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.970> pulling

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
pulled into the carps by you pulling

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
pulled into the carps by you pulling
open<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.630> throught<00:01:39.900> by<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.619> twisting<00:01:41.130> open

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
open your throught by you twisting open

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.240 
open your throught by you twisting open
your<00:01:41.520> throttle<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:43.020> will<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:43.409> go<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.799> how

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
your throttle and I will now go into how

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.160 
your throttle and I will now go into how
that<00:01:44.310> works

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
that works

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.649 
that works
okay<00:01:46.880> trying<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> make<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.240> simple<00:01:48.390> as

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
okay trying to make this as simple as

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.200 
okay trying to make this as simple as
possible<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.549> butterfly

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
possible so this here is your butterfly

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.679 
possible so this here is your butterfly
and<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:53.729> connected<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.420> throttle

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
and it's connected to your throttle

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
and it's connected to your throttle
cables<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.229> go<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.189> when<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
cables they go on this and when you

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.120 
cables they go on this and when you
twist<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:57.390> you'll<00:01:58.049> notice<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.860> this

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
twist your all you'll notice that this

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
twist your all you'll notice that this
little<00:01:59.520> thing<00:01:59.700> here<00:01:59.729> moves<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.170> can

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
little thing here moves because you can

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.069 
little thing here moves because you can
actually<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> most<00:02:02.130> bikes

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
actually see that most bikes

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.929 
actually see that most bikes
well<00:02:04.079> street<00:02:04.439> fighters<00:02:04.740> anyway<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.790> can

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
well street fighters anyway and you can

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.419 
well street fighters anyway and you can
see<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.930> when<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.320> turns<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:08.160> turns

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
see that and this when it turns it turns

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.530 
see that and this when it turns it turns
the<00:02:08.610> butterfly<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.440> allows<00:02:10.790> air<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.270> go

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the butterfly this then allows air to go

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
the butterfly this then allows air to go
into<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.470> car

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
into the car

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.880 
into the car
and<00:02:14.370> straight<00:02:15.000> through<00:02:15.420> into<00:02:16.110> your<00:02:16.410> engine

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and straight through into your engine

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.560 
and straight through into your engine
which<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.310> over<00:02:17.790> here<00:02:17.820> okay<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.330> can't

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
which is over here okay but you can't

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.670 
which is over here okay but you can't
just<00:02:21.750> run<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.110> bike<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.680> air<00:02:22.950> okay<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.440> from<00:02:25.440> your

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
just run a bike on air okay so from your

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.700 
just run a bike on air okay so from your
fuel<00:02:26.040> tank<00:02:26.430> which<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.180> up<00:02:27.300> above<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.750> you've

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
fuel tank which is up above you you've

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.190 
fuel tank which is up above you you've
then<00:02:28.890> got<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.100> fuel<00:02:29.430> tap<00:02:29.810> that's<00:02:30.810> Happ

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
then got a fuel tap that's Happ

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380 
then got a fuel tap that's Happ
sometimes<00:02:31.920> goes<00:02:32.100> into<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> pump<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:33.150> if

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
sometimes goes into a pump because if

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.050 
sometimes goes into a pump because if
it's<00:02:33.600> not<00:02:33.810> vac<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.350> if<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.800> not<00:02:35.060> vacuum

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
it's not vac there if it's not vacuum

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.510 
it's not vac there if it's not vacuum
fed<00:02:36.330> or<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:37.350> not<00:02:37.470> gravity<00:02:37.740> fed<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:38.430> it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
fed or if it's not gravity fed then it

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.800 
fed or if it's not gravity fed then it
will<00:02:38.610> need<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> pump<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.300> will<00:02:39.420> go<00:02:39.480> down<00:02:39.660> into

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
will need a pump it will go down into

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.740 
will need a pump it will go down into
the<00:02:39.959> pump<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:40.920> be<00:02:41.130> pumped<00:02:41.459> up<00:02:41.730> into<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the pump and then be pumped up into the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.420 
the pump and then be pumped up into the
float<00:02:43.080> Bowl<00:02:43.340> okay<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:45.060> float<00:02:45.390> Bowl<00:02:45.690> is

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
float Bowl okay this float Bowl is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.490 
float Bowl okay this float Bowl is
regulated<00:02:47.430> by<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.300> flow<00:02:48.570> inside<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.200> works<00:02:49.350> a

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
regulated by the flow inside it works a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.530 
regulated by the flow inside it works a
bit<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:50.160> toilet<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:51.180> you've<00:02:51.360> got<00:02:51.510> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
bit like you toilet now you've got a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.630 
bit like you toilet now you've got a
float<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> back<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.590> your<00:02:52.709> toilet<00:02:53.130> that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
float on the back of your toilet that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.060 
float on the back of your toilet that
make<00:02:54.300> sure<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.570> not<00:02:55.020> too<00:02:55.230> much<00:02:55.470> water<00:02:55.830> goes

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
make sure that not too much water goes

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.790 
make sure that not too much water goes
in<00:02:56.310> there<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.270> same<00:02:57.480> way<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.470> float

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
in there in the same way that this float

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.280 
in there in the same way that this float
Bowl<00:02:59.100> make<00:02:59.880> sure<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.450> you've<00:03:00.720> not<00:03:00.900> got<00:03:01.110> too

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
Bowl make sure that you've not got too

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.310 
Bowl make sure that you've not got too
much<00:03:01.410> fuel<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:02.010> there<00:03:02.450> okay<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:03.840> how<00:03:04.050> does

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
much fuel in there okay but how does

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.930 
much fuel in there okay but how does
that<00:03:04.470> fuel<00:03:05.000> then<00:03:06.000> get<00:03:06.570> into<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:08.070> air<00:03:08.250> okay

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
that fuel then get into the air okay

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
that fuel then get into the air okay
because<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.300> needs<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.600> be<00:03:09.750> atomized<00:03:10.410> into<00:03:10.770> the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
because it needs to be atomized into the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.000 
because it needs to be atomized into the
air<00:03:11.060> like<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.120> spray<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.590> when<00:03:13.800> it<00:03:13.890> goes

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
air like a spray so that when it goes

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.410 
air like a spray so that when it goes
into<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.340> engine<00:03:14.459> it's<00:03:14.730> not<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.180> big

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
into the engine it's not just in big

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.949 
into the engine it's not just in big
clumps<00:03:16.320> it's<00:03:16.970> it's<00:03:17.970> mixed<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.480> with<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.780> air

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
clumps it's it's mixed in with the air

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.190 
clumps it's it's mixed in with the air
thoroughly<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.640> mix<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.390> believe<00:03:21.930> 14

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
thoroughly and that mix is I believe 14

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.610 
thoroughly and that mix is I believe 14
point<00:03:22.560> 7<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:23.040> 1<00:03:23.480> which<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.510> can<00:03:24.959> change<00:03:25.230> with

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
point 7 to 1 which you can change with

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.289 
point 7 to 1 which you can change with
your<00:03:25.860> mixture<00:03:26.280> screw<00:03:26.549> which<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.090> have<00:03:27.209> in

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
your mixture screw which you have in

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.690 
your mixture screw which you have in
your<00:03:27.390> carbs<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.590> change<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.100> it's

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
your carbs so if you change that it's

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.850 
your carbs so if you change that it's
one<00:03:30.269> part<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.840> fuel<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:32.269> 14.7<00:03:33.269> there<00:03:33.570> as<00:03:34.260> far<00:03:34.799> as

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
one part of fuel to 14.7 there as far as

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.380 
one part of fuel to 14.7 there as far as
I<00:03:35.040> know<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.340> somebody<00:03:35.700> will<00:03:35.910> pull<00:03:36.090> me<00:03:36.180> up<00:03:36.269> in

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
I know and somebody will pull me up in

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.640 
I know and somebody will pull me up in
the<00:03:36.480> comments<00:03:36.660> if<00:03:36.930> I'm<00:03:37.080> wrong<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.500> one

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
the comments if I'm wrong on that one

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.180 
the comments if I'm wrong on that one
but<00:03:38.810> that's<00:03:39.810> what<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.049> ideally<00:03:40.709> want<00:03:40.739> with

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
but that's what you ideally want with

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.250 
but that's what you ideally want with
your<00:03:41.310> mixture<00:03:41.640> you'll<00:03:42.360> know<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.660> it's<00:03:43.049> not

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
your mixture you'll know that it's not

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.650 
your mixture you'll know that it's not
running<00:03:43.470> right<00:03:43.769> from<00:03:44.130> your<00:03:44.220> spark<00:03:44.549> plugs<00:03:44.880> okay

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
running right from your spark plugs okay

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.940 
running right from your spark plugs okay
if<00:03:46.080> your<00:03:46.350> spark<00:03:46.650> plugs<00:03:46.950> are<00:03:47.870> all<00:03:48.870> carbon<00:03:49.739> DUP

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
if your spark plugs are all carbon DUP

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.410 
if your spark plugs are all carbon DUP
then<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.580> means<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.970> you're<00:03:51.090> running<00:03:51.209> the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
then that means that you're running the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.590 
then that means that you're running the
mixture<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:52.220> either<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.459> choke<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.180> still<00:03:54.450> on

which is making it run rich running rich
means<00:03:57.150> you've<00:03:57.239> got<00:03:57.360> too<00:03:57.510> much<00:03:57.690> fuel<00:03:58.080> in<00:03:59.070> your

blistered okay if you get in blew smoke
out<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.030> back<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.840> means<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:23.010> it's

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
out the back that means that it's

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.860 
out the back that means that it's
nothing<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.700> do<00:04:23.820> with<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.060> fuel<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.479> really

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
nothing to do with the fuel in really

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.379 
nothing to do with the fuel in really
it's<00:04:25.110> just<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.860> your

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
it's just that your

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.860 
it's just that your
probably<00:04:28.099> head<00:04:29.099> gaskets<00:04:29.580> gone<00:04:29.759> because<00:04:30.689> I

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
probably head gaskets gone because I

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.929 
probably head gaskets gone because I
always<00:04:31.169> get<00:04:31.469> in<00:04:31.590> inside<00:04:32.159> you<00:04:32.370> said<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.550> want

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939 
always get in inside you said I want

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.409 
always get in inside you said I want
going<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.270> that<00:04:33.389> now<00:04:33.860> anyway<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:36.060> here<00:04:36.300> we've

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
going to that now anyway so here we've

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.589 
going to that now anyway so here we've
got<00:04:36.539> CV<00:04:37.020> carb<00:04:37.349> okay<00:04:38.219> that<00:04:38.370> means<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.819> as<00:04:38.999> this

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
got CV carb okay that means that as this

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.619 
got CV carb okay that means that as this
air<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.050> going<00:04:40.349> through<00:04:41.270> you've<00:04:42.270> got<00:04:42.479> your

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
air is going through you've got your

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.989 
air is going through you've got your
little<00:04:42.779> rubber<00:04:43.740> diaphragm<00:04:43.979> at<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.490> top<00:04:44.729> and

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
little rubber diaphragm at the top and

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.809 
little rubber diaphragm at the top and
it's<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:45.990> vacuum<00:04:46.620> so<00:04:47.129> as<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.490> air<00:04:47.639> goes

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
it's like a vacuum so as the air goes

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:56.080 
it's like a vacuum so as the air goes
through<00:04:49.849> it<00:04:50.849> lifts<00:04:51.389> up<00:04:51.569> this<00:04:53.810> piston<00:04:54.810> here<00:04:55.139> as

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
through it lifts up this piston here as

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.309 
through it lifts up this piston here as
that<00:04:57.090> slowly<00:04:57.479> lifts<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:58.979> lifts<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.490> needle<00:04:59.909> and

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
that slowly lifts it lifts a needle and

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:06.080 
that slowly lifts it lifts a needle and
your<00:05:01.319> pilot<00:05:01.740> jet<00:05:02.219> there<00:05:02.610> as<00:05:03.569> you<00:05:03.659> can<00:05:03.779> see<00:05:05.090> as

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
your pilot jet there as you can see as

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.939 
your pilot jet there as you can see as
that<00:05:06.300> needle<00:05:06.479> moves<00:05:06.840> out<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.139> way<00:05:07.289> allows

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
that needle moves out the way allows

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.649 
that needle moves out the way allows
fuel<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:09.270> be<00:05:09.689> sucked<00:05:10.250> into<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.819> fuel-air

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
fuel to be sucked into this fuel-air

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.769 
fuel to be sucked into this fuel-air
mixture<00:05:13.460> sucked<00:05:14.460> in<00:05:14.699> and<00:05:14.939> then<00:05:15.509> it<00:05:15.629> goes

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
mixture sucked in and then it goes

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:19.100 
mixture sucked in and then it goes
through<00:05:16.110> your<00:05:16.289> butterfly<00:05:16.770> okay<00:05:17.870> so<00:05:18.870> if<00:05:19.020> you

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
through your butterfly okay so if you

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.230 
through your butterfly okay so if you
can<00:05:19.199> imagine<00:05:19.319> this<00:05:19.830> you've<00:05:20.339> got<00:05:20.490> your<00:05:21.000> air<00:05:21.029> box

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
can imagine this you've got your air box

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.089 
can imagine this you've got your air box
up<00:05:21.449> here<00:05:21.800> sucking<00:05:22.800> air<00:05:23.219> through<00:05:23.930> air<00:05:25.099> because

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
up here sucking air through air because

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.980 
up here sucking air through air because
obviously<00:05:26.249> starter<00:05:26.999> motor<00:05:27.180> is<00:05:27.419> turning<00:05:27.870> your

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
obviously starter motor is turning your

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.129 
obviously starter motor is turning your
engine<00:05:28.379> over<00:05:28.969> which<00:05:29.969> is<00:05:30.180> then<00:05:30.360> sucking<00:05:30.870> this

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
engine over which is then sucking this

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.950 
engine over which is then sucking this
air<00:05:31.349> through<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:31.949> then<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.909> air<00:05:33.060> then<00:05:33.569> sucks

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
air through and then the air then sucks

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.480 
air through and then the air then sucks
the<00:05:34.560> fuel<00:05:34.979> through<00:05:35.310> Plus<00:05:36.300> this<00:05:36.509> needle<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.490> in

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
the fuel through Plus this needle and in

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.570 
the fuel through Plus this needle and in
and<00:05:38.930> depending<00:05:39.930> on<00:05:40.229> how<00:05:40.500> much<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:41.069> butterfly

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
and depending on how much the butterfly

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.879 
and depending on how much the butterfly
is<00:05:41.639> then<00:05:41.939> open<00:05:42.330> because<00:05:42.479> of<00:05:42.659> your<00:05:42.870> throttle<00:05:43.319> it

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
is then open because of your throttle it

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.240 
is then open because of your throttle it
will<00:05:44.219> allow<00:05:44.719> more<00:05:45.719> air<00:05:45.779> in<00:05:46.409> and<00:05:46.589> then<00:05:47.009> that

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
will allow more air in and then that

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.059 
will allow more air in and then that
will<00:05:47.460> in<00:05:47.610> turn<00:05:47.849> pull<00:05:48.240> more<00:05:48.539> fuel<00:05:48.899> through<00:05:49.229> but

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
will in turn pull more fuel through but

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.279 
will in turn pull more fuel through but
if<00:05:50.339> you<00:05:50.849> just<00:05:51.089> crack<00:05:51.419> your<00:05:51.629> throttle<00:05:51.930> open

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
if you just crack your throttle open

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.559 
if you just crack your throttle open
straight<00:05:52.589> away<00:05:52.889> and<00:05:53.129> this<00:05:53.849> bottle<00:05:54.120> fires<00:05:54.300> wide

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
straight away and this bottle fires wide

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.420 
straight away and this bottle fires wide
open<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:55.259> this<00:05:55.379> piston<00:05:55.649> is<00:05:55.919> out<00:05:56.039> of<00:05:56.069> the<00:05:56.279> way

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
open and this piston is out of the way

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.920 
open and this piston is out of the way
your<00:05:57.149> engine<00:05:57.449> will<00:05:57.599> cut<00:05:57.750> out<00:05:58.430> this<00:05:59.509> Val<00:06:00.509> this

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
your engine will cut out this Val this

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.670 
your engine will cut out this Val this
air<00:06:01.139> piston<00:06:01.620> here<00:06:01.860> is<00:06:02.069> there<00:06:02.879> vacuumed

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
air piston here is there vacuumed

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.879 
air piston here is there vacuumed
because<00:06:05.330> if<00:06:06.330> you've<00:06:06.930> just<00:06:07.110> got<00:06:07.199> a<00:06:07.289> rush<00:06:07.529> of<00:06:07.740> air

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
because if you've just got a rush of air

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.200 
because if you've just got a rush of air
coming<00:06:08.129> in<00:06:08.250> at<00:06:08.370> your<00:06:08.490> engine<00:06:08.639> it<00:06:08.969> won't<00:06:09.120> have

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
coming in at your engine it won't have

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.959 
coming in at your engine it won't have
time<00:06:09.509> to<00:06:09.810> pull<00:06:10.080> that<00:06:10.229> fuel<00:06:10.589> through<00:06:10.919> so<00:06:11.729> it'll

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
time to pull that fuel through so it'll

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.639 
time to pull that fuel through so it'll
just<00:06:12.000> be<00:06:12.180> air<00:06:12.419> going<00:06:12.629> in<00:06:12.839> and<00:06:13.080> it<00:06:13.199> will<00:06:13.289> stall

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:13.649 
just be air going in and it will stall

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:18.529 
just be air going in and it will stall
the<00:06:13.770> engine<00:06:14.089> ok<00:06:15.089> and<00:06:16.879> which<00:06:17.879> is<00:06:18.060> why<00:06:18.210> fuel

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
the engine ok and which is why fuel

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.610 
the engine ok and which is why fuel
injection<00:06:19.050> really<00:06:19.379> is<00:06:19.469> better<00:06:19.710> because<00:06:20.099> it

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
injection really is better because it

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.230 
injection really is better because it
doesn't<00:06:22.620> need<00:06:22.710> all<00:06:22.889> this<00:06:23.069> it<00:06:23.310> just<00:06:23.490> it<00:06:23.819> sprays

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
doesn't need all this it just it sprays

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.589 
doesn't need all this it just it sprays
the<00:06:24.449> fuel<00:06:24.919> elective<00:06:26.360> electronic<00:06:27.360> sensors<00:06:29.599> and

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
the fuel elective electronic sensors and

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.629 
the fuel elective electronic sensors and
the<00:06:30.930> ECU<00:06:31.379> telling<00:06:31.710> you<00:06:31.800> telling<00:06:32.310> it<00:06:32.370> how<00:06:32.430> much

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
the ECU telling you telling it how much

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.769 
the ECU telling you telling it how much
fuel<00:06:32.909> it<00:06:33.000> needs<00:06:34.250> so<00:06:35.250> obviously<00:06:35.550> that's<00:06:35.779> going

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:36.779 
fuel it needs so obviously that's going

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:37.679 
fuel it needs so obviously that's going
to<00:06:36.870> that

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:37.689 
to that

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.939 
to that
I've<00:06:38.110> try<00:06:38.319> not<00:06:38.499> to<00:06:38.589> make<00:06:38.679> it<00:06:38.830> complicated<00:06:39.099> and

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:40.949 
I've try not to make it complicated and

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.350 
I've try not to make it complicated and
I'm<00:06:41.949> not<00:06:42.099> even<00:06:42.219> going<00:06:42.339> to<00:06:42.369> go<00:06:42.460> either<00:06:43.029> and

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
I'm not even going to go either and

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.219 
I'm not even going to go either and
that's<00:06:43.509> what<00:06:43.659> I<00:06:43.689> was<00:06:43.779> talking<00:06:44.020> about<00:06:44.050> before

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
that's what I was talking about before

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.149 
that's what I was talking about before
the<00:06:44.770> throttle<00:06:45.219> and<00:06:46.319> pulling<00:06:47.319> on<00:06:47.499> one<00:06:47.919> cable

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:48.159 
the throttle and pulling on one cable

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.510 
the throttle and pulling on one cable
and<00:06:48.490> pushing<00:06:49.419> on<00:06:49.509> another<00:06:50.309> turning<00:06:51.309> that

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
and pushing on another turning that

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.639 
and pushing on another turning that
there<00:06:52.029> like<00:06:52.629> you're<00:06:52.929> turning<00:06:53.110> you<00:06:53.379> throttle

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:53.649 
there like you're turning you throttle

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:55.290 
there like you're turning you throttle
as<00:06:53.800> you<00:06:53.949> turn<00:06:54.159> you<00:06:54.249> throttle<00:06:54.610> that<00:06:54.879> will<00:06:55.059> turn

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
as you turn you throttle that will turn

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.639 
as you turn you throttle that will turn
and<00:06:56.279> like<00:06:57.279> that<00:06:57.459> it<00:06:57.729> will<00:06:57.939> open<00:06:58.749> the<00:06:59.169> butterfly

00:06:59.639 --> 00:06:59.649 
and like that it will open the butterfly

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:02.850 
and like that it will open the butterfly
okay<00:07:00.639> I'll<00:07:00.819> go<00:07:01.089> into<00:07:01.360> more<00:07:01.539> on<00:07:01.749> part<00:07:02.020> two<00:07:02.289> I'm

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
okay I'll go into more on part two I'm

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.159 
okay I'll go into more on part two I'm
