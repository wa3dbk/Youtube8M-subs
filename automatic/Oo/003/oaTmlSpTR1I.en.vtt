alive once again I do know a little bit
about<00:02:48.250> interstellar<00:02:49.090> I've<00:02:49.360> looked<00:02:49.630> up<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:50.020> few

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
about interstellar I've looked up a few

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.890 
about interstellar I've looked up a few
things<00:02:50.410> about<00:02:51.150> apparently<00:02:52.150> I'm<00:02:52.420> not<00:02:52.570> sure<00:02:52.780> if

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
things about apparently I'm not sure if

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.870 
things about apparently I'm not sure if
it's<00:02:53.020> in<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.260> future<00:02:53.880> not-too-distant

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
it's in the future not-too-distant

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.610 
it's in the future not-too-distant
future<00:02:54.940> or<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.390> it's<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.690> present-day<00:02:56.110> but<00:02:56.440> the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
future or if it's so present-day but the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.830 
future or if it's so present-day but the
world<00:02:56.800> basically<00:02:57.460> has<00:02:57.820> run<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.270> food<00:02:58.570> it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
world basically has run out of food it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.570 
world basically has run out of food it
seems<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.350> they<00:02:59.470> had<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.340> trailer

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
seems and they had that in the trailer

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.040 
seems and they had that in the trailer
where<00:03:00.910> we<00:03:01.120> don't<00:03:01.270> need<00:03:01.330> any<00:03:01.480> more<00:03:01.600> engineers

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
where we don't need any more engineers

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.850 
where we don't need any more engineers
we<00:03:02.320> need<00:03:02.350> more<00:03:02.800> food<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.660> idea<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.830> use

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
we need more food so the idea is to use

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.910 
we need more food so the idea is to use

the galaxy by this new technology I

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.510 
the galaxy by this new technology I
knows<00:03:25.780> never<00:03:25.990> possible<00:03:26.470> for<00:03:26.800> us<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.310> seems

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
knows never possible for us so it seems

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.000 
knows never possible for us so it seems

fan<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:05.100> think<00:04:06.100> no<00:04:06.220> one's<00:04:06.400> probably<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.850> best

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
fan I think no one's probably the best

fan I think no one's probably the best
director<00:04:07.990> around<00:04:08.350> right<00:04:08.770> now<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:10.000> still<00:04:10.420> think

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
director around right now I still think

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.990 
director around right now I still think
Spielberg's<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.830> best<00:04:12.070> all-time<00:04:12.520> but<00:04:12.760> right

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
Spielberg's the best all-time but right

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.880 
Spielberg's the best all-time but right
now<00:04:13.210> I<00:04:13.600> think<00:04:13.630> Nolan's<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.320> best<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.830> the

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
now I think Nolan's the best just the

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.780 
now I think Nolan's the best just the
way<00:04:15.070> with<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.970> cinematography<00:04:16.840> his<00:04:17.140> story

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.460 
guy who came up with the interstellar
theory<00:05:32.710> as<00:05:32.890> a<00:05:32.920> producer<00:05:33.550> so<00:05:34.170> Nolan's<00:05:35.170> movies

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
theory as a producer so Nolan's movies

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.590 
theory as a producer so Nolan's movies
are<00:05:35.620> usually<00:05:36.010> very<00:05:36.310> grounded<00:05:36.880> realistic

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
are usually very grounded realistic

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.360 
are usually very grounded realistic
movies<00:05:38.020> like<00:05:38.410> The<00:05:38.530> Dark<00:05:38.740> Knight<00:05:38.800> trilogy<00:05:39.070> that

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
movies like The Dark Knight trilogy that

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.010 
movies like The Dark Knight trilogy that
was<00:05:39.610> most<00:05:39.820> realistic<00:05:40.150> Batman<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:40.720> think<00:05:40.780> you

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
was most realistic Batman I think you

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.570 
was most realistic Batman I think you
can<00:05:41.200> do<00:05:42.120> inception<00:05:43.680> realistic<00:05:44.680> if<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.430> want

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
can do inception realistic if you want

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.710 
can do inception realistic if you want
to<00:05:45.640> look<00:05:45.760> at<00:05:45.910> it<00:05:46.000> that<00:05:46.150> way<00:05:46.360> even<00:05:46.540> though

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
to look at it that way even though

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.070 
to look at it that way even though
involves<00:05:47.140> dreams<00:05:47.970> prestige<00:05:48.970> very<00:05:49.480> realistic

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
involves dreams prestige very realistic

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.430 
involves dreams prestige very realistic
just<00:05:50.430> magic<00:05:51.430> movie<00:05:51.730> I<00:05:51.820> mean<00:05:52.030> all<00:05:52.990> Nolan's

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
movies are just something different it

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.050 
movies are just something different it
seems<00:05:55.720> so<00:05:56.020> I'm<00:05:56.950> thinking<00:05:57.340> her<00:05:57.430> celery's<00:05:57.880> gonna

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060
