approximately 11.11 meters per second or

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.289 
approximately 11.11 meters per second or
40<00:01:59.790> km/h<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.409> hecarim<00:02:01.829> traveled<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> 40<00:02:02.729> km/h

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
40 km/h so hecarim traveled a 40 km/h

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.690 
40 km/h so hecarim traveled a 40 km/h
let's<00:02:03.990> put<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.320> into<00:02:04.500> realistic<00:02:05.130> terms<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
let's put that into realistic terms the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.399 
let's put that into realistic terms the
fastest<00:02:06.090> horse<00:02:06.329> ever<00:02:06.600> recorded<00:02:07.140> according

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
fastest horse ever recorded according

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.350 
fastest horse ever recorded according
again<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> internet<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.700> winning<00:02:09.030> brew

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
again to the internet was winning brew

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.830 
again to the internet was winning brew
which<00:02:10.110> hits<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.739> speed<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.129> 70<00:02:11.550> km/h<00:02:12.060> which<00:02:12.569> puts

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
which hits a speed of 70 km/h which puts

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.270 
which hits a speed of 70 km/h which puts
hecarim<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.379> shame<00:02:13.590> kind<00:02:13.980> of

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
hecarim to shame kind of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.480 
hecarim to shame kind of
to<00:02:15.150> put<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.480> into<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.780> bit<00:02:16.020> more<00:02:16.170> perspective

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
to put that into a bit more perspective

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.470 
to put that into a bit more perspective
Conchords<00:02:17.490> top<00:02:17.760> speed<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.360> 2000<00:02:19.220> 172<00:02:20.220> km/h<00:02:20.490> a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
Conchords top speed was 2000 172 km/h a

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.990 
Conchords top speed was 2000 172 km/h a
little<00:02:22.260> bit<00:02:22.350> faster<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.550> speed<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.760> light

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
little bit faster and the speed of light

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240 
little bit faster and the speed of light
is<00:02:24.180> 1<00:02:24.360> billion<00:02:24.600> point<00:02:25.140> zero<00:02:25.380> seven<00:02:25.770> nine<00:02:25.800> two

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
is 1 billion point zero seven nine two

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.370 
is 1 billion point zero seven nine two
five<00:02:26.520> two<00:02:27.140> km/h<00:02:28.140> yeah<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:30.140> what<00:02:31.140> did<00:02:31.260> we

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
five two km/h yeah so what did we

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.070 
five two km/h yeah so what did we
achieve<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.300> probably<00:02:33.300> nothing<00:02:33.660> since

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
achieve with this probably nothing since

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.510 
achieve with this probably nothing since
you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.290> get<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.560> 10<00:02:34.830> K<00:02:35.040> movements<00:02:35.430> we

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
you can get like 10 K movements we

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.930 
you can get like 10 K movements we
Aramis<00:02:36.030> buries<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.270> fucking<00:02:36.690> faggot
