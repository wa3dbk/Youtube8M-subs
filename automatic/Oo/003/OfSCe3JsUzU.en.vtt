00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
obstacles to run into really early in

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470 
obstacles to run into really early in
the<00:00:40.980> run<00:00:41.219> which<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:41.879> much<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.180> far<00:00:42.210> as

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the run which is pretty much as far as

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.240 
the run which is pretty much as far as
you're<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> get<00:00:42.930> based<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:43.800> long<00:00:44.070> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
you're going to get based on how long it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.770 
you're going to get based on how long it
is<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.059> see<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.329> pretty<00:00:45.420> much<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
is you can see it's pretty much a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.770 
is you can see it's pretty much a
straight<00:00:45.809> shot<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> log<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> way

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
straight shot with a log in the way

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.029 
straight shot with a log in the way
which<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> only<00:00:49.050> foreseeable<00:00:49.410> thing<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
which is the only foreseeable thing and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.799 
which is the only foreseeable thing and
then<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.399> i<00:00:50.610> zoom<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.360> you're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
then as i zoom down here you're going to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.250 
then as i zoom down here you're going to
see<00:00:51.899> about<00:00:53.239> one<00:00:54.239> thing<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:55.199> thing

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260

you have to run it they have to avoid
but<00:00:57.739> still<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.890> can't<00:00:59.160> decide<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.730> too

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
but still you can't decide to get too

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.970 
but still you can't decide to get too

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
three test runs you can see that's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
three test runs you can see that's
really<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.020> an<00:01:10.229> easy<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.890> walk<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> park
