series in this lesson we'll continue
talking<00:00:06.290> about<00:00:06.710> exposure<00:00:07.160> modes<00:00:08.230> let's<00:00:09.230> talk

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
talking about exposure modes let's talk

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.290 
talking about exposure modes let's talk
about<00:00:09.590> the<00:00:09.830> modes<00:00:10.010> beyond<00:00:10.460> automatic<00:00:11.150> and

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
about the modes beyond automatic and

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.060 
about the modes beyond automatic and
scene<00:00:11.540> modes<00:00:11.809> that<00:00:12.110> can<00:00:12.320> be<00:00:12.440> found<00:00:12.620> on<00:00:12.830> all

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
scene modes that can be found on all

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.459 
scene modes that can be found on all
digital<00:00:13.490> SLRs<00:00:14.120> and<00:00:14.269> many<00:00:14.750> point-and-shoot

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:15.469 
digital SLRs and many point-and-shoot

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.580 
digital SLRs and many point-and-shoot
cameras<00:00:16.449> the<00:00:17.449> first<00:00:17.720> mode<00:00:17.990> will<00:00:18.140> cover<00:00:18.380> is

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
cameras the first mode will cover is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.130 
cameras the first mode will cover is
program<00:00:19.220> mode<00:00:19.490> which<00:00:19.940> is<00:00:19.970> usually<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.539> p<00:00:20.840> on<00:00:20.990> the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
program mode which is usually a p on the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.330 
program mode which is usually a p on the
dial<00:00:22.570> program<00:00:23.570> mode<00:00:23.810> is<00:00:23.930> similar<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.439> auto<00:00:24.650> but

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
dial program mode is similar to auto but

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.640 
dial program mode is similar to auto but
the<00:00:25.490> user<00:00:25.730> now<00:00:26.029> has<00:00:26.269> more<00:00:26.600> control<00:00:26.869> over<00:00:27.350> the

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
the user now has more control over the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.359 
the user now has more control over the
exposure<00:00:28.100> as<00:00:28.400> well<00:00:28.789> as<00:00:29.000> other<00:00:29.240> settings<00:00:30.369> the

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
exposure as well as other settings the

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.399 
exposure as well as other settings the
key<00:00:31.609> thing<00:00:31.849> to<00:00:31.880> remember<00:00:32.029> about<00:00:32.419> program<00:00:33.139> mode

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:33.409 
key thing to remember about program mode

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.349 
key thing to remember about program mode
is<00:00:33.679> that<00:00:34.039> the<00:00:34.129> camera<00:00:34.460> still<00:00:34.699> sets<00:00:34.969> a<00:00:35.089> shutter

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:35.359 
is that the camera still sets a shutter

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.180 
is that the camera still sets a shutter
speed<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:35.809> aperture<00:00:35.929> combination<00:00:36.859> to<00:00:37.039> get<00:00:37.159> a

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
speed and aperture combination to get a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.059 
speed and aperture combination to get a
proper<00:00:37.429> exposure<00:00:37.940> in<00:00:38.479> other<00:00:39.409> words<00:00:39.649> it's

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:40.069 
proper exposure in other words it's

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.500 
proper exposure in other words it's
still<00:00:40.370> easy<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.819> shoot<00:00:41.149> pictures<00:00:42.909> in<00:00:43.909> program

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
still easy to shoot pictures in program

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.719 
still easy to shoot pictures in program
mode<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:45.199> have<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.499> ability<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:46.100> shift<00:00:46.159> the

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
mode you have the ability to shift the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.930 
mode you have the ability to shift the
exposure<00:00:47.350> by<00:00:48.350> moving<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.769> cameras<00:00:49.129> dial<00:00:49.459> you

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
exposure by moving the cameras dial you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.759 
exposure by moving the cameras dial you
can<00:00:50.120> change<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.600> relationship<00:00:50.749> of<00:00:51.379> shutter

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
can change the relationship of shutter

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.849 
can change the relationship of shutter
speed<00:00:52.159> and<00:00:52.369> aperture<00:00:53.379> doing<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:54.530> will<00:00:54.709> let

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
speed and aperture doing that will let

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.680 
speed and aperture doing that will let
you<00:00:54.979> either<00:00:55.100> have<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.609> faster<00:00:56.149> or<00:00:56.329> slower

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
you either have a faster or slower

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.250 
you either have a faster or slower
shutter<00:00:57.079> speed<00:00:57.559> or<00:00:58.129> more<00:00:59.119> or<00:00:59.359> less<00:00:59.719> depth<00:01:00.079> of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
shutter speed or more or less depth of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.789 
shutter speed or more or less depth of
field<00:01:00.819> by<00:01:01.819> shifting<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:03.079> can<00:01:03.260> let<00:01:03.440> more<00:01:03.769> light

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
field by shifting you can let more light

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.639 
field by shifting you can let more light
in<00:01:04.070> through<00:01:04.609> the<00:01:04.729> lens<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.390> less<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:06.380> through

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
in through the lens and less in through

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.170 
in through the lens and less in through
the<00:01:06.799> shutter<00:01:07.100> or<00:01:07.549> vice<00:01:07.969> versa<00:01:09.729> now<00:01:10.729> let's<00:01:10.969> talk

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
the shutter or vice versa now let's talk

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.149 
the shutter or vice versa now let's talk
about<00:01:11.240> using<00:01:11.869> some<00:01:12.079> of<00:01:12.109> the<00:01:12.289> more<00:01:12.530> advanced

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
about using some of the more advanced

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.160 
about using some of the more advanced
modes<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.359> first<00:01:14.659> is<00:01:14.930> aperture<00:01:15.500> priority<00:01:17.170> it

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
modes the first is aperture priority it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.959 
modes the first is aperture priority it
lets<00:01:18.439> you<00:01:18.619> choose<00:01:18.829> an<00:01:19.009> aperture<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.609> want<00:01:19.820> to

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
lets you choose an aperture you want to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.300 
lets you choose an aperture you want to
use<00:01:20.179> then<00:01:20.719> the<00:01:20.869> camera<00:01:21.109> tries<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.890> select<00:01:22.219> a

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
use then the camera tries to select a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.709 
use then the camera tries to select a
shutter<00:01:22.549> speed<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.060> give<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.450> good

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
shutter speed to give you a good

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.380 
shutter speed to give you a good
exposure<00:01:24.579> why<00:01:25.579> do<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:25.850> use<00:01:26.060> aperture

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
exposure why do you use aperture

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.319 
exposure why do you use aperture
priority<00:01:27.219> primarily<00:01:28.219> to<00:01:28.460> control<00:01:28.789> depth<00:01:29.119> of

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
priority primarily to control depth of

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.660 
priority primarily to control depth of
field<00:01:29.689> for<00:01:30.380> how<00:01:30.590> much<00:01:30.770> of<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.039> image<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.520> in

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
field for how much of the image is in

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.169 
field for how much of the image is in
focus<00:01:31.700> from<00:01:32.450> front<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:33.049> back<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.670> lower<00:01:34.939> the

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
focus from front to back the lower the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.359 
focus from front to back the lower the
aperture<00:01:35.659> number<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.530> lower<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.979> depth<00:01:37.189> of

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
aperture number the lower the depth of

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.410 
aperture number the lower the depth of
field<00:01:37.670> for<00:01:38.420> example<00:01:39.020> f<00:01:39.789> 5.6<00:01:40.789> has<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.060> lower

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
field for example f 5.6 has a lower

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.730 
field for example f 5.6 has a lower
depth<00:01:41.689> of<00:01:41.869> field<00:01:42.140> than<00:01:42.409> f-22<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:45.380> next

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
depth of field than f-22 the next

depth of field than f-22 the next
exposure<00:01:46.159> mode<00:01:46.460> is<00:01:46.670> shutter<00:01:47.299> priority<00:01:48.520> it

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
exposure mode is shutter priority it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.340 
exposure mode is shutter priority it
lets<00:01:49.789> you<00:01:50.090> choose<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.359> shutter<00:01:50.719> speed<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:51.200> want

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
lets you choose a shutter speed you want

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.559 
lets you choose a shutter speed you want
to<00:01:51.499> use<00:01:51.679> then<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.280> camera<00:01:52.520> tries<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.270> select

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
to use then the camera tries to select

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.529 
to use then the camera tries to select
an<00:01:53.719> aperture<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.439> give<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.740> good<00:01:54.979> exposure

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
an aperture to give you a good exposure

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.200 
an aperture to give you a good exposure
so<00:01:56.539> why<00:01:56.749> control<00:01:57.139> shutter<00:01:57.409> speed<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:58.210> control

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
so why control shutter speed to control

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.200 
so why control shutter speed to control
the<00:01:59.450> speed<00:01:59.810> of<00:02:00.079> capture<00:02:00.850> shutter<00:02:01.850> speed

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
the speed of capture shutter speed

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.639 
the speed of capture shutter speed
determines<00:02:02.749> whether<00:02:02.929> action<00:02:03.409> in<00:02:03.499> your

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
determines whether action in your

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.229 
determines whether action in your
pictures<00:02:04.009> will<00:02:04.039> be<00:02:04.340> frozen<00:02:04.670> or<00:02:05.920> blurb<00:02:07.239> fast

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
pictures will be frozen or blurb fast

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.839 
pictures will be frozen or blurb fast
shutter<00:02:08.629> speeds<00:02:09.049> like<00:02:09.590> 15<00:02:10.159> hundredth<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.729> a

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
shutter speeds like 15 hundredth of a

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.270 
shutter speeds like 15 hundredth of a
second<00:02:11.239> will<00:02:11.390> freeze<00:02:11.690> at
