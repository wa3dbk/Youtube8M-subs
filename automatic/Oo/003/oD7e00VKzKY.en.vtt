00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 how about friends having here with another video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.609
 revives these voices they hear are not 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.120
 ghosts or communication of the other 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.280
 world are my neighbors and brought nothing more and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.099
 nothing less than a review davis words 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.080
 that is not the main cast of the show and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.330
 it is nothing more and nothing less than 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.330
 to be able to play to see truth 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.950
 mega class 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:34.280
 courtesy of my good friend rural iván 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:35.710
 iván rule bank run run that does not matter and 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.070
 go 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.629
 did you please sell me this figure 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.360
 as we can see polar cloud is 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.280
 transforms into a polar bear for 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.949
 that you sing steal me and steal me 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.360
 polar bear steals steals robs me I will 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.079
 bring who has lived in town 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.910
 Juarez as beyond 2000 knows more or 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.160
 less 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:04.960
 but well here we go see that it 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:07.630
 transforms and then unfortunately for 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.460
 the conditions of the rays v you 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.710
 you can realize a little bit that this 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.000
 figure has a little to fade from 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.800
 some nudes in the camera that 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.580
 he is also grabbing him but this is 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.830
 clearly a different tone and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.000
 Now let's see down here these three 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.710
 ryan sheets does not matter does not matter but 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.540
 well here we can see that polar cloud 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.060
 has a mechanism for us 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.159
 because if we push their feet 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.159
 back his bear legs 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.390
 very very very nice father has more 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 mechanisms like for example that if 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.850
 we press here 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.990
 the grip of the claw comes out 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.680
 very nice very very pretty very father very 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.880
 cool 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.190
 unfortunately the illusion that it is a 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 polar bear is ruined by several pieces 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.290
 of robots that walk around here that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.110
 been father if it had been coffee but 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.350
 it does not matter to transform it like 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.480
 first figures of piece words very 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640
 simple let's lower the legs of 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.560
 here 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.849
 we lower our legs towards here 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:29.060
 we are going to take off our feet, this is how they are 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.250
 like in between organic and half ok 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.560
 with us to open the part of the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.550
 easy 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.550
 to open it and 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.280
 and that's the sound of mortal kombat no 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:51.069
 could we miss let's remove these 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:56.150
 legs from here open all this piece 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:00.099
 open the part of here to rotate 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.099
 to close this assembly 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.540
 ok let's stop to fly cloud 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.370
 in this way we close the panel of now 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.269
 I know that the bear panel that is here 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.740
 we took the hands from here from where 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:25.400
 they are trapped 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:29.120
 we rotate and rotate 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.549
 and we settled and we have legs 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.879
 friends to polar cloud so 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.890
 simple that fast so it's not that I 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.250
 is transforming it badly or nothing by the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.640
 style that was how it was so fast and 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.530
 simple in bis words and like you 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.629
 you know in bis words there was also the 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.760
 custom of the mutant head that only 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.829
 spinning and that's the way it is 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.989
 just see what they see 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.989
 horrifying is the mutant head of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.590
 this is nightmare friends 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.620
 too much is already the normal face that 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.370
 it's also a nightmare I say see how 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.190
 see it is ugly key color is ugly but 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.049
 like many ugly see how good 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.449
 abdominal has and that's what you 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.070
 get girls or the fact that you walk 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.900
 in a carrazo I do not know I do not know I've never 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.300
 put to see the popularity of polar 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.910
 ass with women 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.810
 that these mechanisms are still working 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:41.289
 if we, we point the one of 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.110
 its legs here becomes the claw 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.280
 but the second the second mechanism is 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.280
 much more interesting 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.810
 that if we point here and 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.310
 we shoot 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.310
 like scorpion ok 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:10.990
 I hope this works if it is not so 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.990
 it looks like a kind of cannon 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.139
 and a bear's foot as well as a scorpion 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.560
 okay 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.349
 pull out a little helper that is nothing more 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.509
 and nothing less than a bat very 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.240
 nice leave some approach so that 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.979
 you see the bat and this one that is 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.580
 bat because they will not correct in 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.580
 the comics 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.020
 very nice very well detailed 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.420
 with skin they look down is really 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.830
 very good effort to 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.980
 also camouflage and pass as a 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.720
 bear tip very very good very very 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.570
 very good the truth is that these 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.450
 first days words it was hardly noticeable that 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.090
 they were like with experimentation and 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:02.240
 put proposals really usability 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.820
 we see that his knees turn a little 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:09.230
 they reflect their legs a little 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:11.480
 in front they flex their arms and turn 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.270
 a little bit with these pockets that are 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.800
 tight his head turns and that's 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.710
 all 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.379
 that is absolutely everything and therefore 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.259
 we basically see that the mechanisms are 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:26.479
 what makes this mega live or die 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.520
 that what was a voyager in that 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.440
 so if you look at me I'm now 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.819
 getting figures that did not appear in 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.349
 the show but it does not matter because that 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:39.310
 some were very good toys like 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.389
 this you see just the veins here 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.889
 very very beautiful 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.740
 some like pollock will achieve good 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.860
 toys 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.319
 Well really I prefer as I said 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.020
 time on facebook that the toys are 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:55.539
 adhering to memorable characters like 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.220
 they were the main cast of the peace 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.259
 but this is not a bad toy 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:03.430
 thanks, thanks 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:08.889
 Ivan for selling me this figure and for 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:11.380
 do me the favor of deviating me 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.240
 here is for all of you in this 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.550
 revision 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.889
 mine friends today to ovelar this is 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.889
 populate the cloud and we say goodbye
