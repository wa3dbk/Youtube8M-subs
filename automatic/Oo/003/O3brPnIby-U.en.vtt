00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
doing a fuel pump on a 2000 Mitsubishi

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.500 
doing a fuel pump on a 2000 Mitsubishi
diamante<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:07.580> we're<00:00:08.580> pretty<00:00:08.790> far<00:00:09.120> into<00:00:09.330> it

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
diamante and we're pretty far into it

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.820 
diamante and we're pretty far into it
now<00:00:09.630> we're<00:00:09.780> going<00:00:09.900> back<00:00:10.110> together<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.679> it

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
now we're going back together with it

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.570 
now we're going back together with it
now<00:00:12.200> we've<00:00:13.200> already<00:00:13.410> replaced<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.099> old<00:00:14.280> fuel

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
now we've already replaced the old fuel

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.730 
now we've already replaced the old fuel
pump<00:00:15.199> this<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.500> old<00:00:16.650> fuel<00:00:16.920> pump<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:18.740> don't

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
pump this is the old fuel pump I don't

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.410 
pump this is the old fuel pump I don't
know<00:00:19.830> if<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.010> says<00:00:20.189> Mitsubishi<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.300> or

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
know if it says Mitsubishi on it or

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.950 
know if it says Mitsubishi on it or
anything<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:22.910> it<00:00:23.910> looks<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.390> original

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
anything but it looks like original

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.370 
anything but it looks like original
equipment<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:27.570> reason<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:27.930> car<00:00:28.140> won't

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
equipment so the reason this car won't

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.820 
equipment so the reason this car won't
start

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
start

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.519 
start
maybe<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.359> fuel<00:00:30.630> pump<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.990> bad

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
maybe this because this fuel pump is bad

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.610 
maybe this because this fuel pump is bad
so<00:00:32.309> we've<00:00:32.430> already<00:00:32.640> pulled<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.090> one<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.620> we
