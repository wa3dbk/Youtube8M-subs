00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.049

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.240
 today the touch tablet weigh 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:15.690
 4 904 storex so this touch pad 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 was equipped with a tile 9 inch tn 1 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.630
 so I 'll show it to you this is this 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.109
 pretty this pretty tablet is so 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.580
 it is a memory of 4 gigas and equipped 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.829
 of the android system 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.030
 4.2 and of course pesto rhin so I 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:44.059
 come back a little bit on this slab tn 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.590
 and here I am lighting it up and so 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 what is the slab tn the slab tn 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.399
 is a value with viewing angles 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.660
 a little narrow here is where 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.309
 by the way we see her see her 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.590
 touch to turn this is so good we have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.500
 good visibility as on this 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.260
 slab that is she pretty colorful enough 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 bright I think it's nice even if 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.210
 it's a slab tn the laws of a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.700
 alipay to sow and it stays calm very 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.630
 friendly one so the memory and 4 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.750
 gigas we can we can extend it in 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.610
 brews 1 to the little connector there on 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.450
 which one can connect a sd card from 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.450
 32 gigas 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.020
 so android 4 points 2 which gives 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.299
 access of course to pesto so I 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.619
 recalls that in order to have access to 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.710
 beavers on this tablet 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:47.710
 so you have to register a gmail account 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.149
 so you have to create an account of all 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.350
 parts one must not take into account 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.420
 that you already have because 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.219
 sanctioning not and so from that 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.939
 moment there once you've created your 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.409
 gmail account 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.409
 it works perfectly 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:10.750
 as for the internet connection 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:13.810
 so I remember here network so here 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.530
 wifi internet connection it works 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.209
 very well too 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.230
 I did not have problems like 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:23.349
 connect with my freebox 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.120
 no connections no problem 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.660
 works very well 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.859
 so there's a little trick on the internet for 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.380
 show you a little the fluidity of 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:38.079
 the device works fine 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.079
 it works very well I heard 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.569
 a lot of things on this tablet 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:48.489
 about responsiveness I find myself 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.780
 nice game I remember its price 1 75 euro 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.370
 at giant casino right now in 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.680
 c promote the outputs to tablets 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.889
 150 euros 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.389
 I really find it for the price 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.389
 it's a pretty tablet 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.790
 at the connection level we have a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.540
 hdmi output the same headphone connector 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.490
 three points it's a usb output 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.420
 so I remember the small exit sd 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.830
 for whoever wants to simply extend 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.450
 nice things that was planned a button 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.100
 which reset button in case the nooks 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.280
 only very good plant will it happen a 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.680
 nothing bad 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.080
 this is the moment I bought it confiscated 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.700
 eight years ago and I find that for 75 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.670
 euros 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.270
 a tablet of 9 12% of 8 years is 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.290
 well it allows him to start already at 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.760
 use the tablets and this universe 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.850
 while not always know what we 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.440
 so that's apart from that at the level 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.150
 autonomy 4h30 autonomy in full 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.420
 use 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.709
 there I have 35% of batteries left between 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.340
 use and watch the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.510
 tablet is at 14:47 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:14.510
 it's 14h47 it's not bad it's not bad 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.799
 I saw a lot less I saw better 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.479
 but it's not bad 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:25.160
 So that's it for this tablet 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:26.720
 really really very nice I you 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.750
