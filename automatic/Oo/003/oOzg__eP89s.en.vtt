00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.390
 it is not always important after a 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.430
 victory 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.520
 and in the way that the 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.910
 team I think it's important that 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.100
 grasping that mystique that they promised 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.590
 as we say to miss more than like days 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.050
 say more or less for the game but if 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.730
 keep working the same thing going 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.210
 advancing what he wants the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.529
 movements all about everything 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.440
 there was not doing well 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.410
 going polishing things is always important 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.470
 they will reach the rival 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.660
 from the front that the truth is something very 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.210
 cute and more on the court and more when 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.390
 I do not know if many of you noticed 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.059
 that we were going to lose good is part of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.520
 this is part of football and you have to be 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.460
 calm and keep working action 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.130
 yes look inside us 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.740
 we knew 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.110
 to which we are going to seat an opponent 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.560
 is that really hard that over there 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.259
 They go first 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.360
 I think that with the approach he made 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.290
 the teacher got me a lot of help from 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 they I never had 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.000
 I had seen a team that goes super 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.160
 leader and that he has made the changes that 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 he did at halftime to get a 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.630
 steering wheel impose a corporate exchange 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.370
 and many things means that cougars 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.030
 went and stood on their court 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.440
 very good that there was no difference or 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.450
 it is better to win but there was no 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.700
 difference in what is the super leader 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.460
 when that one was doing may 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.370
 give the firmware equal to the same and the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.830
 true we inside we knew 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.900
 seeing what we were facing but 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.940
 with that desire to take out our 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.860
 those parties winning the death are 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.119
 can death but we have to give 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.619
 thanks to the fortune play or not the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.450
 three points remained here and the truth 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.880
 We are happy 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.380
 and it 's important to win at home 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.050
 is to assert the locality of saving 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.510
 our people beyond that cougars 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.700
 have to try side but at home 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.800
 It's always nice because it's coming 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.900
 all the people because they have our 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.810
 families and they are here are supporting us 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.860
 and we always want to leave you the best 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.450
 that I believe that after a victory 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.880
 like the one we had over the weekend 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.700
 I think it's important to win at home 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.950
 provide a victory for the people who 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.260
 which is given weekend after order 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.630
 of the week and those who are always with 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.489
 us so I think it's going to be very 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.260
 important to win at home and start 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.650
 to assert the location because we have 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.379
 that make our house worth 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.569
 invite them to stay happy in 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.129
 the team that the team is very good and 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.099
 that together because that's also part 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:55.269
 fundamental for us without them the 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.230
 truth would be impossible things so 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.930
 invite them to always fill in the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.569
 team and that so much work 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.430
 what they do inside make you 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.930
 back to win at home and before 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.930
 this field is invincible 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.670
 first of all we have to win 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.670
 here at home it is necessary 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 to stay on the bench for 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.840
 so that the team keeps growing and 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.630
 be there try to cut the French 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.760
 with the equipment that also in the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.970
 first places and with respect to 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.440
 tigers 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.110
 we know that it is a very very team 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.680
 complicated has great players a 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.790
 great coach and you do not have to trust 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.340
 for her that they are not giving 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.500
 some results we know what 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.840
 let's face a great team and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.490
 we are exams yes I think it has been 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.350
 I work a little 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.020
 different is what we live doing is 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.010
 the worker more 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:03.400
 in the tactical part of the team what 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.630
 which I think is important for these 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.010
 matches to grow 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.760
 what is due to better performance 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.100
 the team and I think part slightly 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.280
 there of what was done differently to the cycle 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.000
 previous 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.880
 and more than anything the sense of trying to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.850
 do it team as I said intense that 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.130
 no lost role that is 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.160
 ordered that is compact and that tries 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.200
 of assaulting the private and I think by the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.620
 moment is the team could do is 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.770
 carry out the idea that pretends here 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.680
 the important thing is that the team lift 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.350
 that is whoever is any name like that 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.980
 that the most important thing is the team 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.980
 He directed
