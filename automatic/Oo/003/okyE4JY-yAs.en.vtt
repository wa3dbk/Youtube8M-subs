00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.600 
I'm coming on here today with some
natural<00:02:42.120> hair<00:02:42.570> realness<00:02:43.380> for<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.190> ladies

natural hair realness for you ladies

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.580 
natural hair realness for you ladies
because<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.810> type<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.050> things<00:02:46.410> that

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
because this is the type of things that

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.800 
because this is the type of things that
I've<00:02:46.709> been<00:02:46.860> going<00:02:47.220> through<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:48.450> hair<00:02:48.690> is

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
I've been going through as my hair is

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.330 
I've been going through as my hair is
grown<00:02:49.140> out<00:02:49.440> as<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:50.070> getting<00:02:50.190> longer<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.120> so

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
grown out as it's getting longer and so

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.150 
grown out as it's getting longer and so
the<00:02:53.340> detangling<00:02:53.970> process<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:55.200> today<00:02:55.620> can

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the detangling process like today can

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.210 
the detangling process like today can
sometimes<00:02:56.700> really<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:58.680> something<00:02:58.980> that

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
sometimes really be just something that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.070 
sometimes really be just something that
you<00:02:59.340> are<00:02:59.370> not<00:02:59.519> looking<00:03:00.000> forward<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.959> I'm
