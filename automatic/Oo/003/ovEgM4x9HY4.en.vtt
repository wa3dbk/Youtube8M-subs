00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello on our youtube channel the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.559
 company freeware my name is andreas and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 I present you canton 3 today 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.820
 professional from home b 242 already 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.160
 everything from the carton so far 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.220
 unpacked we start 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.400
 left it would be two 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 complete sets of propellers beautiful 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.579
 packs them our black sand 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.309
 bag then still the well-known 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.380
 budget sticker this version with 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.580
 metallic look 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.250
 then we have the charger with us 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.650
 power cord to the charger you can 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.490
 The following say normal outlet 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.010
 plug in 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.380
 we have two loader outputs one is 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.460
 for the battery of the body the other 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.980
 is then for the sender 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.860
 because in this remote control of the bdi 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.110
 is the battery in the transmitter can 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.739
 also not be replaced then 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.890
 we still have a small USB cable for 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.229
 connect for firmware update etc 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.210
 then we have a little bag 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.090
 with adhesive patch for under this country 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.070
 frame the damper small tool for the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.020
 motor to change the propeller 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.710
 because of gums and again 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.650
 safety belt kris gemmell so then 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.600
 we have something here in the operating battery 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.970
 differs from that of the phantom 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.470
 two we have a tension of 15 here 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:40.800
 2 volt and electricity market of 4,480 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.720
 milliampere here we have the transmitter 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.780
 the field directly on that of the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.850
 Inspire is very similar we have here 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.700
 the on and off button coming home 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.950
 Button completely normal remote control 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.820
 skripal two antennas then on the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.270
 right side in poti stepless two 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.769
 have push buttons on the left side 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.910
 we centered a turning poti left and 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.830
 right always jumps in 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.910
 center back here too 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.240
 Push button and the 3d failed 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.530
 then we have on the back 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.810
 in any case on the left and right one 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:30.920
 push button on the head we have two usb 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.000
 Connections a normal usb and a 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.040
 mini usb connection 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.900
 we can get to the heart of the head 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.360
 you see a lot of difference on the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.460
 first look not 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.530
 Here we have fixed the 3 axle gÃ¼mbel 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:54.590
 Camera with a small plastic part 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:57.260
 the four camera still looks the same 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.360
 when I turn my head we see 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.930
 tackle here then wants to seek 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.120
 sd card slot micro sd card people 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.940
 continue to turn here, of course, there clearly 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.550
 comes the battery rhine in the sky itself 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.950
 you do not see so much 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.660
 on the other side then the mini usb 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.350
 entrance also think about the company update 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.180
 so that as much of the sky itself 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.200
 well known is the usb socket on 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.170
 head or even for firmware updates so 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.300
 then we have a change 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.100
 landed 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.410
 you can see that when you have it in hand 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.860
 one antenna falls from each one 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.330
 leg 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.290
 say we have four antennas for 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.370
 disposal 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.350
 Here is the compass 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.300
 and what is now strikingly dramatic 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.730
 it in principle the new sensorics 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.920
 ultrasonic sensors to just one 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.640
 flight stable flight behavior indoor 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.950
 to ensure area so that was 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.010
 our short product presentation for the 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.480
 phantom 3 from home the fia he has to 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.580
 very briefly mentioned this is it 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.500
 not to serial model speak it 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.110
 may also change 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.960
 dpa can arise at home 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.820
 What I can say is that she is the one 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.560
 Headphones definitely already on us 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.560
