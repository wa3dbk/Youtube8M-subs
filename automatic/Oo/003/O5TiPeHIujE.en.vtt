00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
for big estates not so much for a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.680 
for big estates not so much for a
backyard<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.489> thought<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.329> cheaper<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
backyard but I thought it's cheaper to

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.660 
backyard but I thought it's cheaper to
do<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> backyard<00:00:37.320> than<00:00:37.860> buy<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> big

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
for online because putting it together

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.170 
for online because putting it together
I<00:01:09.920> took<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> doing<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.880> those<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
I took a bit of doing and those are the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
I took a bit of doing and those are the
parts<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.689> left<00:01:12.900> over<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.680> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
parts we have left over so I know I

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460 
parts we have left over so I know I
don't<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.880> need<00:01:15.180> any<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.570> those<00:01:15.750> no

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
don't think we need any of those no

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.910 
don't think we need any of those no
actually<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:18.420> did<00:01:18.630> figure<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.770> these

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
actually we did figure it out so these

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
actually we did figure it out so these
two<00:01:20.189> parts<00:01:20.580> go<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.150> make<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.479> into<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
two parts go on to make it into the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.160 
two parts go on to make it into the
blower<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.909> now<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
blower and right now we have it in the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.609 
blower and right now we have it in the
vacuum<00:01:26.000> mulcher<00:01:27.000> mode<00:01:27.299> okay<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
vacuum mulcher mode okay and the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.120 
vacuum mulcher mode okay and the
mulching<00:01:29.070> mode<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.549> great<00:01:30.200> because<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.860> will

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
mulching mode is great because it will

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
mulching mode is great because it will
much<00:01:32.400> mulch<00:01:33.180> leaves<00:01:34.759> 18<00:01:35.759> times<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.659> think

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
much mulch leaves 18 times I think

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.969 
much mulch leaves 18 times I think
that's<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.470> said

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that's what they said

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.940 
that's what they said
18<00:01:38.700> times<00:01:38.880> which<00:01:39.390> means<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:40.500> would<00:01:40.619> fit<00:01:40.829> in

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
18 times which means what would fit in

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.179 
18 times which means what would fit in
normally<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.759> bag<00:01:42.470> 18<00:01:43.470> bags<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:44.159> be

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
normally in one bag 18 bags will be

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
normally in one bag 18 bags will be
mulch<00:01:44.579> down<00:01:44.909> into<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> show

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
mulch down into one so I'm going to show

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.030 
mulch down into one so I'm going to show
you<00:01:46.110> how<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.380> works

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you how that works

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.249 
you how that works
we're<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.479> cloth<00:01:48.899> bag

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
we're going to put it in this cloth bag

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.380 
we're going to put it in this cloth bag
which<00:01:49.710> I'll<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:49.920> empty<00:01:50.549> into<00:01:50.820> another<00:01:51.119> bag

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
which I'll then empty into another bag

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.590 
which I'll then empty into another bag
or<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.290> buy<00:01:52.439> disposable<00:01:52.860> bags<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.450> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
or you can buy disposable bags but that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
or you can buy disposable bags but that
seemed<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.259> wasteful<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> me<00:01:56.420> okay

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
seemed a little wasteful to me okay

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.219 
seemed a little wasteful to me okay
