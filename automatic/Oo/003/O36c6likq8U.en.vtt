 online mode that we have more is worth as 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.290
 is saying only that you are 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.150
 asking many people how to 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.130
 can build and how does it explain a 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.539
 How can you build vouchers? 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.279

 among the subscribers and also with me 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.670
 when we play online mode, I'll warn 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.590
 by twitter is I'm going to play in the crack and 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.750
 I'm going to play in the brick forte and 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.460
 you will have me, I will make you my idea and 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.230
 there will not be any kind of problem like 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.579
 you see let's create a map a lot of 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.040
 you more seen and sukkur and how it 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.350
 create a map is very easy we get into 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.090
 build and here in create when we 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.460
 put titles we will have to put them 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.070
 a title not the name of the map not a 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.420
 title for example spain fury vale le 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.800
 We put titles to influence the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.989
 password you want four 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.730
 digits there will not be any kind of problem 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 we choose well to build as I tell you 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.170
 I already have one called Bomberman 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.160
 we want it to be called turning where 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 every 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.690
 the little symbol of question is valid here 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.390
 we take one and we have to put a 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.460
 title to maps enter a title 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.470
 we put bomber come that because I already have 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.450
 one is called bomberman and in the sky 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.640
 we will choose a green sky is red blue 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.470
 the most normal thing is that it's blue, it's worth 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.380
 make it quite daytime and we get 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.880
 to create good as you see we are 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.590
 within the first one that is going to put a 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.130
 tutorial because you already know that this game 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.020
 it would be called duty minecraft would be a very 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.690
 good name to put it because because 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.940
 a game that is combined between shots 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.470
 that would be shooter and creator that would be 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.899
 minecraft we can create what you give us 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.250
 he wins and we can use weapons because 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.050
 I bring this game to the channel because it is 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.940
 free, because many people do not 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.110
 they have the need to be able to buy a 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.789
 game is worth the truth that there is not the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 oven for buns let's say and all the 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.729
 world can not spend enough money 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.140
 to play with youtube well has it 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.509
 seemed like game to put place 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.910
 online mode with subscribers and a 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.070
 free game worth with a pc that does not 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.590
 It needs to be fairly high 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.599
 price a regular regularito pc quoted that 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.450
 we have it at home we can play it 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.640
 without any problem 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.280
 online and not with me also with 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.020
 your friends and it's very easy how is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.730
 going up we will see a bar that 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.070
 has quite different materials per 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.070
 example we have grass we have grass 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.930
 we have earth we have wood iron and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.240
 stairs we can do what we want 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.860
 with these materials is very easy one 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.110
 box office we are doing here as you see 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.120
 Can be adjusted up with clean 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.460
 left you put the material you want 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.920
 and with right click you can remove it vale 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.750
 they will be unlimited and we will be able to use 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.880
 everything we want for example already 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.200
 I assumed tower a pretty tower not 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.640
 tell me that it is not pretty 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.590
 and here we can put a ladder 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.820
 how we take the stairs of the bar 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.680
 above with the mouse is worth has a 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.360
 Roulette we give advertising to the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.770
 sides and we can modify what 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.480
 we want up there will be no 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.980
 kind of problem with the material that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.170
 we open a door we remove it 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.790
 and when our castle is created 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.010
 for example look I already created my 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.290
 fury castle when you save the game 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.480
 in escape you will save the game you will be able to 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.310
 save the guard and nobody will be able to 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.230
 modify your maps 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.489
 that is, if you publish the map for 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.950
 play with your friends 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.410
 nobody will be able to modify the map only 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.880
 you in creative mode is to say yes 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.250
 We open a door here and keep the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.680
 map when we publish it nobody will be able 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.780
 play it in online mode you can play it 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.280
 but do not modify it at the end what good 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.440
 it's quite good as you are seeing 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.269
 we can create our own maps and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.569
 there two different maps there are 50 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.099
 450 and 100% if you want a large map 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.319
 to create our world your houses 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.870
 your turrets your bunkers what 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.000
 only thing I had to do is 100% and 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.340
 If you want a smaller one I would take 50 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.780
 for 50 you can do it with a friend 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.000
 you can invite him to do it with 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.500
 you do not have to do it alone 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.090
 for example in the comments 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.739
 look I have it I want to play with me 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.599
 who wants I have micro I do not have 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.450
 micro we communicate by skype by 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.459
 message and what I want is that between 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.840
 Subscribers have support between 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.549
 you can play between 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.140
 you who entertain each other 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.630
 you and I will also play with 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.239
 you mean when you reach level 17 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.769
 I'm going to make a plan and in the clan we're going to 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.940
 enter all the subscribers that I had 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.850
 martÃ­n game mode online 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.980
 is a game in which we can create in 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.140
 which we can shoot kill us between 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.630
 we take a few laughs that 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.880
 that's what youtube is about. 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.280
 the consoles to entertain us between 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.930
 us to seek new friendships and 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.270
 have a free game 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.910
 I thought it was quite good as you see 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.500
 let's create now a bunker like 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.300
 we created the bunker in a very 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.430
 easy left click with the material that 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.590
 we want to use the income with which 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.420
 We want to remove it, it will disappear 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.970
 only one click and it will appear 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.040
 just one click to put it as 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.050
 you are seeing we can create everything for 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.450
 up what we want and it will have advantages 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.670
 who believes the highest tower because it is 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.040
 say you put yourself in a block of flats 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.510
 that is tremble that of good floor 10 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.790
 plants the track block is worth 10 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.440
 plants and you see what they are under 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.090
 but the one below is going to cost you 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.610
 It's a lot of work to see the one above 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.230
 then the one that has enough height goes 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.880
 to have preference in the war and 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.860
 You can win most battles 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.600
 that play against other friends aller or 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.520
 enemies of my clear because here you 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.180
 you get into multiplayer and you can play with 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.880
 enemies and there will be no type 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.770
 at no cost or anything will be free and 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.870
 you can download it totally free 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.580
 the description you will have how we are going 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.039
 to do here I'm doing a bunker 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.199
 a bunker for me I'm going to tell you one 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.419
 practice because if you read yourselves 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.460
 you whatever you want to call him you put him 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.009
 a tecito nobody will be able to enter inside 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.660
 because because we put him or zinc that 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.430
 also worth serves is intense for 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.380
 minute he answered it in case it rains 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.590
 because it rains we have here a little bit 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.300
 to take refuge as you see inside him 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.250
 we can make a hole up and you 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.630
 we can put one in generates if you 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.130
 We can put a ladder or we can 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.900
 open a door without any kind of 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.970
 problem is like having here we can 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.280
 choose the different materials here 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.080
 we open a door or we can cover it and 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.449
 put a ladder without any kind of 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.889
 problem and we went through the roof os 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.349
 I remember that once we 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.479
 we modify maps will not be able to enter nor 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:14.720
 modify them they mean if you do not have 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.389
 double hollow will not be able to rise and we 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.440
 we will only be inside the bunker 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.150
 well once we make the ship you 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.070
 we can make a window and here 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.470
 is going to get today's tutorial to create 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.330
 the map and the next we were playing 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.920
 or three multiplayer because I'm 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.470
 Looking forward to playing with you a game 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.780
 pretty attractive we can use 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.610
 machine gun snipers we can 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.830
 use grenades we can use kit 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.590
 of rescue is a game that getting 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.240
 points we can have several objectives and 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.520
 we can make subscribers center 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.830
 ok I hope you play the game you know 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.730
