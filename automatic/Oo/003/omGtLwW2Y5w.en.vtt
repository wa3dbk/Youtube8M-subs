00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
with your moisturizer it's pretty nice I

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
with your moisturizer it's pretty nice I
haven't<00:00:38.790> noticed<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> huge<00:00:39.390> difference<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
haven't noticed a huge difference at the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.569 
haven't noticed a huge difference at the
moment<00:00:40.879> I<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.239> noticed<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.739> my<00:00:44.280> skin

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
moment I have noticed that it is my skin

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.060 
moment I have noticed that it is my skin
is<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.149> nicer<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.890> smoother<00:00:46.890> not

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
is a little bit nicer and smoother not

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.529 
is a little bit nicer and smoother not
so<00:00:47.250> much<00:00:47.399> even<00:00:47.610> time<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.180> didn't<00:00:48.450> really

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
so much even time but I didn't really

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.799 
so much even time but I didn't really
have<00:00:48.750> much<00:00:48.780> pigmentation<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.770> begin<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.219> so

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
have much pigmentation to begin with so

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.439 
have much pigmentation to begin with so
that<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.989> probably<00:00:52.260> why<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.610> same<00:00:53.850> time<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that is probably why at the same time I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.720 
that is probably why at the same time I
was<00:00:54.629> also<00:00:54.840> doing<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.320> two-week<00:00:55.739> clinic

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
was also doing a two-week clinic

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
was also doing a two-week clinic
challenge<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.960> consists<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.770> the<00:01:00.440> liquid

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
challenge which consists of the liquid

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.310 
challenge which consists of the liquid
facial<00:01:02.340> soap<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.850> mild<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.780> clarifying

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
facial soap in mild the clarifying

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.770 
facial soap in mild the clarifying
lotion<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:08.100> too<00:01:08.790> I've<00:01:09.119> got<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> one

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
lotion in too I've got it in a one

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.390 
lotion in too I've got it in a one
bottle<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:10.619> I've<00:01:10.860> decanted

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
bottle but that's because I've decanted

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.219 
bottle but that's because I've decanted
it<00:01:11.520> because<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> had<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> bigger<00:01:12.420> actually

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it because I had a bigger actually

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.010 
it because I had a bigger actually
bought<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.130> two<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.150> decanted<00:01:15.659> into<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
bought it in two and I decanted into a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
bought it in two and I decanted into a
smaller<00:01:16.380> bottle<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.670> use<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> take

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
smaller bottle so I can use it to take

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.700

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.340 
used because my skin is pretty dry I'm
skin<00:01:41.909> type<00:01:42.119> too<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.340> dry<00:01:44.759> combination<00:01:45.350> so

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
skin type too so it's dry combination so

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.190 
skin type too so it's dry combination so
I<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.619> dry<00:01:46.950> bits<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.180> moment<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
I have dry bits but at the moment it's a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
I have dry bits but at the moment it's a
lot<00:01:49.560> less<00:01:49.710> driving<00:01:50.040> normally<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> normally

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
lot less driving normally as a normally

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.870 
lot less driving normally as a normally
in<00:01:51.149> scheme<00:01:51.390> top<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.220> I'm<00:01:53.790> getting

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
in scheme top one but as I'm getting

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.219 
in scheme top one but as I'm getting
older<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.060> skin<00:01:57.270> type<00:01:57.509> too<00:01:57.750> so

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
older it's going to skin type too so

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.819 
older it's going to skin type too so
it's<00:01:58.969> not<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.210> dry<00:02:00.540> except<00:02:01.320> at<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.500> moment

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it's not as dry except at the moment
