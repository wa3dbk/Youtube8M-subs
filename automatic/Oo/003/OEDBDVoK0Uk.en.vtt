 Internet projects open it and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:02.640
 we look everything fits that is how 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.799
 way you can say so little 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 cheat moderators and they look 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.229
 so insolent that they miss 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.700
 normal ads and blocks them but 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.330
 misses shit yeah so 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.070
 to say so we need to work 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.060
 further so let them be his method and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.939
 work just 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.689
 build up a large number of bad 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.850
 ads 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.729
 let them figure it out themselves but banana 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.710
 white stream of responses so you do 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.689
 just take and copy the phenomenon 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.909
 which we liked that is 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.770
 in this way, see me, yes 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.079
 now one blocked four 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.869
 active ie they are periodic 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.340
 block they hang often half an hour but 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.290
 during this time one ad can 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.770
 type there up to 20 responses actually 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.840
 we need it and it is important therefore 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.780
 press the button submit ads 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.590
 choose a major city some 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.200

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.610
 field of activity without experience further 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.159
 schedule 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.899
 Remote experience does not matter and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.899
 just copy everything there 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.000
 first we insert why so it is on 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.310
 I got this idea yesterday I 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.200
 watched the ad was just shocked 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.180
 why are they such crappy ads 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.159
 skip well normal good and 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 literate that i write they don't 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:30.260
 Well, no matter how they want 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.580
 and so a little editing for themselves 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.420
 Responsible result Responsibility 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.290
 parallels duties assignment senior 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.260
 the manager is likely from from our yes 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.450
 someone posted conditional clearance while 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.569

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.450
 announcement we put a salary that is 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.739
 I have posted this ad 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.140
 there is literally a minute 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.079
 their ads can spank as much 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.640
 until your account is banned but 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.349
 In principle, I have such a hanging here 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.359
 three days 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.430
 unity maybe because i 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.840
 registered as a company can too 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.239
 try to register when 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.829
 you will simply specify the company 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.650
 fill in and optionally another field 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.549
 and so all the same well, maybe 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.859
 a company of coins to go and flax that's what 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.480
 further we have such a service 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.459
 like related ads 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.959

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.230

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.130
 internet site good store manager 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.989
 the store manager is fine too 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.720
 do the thing that is see here at 5 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.519
 ads blocked 1s so us 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.790
 it is important that there were a lot of ads 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.060
 big flow so work with those 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.060
 by methods
