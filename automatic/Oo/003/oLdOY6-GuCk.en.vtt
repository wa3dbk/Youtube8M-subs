today's<00:00:15.240> project<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.410> got<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.770> done

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
today's project and it's got to be done

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.910 
today's project and it's got to be done
all<00:00:17.099> in<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.400> day<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.810> to<00:00:18.810> drop<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.410> transfer

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
all in one day is to drop the transfer

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.620 
all in one day is to drop the transfer
case<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.279> we're<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> drop<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.000> one<00:00:21.360> inch

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
case and we're going to drop it one inch

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.019 
case and we're going to drop it one inch
and<00:00:24.259> how<00:00:25.259> we're<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.029> we're

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and how we're going to do that we're

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.490 
and how we're going to do that we're
going<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.239> be<00:00:27.300> able<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> reuse<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.930> hardware

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
going to be able to reuse the hardware

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
going to be able to reuse the hardware
we're<00:00:29.489> going<00:00:29.579> to<00:00:29.640> take<00:00:29.849> these<00:00:30.060> spacers<00:00:30.719> up<00:00:31.520> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
we're going to take these spacers up and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.600 
we're going to take these spacers up and
then<00:00:32.610> want<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.820> take<00:00:33.030> some<00:00:33.629> angle<00:00:34.020> iron<00:00:34.610> I'm

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
then want to take some angle iron I'm

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.040 
then want to take some angle iron I'm
going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> box<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.600> we<00:00:39.600> got<00:00:39.780> some

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
going to box it so that we got some

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.729 
going to box it so that we got some
angle<00:00:40.410> iron<00:00:40.559> spacers<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:42.469> drop<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
angle iron spacers that drop the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.630 
angle iron spacers that drop the
transfer<00:00:44.219> case<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:44.730> inch<00:00:46.399> now<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
transfer case one inch now this is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.189 
transfer case one inch now this is
factory<00:00:49.399> installation<00:00:50.399> setup<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.870> want<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
factory installation setup you want to

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.829 
factory installation setup you want to
leave<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.589> like<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:54.120> none<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.659> of

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
leave it like this or none at all of

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.200 
leave it like this or none at all of
whatever<00:00:55.079> there's<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:56.069> that<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.670> spacers

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
whatever there's some that the spacers

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
whatever there's some that the spacers
are<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.569> top<00:00:57.929> of<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.800> bracket<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.550> that's

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
are on top of this bracket and that's

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.799 
are on top of this bracket and that's
not<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.949> what<00:01:01.949> happens<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.429> it<00:01:02.550> puts

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
not right what happens is it puts

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
not right what happens is it puts
pressure<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.800> on<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> frame<00:01:05.400> what

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
pressure right here on the frame what

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.149 
pressure right here on the frame what
we're<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> whole<00:01:07.320> box<00:01:07.710> is

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
we're going to do with the whole box is

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.660 
we're going to do with the whole box is
to<00:01:08.550> evenly<00:01:09.000> distribute<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.690> pressure<00:01:10.670> all

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
to evenly distribute the pressure all

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.030 
to evenly distribute the pressure all
the<00:01:11.880> way<00:01:12.000> across<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> only<00:01:13.440> needs<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.920> as

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the way across so it only needs to be as

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.539 
the way across so it only needs to be as
long<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.940> contact<00:01:15.479> space<00:01:15.870> is<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
long as this contact space is so this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.780 
long as this contact space is so this
one<00:01:17.820> piece<00:01:18.060> angle<00:01:18.480> iron<00:01:18.660> for<00:01:19.320> nine<00:01:19.500> dollars

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
one piece angle iron for nine dollars

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.030 
one piece angle iron for nine dollars
should<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.850> plenty<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.230> us<00:01:23.450> two<00:01:24.450> brackets

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
should be plenty to make us two brackets

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.800 
should be plenty to make us two brackets
drop<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> transfer<00:01:26.670> case<00:01:26.940> one<00:01:27.240> inch<00:01:27.480> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
drop the transfer case one inch and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.370 
drop the transfer case one inch and
still<00:01:28.800> be<00:01:28.980> able<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.250> reuse<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.120> hardware<00:01:30.540> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
still be able to reuse the hardware so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.110 
still be able to reuse the hardware so
that's<00:01:31.650> looking<00:01:32.220> forward<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.550> doing<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
that's looking forward to doing that and

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.940 
that's looking forward to doing that and
seeing<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.690> can<00:01:33.750> eliminate<00:01:34.140> my<00:01:34.470> driveline

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
seeing if I can eliminate my driveline

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.640 
seeing if I can eliminate my driveline
Trent<00:01:35.250> I'm<00:01:35.510> vibration<00:01:39.050> that's<00:01:40.050> about<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:40.440> for

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
Trent I'm vibration that's about it for

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.160 
Trent I'm vibration that's about it for
now<00:01:41.420> here's<00:01:42.420> how<00:01:42.600> we're<00:01:42.750> gonna<00:01:42.840> make<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
now here's how we're gonna make the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.590 
now here's how we're gonna make the
bracket
