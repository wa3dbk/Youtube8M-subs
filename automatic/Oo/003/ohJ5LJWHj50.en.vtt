00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 hi people i'm kidding from wpa de and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.150
 that was here today in the post for us 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:15.389
 the sea â€‹â€‹of â€‹â€‹flowers is the seventh 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.119
 singles in the variant of the luna 730 yes that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.550
 We will be meeting in the next few days 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.630
 test extensively and then you will find 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.320
 a test report on wdr.de on each 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.360
 case we make the same times on here 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 you can find the lumia 735 in green 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.190
 had a rather negative impression of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 this color from the press images the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.270
 I saw before but sees 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.550
 not as bright as in the pictures 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.780
 the nokia presents and pleases me 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.690
 actually quite good while I actually 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.410
 no fan of neon colors otherwise 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.120
 is the smartphone in black and white 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.449
 orange and just this green where the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.460
 orange is still a little colder and 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.510
 Definitely more noticeable if you want that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.340
 device has in your hand that is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.739
 actually feels quite well 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.110
 quite easy especially easier 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.560
 the lumia 920 is just that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.240
 similar design has and yes a one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 slightly smaller display that has here 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.820
 namely a 47 inch HD display with 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.830
 let's turn that from a snapdragon 400 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.479
 processor a gigabyte 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.610
 Memory is available 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.670
 especially on this device is actually 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.490
 the 5 megapixel front camera with the itself 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.200
 according to nokia just outstanding elfi 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.009
 shoot 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 on the back we find a 67 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.150
 megapixel camera with carl zeiss optics 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.619
 and a led lightning 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.329
 yes it feels really good 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.420
 it works very well on the pages 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.960
 we have two buttons or just three 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.560
 namely the volume rocker and the 1 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.990
 button 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.049
 but it lacks this typical 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.520
 Camera button on the bottom 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:07.469
 we have a micro usb charger on board and on 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.780
 the top has a 35 mm connection for 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.150
 headphones and microphone on the left 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.150
 we have nothing on the side 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.400
 nice and smooth and yes it is definitely 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.189
 very well processed much better 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.560
 for example, I find the old one 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:27.400
 nokia lumia 800 it's the design 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.189
 very similar because it also has this 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.720
 rounded corners like here the lumia 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.909
 but it is missing this camera 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.459
 and it's way lighter than that 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.329
 lumia 800 although it is bigger and also 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.829
 much thinner 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.140
 now I have this intentionally 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.659
 then I'll turn it on 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.370
 also set up what I still say 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:51.500
 Wanted is on the back is namely 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.620
 Removable sometimes works 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.870
 lighter sometimes hard cover this 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.200
 you will get in the sale soon 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.060
 and in here is just one 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.239
 wireless charging receiver and the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.269
 nfc chip so on the device here we have 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.000
 a battery a pretty big one 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.220
 a nano sim card slot and just one 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.299
 micro sd card with which the memory 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.519
 should expand to 128gb 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:27.099
 just enough for many stars 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.980
 ok now for the packaging 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:33.230
 we have a charging cable that is 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.840
 but not in usb cable and 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.310
 power supply disconnect so is with is 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.290
 you just need to connect to the pc 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.010
 Another cable that is a pity 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.540
 by film smartphone in 2014 because 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.900
 you will sooner or later with the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.569
 pc need to connect though with a sd 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.150
 map, you will actually be enough 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.699
 but in any case it is a pity that you can 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.959
 not with there actually no 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.500
 would not be higher costs 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.329
 I think there are no headphones 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.609
 and here we have a quick start 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.549
 guide from nokia where to learn how to 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.579
 the smartphone and where to find what 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.959
 push into it so sd-card and 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.159
 sim card of course 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.820
 and here we have a wireless 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:19.549
 charging qr-code where yes on the back 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.329
 the wireless charging offers from nokia 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.290
 are listed 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.320
 supported in 1935 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.780
 wireless loading namely and that was 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.440
 it is not even from the packaging 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.720
 put it this way and now with it 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.880
 me again gets which one is on yes 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.050
 every case then thanks for seeing and 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.050
 bye bye
