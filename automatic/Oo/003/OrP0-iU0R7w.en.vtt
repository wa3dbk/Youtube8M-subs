makes<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> look<00:01:40.860> kind<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.220> straight<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.720> line

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
makes it look kind of straight in a line

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.710 
makes it look kind of straight in a line
what<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.009> need<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.180> need<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.360> take

the side you want to fold this side down
like<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> look<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
like that and when you look at it now it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.969 
like that and when you look at it now it
makes<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.610> nice<00:01:53.759> big<00:01:54.090> triangle<00:01:55.020> okay<00:01:55.710> right

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
makes a nice big triangle okay right

makes a nice big triangle okay right
there<00:01:56.310> see<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.439> you're<00:01:58.439> gonna<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
there see and you're gonna do that to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.190 
there see and you're gonna do that to
put<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.549> other<00:01:59.790> side<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
put this the other side so we do the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.230 
put this the other side so we do the
other<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:01.680> you're<00:02:02.009> gonna<00:02:02.130> take<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.880> top

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
other side you're gonna take the top

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.749 
other side you're gonna take the top
corner<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> pull<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.469> down<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:05.610> if

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
corner and pull it it down because if

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.690 
corner and pull it it down because if
you<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:05.969> fold<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> them<00:02:06.780> both<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.290> way

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
you don't fold it them both this way

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.930 
you don't fold it them both this way
then<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.119> did<00:02:09.929> something<00:02:10.200> wrong<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:10.979> how<00:02:11.190> how

do you know if you're right well if you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.030 
do you know if you're right well if you
take<00:02:13.739> these<00:02:13.950> ends<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.400> fold<00:02:14.670> them<00:02:14.819> over<00:02:16.040> okay

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
take these ends and fold them over okay

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.270 
take these ends and fold them over okay
they<00:02:17.700> should<00:02:18.150> pull<00:02:18.450> directly<00:02:19.170> over<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
they should pull directly over in the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.490 
they should pull directly over in the
shape<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.239> middle<00:02:21.569> section<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:22.319> they

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
shape of the middle section if they

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.210 
shape of the middle section if they
don't<00:02:22.650> do<00:02:22.860> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220

done<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.800> do<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.069> other<00:02:29.280> one

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
done that you have to do the other one

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.330 
done that you have to do the other one
and<00:02:31.040> again<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.970> last<00:02:33.000> time<00:02:34.340> you

and again just like the last time you
have<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:36.000> these<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.930> they<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.290> overlap

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
have to have these so they can overlap

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.660 
have to have these so they can overlap
if<00:02:38.670> they<00:02:38.849> don't<00:02:39.030> overlap<00:02:39.390> directly<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.349> this

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
if they don't overlap directly like this

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.300 
if they don't overlap directly like this
it's<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:41.910> gonna<00:02:42.120> work<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> end<00:02:42.870> okay<00:02:43.860> now

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it's not gonna work in the end okay now

middle actually if you really look at it

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.610 
middle actually if you really look at it
looks<00:03:03.030> kind<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.330> like<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.510> swastika

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
looks kind of like a swastika

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.520 
looks kind of like a swastika
okay<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.550> shape<00:03:05.849> now<00:03:06.750> what<00:03:06.989> you're<00:03:07.140> gonna<00:03:07.260> do

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
is you're going to just take the one end

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.130 
is you're going to just take the one end
and<00:03:10.319> fold<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:11.209> okay<00:03:12.209> then<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.900> go<00:03:13.110> right

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
and fold it okay then you go right

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.949 
and fold it okay then you go right
around<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.010> counterclockwise<00:03:14.190> fashion<00:03:14.959> you

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
around in a counterclockwise fashion you

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.190 
around in a counterclockwise fashion you
fold<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.099> one<00:03:17.400> over<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.330> corner<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.959> that

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
fold this one over the corner of that

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.369 
fold this one over the corner of that
one<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:19.769> see<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.760> just<00:03:21.420> folded<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.989> over<00:03:22.080> to

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
one so see that I just folded it over to

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.130 
one so see that I just folded it over to
corner<00:03:23.330> then<00:03:24.330> we're<00:03:24.510> going<00:03:24.629> to<00:03:24.659> just<00:03:24.810> take<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
corner then we're going to just take the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.039 
corner then we're going to just take the
next<00:03:25.409> one<00:03:25.620> okay<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.519> top<00:03:26.760> one<00:03:27.090> fold<00:03:27.900> it

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
next one okay so the top one fold it

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.880 
next one okay so the top one fold it
over<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.620> corner<00:03:29.690> now<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:31.140> your<00:03:31.440> three
