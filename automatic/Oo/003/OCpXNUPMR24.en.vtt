comes in a bunch of different varieties
as<00:03:30.140> well<00:03:30.320> they<00:03:30.470> make<00:03:30.650> one<00:03:30.890> that's<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.519> double

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
as well they make one that's a double

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.850 
as well they make one that's a double
then<00:03:32.660> make<00:03:32.810> one<00:03:32.840> that's<00:03:33.140> actually<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.440> triple

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
then make one that's actually a triple

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.920 
then make one that's actually a triple
that<00:03:34.040> has<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.880> here<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.360> then<00:03:35.420> one<00:03:35.720> in<00:03:35.870> the

below on their flight cases cdjs can go
up<00:03:48.260> they<00:03:48.739> actually<00:03:49.070> have<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.570> plate<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.870> is

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
up they actually have a plate that is

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.229 
up they actually have a plate that is
specifically<00:03:52.040> designed<00:03:52.160> just<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.880> hold<00:03:53.060> the

specifically designed just to hold the
CDJ<00:03:53.660> 1000<00:03:54.290> since<00:03:54.440> it's<00:03:54.590> pretty<00:03:54.799> much<00:03:54.920> one<00:03:55.160> of

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
CDJ 1000 since it's pretty much one of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.460 
CDJ 1000 since it's pretty much one of
the<00:03:55.310> more<00:03:55.459> popular<00:03:55.840> cdjs<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:56.989> existence

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
the more popular cdjs in existence

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.539 
the more popular cdjs in existence
that's<00:03:57.590> been<00:03:57.739> around<00:03:57.830> for<00:03:58.070> almost<00:03:58.100> nine<00:03:58.519> years

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
that's been around for almost nine years

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.820 
that's been around for almost nine years
now<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.540> that's<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> elevation<00:04:00.320> series<00:04:00.650> from

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
now so that's the elevation series from

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.949 
now so that's the elevation series from
from<00:04:01.430> Odyssey<00:04:01.820> those<00:04:02.030> are<00:04:02.150> also<00:04:02.269> all<00:04:02.600> over<00:04:02.840> our

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
this thing is very versatile the way

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.030 
this thing is very versatile the way
that<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.970> flips<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.420> folds<00:04:25.750> around<00:04:26.040> it's

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
that it it flips and folds around it's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.650 
that it it flips and folds around it's
all<00:04:27.190> aluminum<00:04:27.460> this<00:04:27.850> thing<00:04:28.060> likes<00:04:28.270> where<00:04:28.540> it

they tighten them up over here and then

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:57.170 
they tighten them up over here and then
this<00:04:41.740> locks<00:04:42.070> with<00:04:42.850> pressure<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:44.590> folds

different<00:05:32.530> applications<00:05:32.650> you<00:05:33.930> set<00:05:34.930> it<00:05:35.020> up

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
different applications you set it up

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.450 
different applications you set it up
where<00:05:36.730> would<00:05:36.820> go<00:05:37.000> underneath<00:05:37.620> of<00:05:38.620> a<00:05:38.740> case<00:05:38.980> if

you've got a situation or a bigger
workspace<00:05:42.360> you<00:05:43.360> can<00:05:43.510> set<00:05:43.690> it<00:05:43.720> up<00:05:43.900> in<00:05:44.080> kind<00:05:44.470> of<00:05:44.500> a

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
workspace you can set it up in kind of a

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.960 
workspace you can set it up in kind of a
Z<00:05:44.800> format<00:05:48.570> you<00:05:49.570> can<00:05:49.690> also<00:05:49.870> go<00:05:50.820> you<00:05:51.820> know<00:05:51.880> if

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
Z format you can also go you know if

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.520 
Z format you can also go you know if
you've<00:05:52.090> got<00:05:52.240> somewhere<00:05:52.600> that<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:52.900> can<00:05:53.020> tuck
