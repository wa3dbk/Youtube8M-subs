00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 we passed plastic surgery and 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.890
 reconstructive we talked about the correction of 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.719
 malformations in the ears and as such is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.030
 in the morning edition one of our 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 magazines in this area enthralls large 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 consumption continues on again has 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.300
 presence in the morning edition is to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.270
 is what can be considered a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.640
 Anovulatory malformation has to do with 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.090
 so the aspect with the times 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.529
 when children are born because they are 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.230
 bad training is something that is 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.759
 present since birth 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.219
 be essentially characterized by 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.559
 two things one is the hourly angle 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.780
 makes a headache when he makes a mistake 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.210
 very big and obviously now too 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.640
 and the other is farther from the absence of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.219
 formation of these little nails that we have 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.710
 here in the girlfriend that many people 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.309
 this part is neighbor completeness not 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.410
 do before them and therefore the time is 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.910
 further away is almost 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.910
 would improve the large and pro forma 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 including eddy we're talking about 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.330
 gt line that the team could be 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:14.750
 with the schedules and was also 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.750
 forced to call it organizes adoption 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.590
 work with that the team wrote 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.150
 estimates a production and is called ears 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.560
 deduction is and it's not just the stops it 's not 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.750
 essentially a matter of hours if it is 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.079
 very big has to do with being in fact 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.240
 a skull away and is caring 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.100
 that are generated in the option in this case 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.500
 of the life necklace of an aesthetic question 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.259
 yes it's an aesthetic question there is not 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.180
 no intention in terms of use of the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.090
 which in terms of hearing 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.799
 there is no other is not a sign of 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.850
 no other disease that is 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.189
 underlying 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.170
 for example some things like appendix 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.149
 priori classics are the penalties 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.920
 malformations that sometimes appear in the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.719
 babies in front of the time frames in this 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.149
 if this is a signal is associated with 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.829
 a poorly trained channel often in the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.840
 however this is not an aesthetic element 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.560
 and there are a lot of people running that sort of 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.709
 surgery 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.930
 there are huge people not only men but 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.890
 sizes even for the same 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.540
 Sometimes they end up minimizing a little by 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.579
 with hair they can hide and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.439
 they can hide better now never 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.680
 use capital for example in men 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.760
 probably due to the emergence of 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.069
 discord ends up being one more path 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.019
 how was the intervention 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.629
 can do this conversion is very 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.299
 simple is with the decision is made back 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.670
 golden therefore is not is not visible is 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.280
 made with where it was locally and basically 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.939
 through an assembly of the cartilage to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.919
 soy has to be closer now 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.049
 of the skull and is achieved through 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:52.049
 moubarak who make so much their decisions 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.510
 they are not dots inside and 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.680
 Sometimes you need to shorten a stamp and x 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.510
 of the cartilage and thus can 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.810
 a more normal confirmation of 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.180
 andrezinho sasha more possible with 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.219
 Most dry people can be a 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.530
 standard is this is amazing 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.819
 recovery is more complicated than 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.370
 process and if the document is more 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.150
 I took a little volleyball yesterday by 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.729
 pressure 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.209
 good now some some publications 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:23.269
 once used those tracks 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.449
 the tapes for less time especially 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.280
 day night up for a month but now 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.650
 check out the latest posts 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.659
 suggest that you do not need to do this 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.430
 modeling for so long can be 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.680
 one more roll in the night time of the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.199
 than in the cold during the day 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.970
 by the state port is obliged to 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:44.549
 go down the street and do some racing 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.489
 talk bad as the name are taken 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.040
 end of five six days and plant 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.500
 from this cold height is already 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.069
 healed and then sleeps with her 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.799
 band uses a spot in the first 45 days after 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.049
 operative is to both is a matter 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.090
 often genetic that is 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.919
 associated with the family does not increase the time 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.049
 in our family that even has a 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:10.109
 the dominant autosomal component or 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.019
 means that if there is a person in the 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.689
 family that has now given in adoption to 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:20.159
 about 50% probability of the 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:22.139
 child born smell was my dream 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:24.540
 hexa but it attends to more malformations 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.930
 the author of the malformations of the 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.860
 the ear pinning is for example as 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.380
 already suffered there are those of tennis worse and clear there 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.890
 information in the sense that 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.360
 there is an absence of the worst and clear 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.660
 we are talking about making a construction 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.240
 complex and total time 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.280
 have to be mislaid in several 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.780
 various periods 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.110
 often using the motto that they are 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.910
 pre-fabricated with materials 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.350
 some laboratories or by using 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.240
 example the ribs 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:02.520
 there are also the captain type spock schedules 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.700
 of the star winner exactly 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.680
 now they tell me to try various pathologies 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.620
 question is pathologies now malformations 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.090
 now in some cases in fact these 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.800
 affirmations are a warning sign can 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.650
 being of a child of a possible 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.200
 problem or problem 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.970
 was also in this initial phase of the village 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.770
 they will be on time about the 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.590
 neonatologist pediatricians are 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.810
 the first screening 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.140
 obviously the people who are there 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.180
 because it is a complicated path in the 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.520
 parents know what the poor can do. 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.500
 obviously i mean i could 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.140
 play in turn as the 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.030
 rivals in this morning edition is not known 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.030
 very well that the organisms is always good
