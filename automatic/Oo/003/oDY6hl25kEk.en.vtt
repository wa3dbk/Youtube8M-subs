00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.490
 hi friends only goalkeepers to the os 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 We present the new range of colors that 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.200
 has chosen the nike sports brand for 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.619
 climb the tico in my hands the range 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.470
 high of this line the elastic line 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.570
 final as you will see it had been for this one 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.030
 for this campaign a purple color in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.559
 combination with a fluorescent yellow 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.220
 that brings great spectacularity not to the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.449
 Slipper inside the cut technology 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.660
 in which novel skin of this 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.309
 season in which is a 3-d mesh 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.170
 with a layer of polyurethane on top 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.840
 that brings great lightness and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.910
 flexibility to the shoe apart from 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.920
 comfort we see the 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.800
 the whole shoe is surrounded by 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.080
 a layer of reinforcement that surrounds it 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.750
 practically whole with a little more 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.629
 of surface in the tip that is the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.460
 that provides great resistance to 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.320
 wear not of the shoe as it is a 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.390
 material light enough but at the same time 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.010
 makes it a little bit weak 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.380
 and then because this reinforcement is the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.479
 that makes it cover those areas that more 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.670
 rub against the ground and I say it's a 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.380
 very light material makes you feel 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.380
 as if as if she were not wearing a sneaker 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.219
 input was to use the material 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.990
 nike's exclusive ortho light that 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.899
 provide cushioning at the same time 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.640
 lightness for the sole we already saw that 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.610
 change with the design with respect to 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.799
 past we can distinguish three zones the zone 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.619
 front and back on the sides that 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.270
 is the area in the form of a suction cup 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.189
 provides great grip and apart 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.420
 made in a material that much more 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.700
 durable than the rest because in the area 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.880
 let's say that more suffers 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.520
 in the moments of the game then zone of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.610
 hills multidirectional hills that 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.990
 It gives us great ease in 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.729
 the displacements and the turns and other 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.920
 central zone let's say the flex zone 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.899
 a little bit more reinforced that is the one 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.270
 it gives us stability also presents 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.739
 the line of transverse bending for 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.420
 be able to make any kind of 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.160
 explosive movement that allows us 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.750
 make in the shoe one of the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.489
 most complete shoes on the market 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.610
 especially for players looking for that 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.490
 lightness and feel the contact of the ball 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.080
 continually 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.900
 for this campaign and it has facilitated us 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.760
 only the apart of the final elastic model 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.320
 and the elastic model pro what 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.330
 We present in two colors in purple that 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.840
 is the one that I have commented before and in black 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.810
 elastic elastic is worth but also 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.490
 It's a great low profile sneaker 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.470
 like the previous one also done in 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.120
 synthetic material presents a zone of 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.590
 reinforcement in the lateral zone and the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.320
 tip as I said before the 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.390
 zone in addition to more wear and tear is still 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.590
 very light no longer presents the technology 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.050
 of that skin but it's still a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.510
 Breathable synthetic material and very 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.610
 light not luck also combination 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.900
 of multidirectional lines with with 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.060
 taco zone to give a little bit of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.830
 grab the ball 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.720
 and what I say available also 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.819
 we will have the range also elastic 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.280
 normal elastic but we do not have it 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.950
 still in summary a great a great 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.360
 sneaker in a flagship player 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.790
 of the brand as ricardinho will use it 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.739
 in this season's games and 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.840
 let's hope you like it and the jewels that 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.230
 have at your disposal in a short 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.230
 space of time
