00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.950 
fact the idea of internal exhaust um
yeah<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> mean<00:00:37.790> as<00:00:38.790> far<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> power<00:00:39.690> dish

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
yeah I mean as far as the power dish

don't they're not were the six 80s

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.740 
don't they're not were the six 80s
really<00:00:56.850> aren't<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.510> they're

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
really aren't I don't think they're

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
really aren't I don't think they're
really<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> shining<00:00:59.250> lights<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
really the shining lights in the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.380 
really the shining lights in the
6-series<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.840> time<00:01:01.079> guys<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:02.969> think

6-series this time guys and I do think

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
6-series this time guys and I do think
it's<00:01:03.570> worth<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> extra<00:01:03.989> money<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.650> save<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
it's worth the extra money to save up a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.770 
it's worth the extra money to save up a
little<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.400> more<00:01:05.519> money<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> jump

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
from the 670 to the 670 power edition I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.270 
from the 670 to the 670 power edition I
told<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.600> twenty<00:01:10.020> bucks<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.470> hire<00:01:10.770> yeah<00:01:11.250> I

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
was it really knowledge and when this

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.589 
was it really knowledge and when this
was<00:02:31.470> available<00:02:31.830> editing<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.060> true<00:02:33.330> but

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
get them into a gig so think at the four

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.770 
get them into a gig so think at the four
gig<00:05:17.729> get<00:05:17.880> out<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.060> get<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.240> reference<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.660> then

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
gig get out to get the reference to then

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.260 
gig get out to get the reference to then
it's<00:05:18.960> ugly<00:05:19.229> so<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:20.520> would<00:05:20.610> be<00:05:20.700> nice<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:21.120> see

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
it's ugly so that would be nice to see

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.930 
it's ugly so that would be nice to see
it<00:05:21.360> as<00:05:21.450> an<00:05:21.540> improvement<00:05:21.840> yeah<00:05:22.380> but<00:05:23.160> this<00:05:23.729> is<00:05:23.910> a

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
it as an improvement yeah but this is a

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.200 
it as an improvement yeah but this is a
real<00:05:24.150> great<00:05:24.360> car<00:05:24.870> really<00:05:25.669> still<00:05:26.669> got<00:05:27.000> fired

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
real great car really still got fired

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.840 
real great car really still got fired
but<00:05:27.720> um<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:28.229> think<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:29.130> pretty<00:05:29.310> much<00:05:29.400> wraps<00:05:29.640> it

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
but um I think that pretty much wraps it

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.219 
but um I think that pretty much wraps it
