this<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:39.320> resist<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:42.259> babbino

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
this little resist this is the babbino

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.999 
this little resist this is the babbino
basically<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> wire<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:46.439> thing

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
basically it's like a wire like thing

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.469 
basically it's like a wire like thing
that<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.520> kind<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> hook<00:01:47.970> around<00:01:48.119> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that you can like kind of hook around so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
that you can like kind of hook around so
it<00:01:48.540> doesn't<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:48.869> tangled<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> find<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.159> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it doesn't get tangled but I find that I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.760

when<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> untangle<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> takes<00:01:52.229> more<00:01:52.439> time<00:01:52.710> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
when I untangle it it takes more time to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.340 
when I untangle it it takes more time to
like<00:01:53.189> when<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> tangled<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.079> where

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
like when I tangled it so this is where

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.050 
like when I tangled it so this is where

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
whatever stench it is well because I

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.949 
whatever stench it is well because I
know<00:03:41.549> hair<00:03:41.940> like<00:03:42.150> hair<00:03:42.389> absorbs<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.810> lot<00:03:42.840> of

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
know hair like hair absorbs a lot of

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.080 
know hair like hair absorbs a lot of
like<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.410> odor<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:43.920> what<00:03:44.459> this<00:03:44.609> does<00:03:44.940> it

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
like the odor so what this does it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.150 
like the odor so what this does it
actually<00:03:45.120> helps<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.690> spray<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.859> your<00:03:47.010> hair
