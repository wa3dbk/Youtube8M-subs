00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.360
 welcome to the three players point it in 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.150
 this fast and very fast video 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.290
 since you asked me in so many vi 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.160
 I will show you how to connect yours 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.340
 pad ps3 that is sic sassi on dualshock 3 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.360
 no matter via bluetooth to yours 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.309
 android cellphone the tablet in this 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.249
 tutorial of course we will use a 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.609
 tablet like this because we have 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:41.409
 this is available only for that reason 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.640
 in reality there will be no problems e 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.649
 the important thing is that your tablet 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.300
 mobile phone has bluetooth connection 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.159
 to be able to interface with the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.100
 controller of what we would need 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.440
 we obviously need tablets 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.350
 controller and then two applications 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.030
 in addition to the USB charging cable for the pad 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.190
 applications are six assis 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.199
 compatibility checker that will serve and is 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.260
 free to verify that the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.030
 our tablet all on the device either 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.770
 absolutely compatible with the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.560
 bluetooth connection and with the six assis 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.480
 is the application for then actually 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.490
 interface the controller with the tower 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.930
 which is six assis controller 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.850
 unfortunately this application is a 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.970
 payment certainly no need for you 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.860
 say that for android 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.600
 in short, we understood each other 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.400
 but if you want to buy the thing you get 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.200
 advice because it is really useful 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.640
 and it interfaces very well with all the 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.750
 games 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.150
 besides this of course we would have 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.580
 need root permissions not 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.440
 they should be needed however they say 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.720
 al with some devices serves with 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.300
 some not, I did not understand well for 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.350
 security I stole my tablet then 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.940
 I have not encountered any kind of 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.860
 problem if you should meet them 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.840
 try to rotate it and then to stay at 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.190
 verification now call to talk 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.440
 See you at the end of the video and now 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.880
 I will explain you well and very quickly 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.350
 how to pair the two 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.930
 first we install six assis 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.730
 compatibility checker on our tablet 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.679
 once done this find the link 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.690
 in description of the play store where 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.740
 download the application open it e 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.900
 click on 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.180
 art done what the program will start a 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.670
 do the numerous checks to see if 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.140
 our device compatible with the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.660
 sony controller 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.540
 if so, we will be shown a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.610
 notice containing a mac address for that 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.470
 understand us in this video is 18 2 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.450
 points 46 and bla bla bla 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.790
 obviously every device to its own 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.770
 mac address you mark it on a piece of 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.170
 card or where you want it because we will go to 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.840
 insert later into the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.860
 controller through an application 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.360
 required for windows 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.670
 the application is called six assis per 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.530
 jules once installed and opened 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.930
 will look for the connection with ours 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.300
 controller we connect it once 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.800
 automatically connected will install 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.100
 drive once installation is complete 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.230
 of the drivers we insert inside the string 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.520
 change and mac address the code 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.490
 previously provided to us 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.860
 from the application on our tablet 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.900
 let's just click on update and one 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
 once confirmed we can disconnect 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.960
 directly to the controller 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.840
 now back to our tablet we open 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:19.750
 the six assis controller application from 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.190
 here just click on start is one 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.840
 time the application is on hold 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.020
 on the controller press the center button 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.120
 on our ip3 ps3 once made 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.800
 the connection will notify us that it was 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.750
 found the joypad with a level of 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.770
 medium high or low battery depending on 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.770
 of the charge level 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:40.020
 having done that, all we have to do is go 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.970
 in preferences top right or where it is 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.130
 placed on your device 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.430
 click on game pad settings and 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.230
 game pad skills 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.600
 in this way the tablet or the mobile phone 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.290
 will automatically recognize that 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.110
 external gamepad the ps3 joypad we have 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.330
 made numerous tests with various emulators e 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.680
 roms and everyone recognized the joypad 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.210
 without problems 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.460
 obviously not all year emulators 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.959
 the preconfiguration for the ps3 joypad 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.550
 so we advise you to check 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.470
 in the settings and set 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.660
 individually we occasionally have 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.160
 found a minimum lag with no 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.209
 problem especially with games 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.100
 playstation 1 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.070
 in fact we have this tutorial for you 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.860
 wanted to realize also because precisely 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.340
 given the similarity of the ps3 pad with 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.560
 one 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.680
 ps 1 could be much more 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.630
 pleasant to emulate ps1 directly on 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.910
 our devices through use 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.590
 of the ps3 joypad then I hope this 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.250
 tutorial you have been useful as you have 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.100
 since it was not wanted nothing was enough 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.430
 just a second and two put operations 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.860
 on the cross to connect the two things 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.720
 it's nothing if you have any other advice questions 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.520
 or any of chessa bla bla bla that 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.650
 what do you want to write below if the 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.449
 video was helpful you enjoyed it or 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.669
 so on that left me like and 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.919
 share it with those you think can 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.720
 be interested and subscribe to 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.100
 facebook page however click on 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.010
 buttons at the end of the video 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.990
 in the other end directly or in 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.070
 facebook page or subscribe to channel o 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.070
 watching 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.540
 another video maybe like that 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.280
 on the andrid emulation I did 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.360
 a few months ago 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.240
 having said that I thank you for having me 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.889
 followed and see you Thursday with I don't know 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.070
 what will be if another is faithful 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.070
 spot 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.700
 however there are one emulators 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.400
 avalanche for an avalanche of systems 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.650
 several able to emulate as many 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.169
 an equally avalanche of ho systems 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.580
 seen for example emulate doom on delle 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.650
 scientific calculators 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.630
 the important thing is to understand where you want 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.950
 arriving in fact I like the life of 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.690
 people who approach emulators 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.320
 in two very specific categories 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.320
 the purists
