out of the shot while I was focusing so
I<00:01:42.829> tried<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.100> focus<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.609> background<00:01:43.850> a

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
I tried to focus on the background a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.730 
I tried to focus on the background a
little<00:01:44.240> bit<00:01:44.539> more<00:01:44.719> as<00:01:44.929> you<00:01:45.229> can<00:01:45.320> notice<00:01:45.380> I'm<00:01:45.710> a

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
little bit more as you can notice I'm a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.260 
little bit more as you can notice I'm a
little<00:01:46.009> bit<00:01:46.130> blurred<00:01:46.490> right<00:01:46.729> now<00:01:46.909> but<00:01:47.119> that's

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
little bit blurred right now but that's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.819 
little bit blurred right now but that's
just<00:01:47.390> an<00:01:47.600> effect<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:48.049> this<00:01:48.200> but<00:01:48.469> it's<00:01:48.619> not

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
just an effect of this but it's not

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.069 
just an effect of this but it's not
blurred<00:01:49.130> completely<00:01:49.329> so<00:01:50.329> I<00:01:50.359> recommend<00:01:50.689> if

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
blurred completely so I recommend if

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.480 
blurred completely so I recommend if
you're<00:01:51.170> trying<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.499> like<00:01:51.740> get<00:01:51.950> yourself<00:01:52.340> like

focus<00:01:56.149> on<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.539> background<00:01:56.749> rather<00:01:57.170> than

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
focus on the background rather than

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.649
