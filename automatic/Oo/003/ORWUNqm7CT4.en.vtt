so I really don't know how comfortable
durable<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.700> separate<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:49.020> really

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
excited to get it today and so I thought

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.630 
excited to get it today and so I thought

slide off this rather than snag like it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.370 
slide off this rather than snag like it
wouldn't<00:01:42.030> match<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.229> might

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
wouldn't match so I think that might

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.690 
wouldn't match so I think that might
have<00:01:43.439> been<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> good<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
have been a good this is in there and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
have been a good this is in there and
these<00:01:44.790> side<00:01:45.000> pockets<00:01:45.450> are<00:01:45.570> adjustable<00:01:46.140> which

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
these side pockets are adjustable which

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.990 
these side pockets are adjustable which
is<00:01:46.979> good<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:49.430> materials<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.579> good<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.880> also

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
is good so materials are good they also

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
is good so materials are good they also

pocket<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.420> lot<00:01:54.600> beefier<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.590> remember

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
pocket is a lot beefier then I remember

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.969 
pocket is a lot beefier then I remember
my<00:01:56.579> original<00:01:56.729> p2<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.740> really

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
my original p2 this is really really

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.780 
my original p2 this is really really
it's<00:01:59.100> almost<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.490> rigid<00:01:59.700> plastic

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
it's almost like a rigid plastic

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.120 
it's almost like a rigid plastic
so<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.540> imagine<00:02:02.870> this<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.110> gonna<00:02:03.260> be<00:02:03.470> very<00:02:03.950> very

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
so I imagine this is gonna be very very

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.000 
so I imagine this is gonna be very very
durable<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.530> one<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.680> things<00:02:06.830> I've<00:02:06.950> always

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010

pocket not quite sure why they did that
I<00:02:19.340> mean<00:02:19.520> obviously<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.360> prevent

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
I mean obviously it's to prevent

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.560

contents<00:02:22.250> from<00:02:22.370> falling<00:02:23.000> out<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.360> I've<00:02:23.450> never

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
contents from falling out but I've never

really<00:02:23.870> had<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.160> maybe<00:02:25.160> they<00:02:25.340> couldn't<00:02:25.640> save

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
really had that maybe they couldn't save

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
lowering some weight not sure oh and one

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.879 
lowering some weight not sure oh and one
thing<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.210> should<00:04:45.240> mention<00:04:45.419> is<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:45.810> again<00:04:46.770> and

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
thing I should mention is that again and

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.790 
thing I should mention is that again and
that<00:04:47.250> hip<00:04:47.850> belt<00:04:48.410> this<00:04:49.410> is<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.530> little<00:04:49.710> bit

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
that hip belt this is a little bit

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.650 
that hip belt this is a little bit
different<00:04:50.130> than<00:04:50.220> my<00:04:50.310> p2<00:04:50.700> I<00:04:50.729> think<00:04:51.120> most<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.570> the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
different than my p2 I think most of the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.969 
different than my p2 I think most of the
standard<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.020> always<00:04:52.380> come<00:04:52.560> with<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:52.770> now

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
standard you always come with this now

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.590 
standard you always come with this now
but<00:04:53.160> it's<00:04:53.280> got<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:54.060> straps<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.540> you

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
but it's got that the straps that you

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.180 
but it's got that the straps that you
pull<00:04:54.810> forward<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.320> tighten<00:04:55.740> which<00:04:55.860> I<00:04:55.979> like

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
pull forward to tighten which I like

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.719 
pull forward to tighten which I like
rather<00:04:56.370> than<00:04:56.610> having<00:04:57.540> to<00:04:57.780> pull<00:04:57.990> back<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:59.340> that

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
rather than having to pull back so that

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.940 
rather than having to pull back so that
pretty<00:04:59.910> much<00:05:00.030> does<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.300> for<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:01.350> outside<00:05:01.740> legs

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
pretty much does it for the outside legs

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.190 
pretty much does it for the outside legs

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
and let's open it up and here's where

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.560 
and let's open it up and here's where
it's<00:05:04.350> really<00:05:04.560> different<00:05:04.860> so<00:05:05.400> I<00:05:05.729> can<00:05:06.360> show<00:05:06.510> you

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570

out I have one of these on my p2 as well

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.010 
out I have one of these on my p2 as well
hydration<00:05:52.320> sleep<00:05:52.770> also<00:05:53.610> removable<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.360> they

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
hydration sleep also removable and they

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.430 
hydration sleep also removable and they
attached<00:05:55.260> to<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.650> same<00:05:55.830> clips<00:05:56.310> so<00:05:57.169> they<00:05:58.169> said

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
attached to the same clips so they said

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.070 
attached to the same clips so they said
wait<00:05:58.889> there<00:05:59.130> by<00:05:59.370> just<00:05:59.430> using<00:05:59.789> two<00:06:00.360> loops<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.930> be

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
wait there by just using two loops to be

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.100 
wait there by just using two loops to be
able<00:06:01.169> to<00:06:01.350> attach<00:06:01.590> two<00:06:02.280> different<00:06:03.110> accessories

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
able to attach two different accessories

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.560 
able to attach two different accessories
and<00:06:05.070> one<00:06:05.820> thing<00:06:05.940> that's<00:06:06.060> interesting<00:06:06.240> here

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
and one thing that's interesting here

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.690 
and one thing that's interesting here
you<00:06:07.200> notice<00:06:07.500> we've<00:06:07.620> got<00:06:07.680> these<00:06:07.919> internal

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
you notice we've got these internal

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.340 
you notice we've got these internal
compression<00:06:09.599> straps

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
compression straps

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.100 
compression straps
kind<00:06:10.500> of<00:06:10.530> cool<00:06:10.710> so<00:06:11.340> basically<00:06:12.330> after<00:06:12.720> you<00:06:12.930> pack

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
kind of cool so basically after you pack

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.540 
kind of cool so basically after you pack
it<00:06:13.260> all<00:06:13.320> up<00:06:15.710> well<00:06:16.710> your<00:06:16.920> stuff<00:06:17.100> in<00:06:17.250> there<00:06:17.400> and

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
it all up well your stuff in there and

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.310 
it all up well your stuff in there and
then<00:06:17.610> you've<00:06:17.790> got<00:06:18.030> these<00:06:18.780> compression<00:06:19.290> straps

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
then you've got these compression straps

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.740 
then you've got these compression straps
I<00:06:20.100> can<00:06:20.310> just<00:06:20.460> tighten<00:06:21.060> everything<00:06:21.240> down<00:06:21.450> with

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
I can just tighten everything down with

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.870 
I can just tighten everything down with
if<00:06:21.930> you<00:06:22.050> want<00:06:22.290> and<00:06:22.980> you<00:06:23.460> know<00:06:23.580> it's<00:06:23.700> a<00:06:23.730> little

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
if you want and you know it's a little

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.130 
if you want and you know it's a little
bit<00:06:23.970> concerned<00:06:24.330> about<00:06:24.360> them<00:06:24.630> getting<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.990> way

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
bit concerned about them getting the way

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.810 
bit concerned about them getting the way
like<00:06:25.860> that<00:06:26.070> play<00:06:26.280> with<00:06:26.430> it<00:06:26.580> they<00:06:26.700> actually

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
like that play with it they actually

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.280 
like that play with it they actually
really<00:06:27.210> don't<00:06:27.330> get<00:06:27.510> in<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:27.690> way<00:06:27.810> at<00:06:27.960> all<00:06:28.080> which

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
really don't get in the way at all which

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.030 
really don't get in the way at all which
is<00:06:28.320> kind<00:06:28.590> of<00:06:28.620> nice

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
is kind of nice

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.560 
is kind of nice
you<00:06:29.550> don't<00:06:29.700> have<00:06:29.910> to<00:06:30.030> use<00:06:30.180> them<00:06:30.300> you<00:06:30.390> can<00:06:30.540> just

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
you don't have to use them you can just

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.680 
you don't have to use them you can just
leave<00:06:30.840> them<00:06:30.900> open<00:06:31.080> I<00:06:31.410> suppose<00:06:31.800> and<00:06:32.450> just<00:06:33.450> pack

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
leave them open I suppose and just pack

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.940 
leave them open I suppose and just pack
like<00:06:33.900> that<00:06:34.110> if<00:06:34.290> you're<00:06:34.470> free<00:06:34.620> out<00:06:34.710> worrying

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
like that if you're free out worrying

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.340 
like that if you're free out worrying
about<00:06:35.130> compression<00:06:35.640> because<00:06:36.230> there<00:06:37.230> are

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
about compression because there are

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.590 
about compression because there are
other<00:06:37.620> compression<00:06:37.950> straps<00:06:38.490> on<00:06:38.670> the<00:06:38.820> outside

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
other compression straps on the outside

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.560 
other compression straps on the outside
of<00:06:39.720> the<00:06:39.780> pack<00:06:39.990> in<00:06:40.290> on<00:06:40.410> the<00:06:40.500> top<00:06:40.710> so<00:06:41.550> you've<00:06:42.450> also

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
of the pack in on the top so you've also

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.490 
of the pack in on the top so you've also
got<00:06:42.840> the<00:06:44.300> compression<00:06:45.300> down<00:06:45.420> way<00:06:45.570> so<00:06:45.630> there's

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
got the compression down way so there's

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.710 
got the compression down way so there's
the<00:06:46.650> top<00:06:46.830> compression<00:06:47.450> side<00:06:48.450> compression

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
the top compression side compression

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.520 
the top compression side compression
strap<00:06:49.140> rudder

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
strap rudder

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.980 
strap rudder
I<00:06:49.680> mean<00:06:50.400> these<00:06:51.030> also<00:06:51.270> act<00:06:51.540> as<00:06:51.630> compression

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
I mean these also act as compression

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.990 
I mean these also act as compression
straps<00:06:52.350> Jesus<00:06:52.710> so<00:06:52.830> you<00:06:52.860> may<00:06:53.430> or<00:06:53.490> may<00:06:53.580> not<00:06:53.670> need

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
straps Jesus so you may or may not need

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.650 
straps Jesus so you may or may not need
that<00:06:54.060> guess<00:06:54.780> it<00:06:54.900> just<00:06:54.930> depends<00:06:55.290> on<00:06:55.560> your<00:06:55.620> load

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
that guess it just depends on your load

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.930 
that guess it just depends on your load
so<00:06:57.660> again<00:06:58.290> I<00:06:58.320> really<00:06:58.590> like<00:06:58.770> this<00:06:58.950> a<00:06:58.980> lot<00:06:59.190> just

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
so again I really like this a lot just

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.190 
so again I really like this a lot just
to<00:07:00.060> kind<00:07:00.270> of<00:07:00.300> give<00:07:00.450> you<00:07:00.480> a<00:07:00.570> little<00:07:00.870> quick

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
to kind of give you a little quick

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.340 
to kind of give you a little quick
comparison<00:07:01.770> here's<00:07:02.340> the<00:07:02.840> first<00:07:03.840> of<00:07:03.960> the<00:07:04.080> ula

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
comparison here's the first of the ula

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.020 
comparison here's the first of the ula
opens<00:07:04.770> up<00:07:04.950> and<00:07:05.220> here's<00:07:05.400> the<00:07:05.550> mountain<00:07:05.790> Smith

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
opens up and here's the mountain Smith

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:15.260 
opens up and here's the mountain Smith
goes<00:07:11.360> up<00:07:12.360> to<00:07:13.160> about<00:07:14.160> the<00:07:14.370> same<00:07:14.550> size<00:07:14.820> I<00:07:15.090> think

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
goes up to about the same size I think

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.790 
goes up to about the same size I think
maybe<00:07:15.420> the<00:07:15.600> ula<00:07:16.020> opens<00:07:16.320> up<00:07:16.470> a<00:07:16.500> little<00:07:16.590> bit

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
maybe the ula opens up a little bit

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.160 
maybe the ula opens up a little bit
deeper<00:07:18.590> yeah<00:07:19.590> you've<00:07:20.370> got<00:07:20.610> a<00:07:20.640> little<00:07:21.000> bit<00:07:21.170> see

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.170 
deeper yeah you've got a little bit see

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.890 
deeper yeah you've got a little bit see
that<00:07:22.700> this<00:07:23.700> doesn't<00:07:24.060> quite<00:07:24.240> open<00:07:24.600> all<00:07:24.690> the<00:07:24.780> way

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
that this doesn't quite open all the way

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.270 
that this doesn't quite open all the way
down<00:07:25.100> that<00:07:26.100> far<00:07:26.370> you<00:07:26.970> la<00:07:27.680> Camino<00:07:28.680> opens<00:07:29.040> down<00:07:29.250> a

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
down that far you la Camino opens down a

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.130 
down that far you la Camino opens down a
little<00:07:29.460> bit<00:07:29.580> more<00:07:29.790> to<00:07:30.450> the<00:07:30.570> bottom<00:07:30.870> so<00:07:30.990> you

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.140 
little bit more to the bottom so you

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.420 
little bit more to the bottom so you
little<00:07:31.290> bit<00:07:31.380> easier<00:07:31.650> access<00:07:31.830> to<00:07:32.190> the<00:07:32.280> bottom

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
little bit easier access to the bottom

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.600 
little bit easier access to the bottom
which<00:07:32.670> is<00:07:32.700> kind<00:07:33.030> of<00:07:33.060> nice<00:07:33.270> so<00:07:33.950> overall<00:07:34.950> it

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
which is kind of nice so overall it

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.490 
which is kind of nice so overall it
looks<00:07:35.670> like<00:07:35.880> a<00:07:35.910> really<00:07:36.150> interesting<00:07:36.390> pack<00:07:36.810> to

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
looks like a really interesting pack to

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.990 
looks like a really interesting pack to
me<00:07:37.590> it's<00:07:37.740> you<00:07:38.130> know<00:07:38.220> I've<00:07:38.310> always<00:07:38.490> said<00:07:38.790> that<00:07:38.820> I

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 
me it's you know I've always said that I

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.420 
me it's you know I've always said that I
wish<00:07:39.300> they<00:07:39.450> could<00:07:39.660> combine<00:07:40.290> the<00:07:40.710> mounts<00:07:41.370> from

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430 
wish they could combine the mounts from
