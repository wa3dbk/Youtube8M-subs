00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
here so instead of adding instead of

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.720 
here so instead of adding instead of
adding<00:02:08.910> more<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.599> each<00:02:09.780> row<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.459> add<00:02:11.640> two

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
adding more to each row you just add two

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.070 
adding more to each row you just add two
calm<00:02:13.000> okay<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.590> for<00:02:15.519> example<00:02:15.750> there's<00:02:16.750> three

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
calm okay so for example there's three

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.809 
calm okay so for example there's three
weeks<00:02:17.319> it's<00:02:17.799> easier<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.549> make<00:02:18.790> it

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
weeks it's easier if you just make it

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.030 
weeks it's easier if you just make it
like<00:02:19.060> if<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.629> want<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.019> just<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.709> four

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
like if you want more we just have four

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.130 
like if you want more we just have four
like<00:02:21.790> squares<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.659> wheats<00:02:22.840> they're<00:02:23.019> not

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
like squares of wheats they're not

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.710 
like squares of wheats they're not
actually<00:02:23.440> squares<00:02:23.799> except<00:02:24.159> for<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.430> one<00:02:24.720> but

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
actually squares except for this one but

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.350 
actually squares except for this one but
there's<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.989> reason<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.769> everything<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:28.299> I'm

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
there's a reason for everything but I'm

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.729 
there's a reason for everything but I'm
gonna<00:02:28.450> show<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.780> with<00:02:28.989> this<00:02:29.110> off<00:02:29.290> because<00:02:29.470> I'm

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
gonna show you with this off because I'm

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.470 
gonna show you with this off because I'm
proud<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.760> I'm<00:02:30.849> gonna<00:02:30.970> make<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.269> in

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
proud of this and I'm gonna make this in

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.289 
proud of this and I'm gonna make this in
my<00:02:31.629> let's<00:02:31.930> play<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.379> I'm<00:02:33.099> doing<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.849> you

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
my let's play that I'm doing so you

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.089 
my let's play that I'm doing so you
break<00:02:34.569> this<00:02:34.720> since<00:02:35.019> sand<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:37.140> falls<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:39.069> know

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
break this since sand is falls you know

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.990 
break this since sand is falls you know
cuz<00:02:39.459> gravity<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:40.840> break<00:02:41.170> these<00:02:41.739> but<00:02:42.640> will<00:02:42.909> it

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
cuz gravity you break these but will it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.640 
cuz gravity you break these but will it
be<00:02:43.030> faster<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.780> use<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> shot

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
be faster if I use a shot

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.910 
be faster if I use a shot
okay<00:02:44.950> there's<00:02:45.160> there's<00:02:45.459> no<00:02:45.579> shovels<00:02:46.799> but<00:02:47.799> you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
okay there's there's no shovels but you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.400 
okay there's there's no shovels but you
just<00:02:48.069> break<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:53.260> as

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
just break this like this and then as

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.830 
just break this like this and then as
you<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:53.650> see<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.730> water<00:02:55.060> push<00:02:55.629> it<00:02:55.810> now

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
you can see the water push it now

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.349 
you can see the water push it now
there's<00:02:56.500> occasional<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.549> it<00:02:57.760> goes<00:02:58.000> there

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
there's occasional like it goes there

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.420 
there's occasional like it goes there
you<00:02:58.540> know<00:02:58.660> but<00:02:58.900> whenever<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.680> replant<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.340> you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
you know but whenever you replant it you

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.030 
you know but whenever you replant it you
could<00:03:00.609> pick<00:03:00.879> those<00:03:01.030> up<00:03:01.260> see<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.650> as<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.890> can

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
could pick those up see but as you can

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.470 
could pick those up see but as you can
see<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.459> falls<00:03:03.849> down<00:03:04.060> like<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.109> like<00:03:06.480> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
see it falls down like this like the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.660 
see it falls down like this like the
water<00:03:07.660> pushes<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.349> and<00:03:08.560> then<00:03:09.190> there's<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.430> fence

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
water pushes it and then there's a fence

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.160 
water pushes it and then there's a fence
so<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.910> don't<00:03:10.090> fall<00:03:10.239> down<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.629> know<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.989> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
so you don't fall down you know and the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.099 
so you don't fall down you know and the
items<00:03:11.910> fall<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.120> there<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:16.090> these<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.629> then

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
items fall in there like these and then

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.080 
items fall in there like these and then
there's<00:03:17.440> also<00:03:17.590> water<00:03:18.130> that's<00:03:18.669> under<00:03:18.880> here

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
there's also water that's under here

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.920 
there's also water that's under here
that<00:03:19.480> pushes<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.700> items<00:03:22.120> there<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.750> it

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
that pushes it the items there and it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.099 
that pushes it the items there and it
goes<00:03:23.169> or<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.040> staircase<00:03:24.519> is<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.660> pretty<00:03:25.959> cool

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
goes or the staircase is so pretty cool

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.539 
goes or the staircase is so pretty cool
pretty<00:03:26.319> cool<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:30.130> reason<00:03:30.430> why

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
pretty cool and so the reason why

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.640 
pretty cool and so the reason why
there's<00:03:30.819> like<00:03:30.910> columns<00:03:31.419> like<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.470> see

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
there's like columns like this you see

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.900 
there's like columns like this you see
so<00:03:32.859> you<00:03:32.919> could<00:03:33.099> separate<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.760> different

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
so you could separate the different

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.740 
so you could separate the different
types<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.419> plants<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:35.560> if<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.609> just<00:03:37.060> wanted<00:03:37.540> to

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
types of plants so if I just wanted to

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.440 
types of plants so if I just wanted to
collect<00:03:38.139> the<00:03:38.380> wheat<00:03:39.280> because<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.120> other<00:03:40.239> ones

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
collect the wheat because the other ones

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.229 
collect the wheat because the other ones
aren't<00:03:40.630> ready<00:03:41.069> then<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.519> just<00:03:42.790> destroyed<00:03:43.209> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
aren't ready then you just destroyed the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.170 
aren't ready then you just destroyed the
wheat<00:03:43.510> column<00:03:43.870> right<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.919> then<00:03:45.400> if<00:03:45.669> you<00:03:45.910> want

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
wheat column right and then if you want

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.430 
wheat column right and then if you want
the<00:03:46.299> potatoes<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.109> carrots<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:48.340> destroy

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
the potatoes and the carrots you destroy

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.520 
the potatoes and the carrots you destroy
you<00:03:50.440> destroy<00:03:50.560> both<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.010> them<00:03:51.280> so<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:53.410> don't

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
you destroy both of them so you don't

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.199 
you destroy both of them so you don't
have<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.829> destroy<00:03:54.160> all<00:03:54.430> them<00:03:54.700> at<00:03:54.849> once<00:03:55.060> you

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
have to destroy all them at once you

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.789 
have to destroy all them at once you
know<00:03:56.250> just<00:03:57.250> each<00:03:57.489> column<00:03:57.879> so<00:03:58.870> that's<00:03:59.019> that's

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
know just each column so that's that's

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.460 
know just each column so that's that's
what's<00:04:00.069> nifty<00:04:00.430> about<00:04:00.639> it<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.940> okay<00:04:04.840> yeah<00:04:05.260> I

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
what's nifty about it so okay yeah I

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.689 
what's nifty about it so okay yeah I
destroyed<00:04:06.280> too<00:04:07.030> many<00:04:07.209> blocks<00:04:08.040> that's<00:04:09.040> that's

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
destroyed too many blocks that's that's

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:13.470 
destroyed too many blocks that's that's
only<00:04:09.879> because<00:04:10.030> it's<00:04:10.329> on<00:04:10.449> creative<00:04:10.840> though<00:04:12.480> but

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
only because it's on creative though but

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.939 
only because it's on creative though but
if<00:04:13.540> you're<00:04:13.690> using<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:14.019> shovel<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.680> wouldn't

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
if you're using a shovel it wouldn't

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:20.039 
if you're using a shovel it wouldn't
destroy<00:04:15.250> as<00:04:15.459> fast<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:18.090> okay<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.539> pretend<00:04:19.900> I'm<00:04:20.019> a

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
destroy as fast so okay to pretend I'm a

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.820 
destroy as fast so okay to pretend I'm a
potato<00:04:20.530> all<00:04:21.039> right<00:04:21.159> and<00:04:21.400> I'm<00:04:21.489> just<00:04:21.549> gonna<00:04:21.820> flow

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
potato all right and I'm just gonna flow
