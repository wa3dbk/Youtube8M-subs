00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 good friends of haqqani engines we are at a 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:15.629
 citroen event for the ds3 cup test 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.539
 unfortunately, time does not help us 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:22.050
 raining and not a little here in Milan we are 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.140
 with moma style.com alessandra that we 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.539
 will give female impressions on this 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 car on comfort as it goes on like the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.900
 find but I give you some data 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.980
 engine technician are testing 1600 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.910
 155 horses therefore the most version 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.580
 powerful in the range however will come 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.070
 also represented the 82 horses that goes 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.220
 great for new drivers being 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.500
 below the legal limits then also the hd 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.370
 hence the engine one for all diesel 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.020
 by 90 horses we are driving it 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.990
 mostly in the city we did 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.730
 also a few kilometers in in 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.170
 tangentially a 50 trial course 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.900
 minutes these will be the first 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.510
 impressions on this ds3 that I think 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.640
 really very well finished but here at the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.170
 sacred tell me what you think of this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.690
 plank of the belleri and the skin 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.909
 ethically it is really fantastic and it is 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.429
 also very happy 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.229
 what I absolutely believe I must 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:23.450
 make it go to the public 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.119
 beautiful beautiful finishes 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.459
 really really a car 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.630
 especially comfortable the seats 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:34.630
 they are very quiet and in short no 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.280
 I must say that I am 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.780
 fully satisfied he releases me 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.140
 what you say silent because the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.820
 soft top is produced by had been that 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.490
 produces practically all the soft tops for 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.740
 all convertibles in production are triple 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.960
 stratum and citroen asked him the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.689
 same specifications as aston martin 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.049
 therefore tendency to be silent 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.000
 of this ds3 is practically the same 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.060
 at least so in citroen assure us to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.950
 that of the ds 3 sedan 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.380
 you talked about comfort I tell you right away 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.200
 that the structure of this 155 horses is 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.929
 very stiff very flat does not roll not 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.819
 pitching repeats very little approved 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.530
 but the sensations are the guiding ones 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.709
 pretty karting with a steering wheel 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.940
 nice direct and even power assistance 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.920
 I particularly liked it 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.319
 suspension however that absorb well 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.330
 and the holes and holes with snow and rain 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.760
 of these days in Milan here if they are 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.660
 many opened I just got one 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.110
 chasm 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.489
 the engine despite being a petrol turbo 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.250
 however it has a lot of torque even at low 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.650
 and departures are never a problem 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.510
 also cited this start stop are not 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.380
 problems there is no start stop for 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.670
 as for the engine there are others 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.489
 first goodies the 6-speed gearbox loses 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.340
 that negative note that meaning 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.790
 I therefore call that French 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.519
 rubberiness because 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.670
 honest if i like them a little 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.890
 noisy when changing gear but 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.340
 however the gear change and also the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.469
 clutch is very good not braking 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.870
 I can tell you it's much pressure 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.989
 of the punctured good but we have not had 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.900
 way to test it for a long time I hope to 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.250
 being able to test it longer when 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.750
 he enters the test for ps3 that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.349
 continues with success because they are 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.420
 200,000 have been sold since 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.970
 launch date 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.129
 ds3 icons remain on this 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.220
 cabrio because the roof opens into 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.510
 only in the upper part and e 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.030
 posterior not lateral then the fin 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.610
 of the ds3 remains but alessandra del 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.110
 standard pheasant 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.600
 guys it's raining but i'll show you 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.890
 open hooded hood attention 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.270
 with three opening positions de vos 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.010
 left what happens you continue 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.920
 open this is the first of you thanks 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.880
 Alessandro had to convince to do 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.990
 this is the second thing 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.540
 position 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:14.210
 all open and as you see one opens 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.620
 large section a ration called the known 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.750
 rear in glass with resistors 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.900
 so for the rear window then also 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.660
 season tickets for old convertibles 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.120
 I am a memory the boss can open 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.530
 up to 120 kilometers per hour 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.960
 in this case I would say to close it 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.240
 completely the air conditioner feels 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.550
 that the open top increases 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.140
 air flow according to conditions 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.310
 there is also a wind stop outside 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.380
 positioned above the other top 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.030
 icons of this that if 3 convertibles are i 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.260
 headlights placed 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.630
 the resigners we had seen at 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.660
 presentation when you saw it for 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.880
 first time in Sicily and tell the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.950
 first pressures are certainly a lot 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.710
 good prices range from around 18 thousand e 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.300
 900 euros for the basic version at around 26 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.640
 thousand euros for these super versions 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.940
 equipped but that much seats in 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.340
 skin the air freshener 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.660
 automatic and many goodies above all 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.080
 for comfort for the andrea engines 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.080
 hope
