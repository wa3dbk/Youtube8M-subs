like you it'll just be refined this is a

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.439 
like you it'll just be refined this is a
time<00:03:32.440> when<00:03:32.680> we're<00:03:33.099> able<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.459> actually<00:03:33.489> make

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
time when we're able to actually make

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.210 
time when we're able to actually make
the<00:03:34.599> changes<00:03:34.930> while<00:03:35.109> they're<00:03:35.319> in<00:03:35.409> school<00:03:35.440> and

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
so if they have a self-image issue we

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.180 
so if they have a self-image issue we
can<00:03:40.870> correct<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.169> at<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.379> time<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.919> make

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
can correct it at that time and make
