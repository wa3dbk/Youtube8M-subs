00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.440
 in this tutorial we are going to learn to 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.820
 create hdr photographs with the program 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.910
 cs6 we are in version cs6 extend 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.520
 I say it because maybe some of you can 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.140
 change if you have another version worth 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.460
 let's first explain that they are 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.560
 the hdr images something basic and simple 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.500
 but so that we understand what is the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.550
 hdr images are high range images 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.430
 dynamic and this hdr technique allows us 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.340
 improve the dynamic range of the zones 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.440
 more illuminated and the shadow areas of 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.480
 our pictures us 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.149
 we would need to get a minimum of three 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.930
 photographs with a tripod and with our 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:58.309
 camera to be able to transform it later 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:02.239
 in a htc r then we would need a 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.519
 slr camera not of these compact that what 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.280
 they do everything automatic but they have 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.969
 of the dial of speed and openings of you 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.690
 to fragma then imagine that we are going to 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.150
 create 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.960
 our hdr photography we carry our 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.230
 tripod our SLR camera and we place it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.090
 in the landscape where we want 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.790
 create a picture for later 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.740
 turn it into hdr then we put 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.860
 our kind of we assemble our camera 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.540
 and we put the sports and speed meter 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.810
 as an example let's imagine that 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.950
 gives us a speed in the husband 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.980
 meter and it gives us a correct speed of 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.840
 125 then we shoot and 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.570
 then we would have to change the dial 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.850
 of speed to a stop below and 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.980
 then a stop above the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.300
 correct exposure what depended 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.610
 so we shoot our first 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.430
 our first shot at 125 us 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.190
 we would pass the pp the speed dial and 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.679
 we would pass it to 60 then we had it 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:13.550
 once again to 125 and we raise it another stop 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.890
 that was selling at 250 speed and 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.290
 we make another shot then 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.360
 we would have our three photographs 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.879
 once we have our 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.219
 photography made with our three 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.500
 photographs we would pass them to 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:31.380
 our computer 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.020
 I have opened photoshop and news of 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.360
 cs 6 I say it for what it is if you want 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.820
 work as a server because what 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.730
 do so and so you find the same 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.840
 functions that I'm going to handle then 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.550
 if we come to mini bridge 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.430
 as an example and here we have the 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.470
 photographs I did a few more for 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.470
 here I have a few 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.700
 but let's take in this case these 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.430
 three photographs for them 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.950
 we appeal the control key and we are going to 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.430
 choose the three photographs with which 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.770
 We are going to turn our image into 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.160
 hdr 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.860
 then we come with right button 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.330
 photoshop and here where it puts combine 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.400
 for hdr pro we give to ok and the program 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.950
 now he's going to do some functions for us 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.640
 automatic way we will leave a 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.510
 message that we will see 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.280
 here we accept tells us that maybe in 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.530
 the photographs have not been made with the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.060
 same camera in this case is incorrect 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.430
 because they are made with the same camera 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.590
 and here we have the three photographs that 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.940
 we have made one with a speed 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.670
 another with note and another with another then 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.420
 by default it surprises like this with 16 bits the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.570
 we leave as such and here we can 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.600
 decide if it was an urban dusk if it is 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.630
 a plane if it is a monochromatic 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.050
 artistic if it's monochromatic the high 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.970
 contrast mount monochromatic heap of 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.050
 low contrast in order here we have some 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.390
 how many functions that can help us 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.560
 that is, it allows us to decide in 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.750
 what do we want to work on our hd image 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.329
 r 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.240
 let's choose one any 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.980
 example let's take a 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.110
 monochromatic artist for artistic by 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.210
 example and here we can work with 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.870
 our radio 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.360
 as much as we want 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.860
 also the intensity we can go 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.689
 working them 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.909
 and working on the photograph if it does not come out 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.000
 some kind of ghost is not coming out 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:50.909
 a ghost of these literals is 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.810
 a feeling that if we have moved 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.819
 a little bit the camera then we could in 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.039
 apply it here to disappear in 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.590
 this case because I have a good 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.539
 tripod but maybe you have stuck a 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.360
 Blizzard of air to brains can move a 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.849
 little then clicking is this from whom 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.460
 we would eliminate the ghost too 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.669
 we can soften the edges leaving it without 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.669
 soften 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.380
 we can work with the range 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.409
 in order here we have a few 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.779
 functions 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:26.709
 that will allow us also the 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:31.610
 exhibition that will allow us 

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:34.069
 we work our image 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.270
 then it was advanced we can also 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.270
 work with shadows 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.960
 the illuminated areas we can give more 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.960
 contrast 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.889
 The intensity 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.139
 in this case the radio 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.789
 perhaps a little too it would lower 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.310
 saturation we can give it a bit of 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.860
 saturation and in this case I had it 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.110
 lowered but we can if we want 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.319
 take it out in color we follow the 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.790
 saturation with what we can leave a tone 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.890
 as well as subtle 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.200
 and once we had it to 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.810
 taste forgive me before he moved here 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.730
 we also have the curve of which which 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.090
 we could work a little 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.090
 curve 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.810
 and leave it to our liking suppose that 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.670
 we have already worked and we have it to 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.030
 our taste here we would give it to ok 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.850
 and now we would pass this image 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:44.780
 the photoshop program continues 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:47.750
 working with the image we can hide 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.730
 a moment in the mini bridge and here 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.430
 we would have our image already finished 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.540
 I've seen that here I get a piece of 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.470
 I'm going to make a small lamp 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:02.540
 selection with the frame tool 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:06.140
 elliptical same edition fill create 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.570
 according to content and control so that 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.520
 I eliminated if once we have it 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.800
 finished we would like to continue 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.220
 working on our image we come 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.760
 here to image adjustments and here we find 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.550
 hdr tones this window is the same 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.620
 window that I have shown you previously 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.550
 the only thing that as I had the images 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.740
 in raw because it automatically opens me the 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.020
 rock show but to you it is 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.030
 it's possible that they will not open rock but 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.900
 You can work the same thing that I have done 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.120
 previously from this part here 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.000
 I 'm going to cancel it because I've already 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.430
 decided that I would like this way 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.190
 but you can experiment with 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.440
 all the settings you have and find 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.720
 the function that you like very well 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:57.130
 we have seen how to work our 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:59.919
 photography hdr a little theory of how 

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.970
 create our photographs and cameras 

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.970
 that we need
