like knee pad knee guards here and when

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.649 
like knee pad knee guards here and when
you<00:04:38.009> first<00:04:38.189> unbox<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.879> these<00:04:39.120> are<00:04:39.270> on<00:04:39.419> pretty

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
you first unbox it these are on pretty

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.580 
you first unbox it these are on pretty
sturdy<00:04:40.020> but<00:04:40.919> if<00:04:41.219> you<00:04:41.430> ever<00:04:41.669> pop<00:04:42.150> them<00:04:42.360> off

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
sturdy but if you ever pop them off

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.439 
sturdy but if you ever pop them off
they're<00:04:43.590> really<00:04:44.039> hard<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.400> get<00:04:44.490> back<00:04:44.550> on<00:04:45.060> and

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
they're really hard to get back on and

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.260 
they're really hard to get back on and
keep<00:04:45.719> them<00:04:45.930> there<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:47.370> once<00:04:47.669> they<00:04:48.030> come<00:04:48.240> off

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
keep them there like once they come off

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.920 
keep them there like once they come off
the<00:04:48.659> first<00:04:48.960> time<00:04:49.280> they'll<00:04:50.280> fall<00:04:51.150> off<00:04:51.180> really

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
the first time they'll fall off really

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.179 
the first time they'll fall off really
easily

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
easily

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.779 
easily
I<00:04:54.379> guess<00:04:55.379> maybe<00:04:55.949> that<00:04:56.219> makes<00:04:56.400> them<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.639> little

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
I guess maybe that makes them a little

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.839 
I guess maybe that makes them a little
more<00:04:56.940> poseable<00:04:57.560> but<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.860> think<00:04:59.580> they<00:04:59.669> could

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
more poseable but I think they could

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.249 
more poseable but I think they could
have<00:04:59.940> at<00:05:00.060> least<00:05:00.090> like<00:05:00.449> you<00:05:00.599> know<00:05:00.719> see<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:01.020> here

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
have at least like you know see you here

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.959 
have at least like you know see you here
where<00:05:01.500> they<00:05:02.159> made<00:05:02.340> these<00:05:02.520> like<00:05:02.699> leather

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
where they made these like leather

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.969 
where they made these like leather
wrappings<00:05:03.539> out<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.020> plastic<00:05:04.560> they<00:05:04.710> could<00:05:04.889> have

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
wrappings out of plastic they could have

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.550 
wrappings out of plastic they could have
put<00:05:05.219> something<00:05:05.460> down<00:05:05.759> there<00:05:06.000> to<00:05:06.840> cover<00:05:07.349> up<00:05:07.469> the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
put something down there to cover up the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.260 
put something down there to cover up the
back<00:05:07.740> there<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.039> it's<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.400> not<00:05:08.580> exposed<00:05:08.969> ball

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
back there so it's just not exposed ball

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.170 
back there so it's just not exposed ball
joint

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
joint

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.920 
joint
yeah<00:05:12.180> those<00:05:12.360> come<00:05:12.599> off<00:05:12.690> really<00:05:12.990> easily<00:05:14.930> other

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
yeah those come off really easily other

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.800 
yeah those come off really easily other
aspects<00:05:16.560> are<00:05:16.710> really<00:05:17.580> delicate<00:05:17.789> the<00:05:18.599> first

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
aspects are really delicate the first

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.969 
aspects are really delicate the first
night<00:05:19.050> that<00:05:19.080> we<00:05:19.289> actually<00:05:19.469> wanted<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.860> go

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979

cheaper and there's a lot more
information<00:06:07.050> about<00:06:07.440> it<00:06:07.740> online<00:06:07.949> I<00:06:08.490> would<00:06:08.940> say

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
information about it online I would say

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.689 
information about it online I would say
you<00:06:09.900> know<00:06:10.020> if<00:06:10.620> you're<00:06:10.800> just<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:11.069> moderate<00:06:11.460> fan

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
you know if you're just a moderate fan

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.719 
you know if you're just a moderate fan
stick<00:06:12.150> to<00:06:12.300> that<00:06:12.740> because<00:06:13.740> this<00:06:13.919> is<00:06:13.979> not<00:06:14.339> worth

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
stick to that because this is not worth

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.480 
stick to that because this is not worth
the<00:06:15.210> $90

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
the $90

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.079 
the $90
you<00:06:17.490> know<00:06:17.610> price<00:06:18.029> tag<00:06:18.770> even<00:06:19.770> even<00:06:20.639> if<00:06:20.759> you<00:06:20.879> can

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:21.089 
you know price tag even even if you can

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:24.260 
you know price tag even even if you can
find<00:06:21.330> it<00:06:21.449> for<00:06:21.539> $70<00:06:22.319> you<00:06:23.190> know<00:06:23.339> including

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
find it for $70 you know including

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.749 
find it for $70 you know including
shipping<00:06:24.539> or<00:06:24.870> whatever<00:06:25.219> you<00:06:26.219> know<00:06:26.310> after<00:06:26.639> the

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
shipping or whatever you know after the

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.800 
shipping or whatever you know after the
cost<00:06:26.909> of<00:06:27.180> them<00:06:27.449> having<00:06:27.750> to<00:06:27.839> import<00:06:28.199> it<00:06:29.810> really

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
cost of them having to import it really

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.409 
cost of them having to import it really
not<00:06:31.199> worth<00:06:31.409> it<00:06:31.649> I<00:06:31.770> don't<00:06:31.919> think<00:06:32.190> I<00:06:32.459> mean<00:06:33.180> it's

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
not worth it I don't think I mean it's

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.629 
not worth it I don't think I mean it's
it's<00:06:33.719> really<00:06:34.020> detailed<00:06:34.740> I<00:06:35.279> mean

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
it's really detailed I mean

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.580 
it's really detailed I mean
looks<00:06:35.969> just<00:06:36.150> like<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:36.419> character<00:06:36.870> from<00:06:37.499> the

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
looks just like the character from the

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.339 
looks just like the character from the
anime<00:06:37.949> every<00:06:38.490> little<00:06:38.729> detail<00:06:38.849> matches<00:06:39.659> the

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
anime every little detail matches the

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:45.739 
anime every little detail matches the
character<00:06:41.930> but<00:06:42.930> again<00:06:43.349> just<00:06:43.999> the<00:06:44.999> the<00:06:45.479> motion

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:45.749 
character but again just the the motion

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:49.399 
character but again just the the motion
aspect<00:06:46.439> of<00:06:46.560> it<00:06:46.740> is<00:06:46.889> it's<00:06:47.159> just<00:06:47.219> not<00:06:47.490> there<00:06:48.409> if

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
aspect of it is it's just not there if

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.929 
aspect of it is it's just not there if
you<00:06:49.560> pose<00:06:49.770> there<00:06:49.979> a<00:06:50.009> certain<00:06:50.219> way<00:06:50.460> she'll<00:06:50.789> just

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:50.939 
you pose there a certain way she'll just

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.719 
you pose there a certain way she'll just
topple<00:06:51.300> over<00:06:51.949> once<00:06:52.949> you<00:06:53.039> move<00:06:53.219> things<00:06:53.550> a

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
topple over once you move things a

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
certain way it's kind of hard to see

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.790 
certain way it's kind of hard to see
like<00:06:56.069> her<00:06:56.400> hips<00:06:56.849> move<00:06:57.150> and<00:06:57.569> all<00:06:58.080> this<00:06:58.499> and
