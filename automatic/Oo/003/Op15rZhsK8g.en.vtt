00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
you open it up again and then you do the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:03:04.730 
you open it up again and then you do the
same<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.910> other<00:02:48.150> three<00:02:48.840> sides

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.380 

okay<00:03:05.480> now<00:03:06.480> open<00:03:06.780> everything<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.120> take<00:03:09.120> one

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
okay now open everything up and take one

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.760 
okay now open everything up and take one
corner<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.020> open<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.980> up<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.530> part

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
corner and open it up this is the part

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.210 
corner and open it up this is the part
where<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.250> whole<00:03:14.910> box<00:03:15.450> shaping<00:03:16.070> begins<00:03:17.070> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
where the whole box shaping begins to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.460 
where the whole box shaping begins to
take<00:03:17.370> shape<00:03:17.420> you're<00:03:18.420> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.810> cut<00:03:19.020> up<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.380> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
take shape you're going to cut up to the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.090 
take shape you're going to cut up to the
first<00:03:19.680> crease<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.490> diagonal<00:03:21.260> along<00:03:22.260> this

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
first crease on a diagonal along this

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.780 
first crease on a diagonal along this

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.449 

you<00:03:28.790> fold<00:03:29.090> in<00:03:29.299> these<00:03:29.720> little<00:03:30.709> triangles<00:03:31.340> on

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
you fold in these little triangles on

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.140 
you fold in these little triangles on
the<00:03:31.579> sides<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:33.129> fold<00:03:34.129> right<00:03:34.760> here<00:03:34.790> in<00:03:35.060> the

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
then you fold over and that side is done

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.100 
then you fold over and that side is done
turn<00:04:21.590> it<00:04:21.620> around

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
nicely decorated now this is the cover I

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.430 
nicely decorated now this is the cover I
already<00:04:34.979> had<00:04:35.159> made<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.580> base<00:04:36.120> for<00:04:36.539> my<00:04:36.599> box<00:04:37.020> all

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
already had made a base for my box all

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.439 
already had made a base for my box all
you<00:04:37.800> have<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:38.039> do<00:04:38.220> is<00:04:38.430> cut<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.699> square<00:04:38.909> there's

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
you have to do is cut a square there's

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.149 
you have to do is cut a square there's
at<00:04:39.690> least<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:40.229> quarter<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.650> an<00:04:40.740> inch<00:04:40.830> smaller

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
at least a quarter of an inch smaller

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:46.939 
at least a quarter of an inch smaller
and<00:04:42.169> it'll<00:04:43.169> fit<00:04:43.409> right<00:04:43.590> into<00:04:44.069> your<00:04:44.970> cover<00:04:45.949> so

and it'll fit right into your cover so

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.499 
and it'll fit right into your cover so
this<00:04:47.099> is<00:04:47.220> one<00:04:47.400> design<00:04:47.669> this<00:04:47.879> is<00:04:48.030> another<00:04:48.270> one

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
this is one design this is another one

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.270 
this is one design this is another one
that<00:04:48.539> I<00:04:48.659> made<00:04:48.900> there<00:04:49.620> are<00:04:49.740> other<00:04:49.919> ways<00:04:50.129> that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
that I made there are other ways that

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.249 
that I made there are other ways that
you<00:04:50.340> can<00:04:50.520> make<00:04:50.729> this<00:04:50.970> box<00:04:51.240> basically<00:04:52.020> you

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
you can make this box basically you

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.290 
you can make this box basically you
could<00:04:52.470> um<00:04:52.680> did<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.430> paper<00:04:53.699> doesn't<00:04:53.970> have<00:04:54.180> to

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
could um did the paper doesn't have to

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.709 
could um did the paper doesn't have to
match<00:04:54.479> you<00:04:54.930> can<00:04:55.080> do<00:04:55.289> contrasting<00:04:56.009> colors<00:04:56.400> or

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
match you can do contrasting colors or

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.600 
match you can do contrasting colors or
for<00:04:57.719> example<00:04:57.780> in<00:04:58.139> this<00:04:58.259> case<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.860> used<00:04:59.159> vellum

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
for example in this case I used vellum

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.430 
for example in this case I used vellum
paper<00:04:59.819> vellum<00:05:00.810> paper<00:05:00.930> is<00:05:01.139> a<00:05:01.199> little

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
paper vellum paper is a little

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.659 
paper vellum paper is a little
translucent<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.190> I<00:05:02.310> don't<00:05:02.400> know<00:05:02.520> if<00:05:02.610> you

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
translucent and I don't know if you

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.939 
translucent and I don't know if you
could<00:05:02.849> see<00:05:03.120> my<00:05:03.330> finger<00:05:03.900> or<00:05:04.259> something<00:05:04.500> that<00:05:04.919> I

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
could see my finger or something that I

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.730 
could see my finger or something that I
put<00:05:05.219> in<00:05:05.370> inside<00:05:05.879> you<00:05:06.750> can<00:05:06.930> kind<00:05:07.169> of<00:05:07.259> see<00:05:07.620> it

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
put in inside you can kind of see it

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.379 
put in inside you can kind of see it
it's<00:05:07.949> a<00:05:08.039> little<00:05:08.250> bit<00:05:08.400> translucent<00:05:08.759> so<00:05:09.300> it

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
it's a little bit translucent so it

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.619 
it's a little bit translucent so it
gives<00:05:09.569> a<00:05:09.659> different<00:05:09.690> type<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.139> look<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:11.629> then

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
gives a different type of look and then

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.399 
gives a different type of look and then
just<00:05:13.259> to<00:05:13.379> show<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:13.729> when<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:15.690> use<00:05:15.840> regular
