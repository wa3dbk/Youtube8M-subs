00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.270
 hello everyone welcome to another video 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.430
 about gta 5 information fast to 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.230
 out of your land that will be something about 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.539
 the epsilon program good this what is 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.119
 this is supposedly a kind of 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.630
 sect that there will be in gta 5 in the game 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.579
 and then they are parodying things and have 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.379
 made a new entry in your newswire 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.440
 on the website where you can see 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.899
 The 12 Commandments of the Epsilon Program 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.750
 this for example and in the background you can see 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.539
 waves of a sea and things like that and good this 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.190
 video comes to that may this that we 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.230
 they are showing is a part of the game 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.120
 a part of the map this area with the lighthouse 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.100
 there in the background these waves well in 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.960
 movement may be well as 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.440
 involves the water in gta 5 and we 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.210
 are teaching and I say this because the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.649
 graphics seem a lot to me like they are 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.120
 those who usually do rockstar also 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.920
 they look like those that have been seen in the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.140
 trailer the sky also looks like 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.659
 quite a bit the clouds to how they were 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.610
 in the trailer one and another of the things is 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.710
 that in the water if you notice every time 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.960
 The wave passes the white trail that 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.820
 supposedly that's the salt and you see 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.800
 exactly like a photograph 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.159
 that they taught us a few days ago in the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.289
 that lightning was coming out 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.390
 then it gives me to think that this 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.579
 equally yes that is gta 5 this at 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.609
 better part of the map is a part of 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.409
 a side where the map ends and 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.850
 this about there is infinite water to the best 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.409
 this is one of those areas when it 's going 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.259
 forward the video is saying 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.000
 things about the epsilon program looks 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.799
 a mountain and maybe this is the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.140
 end of the map area like I just 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.880
 to say and from this that there is infinite water 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.179
 everywhere as in all maps 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.640
 gt Aces Yes that's how it is 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.619
 gta iv that's how water is in the gta 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.840
 5 is to say that I love how it 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.549
 the waves behave I like very much how 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.379
 the rocks are molded these also 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.810
 it looks like they have the graphics of the 

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:02.579
 things that have been shown in the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.679
 different pictures or in the trailers 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.879
 or the videos of the game good the videos 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.950
 of the game are only two that are both 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.629
 trailers but good then the things that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.970
 talk above the exile program are 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.099
 for example, what are you 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.300
 putting things like religious or things 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.190
 like that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.260
 and well nothing important I could 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.390
 highlight only that word they put 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.280
 kiflom I do not know exactly what it is and 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.920
 some you have or you have deciphered - 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.620
 you can say in the comments that sky 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.230
 efe efe lm maybe you have to see how 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.700
 the initials if it is one is a phrase that 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.480
 has something to do with the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.730
 gta 5 this rockstar will surely be 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.920
 giving here subliminal advertising about 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.200
 the game and good the video as you will see 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.030
 right now it's short hard less than three 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.440
 minutes and enters a continuous loop 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.030
 going forward I just got 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.440
 sound the mobile if that has sounded 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.510
 brum if you have heard it is the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.270
 good mobile because I hope that I have 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.270
 liked the video and until next time
