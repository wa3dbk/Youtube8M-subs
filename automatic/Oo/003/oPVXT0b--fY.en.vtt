00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it's about it got the ignition hot wired

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.109 
it's about it got the ignition hot wired
up<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.619> didn't<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> key<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
up because I didn't have the key so I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.870 
up because I didn't have the key so I
just<00:00:30.420> took<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.869> then<00:00:31.610> hot-wired<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
just took it out and then hot-wired the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.950 
just took it out and then hot-wired the
wires<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.329> back<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:35.149> now<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> horn

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
wires on the back here so now the horn

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.540 
wires on the back here so now the horn
works<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> blinkers<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.309> lights

the turn signals and everything stagers

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
the turn signals and everything stagers
been<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.180> ripped<00:00:45.420> apart<00:00:45.829> all<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> parts<00:00:47.280> in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.530 
rear cylinder heads or both cylinder
heads<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.970> they<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.119> clogged<00:01:18.360> up

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
heads actually and they get clogged up

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.170 
heads actually and they get clogged up
with<00:01:18.689> oil<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> end<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:20.180> overheating

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
with oil and then you end up overheating

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
with oil and then you end up overheating
and<00:01:21.360> seizing<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> cylinder<00:01:22.320> head<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.430> that's

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and seizing a cylinder head so that's

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.390 
and seizing a cylinder head so that's
what<00:01:23.729> happened<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:26.340> can

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
what happened to this one here you can

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.460 
what happened to this one here you can
see<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.880> chunk<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> cam<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.630> broken<00:01:28.320> off

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
see that chunk of the cam is broken off

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.950 
see that chunk of the cam is broken off
got<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> timing<00:01:29.850> chain<00:01:29.880> moved<00:01:30.270> down<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.810> can

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
got the timing chain moved down so I can

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.499 
got the timing chain moved down so I can
get<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> out<00:01:31.490> but<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.670> owners<00:01:33.000> manual<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
get it out but in the owners manual that

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.140 
get it out but in the owners manual that
says<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.930> got<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> drop<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.759> drop<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> end

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
says you got to drop the drop the end

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.810 
says you got to drop the drop the end
you<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.439> in<00:01:37.439> order<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.950> take<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> cylinder

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
you know in order to take the cylinder

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.039 
you know in order to take the cylinder
head<00:01:38.970> off<00:01:39.000> because<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.570> tight<00:01:39.780> against

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
head off because it's so tight against

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.859 
head off because it's so tight against
the<00:01:40.170> frame<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.909> that's<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.299> freaking<00:01:42.659> heavy

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the frame and that's a freaking heavy

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.819 
the frame and that's a freaking heavy
motor<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.530> bike<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:44.600> pretty<00:01:45.600> heavy<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.560> fell

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
motor this bike is pretty heavy it fell

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.910 
motor this bike is pretty heavy it fell
over<00:01:47.009> once<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.490> pick<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.530> guess<00:01:49.649> I'll

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
over once I pick it up so I guess I'll

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.580 
over once I pick it up so I guess I'll
probably<00:01:50.100> end<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.369> dropping<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.880> motor<00:01:51.060> out

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
probably end up dropping the motor out

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.719 
probably end up dropping the motor out
probably<00:01:52.590> part<00:01:52.829> two<00:01:53.040> I'll<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> motor

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
probably part two I'll have the motor

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.569 
probably part two I'll have the motor
out<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:53.970> pop<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> cylinder<00:01:54.780> head<00:01:54.930> off<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
out and pop the cylinder head off and

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.770 
out and pop the cylinder head off and
maybe<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> stator<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.420> I'm<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.659> sure

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
maybe have the stator and I'm not sure

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
maybe have the stator and I'm not sure
why<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.960> stator<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.380> out<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.850> if

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
why the stator is out I don't know if

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.840 
why the stator is out I don't know if
there's<00:02:00.060> something<00:02:00.270> wrong<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> but

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
there's something wrong with it but

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.789 
there's something wrong with it but
anyways<00:02:02.850> pretty<00:02:03.270> good<00:02:03.420> bike<00:02:03.600> only<00:02:04.200> seven

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
anyways pretty good bike only seven

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.830 
anyways pretty good bike only seven
thousand<00:02:05.280> four<00:02:05.430> hundred<00:02:05.759> miles<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.299> it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.389 

so<00:02:09.319> obviously<00:02:09.649> get<00:02:09.860> her<00:02:09.950> cleaned<00:02:10.220> off<00:02:10.369> and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
so obviously get her cleaned off and

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.180 
so obviously get her cleaned off and
hopefully<00:02:11.390> sell<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.870> or<00:02:11.990> something<00:02:12.380> but<00:02:13.100> if

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
hopefully sell it or something but if

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.250 
hopefully sell it or something but if
