we<00:00:10.290> start<00:00:10.620> by<00:00:10.800> uncovering<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.000> footer<00:00:12.270> and<00:00:12.570> as

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
we start by uncovering the footer and as

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.520 
we start by uncovering the footer and as
you<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:14.070> there<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> lot<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.299> water<00:00:15.600> down

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:16.530 
you can see there is a lot of water down

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.920 
you can see there is a lot of water down
here<00:00:16.890> along<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.280> footer<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.600> why<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
here along the footer that is why the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.950 
here along the footer that is why the
footer<00:00:19.440> tile<00:00:19.770> becomes<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.640> important<00:00:21.300> to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
footer tile becomes so important to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.110 
footer tile becomes so important to
remove<00:00:22.440> this<00:00:22.800> water<00:00:25.130> continue<00:00:26.130> digging<00:00:26.400> until

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120

you've<00:00:27.300> uncovered<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:28.170> footer<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.860> have<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.370 
you've uncovered that footer and have a

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.089 
you've uncovered that footer and have a
nice<00:00:29.700> little<00:00:29.970> trench<00:00:30.390> along<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.470> side<00:00:31.770> of<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
nice little trench along the side of the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.950 
nice little trench along the side of the
footer<00:00:32.369> that's<00:00:33.120> where<00:00:33.420> we're<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> lay

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
footer that's where we're going to lay

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.430 
footer that's where we're going to lay
our<00:00:34.170> pipe<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:35.160> gravel<00:00:35.610> underneath<00:00:35.879> of<00:00:36.239> it

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
our pipe with gravel underneath of it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.590 
our pipe with gravel underneath of it
here<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.770> an<00:00:38.039> over<00:00:38.760> pour<00:00:39.060> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> footer

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
here we have an over pour of the footer

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.430 
here we have an over pour of the footer
you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.530> wide<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.370> litter<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
you can see how wide this litter is and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.960 
you can see how wide this litter is and
now<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.920> we're<00:00:44.070> doing<00:00:44.100> now<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.820> we're

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
now what we're doing now is we're

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.540 
now what we're doing now is we're
putting<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.600> liquid<00:00:46.020> rubber<00:00:46.410> onto<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
putting some liquid rubber onto the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
putting some liquid rubber onto the
blocks<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.840> helps<00:00:49.170> keep<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.440> water

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
blocks and this helps keep the water

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.040 
blocks and this helps keep the water
from<00:00:50.280> coming<00:00:50.550> through<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.630> the<00:00:52.590> crawlspace

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
from coming through into the crawlspace

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.950 
from coming through into the crawlspace
well<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.230> liquid<00:00:55.649> rubber<00:00:55.829> hardens<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:57.630> is

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
well this liquid rubber hardens it is

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.600 
well this liquid rubber hardens it is
actually<00:00:58.380> pretty<00:00:58.620> hard<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.219> makes<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
actually pretty hard and it's makes a

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.030 
actually pretty hard and it's makes a
great<00:00:59.910> seal<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.899> we're<00:01:01.110> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> seal<00:01:01.770> all

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
great seal so we're going to seal all

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.479 
great seal so we're going to seal all
the<00:01:02.100> way<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.610> this<00:01:03.450> building<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:05.339> can

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the way around this building and you can

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.950 
the way around this building and you can
see<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.790> we're<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.570> way<00:01:06.719> up

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
see that we're not going all the way up

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
see that we're not going all the way up
the<00:01:07.110> wall<00:01:07.369> because<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> finished<00:01:08.909> grade<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the wall because the finished grade is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.349 
the wall because the finished grade is
actually<00:01:10.350> no<00:01:10.560> higher<00:01:10.890> than<00:01:11.639> the<00:01:11.880> top<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.149> that

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
actually no higher than the top of that

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.949 
actually no higher than the top of that
black<00:01:12.810> rubber<00:01:13.670> here<00:01:14.670> we've<00:01:14.819> got<00:01:15.030> pretty<00:01:15.689> much

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 
black rubber here we've got pretty much

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.770 
black rubber here we've got pretty much
the<00:01:16.319> entire<00:01:16.770> building<00:01:17.310> has<00:01:17.429> now<00:01:18.060> been<00:01:18.299> painted

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the entire building has now been painted

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.559 
the entire building has now been painted

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
with liquid rubber we're going all the

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.949 
with liquid rubber we're going all the
way<00:01:21.749> around<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.209> are<00:01:24.240> ready<00:01:24.539> to<00:01:24.779> add

the bottom of the trench
into<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.040> pipe<00:02:04.280> that's<00:02:04.670> why<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:04.880> need<00:02:05.119> gravel

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
into the pipe that's why you need gravel

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.719 
into the pipe that's why you need gravel
underneath<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.260> now<00:02:06.799> we're<00:02:07.010> inside<00:02:07.520> the

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
underneath of it now we're inside the

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.430 
underneath of it now we're inside the
crawlspace<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.569> we're<00:02:08.869> doing<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.259> same

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
crawlspace and we're doing the same

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.820 
crawlspace and we're doing the same
thing<00:02:09.800> we've<00:02:10.429> got<00:02:10.959> gravel<00:02:11.959> perforated<00:02:12.590> pipe

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
thing we've got gravel perforated pipe

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.110 
thing we've got gravel perforated pipe
that<00:02:13.130> surrounds<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:15.040> interior<00:02:16.040> wall<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
that surrounds the interior wall so that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.420 
that surrounds the interior wall so that
as<00:02:17.300> water<00:02:17.720> does<00:02:18.050> come<00:02:18.380> into<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.800> crawlspace

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
as water does come into this crawlspace

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.430 
as water does come into this crawlspace
it<00:02:19.700> will<00:02:19.850> be<00:02:19.970> picked<00:02:20.239> up<00:02:20.390> by<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:20.630> system<00:02:21.230> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
it will be picked up by this system and
