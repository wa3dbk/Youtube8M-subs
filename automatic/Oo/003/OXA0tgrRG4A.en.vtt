00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello to all the guys of 99 today we are 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.910
 here to see a gameplay of ferrari 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.519
 the race experience 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:16.830
 this in my opinion is one of the most games 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:21.510
 beautiful for him because simulation not like 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:29.060
 dbo speed shift true ie we are safe and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:34.890
 the dates of things though gravity 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:39.809
 I do n't know you see but I like it and it is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.829
 the best game to show a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.309
 commitment on the Monza track with the 458 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.309
 Italy 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.100
 here are these weapons speaking the 458 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.500
 here is the bike 58 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.500
 we think of a 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.480
 here 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.480
 this Italy racetrack should sen 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.409
 Yup 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 let's make 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.200
 two laps 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.080
 Let's start this race 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.609
 ad hoc as far as the visuals are there 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.060
 third person view that the visual 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:37.569
 in the first person that is the cockpit then 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.569
 look at the launch 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.170
 he did very well 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.970
 it's done very well 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.560
 the crisis of the good is also the damage 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.560
 usually not wrong 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.790
 no 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.790
 it helps a lot 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.310
 then then in this game it is possible 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.310
 get well 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.230
 today will want to donate 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.230
 still empty 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.550
 this came out not only of the mime also 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.550
 for ps3 xbox I don't know 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.340
 4 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.530
 increase 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.380
 it's a good graphic I ca n't talk about 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.380
 why 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.910
 very strong 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.229
 but it takes place there 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:35.750
 when i'm ever take 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.750
 I believe too 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.010
 rai modifications 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.840
 we must brake 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.040
 no 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.100
 say 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.020
 that I had recovered but 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.770
 Fedun 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.770
 third goal 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:46.440
 lost 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.440
 the south floor I was so favorable 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.680
 the father of the small of the quota 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.880
 promised 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:05.520
 fortunately the opponent is beaten 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.520
 even if it seems like he's already gone 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.200
 very probably we thank 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.360
 in the first map from a good 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:32.689
 I said maybe less can happen 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.289
 just a curve is missing 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.289
 dogfish 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.729
 no born agreement came out 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.360
 I can exploit 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.110
 only the first miracle happened 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.849
 withdraw nothing to lose with maybe 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.240
 lose a win in our pocket 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:05.699
 unless it exits the car 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.699
 no so i won 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:11.210
 then you can talk about better game 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:18.270
 berlin closed in value even if not 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:22.020
 he can play flying because for him he does not 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:24.650
 there is however for today it's all from ansys 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.650
 99
