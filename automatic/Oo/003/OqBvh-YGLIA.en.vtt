00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
they pretty much extended launch and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.900 
they pretty much extended launch and
then<00:03:31.040> put<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.280> somewhere<00:03:31.459> else<00:03:31.579> like<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
then put it somewhere else like the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
campaign but then right here doesn't

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.020 
campaign but then right here doesn't
that<00:03:34.340> look<00:03:34.489> like<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.910> dory<00:03:35.510> could<00:03:35.750> open<00:03:36.019> in<00:03:37.030> like

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
that look like a dory could open in like

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.580 
that look like a dory could open in like
you<00:03:38.269> know<00:03:38.359> like<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:38.750> thousand<00:03:39.200> point<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.530> you
