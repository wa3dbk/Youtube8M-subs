months giving my living room a little
makeover<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:03.929> thought<00:00:04.110> I'd<00:00:04.259> give<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.529> a

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.270 
makeover and I thought I'd give you a
tour<00:00:04.799> check<00:00:05.279> it<00:00:05.400> out<00:00:09.590> so<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.740> other<00:00:10.769> thing

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
tour check it out so the other thing

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.000 
tour check it out so the other thing
that<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:17.240> say<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.320> biggest<00:00:19.619> thing<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
that I say it so the biggest thing that

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.620 
that I say it so the biggest thing that
we<00:00:20.220> changed<00:00:20.520> about<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> living<00:00:21.029> room<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
we changed about the living room is the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.390 
we changed about the living room is the
color<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> walls<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
color of the walls I think it's the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.269 
color of the walls I think it's the
simplest<00:00:23.820> way<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.529> redesign<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> room<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.189> not

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
simplest way to redesign a room for not

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.970 
simplest way to redesign a room for not
much<00:00:26.490> money<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.720> remember<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.500> old<00:00:28.619> color

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
much money if you remember the old color

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400 
much money if you remember the old color
I<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:29.970> big<00:00:30.300> green<00:00:30.599> kick<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.260> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
I was on a really big green kick and so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.080 
I was on a really big green kick and so
the<00:00:31.529> walls<00:00:31.740> were<00:00:32.099> bright<00:00:32.820> bright<00:00:33.059> bright

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the walls were bright bright bright

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.090 
the walls were bright bright bright
green<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:34.140> time<00:00:34.200> around<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.770> want<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.040> do

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
green this time around I want to do

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.830 
green this time around I want to do
something<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.520> lot<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:35.730> muted<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
something a lot more muted so that the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260 
something a lot more muted so that the
colors<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> room<00:00:37.980> could<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.370> pop<00:00:39.000> as

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
colors in the room could actually pop as

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
colors in the room could actually pop as
accents<00:00:39.870> instead<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> being<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> walls

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
