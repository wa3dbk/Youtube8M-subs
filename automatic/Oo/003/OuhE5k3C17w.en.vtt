00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hey people today i wanted to show you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.200
 how I make my message boards do it 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.690
 There are two variants for that and they wanted 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.190
 I like to introduce you more often 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.240
 demand 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.889
 that you sometimes see mainspitz the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.170
 videos if i have with hair day or 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.789
 not wanna have my hair too grand 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.140
 then I'll just enter 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.090
 pressure or not go shopping 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 I have to go to work or no idea 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.710
 then I do not need to be great 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.170
 to finish my hair style and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 then comes there on the head all right 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.630
 then I would say let's start 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.399
 So now I have nothing to do with 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.899
 my hair just made 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.610
 fought and the first thing I do 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.149
 I take a normal fight 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.370
 and copy my hair a bit 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.590
 So I always do it without it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.350
 pony this and if you want then 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.600
 you can also pull the page 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 but I always do it that way 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 I got me when I was here so and a pony 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.230
 that's just a bit of volume 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.480
 maybe I'll take you a bit 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.940
 more back then you might see it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.080
 better 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.869
 I think that's how you recognize everything better 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.010
 and then here on the sides one more 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.810
 a little bit like that 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.869
 it is really fast so it 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.979
 is nothing special or anything 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.810
 I now had personally no 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.450
 video about it because I did it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.430
 simply it's nothing like that for me 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 special but you already wanted it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.439
 See more often and that's why I thought so 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.060
 Okay, I'll show you then 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.470
 I'll just take a hair tie for her 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 Of course, if the longer 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.369
 On the way , the whole are fix 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.000
 I now have the Schwarzkopf three 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.079
 weather taffeta for polo then I suppose 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.079
 a normal professional 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.159
 I take my hair I am me 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.429
 suddenly as if I had a head 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.429
 do 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.230
 he looks like this now I have to 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.520
 watch because I have no mirror here 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.410
 I have the camera as a mirror yes that 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.450
 everything does not have to be so neat at 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.250
 It looks to me then and then 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.460
 is the one variant 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.230
 I make something like a braid but 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.080
 i do not go all the way with my hair 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.540
 but make me just this loop 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.900
 here as far as it goes 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.470
 and then I do so but that's how it looks 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.170
 totally crazy and that's why 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.260
 sometimes has to look 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.420
 that's why you could do it that way 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.030
 but let me take it structurally 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.350
 me those and the side so this 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.290
 two pages of pieces and stuff that 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.090
 you just see that and stop 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.330
 we all just here to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:58.150
 tournament once the side of the page 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.510
 and then it's smaller and looks too 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.670
 bit more messi moderate and then pulled 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.810
 I just still the streaks 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.739
 out I want out, so I want 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.290
 see absolutely nothing you wait yes i 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.260
 I think that's what I do here 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.380
 just a little bit out and you 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.970
 Look here it is pushed right 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.430
 by that I now intubated before 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.830
 have and that's it then it is there 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.620
 That's all you're waiting for 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.390
 I have to do it here a bit 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.140
 more even make so if there is such a 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.180
 that's a bit chaotic on your head 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.130
 all here just so out of it all 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.840
 So evenly is it was now 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.030
 place on the other side and on the 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.400
 others were more where you are then you can 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.019
 you that just still so justly pluck it 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.430
 is not a perfect hairstyle now 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.890
 find that maybe terrible too 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.660
 but that's just my everyday life 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.489
 hairstyle when I really did not wanna 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.680
 to do my hair and then come 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.170
 we go there for the second I'm doing this 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.440
 whole times on the second is also real 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.840
 It is still done in two minutes 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.850
 easier than the first one so that my 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 hand again by huggel 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.810
 and I do the same with the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.810
 copy and with the hairspray and then 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.669
 I'll just take a set like this again 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.669
 just 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.020
 to pluck it all right here 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.570
 just with the hairs with the fingers 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.039
 go through here so you can also one 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.400
 came when you have it neat 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.770
 but then want to see the whole stop 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.120
 stricter and bit stuffy me 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.690
 Do the whole thing then always like that 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:50.690
 and yes all I do is turn me 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:54.759
 my hair just like that and makes me 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.759
 this normal classic there 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.750
 go with my hair coni around and there 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.120
 you just have such a knot up here 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.010
 my head and then I pulled the whole thing 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.330
 out again, I always do it 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:17.360
 Much much later and better 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:19.630
 and so, after all , and then so 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.630
 a little bit 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.220
 then you have the whole so yes so see 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.270
 I usually go out when I am 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.790
 go shopping or to work is 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.480
 ahead as a half normal granny you 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.310
 so to speak and that's all me 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.190
 do not know it's really nice 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.380
 or next, but you want it 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.580
 see that and I showed you yes 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.650
 the can you then stop it all over with 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.510
 fix and I always think so 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.790
 perfect if you go shopping or 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.870
 shopping is about really fat scarf has 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.490
 and you can definitely do that 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.950
 hair then just annoying and 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.900
 Pieksen and if you have the hair then over 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.030
 the screen from one sees immediately 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.940
 and that's quite enough 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.050
 if I have really fat bowls 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:10.210
 just do not bother the hair and it 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.590
 is just so cool and perfect 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.330
 and if you have no bock 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.750
 hairspray or just does not have or what 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.830
 always 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.440
 then you can agree as well 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.330
 this is now from battery of 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.990
 Schwarzkopf and it's called back volume 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.580
 push up and that's a spray brother 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.380
 that should refresh the volume so 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.210
 if somehow yesterday your hair 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.220
 washed abt and you mean today is 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.530
 your volume out then you can just 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.320
 spray the whole thing into the neck 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.770
 this volume brother works that 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.300
 exactly the same only in spree form yes and 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.220
 I recently bought that and it 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.130
 works fine but I do that 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.320
 But I have to say that powder is better 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.880
 You can also try that out 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.920
 it I have now bought new 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.680
 and so in case of emergency, it's okay 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.250
 I do not know how much it costs me 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.570
 believe so around five euros and wanted 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.390
 I will show you in any case 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.470
 then you have it again 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.690
 Volume effect you can then also with 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.480
 wearing open arms and that's it 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.520
 So I hope the video I have 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.640
 to some extent like I said it 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.620
 is her six earth-shattering but her 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.720
 By the way , I want you to see that 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.100
 to ask if you have video wishes 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.540
 I've also been at facebook 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.130
 asked then just write me in 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.490
 the comments i do not know all 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.380
 on facebook with 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.849
 or do not have possibility or what 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.039
 always write me that 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.840
 Comments want to see what for video 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.919
 there is no christmas videos now 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.870
 or something else 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.900
 it can also be quite normal videos 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.400
 I just wanted to know what is 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.319
 because maybe you want to see that 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.090
 Supermarkets lately come several 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:46.520
 videos of me and I just totally 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.650
 bock on videos to turn quite a lot 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.139
 I'm just really fun right now 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.789
 and that's why yours is writing to me 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:56.380
 I wish and I try to implement it 

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:59.860
 and that was something for you 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.860
 until next time
