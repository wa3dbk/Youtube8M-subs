guys beat medicham stuff like that just
a<00:02:01.950> really<00:02:02.280> truly<00:02:02.490> speed<00:02:02.850> stat<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.659> need

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
a really truly speed stat that you need

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.060 
a really truly speed stat that you need
to<00:02:03.840> fully<00:02:04.049> invest<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.799> all<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
to fully invest in to get all the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.059 
to fully invest in to get all the
benefits<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.780> next<00:02:06.780> we<00:02:06.990> max<00:02:07.439> out<00:02:07.619> special

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
benefits of it next we max out special

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.109 
benefits of it next we max out special
attack<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.849> hit

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
attack we hit

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.930 
attack we hit
you<00:02:09.629> know<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:10.049> 2:19<00:02:10.739> well<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.340> $2.99

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
you know a 2:19 well it would be $2.99

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.580 
you know a 2:19 well it would be $2.99
if<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.120> weren't<00:02:12.299> for<00:02:12.360> him<00:02:12.510> power<00:02:12.690> grass<00:02:12.959> but<00:02:13.500> at

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
if it weren't for him power grass but at

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.280 
if it weren't for him power grass but at
299<00:02:14.010> 298<00:02:14.940> Special<00:02:15.420> Attack<00:02:15.510> stat<00:02:15.720> which<00:02:16.140> is

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
299 298 Special Attack stat which is

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.690 
299 298 Special Attack stat which is
very<00:02:16.590> very<00:02:16.769> good<00:02:16.890> especially<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.549> conjunction

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
very very good especially in conjunction

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.089 
very very good especially in conjunction
with<00:02:17.970> life<00:02:18.209> for<00:02:18.420> very<00:02:19.019> powerful<00:02:19.530> very

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
with life for very powerful very

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.250 
with life for very powerful very
powerful<00:02:20.129> indeed<00:02:20.750> then<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:21.870> put<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.110> last

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
powerful indeed then we put the last

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.710 
powerful indeed then we put the last
four<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.890> defense<00:02:23.519> just<00:02:23.790> because<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.599> know

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
four in defense just because you know

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.899 
four in defense just because you know
why<00:02:24.959> not<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.709> can<00:02:25.829> put<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.069> in<00:02:26.129> HP<00:02:26.459> if<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:26.610> want

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
why not you can put it in HP if you want

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.479 
why not you can put it in HP if you want
I<00:02:27.150> think<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.629> take<00:02:27.840> less<00:02:28.200> from<00:02:28.799> life<00:02:28.950> orb<00:02:29.250> if

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
I think you take less from life orb if

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.640 
I think you take less from life orb if
you<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.730> an<00:02:29.849> audit<00:02:30.060> HP<00:02:30.299> number<00:02:30.390> two<00:02:30.659> so<00:02:31.200> put

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
you have an audit HP number two so put

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.250 
you have an audit HP number two so put
that<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:32.010> defense<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:32.819> we<00:02:32.879> have<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.260> attack

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that in defense then we have to attack

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.610 
that in defense then we have to attack
IVs<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.680> lessen<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.280> power<00:02:35.519> of<00:02:36.049> foul<00:02:37.049> play

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
IVs to lessen the power of foul play

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.339 
IVs to lessen the power of foul play
confusion<00:02:38.159> all<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.790> mess<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.209> think<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
confusion all that mess I think this

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.199 
confusion all that mess I think this
will<00:02:40.470> give<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.340> know<00:02:41.459> still<00:02:42.090> give

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
will give you the you know still give

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.640 
will give you the you know still give
you<00:02:42.299> hidden<00:02:42.510> power<00:02:42.629> grass<00:02:42.750> as<00:02:43.260> long<00:02:43.410> as<00:02:43.530> it's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
you hidden power grass as long as it's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.110 
you hidden power grass as long as it's
an<00:02:43.709> even<00:02:44.040> number<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.549> is<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.819> lowest

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
an even number and this is the lowest

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.430 
an even number and this is the lowest
even<00:02:45.420> number<00:02:45.629> we<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.930> get<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.790> yeah

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
even number we can get I think so yeah

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.650 
even number we can get I think so yeah
but<00:02:49.440> anyway<00:02:49.709> let's<00:02:49.950> let's<00:02:50.879> go<00:02:51.480> over<00:02:51.569> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
but anyway let's let's go over the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.140 
but anyway let's let's go over the
ability<00:02:52.049> competitive<00:02:52.799> now<00:02:53.280> competitive<00:02:53.970> is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
ability competitive now competitive is

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.809 
ability competitive now competitive is
interesting<00:02:55.079> because<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:56.010> every<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.640> kind

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
interesting because for every it's kind

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.509 
interesting because for every it's kind
of<00:02:56.849> like<00:02:57.030> um<00:02:57.560> defiant<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.920> for<00:02:59.310> special

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
of like um defiant but for special

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.649 
of like um defiant but for special
attackers<00:03:00.859> so<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:02.519> know<00:03:02.609> if<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.879> get<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.180> stat

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
attackers so you know if you get a stat

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.770 
attackers so you know if you get a stat
lowered<00:03:04.019> or<00:03:04.170> whatever<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:05.159> can<00:03:05.780> essentially

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
lowered or whatever you can essentially

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.720 
lowered or whatever you can essentially
roll<00:03:07.230> over<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> team<00:03:07.859> I<00:03:08.010> don't<00:03:08.159> think<00:03:08.280> anything

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
roll over a team I don't think anything

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.220 
roll over a team I don't think anything
I<00:03:08.819> don't<00:03:08.940> think<00:03:09.090> even<00:03:09.269> special<00:03:09.690> walls<00:03:09.959> can

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
I don't think even special walls can

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.460 
I don't think even special walls can
take<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.620> life<00:03:10.829> or<00:03:11.099> boost<00:03:11.430> its<00:03:11.640> surf<00:03:12.019> or<00:03:13.019> you

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
take a life or boost its surf or you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.080 
take a life or boost its surf or you
know<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> life<00:03:13.799> floor<00:03:14.040> boosted<00:03:14.400> hydropump<00:03:14.880> you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
know a life floor boosted hydropump you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.390 
know a life floor boosted hydropump you
choose<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.389> run<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.780> instead<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:17.069> you<00:03:17.130> get<00:03:17.370> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
choose to run that instead if you get a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.089 
choose to run that instead if you get a
competitive<00:03:17.669> boost<00:03:18.290> what<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.590> do<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.980> get

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
competitive boost what you can do to get

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.030 
competitive boost what you can do to get
this<00:03:20.340> boost<00:03:20.609> is<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.810> coming<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.620> predicted

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
this boost is like coming on a predicted

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.030 
this boost is like coming on a predicted
defog<00:03:23.660> your<00:03:24.660> opponent<00:03:25.079> won't<00:03:25.139> like<00:03:25.440> never

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
defog your opponent won't like never

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.699 
defog your opponent won't like never
predict<00:03:26.609> this<00:03:26.790> ever<00:03:27.470> because<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.620> know

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
predict this ever because you know

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.339 
predict this ever because you know
melodic<00:03:29.129> like<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.400> said<00:03:29.780> 99%<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.900> time<00:03:31.049> is

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
melodic like I said 99% of the time is

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.650 
melodic like I said 99% of the time is
defensive<00:03:31.950> competitive<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.180> new<00:03:33.389> ability

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
defensive competitive is a new ability

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.750 
defensive competitive is a new ability
it's<00:03:34.049> not<00:03:34.230> very<00:03:34.500> well<00:03:34.680> known<00:03:34.919> yet<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.400> guess<00:03:35.609> it

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
it's not very well known yet I guess it

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.089 
it's not very well known yet I guess it
will<00:03:35.879> be<00:03:36.030> after<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.389> video<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.069> can

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
will be after this video but you can

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.309 
will be after this video but you can

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
come in on a defog you know if you if
