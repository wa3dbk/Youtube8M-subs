machining processes so that we can then

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740 
machining processes so that we can then
press<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.340> phases<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> blades<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
after the pressing we will then fit the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.510 
after the pressing we will then fit the
handles<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.200> handles<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> flex<00:01:23.189> and

handles the handles have to flex and
move<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:24.689> has<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:24.990> an<00:01:25.409> area

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
move well there has to be an area

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
move well there has to be an area
through<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> bat<00:01:26.729> where<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> energy<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
through the bat where the energy is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
through the bat where the energy is
absorbed<00:01:27.930> every<00:01:28.560> time<00:01:28.740> you're<00:01:28.890> hitting<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
absorbed every time you're hitting the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
absorbed every time you're hitting the
ball<00:01:29.430> once<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> handles<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:30.990> fitted<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.560> will

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
ball once the handles are fitted we will

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.740 
ball once the handles are fitted we will
actually<00:01:31.829> work<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.000> final<00:01:33.479> sort<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
