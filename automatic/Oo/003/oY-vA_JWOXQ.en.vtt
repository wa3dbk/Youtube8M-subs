00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
to mount this piece here in your car

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.500 
to mount this piece here in your car
basically<00:02:18.080> glue<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.560> place<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:20.480> it

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
basically glue it in place and have it

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.460 
basically glue it in place and have it
flush<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.230> where<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.270> basically<00:02:23.270> runs<00:02:24.110> along

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
flush to where the basically runs along

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.070 
flush to where the basically runs along
the<00:02:24.770> surface<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.430> car<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.910> know<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.810> these

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the surface of the car you know so these

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.290 
the surface of the car you know so these
are<00:02:27.350> basically<00:02:27.770> flat<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.760> surface<00:02:29.180> of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
are basically flat with the surface of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.540 
are basically flat with the surface of
the<00:02:29.420> trunk<00:02:29.690> opening<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.770> then<00:02:31.130> what<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.370> do

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
the trunk opening and then what you do

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.870 
the trunk opening and then what you do

stander CA glue it's a two-part it's a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.450 
stander CA glue it's a two-part it's a
thick<00:02:38.330> type<00:02:38.930> superglue<00:02:39.560> what<00:02:40.310> they

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
thick type superglue what they

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.690 
thick type superglue what they
accelerator<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.390> love<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.050> Tuffy<00:02:42.700> while

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
you're doing it's good to go so that's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.660 
you're doing it's good to go so that's
that<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.500> then<00:02:54.650> basically<00:02:55.070> what<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.430> want<00:02:55.610> to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670

that and then basically what you want to
do<00:02:55.790> okay<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.720> got<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.080> glued<00:02:57.320> in<00:02:57.470> place

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
do okay and you got it glued in place

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.290 
do okay and you got it glued in place
here<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.550> then<00:02:58.700> you're<00:02:58.820> going<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.000> want<00:02:59.239> to

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
here and then you're going to want to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.530 
here and then you're going to want to
lay<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:01.430> don't<00:03:01.610> want<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.820> lay<00:03:01.970> your<00:03:02.209> door

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540

lay you don't want to lay your door
you'll<00:03:03.080> get<00:03:03.320> in<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.590> case<00:03:03.800> your<00:03:03.980> truck<00:03:04.280> on

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
you'll get in this case your truck on

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.710 
you'll get in this case your truck on
the<00:03:05.870> surface<00:03:06.320> basically<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.910> what<00:03:08.480> that's

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
the surface basically and what that's

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.890 
the surface basically and what that's
going<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:08.959> do<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.290> it's<00:03:09.440> going<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.680> line<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.160> up

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
going to do is it's going to line you up

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.840 
going to do is it's going to line you up
so<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:11.989> can<00:03:12.260> mount<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.920> two<00:03:13.130> brass<00:03:13.430> tubes

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
so you can mount you to two brass tubes

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.540 
so you can mount you to two brass tubes
and<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.930> place<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.950> what<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.190> do<00:03:16.370> is

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
and the place so what you do is

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.160 
and the place so what you do is
basically<00:03:16.850> if<00:03:17.330> they<00:03:17.480> weren't<00:03:17.630> already<00:03:17.810> glued

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
basically if they weren't already glued

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.410 
basically if they weren't already glued
on<00:03:18.410> what<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.340> do<00:03:19.550> is<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.850> slide<00:03:20.060> them<00:03:20.300> over

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
on what you do is you slide them over

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.530 
on what you do is you slide them over
the<00:03:20.660> two<00:03:20.870> best<00:03:21.170> rods<00:03:21.470> in<00:03:21.800> place<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.370> then<00:03:23.330> glue

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
the two best rods in place and then glue

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.470 
the two best rods in place and then glue
them<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.810> place<00:03:23.840> with<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.470> trunk<00:03:24.739> shut<00:03:25.040> and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
them in place with the trunk shut and

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.300 
them in place with the trunk shut and
after<00:03:26.480> that's<00:03:26.660> done<00:03:26.959> pretty<00:03:27.530> much<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:27.980> end<00:03:28.160> up

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
after that's done pretty much you end up

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.970 
after that's done pretty much you end up
with<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.910> know<00:03:29.030> you're<00:03:29.540> working<00:03:29.690> trunk<00:03:30.170> it's

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
with you know you're working trunk it's

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.670 
with you know you're working trunk it's
not<00:03:31.220> on<00:03:31.400> right<00:03:31.610> now<00:03:31.790> but<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.510> after<00:03:33.260> this<00:03:33.380> glue

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
not on right now but you after this glue

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.100 
not on right now but you after this glue
the<00:03:33.770> place<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.220> can<00:03:34.400> then<00:03:34.520> slide<00:03:34.820> it<00:03:35.110> there

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
the place you can then slide it there

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.510 
the place you can then slide it there
