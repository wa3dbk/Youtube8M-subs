the other side so this is the single
type<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.119> probably<00:00:27.330> very<00:00:27.720> similarly

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
type and it's probably very similarly

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.740

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
going to send this one off for reverb so

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.490 
going to send this one off for reverb so
we're<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.710> too<00:01:11.430> worried<00:01:12.110> okay<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.170> that's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
we're not too worried okay so that's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.960 
we're not too worried okay so that's
about<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:15.980> so<00:01:16.980> that's<00:01:17.100> those<00:01:17.520> four<00:01:18.180> off<00:01:18.890> okay

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
about it so that's those four off okay

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.610 
about it so that's those four off okay
so<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> looks<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.660> next<00:01:22.020> thing<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.410> these

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
so it looks like the next thing is these

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.850 
so it looks like the next thing is these
little<00:01:23.490> tabs<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> top<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.680> see

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
little tabs on the top so you can see

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.610 
little tabs on the top so you can see
you<00:01:26.190> got<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> plastic<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.120> can<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.530> if

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
you got a plastic you can see there if

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.640 
you got a plastic you can see there if
we<00:01:28.740> lift<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.480> now<00:01:30.480> on<00:01:30.660> there's<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.140> on

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
we lift that up now on there's a bit on

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.640 
we lift that up now on there's a bit on
the<00:01:31.800> air<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> trick<00:01:33.120> is<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.320> not<00:01:34.320> let<00:01:34.500> those

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the air so the trick is to not let those

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
the air so the trick is to not let those
click<00:01:35.040> back<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.700> you're<00:01:35.820> doing<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> other

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
click back on as you're doing the other

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.690 
click back on as you're doing the other
so<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.250> side<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:39.350> trouble<00:01:40.350> there

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
so that's the one side on trouble there

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.540 
so that's the one side on trouble there
so<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.909> try<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.840> stop<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> from<00:01:43.620> Bri

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
so if I try and stop that from Bri

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.180 
so if I try and stop that from Bri
engaging<00:01:45.350> I'm<00:01:46.350> gonna<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.650> flat<00:01:46.950> blade

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
engaging I'm gonna get flat blade

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.920 
engaging I'm gonna get flat blade

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.990 
alright that one off there we go that
middle<00:02:06.590> one<00:02:06.619> seems<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.100> be<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.430> tricky<00:02:07.670> one

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
middle one seems to be the tricky one

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.620 
middle one seems to be the tricky one
there<00:02:09.190> okay<00:02:10.190> all<00:02:10.759> right<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.180> that's<00:02:11.270> about<00:02:11.510> it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
probably got an electrical connection

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.229 
probably got an electrical connection
yeah

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
yeah

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.949 
yeah
connected<00:02:22.420> let's<00:02:23.420> have<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.750> look<00:02:23.930> okay<00:02:24.350> right

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
connected let's have a look okay right

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.470 
connected let's have a look okay right
there<00:02:26.959> we<00:02:27.140> go<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.500> we've<00:02:27.620> got<00:02:27.799> two<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.069> these

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
there we go so we've got two of these

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.229 
there we go so we've got two of these
ribbon<00:02:29.480> type<00:02:29.989> cables<00:02:30.620> connected<00:02:31.160> here<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
ribbon type cables connected here so the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.259 
ribbon type cables connected here so the
way<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.390> disengage<00:02:33.230> these<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.000> see

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
way to disengage these as you can see

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.330 
way to disengage these as you can see
we've<00:02:35.390> got<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.540> slightly<00:02:35.870> darker<00:02:36.650> beige<00:02:36.890> bit

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
we've got a slightly darker beige bit

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.259 
we've got a slightly darker beige bit
here<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.239> if<00:02:38.390> we<00:02:38.510> push<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:38.930> bar<00:02:39.260> backwards

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
here and if we push that bar backwards

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.410 
here and if we push that bar backwards
okay<00:02:41.269> on<00:02:41.959> one<00:02:42.200> side<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.920> then<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.220> other<00:02:46.420> okay

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
okay on one side and then the other okay

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.570 
okay on one side and then the other okay
we<00:02:47.569> should<00:02:47.630> then<00:02:48.019> be<00:02:48.350> able<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.250> tease

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
we should then be able to just tease

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.660 
we should then be able to just tease
that<00:02:49.610> out<00:02:50.709> clever<00:02:51.709> little<00:02:51.890> connector<00:02:52.400> these

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
that out clever little connector these

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.590 
that out clever little connector these
again<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.750> push<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.410> alright<00:02:55.359> push<00:02:56.359> it

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
again just push that one alright push it

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.509 
again just push that one alright push it
and<00:02:56.840> then<00:02:57.049> that<00:02:57.230> connector<00:02:57.709> comes<00:02:57.890> up<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.430> you

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
and then that connector comes up so you

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.190 
and then that connector comes up so you
can<00:02:58.640> see<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.940> electrical<00:02:59.359> connections<00:02:59.989> are

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
can see the electrical connections are

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.520 
can see the electrical connections are
on<00:03:00.350> that<00:03:00.920> side<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.549> ribbon<00:03:01.820> cable<00:03:02.269> is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
on that side of the ribbon cable is

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.900 
on that side of the ribbon cable is
reinsert<00:03:03.530> them<00:03:03.709> make<00:03:03.890> sure<00:03:03.920> they're<00:03:04.280> fully

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
reinsert them make sure they're fully

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.270 
reinsert them make sure they're fully
inserted<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.959> then<00:03:06.079> you<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.769> click<00:03:07.040> those

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
inserted and then you just click those

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.160 
inserted and then you just click those
lock<00:03:08.239> tabs<00:03:08.660> in<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.959> that's<00:03:11.959> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
lock tabs in so that is the that's the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.660 
lock tabs in so that is the that's the
radio<00:03:12.410> facial<00:03:12.769> remove<00:03:13.010> now<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:13.370> you've<00:03:13.489> got<00:03:13.640> a

problem with the LCD screen or you need
to<00:03:16.160> change<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.640> LCD<00:03:17.239> screen<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:18.350> looks<00:03:18.620> like<00:03:18.890> a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
to change the LCD screen it looks like a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.009 
to change the LCD screen it looks like a
similar<00:03:19.310> process<00:03:20.180> you've<00:03:20.630> got<00:03:20.750> similar

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
similar process you've got similar

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.410 
similar process you've got similar
connectors<00:03:21.620> here<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.430> you've<00:03:22.820> also<00:03:23.000> got<00:03:23.209> some

connectors here and you've also got some

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.150 
connectors here and you've also got some
screws<00:03:24.820> here<00:03:26.049> for<00:03:27.049> locating<00:03:27.380> these<00:03:27.680> circuit

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
screws here for locating these circuit

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.729 
screws here for locating these circuit
boards<00:03:28.340> on<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:29.570> hopefully<00:03:29.840> that'll<00:03:30.260> get<00:03:30.500> you

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
boards on but hopefully that'll get you

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.530 
boards on but hopefully that'll get you
certainly<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.430> worst<00:03:31.609> bit<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.120> job<00:03:32.329> done

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
certainly the worst bit of the job done

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.810 
certainly the worst bit of the job done
there
