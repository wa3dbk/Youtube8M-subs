00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.140 
certain distance and here you can see
you<00:02:36.079> can<00:02:36.260> set<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:37.430> distance<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.090> meters

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
you can set the distance and meters

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.030 
you can set the distance and meters
currently<00:02:41.150> there's<00:02:41.359> no<00:02:41.540> way<00:02:41.719> to<00:02:41.780> set<00:02:42.079> it<00:02:42.200> in<00:02:42.409> a

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
your stop motion video playback so you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.750 
your stop motion video playback so you
can<00:04:18.109> select<00:04:18.289> the<00:04:18.709> number<00:04:18.979> of<00:04:19.219> frames<00:04:19.430> per

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
can select the number of frames per

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.330 
can select the number of frames per
second<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:21.320> here<00:04:21.469> you<00:04:21.529> can<00:04:21.590> see<00:04:21.769> that's<00:04:21.979> really

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
second so here you can see that's really

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.200 
second so here you can see that's really
super

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
super

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.960 
super
superfast<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:25.270> if<00:04:26.270> we<00:04:26.449> put<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.080> down<00:04:27.199> to<00:04:27.350> two

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
superfast and if we put it down to two

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.900 
superfast and if we put it down to two
and<00:04:28.970> it's<00:04:29.090> significantly<00:04:29.690> slower<00:04:30.699> you<00:04:31.699> can

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
and it's significantly slower you can

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.710 
and it's significantly slower you can
also<00:04:32.229> add<00:04:33.789> filters<00:04:35.710> down<00:04:36.710> here<00:04:37.569> which<00:04:38.569> is

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
also add filters down here which is

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.879 
also add filters down here which is
really<00:04:38.930> cool<00:04:39.199> you<00:04:39.590> can<00:04:39.740> add<00:04:39.889> artistic<00:04:40.580> filters

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
can experiment with frames and distances

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.070 
can experiment with frames and distances
and<00:06:43.009> whatnot<00:06:43.400> it<00:06:43.669> is<00:06:43.849> pretty<00:06:44.059> cool<00:06:44.330> so<00:06:44.809> I
