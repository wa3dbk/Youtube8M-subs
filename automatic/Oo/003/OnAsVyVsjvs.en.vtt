mitral valve repair and a young man and
we<00:01:29.729> did<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> aortic<00:01:30.270> valve<00:01:30.479> replacement

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
we did in the aortic valve replacement

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.530 
we did in the aortic valve replacement
both<00:01:31.170> through<00:01:31.409> his<00:01:31.439> many<00:01:31.710> incisions<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.670> an

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
obviously we know that the operation is

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.780 
obviously we know that the operation is
one<00:01:41.210> small<00:01:41.570> part<00:01:41.869> of<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.409> total<00:01:43.280> care<00:01:43.549> of<00:01:43.670> the

we've got a great team of patients out
there<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.970> they<00:02:08.030> often<00:02:08.209> write<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.720> with

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
there and they often write in with

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.630 
there and they often write in with
questions<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.800> one<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.250> questions<00:02:10.580> that

questions and one of the questions that

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.640 
questions and one of the questions that
I<00:02:10.759> got<00:02:10.880> recently<00:02:11.269> was<00:02:11.390> sort<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.569> Carrigan<00:02:11.959> then

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
I got recently was sort of Carrigan then

after<00:02:25.519> surgery<00:02:25.850> we<00:02:25.940> get<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.420> little<00:02:27.050> nervous

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
after surgery we get a little nervous

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.690 
after surgery we get a little nervous
that<00:02:27.440> something<00:02:27.890> didn't<00:02:28.100> go<00:02:28.130> right<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:28.549> is

is very common a murmur is it just a
little<00:02:35.360> sign<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.959> there<00:02:36.530> may<00:02:36.650> be<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.830> little

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
little sign that there may be a little

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.770 
little sign that there may be a little

most important thing about that patient

most important thing about that patient
is<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.440> he<00:03:06.620> does<00:03:06.799> need<00:03:07.010> follow-up<00:03:07.250> because

is that he does need follow-up because

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.270 
is that he does need follow-up because
the<00:03:07.910> murmur<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.359> just<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.720> murmur<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.769> images

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
the murmur is just a murmur the images

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.740 
the murmur is just a murmur the images
on<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.430> echocardiogram<00:03:11.180> determining

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
whether or not that murmur is pathologic

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.220 
whether or not that murmur is pathologic
meaning<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.000> valve<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.359> getting<00:03:14.630> narrowed<00:03:14.989> or

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230

meaning the valve is getting narrowed or
is<00:03:15.350> leaking<00:03:15.709> are<00:03:15.890> more<00:03:16.130> important<00:03:16.609> so<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.299> am

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
is leaking are more important so I am

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.840 
is leaking are more important so I am
sure<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:17.900> that<00:03:18.380> Mela<00:03:18.650> was<00:03:18.859> fine<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.670> for

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
sure that that Mela was fine and so for

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.370 
sure that that Mela was fine and so for
Carrigan<00:03:20.239> your<00:03:20.390> recommendation<00:03:21.079> for<00:03:21.260> him

Carrigan your recommendation for him

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.920 
Carrigan your recommendation for him
though<00:03:21.530> would<00:03:21.829> be<00:03:21.859> to<00:03:22.340> keep<00:03:23.299> having<00:03:23.660> annual
