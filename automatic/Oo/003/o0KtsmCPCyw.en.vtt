00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
looks like could be trouble yeah exactly

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.190 
looks like could be trouble yeah exactly

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
because it's not only just rain and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.320 
because it's not only just rain and
heavy<00:00:04.500> rain<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.100> quite<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> bit<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.759> it<00:00:06.029> for

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
several days but we have the potential

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.940

thunderstorm warnings to fire up

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.950 
thunderstorm warnings to fire up
throughout<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.000> course<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> day<00:01:27.930> today

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
throughout the course of the day today

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.499 
throughout the course of the day today
and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> suspect<00:01:29.670> National<00:01:30.119> Weather

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and then I suspect National Weather

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
and then I suspect National Weather
Service<00:01:30.900> will<00:01:31.020> probably<00:01:31.470> extend<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.400> watch

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
Service will probably extend that watch

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.880 
Service will probably extend that watch
into<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> evening<00:01:33.659> there's<00:01:34.229> also<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.530> flood

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
into the evening there's also a flood
