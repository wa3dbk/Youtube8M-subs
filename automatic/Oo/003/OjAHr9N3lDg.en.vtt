00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello girls welcome to the channel this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.139
 Once I bring you a video about what 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.470
 what is dandruff is the problem so 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.049
 annoying for many people 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.560
 since as I told you in a 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.010
 video to my a shampoo caused me this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 dandruff problem because I'm not from 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.710
 suffer from dandruff but the truth is that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.419
 how I like to be trying different 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.460
 shampoos because I do not like that my 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.860
 hair be bad habit to one 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.480
 then this time caused me a 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.700
 little problem 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.500
 and the girl thing is that like 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.800
 you know I love things 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.750
 natural and all that but this time I 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.960
 I wanted to give a joke to something that was not 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420
 natural since natural things if you 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.670
 they work but you need to be very 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.630
 constant to see the results and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.240
 really I was going to attend an event and 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.310
 I needed to get rid of that dandruff 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 he has like he needed something that was 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.570
 the fastest the soonest then I went 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.610
 to the pharmacy to buy shampoo you 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.710
 I do not know if they have heard of him such a shampoo 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.180
 I have heard medical quite in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.580
 television 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.730
 the thing that I did not find it at all 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.160
 but I found another shampoo and I took a chance 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.140
 to buy it I was not very sure if I 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.330
 it was going to work but the truth is that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.750
 it worked very well because in the first 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.380
 I use girls I take off like 90% of the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.550
 dandruff which was very very satisfying 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.560
 very good and the shampoo is this to the box 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.040
 I already throw it away but I want to make you like 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.869
 a review of this product I'm not 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.970
 doing because the company has 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.759
 hired something like that because not 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.920
 I bought it with my money in the brand of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.660
 neutral or neutral neutrogena and this is the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.720
 sold in pharmacies I found it 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.330
 the world greens for a price as 10 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.759
 dollars if more or less like 10 dollars 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.880
 it cost me as I tell them from what I read 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.310
 in the on the label that this one 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.310
 risk to buy it from me yes 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.600
 It worked, it's worth mentioning that it 's a 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.140
 product 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.660
 a little strong in the smell a little strong 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.550
 when you put it on this one that if it leaves you 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.920
 like a little bit stiff the hair a 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.870
 little dry but if you clean 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.950
 pretty the scalp of the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.220
 annoying dandruff earlier years ago 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.370
 back I had also appeared from this 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.520
 and the truth is that we try the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.560
 natural products that did cost me 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.660
 very much that I could get it out 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.210
 understand then why I decided 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.730
 buy this which I recommend 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.700
 but always remember that we all have 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.500
 different type of skin hair 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.850
 etc. can make us like them 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.400
 in people and can do that to 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.390
 other no but not personal I do 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.330
 I can recommend the way I 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.550
 I'm using it, it's good I got to bathe and 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.430
 He washed his hair well more than anything else 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.160
 I rinse it goes well with the water and 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.000
 later since I had it wet already I 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.250
 put a quantity of the shampoo 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.170
 in the scalp I massaged it 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.630
 you know that always the first 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.690
 washing will not foam you until the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.720
 second so that it penetrates well then I 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.890
 I took it off I put a little bit of this 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.300
 and it was good again, this one for 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.010
 that penetrates well in the scalp 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.840
 well the massage then later so that 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.240
 not my hair will not stay with the smell 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.750
 as medicinal because if it has a smell 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.480
 so strong what I was doing is putting my 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.700
 shampoo already usual in the third 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.270
 rinse and leave it a little bit so that 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.459
 it was that smell of what was rinsing and now 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.220
 I put my conditioner on stockings 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.290
 tips normally in the first 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.570
 girls I noticed as I say them 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.610
 difference because I needed a 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.310
 product that will take away that dandruff 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.440
 soon because, as I say, is that 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.900
 I was going to an event and 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.519
 So I needed you not to see how 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.000
 those scales or anything like that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:25.440
 and I think it's super good 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.199
 I was using about twice in the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.319
 week once or twice a week what 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.389
 I used right now I already have 15 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:36.300
 days that I have not used it because 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.949
 Well, I took off what was really 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:43.110
 lacquers as you can realize well and I 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.389
 I do not know why but it came out more and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.720
 I concentrated on what was the part 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.900
 this is how it is annoying because 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.610
 well imagine that front anybody 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.380
 You can admire it but it's very important 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.870
 that you take into account that it is a product 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.849
 super strong that suddenly you're going to 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.069
 put dry hair so it's 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.229
 important that you apply your oils and 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.360
 Always your normal hair care 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.250
 so you do not see that as you can see my 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.919
 hair right now I do not know abused 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.919
 nothing because as I keep doing its 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.319
 little things and everything and apart from that in these 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.669
 I'm going to bring you a video 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.350
 talking to you about something that I've been 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.200
 doing for the fall 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.870
 and lest you can not notice but 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.930
 I already have many little hairs that come 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.720
 coming out they are doing then I 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.330
 I was giving him this chance 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.760
 what am I doing to bring you to 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.580
 you this video and show them that if 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.230
 It has been working well for me 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.550
 as I tell you talking about this other 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.800
 product 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.950
 I recommend them to girls like that 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.140
 I think that if you do not have this 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.030
 product as well as within reach can 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.880
 find on the internet here is the 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.100

 I do not know, asking for it online 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.140
 they charge you shipping or not but this field is 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.330
 very good and I wanted to give them as a 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.320
 little review is called to you 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.940

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.860
 which I like because it is approved by
