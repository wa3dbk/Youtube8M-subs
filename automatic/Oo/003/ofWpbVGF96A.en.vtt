actually over the past summer hours we

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.869 
actually over the past summer hours we
have<00:00:39.930> seen<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> center<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.860> circulation<00:00:41.100> at

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
have seen the center of circulation at

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.810 
have seen the center of circulation at
least<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.300> bulk<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.260> eye<00:00:43.770> wall<00:00:44.280> start<00:00:44.670> to

least the bulk of that eye wall start to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.910 
least the bulk of that eye wall start to
expand<00:00:45.329> away<00:00:45.719> from<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> center<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.680> does

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
expand away from the center so it does

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.279 
expand away from the center so it does
look<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.820> storm<00:00:48.120> systems<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:49.020> only

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
look like the storm systems and not only

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.619 
look like the storm systems and not only

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
in the Philippines well it does look

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.140

there's gonna be another low forming in
the<00:01:16.259> Philippine<00:01:16.590> seas<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.009> something<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the Philippine seas so something to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
the Philippine seas so something to
watch<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.450> let's<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> look<00:01:19.500> at

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
watch out for but let's take a look at

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.649 
watch out for but let's take a look at
the<00:01:20.009> official<00:01:20.670> track<00:01:20.909> from<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.509> Japan

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
system as of 0 UTC when I'm doing this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.660

video<00:01:26.729> update<00:01:27.240> pressure<00:01:27.570> about<00:01:28.040> 965<00:01:29.040> HPA<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
video update pressure about 965 HPA so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
video update pressure about 965 HPA so
just<00:01:30.150> below<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> threshold<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.140> typhoon<00:01:31.680> but

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
just below the threshold of typhoon but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.230 
just below the threshold of typhoon but
I<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.640> look<00:01:32.759> at<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> satellite

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
I do think just look at a satellite

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.330 
I do think just look at a satellite
imagery<00:01:33.720> at<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.049> time<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.950> current

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
imagery at this time in actually current

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.399 
imagery at this time in actually current
microwave<00:01:35.850> imagery<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.540> looks<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.930> lot<00:01:37.170> lower

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
microwave imagery it looks a lot lower

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.260 
microwave imagery it looks a lot lower
than<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.860> very<00:01:38.220> well-defined<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
than with that very well-defined I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.730 
than with that very well-defined I
really<00:01:39.720> forming<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.439> center<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
really forming around that center of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.380 
really forming around that center of
circulation<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.430> look<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.729> banding

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
circulation but look at this banding

with that very well-defined eye you can

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.420 
with that very well-defined eye you can
see<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> pop<00:01:52.140> right<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.280> that

this is gonna be skirting the youth
towards<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.100> south<00:02:02.280> see<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:03.030> bands<00:02:03.390> coming

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689

definitely a very severe risk there for
southern<00:02:16.320> China<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.310> main<00:02:17.550> threat<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.570> we

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
southern China but the main threat if we

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.060 
southern China but the main threat if we
go<00:02:18.840> back<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.320> track<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:19.710> going<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.950> be

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
go back to that track it's going to be

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.680 
go back to that track it's going to be
here<00:02:20.310> along<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.700> coastline<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.300> Vietnam

at<00:02:24.210> NAMM<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.720> south<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.440> Hanoi<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.940> gonna

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
at NAMM but south of Hanoi this is gonna

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.000 
at NAMM but south of Hanoi this is gonna
make<00:02:27.300> an<00:02:27.450> landfall<00:02:27.930> as<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.080> pretty<00:02:28.440> strong

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
make an landfall as a pretty strong

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.120 
make an landfall as a pretty strong
tropical<00:02:29.460> system<00:02:30.270> upwards<00:02:30.780> impossibly<00:02:31.380> at

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
tropical system upwards impossibly at

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.100 
tropical system upwards impossibly at
least<00:02:32.400> according<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.850> je<00:02:33.090> ma<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.300> category<00:02:33.870> 2

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
least according to je ma a category 2

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.720 
least according to je ma a category 2
but<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.350> think<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.680> could<00:02:34.830> be<00:02:34.950> even<00:02:35.190> higher<00:02:35.400> in

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
but I think it could be even higher in

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.430 
but I think it could be even higher in
intensity<00:02:36.240> than<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.630> especially<00:02:37.140> once<00:02:37.350> it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
intensity than that especially once it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.620 
intensity than that especially once it
gets<00:02:37.650> out<00:02:37.740> here<00:02:38.010> towards<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.490> Gulf<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:39.450> get

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
gets out here towards the Gulf you get

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.510 
gets out here towards the Gulf you get
some<00:02:39.840> very<00:02:39.990> warm<00:02:40.440> sea<00:02:40.740> surface<00:02:40.980> temperatures

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
some very warm sea surface temperatures

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.280 
some very warm sea surface temperatures
combined<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.270> with<00:02:42.450> lower<00:02:42.720> vertical<00:02:43.140> wind

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
combined in with lower vertical wind

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.230 
combined in with lower vertical wind
shear<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.800> often<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.370> see<00:02:44.640> storms<00:02:44.940> once

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
shear and we often do see storms once

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.510 
shear and we often do see storms once
they<00:02:45.360> enter<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.840> area<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.530> ocean<00:02:46.740> right<00:02:47.310> in

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
they enter this area of ocean right in

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.510 
they enter this area of ocean right in
here<00:02:47.880> ah<00:02:48.050> see<00:02:49.050> an<00:02:49.350> explosive<00:02:50.070> intensification

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
here ah see an explosive intensification

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.250 
here ah see an explosive intensification
so<00:02:51.090> there's<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.330> possibility<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:52.080> that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
so there's a possibility of that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.990 
so there's a possibility of that
occurring<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:53.610> looking<00:02:53.880> at

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
occurring but this is just looking at

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.449 
occurring but this is just looking at

look at the current satellite imagery I

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.449 
look at the current satellite imagery I
do<00:03:11.940> think<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.600> completely<00:03:12.920> possible<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
do think that is completely possible and

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.449 
do think that is completely possible and

evening<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.690> really<00:04:16.260> just<00:04:16.530> starts<00:04:16.769> near<00:04:17.040> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
evening it really just starts near the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.860 
evening it really just starts near the
coastline<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.820> this<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.299> where<00:04:18.600> we're

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
coastline and this is where we're

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.960 
coastline and this is where we're
thinking<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:19.500> center<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.220> circulation<00:04:20.579> is

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
thinking that center of circulation is

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.330 
thinking that center of circulation is
gonna<00:04:21.120> be<00:04:21.209> pushing<00:04:21.450> onshore<00:04:22.289> just<00:04:22.890> north<00:04:23.190> of

and<00:04:57.120> that's<00:04:57.390> where<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.720> highest<00:04:58.110> risk<00:04:58.350> of

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
and that's where the highest risk of

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.650 
and that's where the highest risk of
storm<00:04:58.830> surge<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.220> going<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.610> be<00:04:59.760> up<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.030> 4<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.480> 5

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
storm surge is going to be up to 4 to 5

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.450 
storm surge is going to be up to 4 to 5
meter<00:05:00.900> high<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.470> these<00:05:01.620> low-lying<00:05:02.160> coastal

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
meter high in these low-lying coastal

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.820 
meter high in these low-lying coastal
areas<00:05:03.060> are<00:05:03.180> very<00:05:03.240> well<00:05:03.660> possible<00:05:04.140> not<00:05:04.710> to

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
areas are very well possible not to

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.050 
areas are very well possible not to
mention<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.190> high<00:05:05.340> waves<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:05.760> are<00:05:05.820> gonna<00:05:05.970> be

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
mention the high waves that are gonna be

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.090 
mention the high waves that are gonna be
coming<00:05:06.300> ashore<00:05:06.540> with<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:06.900> as<00:05:07.080> well<00:05:07.290> and<00:05:07.470> then

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
coming ashore with this as well and then

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.340 
coming ashore with this as well and then
the<00:05:08.400> heavy<00:05:08.610> rainfall<00:05:08.970> farther<00:05:09.630> inland<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.230> do

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
the heavy rainfall farther inland you do

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.320 
the heavy rainfall farther inland you do
have<00:05:10.470> this<00:05:10.560> mountain<00:05:10.950> chain<00:05:11.130> right<00:05:11.340> here<00:05:11.640> once

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
have this mountain chain right here once

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.200 
have this mountain chain right here once
that<00:05:12.540> rain<00:05:12.720> pushes<00:05:13.260> onshore<00:05:14.060> there<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.180> a

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
that rain pushes onshore there is a

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.940 
that rain pushes onshore there is a
fairly<00:05:15.630> high<00:05:15.960> risk<00:05:16.260> of<00:05:16.380> some<00:05:16.560> flooding<00:05:16.800> and

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
fairly high risk of some flooding and

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.440 
fairly high risk of some flooding and
even<00:05:17.040> landslides<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:17.760> we<00:05:17.850> can<00:05:17.970> even<00:05:18.180> switch

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
even landslides and we can even switch

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.480 
even landslides and we can even switch
this<00:05:18.720> up<00:05:18.900> from<00:05:19.140> the<00:05:19.320> winds<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.040> let's<00:05:20.280> take<00:05:20.460> a

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
this up from the winds and let's take a

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.160 
this up from the winds and let's take a
look<00:05:20.700> at<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.880> MSL<00:05:21.390> for<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.690> same<00:05:21.870> time<00:05:22.140> period

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
look at the MSL for the same time period

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.470 
look at the MSL for the same time period
just<00:05:22.710> showing<00:05:22.950> that<00:05:23.030> precipitation<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.240> I

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
just showing that precipitation and I

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.060 
just showing that precipitation and I
almost<00:05:24.720> can<00:05:25.020> guarantee<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.620> this<00:05:25.800> is<00:05:25.920> gonna

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
almost can guarantee you this is gonna

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.070 
almost can guarantee you this is gonna
show<00:05:26.340> it<00:05:26.490> building<00:05:26.940> up<00:05:27.090> right<00:05:27.330> in<00:05:27.540> that<00:05:27.600> area

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
show it building up right in that area

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.740 
show it building up right in that area
and<00:05:28.320> kind<00:05:28.500> of<00:05:28.650> see<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.950> right<00:05:29.160> there<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:30.030> that's

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
and kind of see it right there so that's

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.090 
and kind of see it right there so that's
where<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.080> highest<00:05:31.230> risk<00:05:31.590> of<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.800> flooding

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
where the highest risk of the flooding

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.260 
where the highest risk of the flooding
and<00:05:32.190> landslides<00:05:32.640> are<00:05:32.730> gonna<00:05:32.820> be<00:05:32.970> just<00:05:33.180> a

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
and landslides are gonna be just a

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.150 
and landslides are gonna be just a
little<00:05:33.300> bit<00:05:33.540> farther<00:05:33.840> inland<00:05:34.350> right<00:05:34.860> near<00:05:35.040> the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
little bit farther inland right near the

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.680 
little bit farther inland right near the
coast<00:05:35.370> area<00:05:35.760> we<00:05:35.880> have<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.060> talk<00:05:36.210> about<00:05:36.240> storm

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
coast area we have to talk about storm

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.570 
coast area we have to talk about storm
surge<00:05:36.930> these<00:05:37.260> damaging<00:05:37.890> winds<00:05:38.130> very<00:05:38.400> well

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
surge these damaging winds very well

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.550 
surge these damaging winds very well
possible<00:05:38.850> and<00:05:39.390> not<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:40.020> mention<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.410> high

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
possible and not to mention the high

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.990 
possible and not to mention the high
waves<00:05:40.860> I'm<00:05:41.040> gonna<00:05:41.160> be<00:05:41.250> coming<00:05:41.460> ashore<00:05:41.580> so<00:05:41.970> a

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
waves I'm gonna be coming ashore so a

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.330 
waves I'm gonna be coming ashore so a
lot<00:05:42.540> of<00:05:42.570> stuff<00:05:43.020> going<00:05:43.380> on<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.890> do<00:05:43.950> think<00:05:44.310> that

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
lot of stuff going on I do think that

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.040 
lot of stuff going on I do think that
Hanoi<00:05:44.760> you're<00:05:45.060> gonna<00:05:45.180> be<00:05:45.330> missing<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.780> bulk

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
Hanoi you're gonna be missing the bulk

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.870 
Hanoi you're gonna be missing the bulk
of<00:05:46.169> this<00:05:46.290> weather<00:05:46.560> so<00:05:46.800> we're<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.340> biggest

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
of this weather so we're the biggest

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.180 
of this weather so we're the biggest
population<00:05:48.570> is<00:05:48.720> storm<00:05:49.410> system<00:05:49.770> should<00:05:49.950> remain

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
population is storm system should remain

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.590 
population is storm system should remain
farther<00:05:50.550> towards<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:50.910> south<00:05:51.120> but<00:05:51.270> somebody's

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
farther towards the south but somebody's

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.210 
farther towards the south but somebody's
outer<00:05:51.780> rainbands<00:05:52.140> are<00:05:52.560> very<00:05:52.740> well<00:05:52.890> gonna<00:05:53.040> be<00:05:53.190> a

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
outer rainbands are very well gonna be a

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.340 
outer rainbands are very well gonna be a
threat<00:05:53.580> though<00:05:53.820> even<00:05:54.570> farther<00:05:54.960> off<00:05:55.169> there

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
threat though even farther off there

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.600 
threat though even farther off there
towards<00:05:55.650> North<00:05:55.919> but<00:05:56.070> we're<00:05:56.190> talking<00:05:56.340> about

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
towards North but we're talking about

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.170 
towards North but we're talking about
down<00:05:57.030> here<00:05:57.480> into<00:05:57.690> these<00:05:58.230> areas<00:05:58.970> where<00:05:59.970> the

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
down here into these areas where the
