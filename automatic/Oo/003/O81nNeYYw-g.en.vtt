00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 I said it several times and they told me 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.799
 preseason that we're going to have the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.930
 possibility of seeing a game at home 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.730
 2-0 for the final I bought it then 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.080
 the only thing that remains is that only 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.670
 that we have a complicated obstacle because 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.080
 the lion 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.330
 it's a team that has always turned 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.490
 goals but we have also 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.740
 received very few young people in a match 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.570
 of soccer and many things can happen 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.110
 we hope to be more precise than the other 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.110
 day us 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.199
 and I think the public support is going to be 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.019
 fundamental and also make matches 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.659
 at home without despairing is a match 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.390
 of football and we also do not have 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.909
 despair that I'm calm because 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.400
 we have a lot of experience people and what 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.620
 they will know how to drive 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.450
 We think it's going to be a good match 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.610
 football and we will see who is more 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.170
 prepared to withstand the pressure 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.200
 but let's continue the same we do not have to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.180
 what change are we the same with the same 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.170
 script let's continue playing the same with 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.300
 the same intensity with same 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.370
 aggressiveness the only thing we have wants 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.740
 hit the arch just the other day 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.500
 we had 56 approaches the canary and 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.810
 we throw everything out then I think if 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.090
 we make a goal first 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.100
 the psychological change is very important 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.860
 so we have to be very good at 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.479
 defensive and make a goal nothing else to do 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.619
 a making a goal I think the appearance 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.780
 of insurance that will change a lot the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.820
 party then we need people 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.370
 that people support us and I think that their 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.770
 important actions 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.750
 we will only try to take a game to 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.580
 rival field as it was the other day but 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.470
 we know that lion has great players 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.690
 and that he will not stop looking for a goal 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.790
 then we have to make a match 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.800
 almost perfect to pass the series 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.420
 but I think that the support of the people is going to 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.140
 be fundamental to give that extra to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.450
 the players that the players 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.610
 they need the encouragement of the people to 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.120
 to give that little bit more than 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.120
 we need 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.760
 we want to reach the final but 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.890
 no no 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.619
 when you finish participation and do 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.270
 a recount there I tell you so that we 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.820
 it reached and if we fulfill we fulfill it today 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.670
 we need to earn 20 to get to the 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.900
 final I do not want to talk about assumptions not 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.900
 I'm interested, I'm not made up
