00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.560
 you have to know is that Spain arrives 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.600
 good gentlemen and miss now let's continue to talk about the cartoon spread 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.630
 how to be born where they are and why they put the breast of the group 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.289
 total silence 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.550
 They are usually dozens three years ago 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.759
 the name because 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.739
 we want to be part of this new generation 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.739
 of musicians and young people waiting for a different message 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.449
 it's for the family 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.319
 i 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.610
 it has been three years of the expedition of employment to grow the guerrilla musically 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.809
 now launching the second production the first c new nation title 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.249
 tax the park simón bolívar with an attendance more than 60 thousand people 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 live also but during the day and that second production that is titled the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.070
 world will change 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.050
 record filner 2009 and in disk release and you where are you and 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.179
 are we going to make a musical group 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.200
 don rafael point encounter 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.680
 - about this as Fernando lancia was in 2006 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.770
 for that reason I think that from that time we tell you how to unite each one we had 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.340
 as different 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.820
 bands groups 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.110
 we do not say to join all with all 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.270
 many estates tanaka different musicians excellent musicians too 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.290
 we started to work from that time of the songs we composed 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.310
 fernando lorena from other pastor another we all joined and the anses 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.170
 given we compose them then these tasks be very cool clear power 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.480
 different message did not hide afterwards as is common and current is not that what 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.020
 The only thing we want is to bring a change transformation message to this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.450
 fair arrives since allen won a colon that is getting up there 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.820
 many people that when they go to a launch concert where they said what 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.299
 that is always thinking how the music in jumping and the whole thing but not 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.570
 listen in the country 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.340
 basically what do you have to tell the world through 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.340
 of his music 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.580
 as he did his first production been a lie 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.550
 as a nation 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.630
 clear so it was the first thing we did percent the yearning always 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.360
 as as musicians is to be able to contribute something more than good music 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.270
 and more as young people to 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.669
 there are so many things that are hitting us 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.809
 then we have seen as a very good response through what we are 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:13.489
 making the message 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.700
 of each of the things we wanted to print in truth every 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.519
 song 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.529
 and that's why the world will change already as with the vision still 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.619
 a little more seriously if not only Colombia can change each of the 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.469
 nations that visit us but the world can change through very 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:28.639
 good message 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.869
 that we young people can do very good things 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.709
 and we do not necessarily have to 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.180
 is to be part of a religion to be able to listen to good music I think that 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.829
 clearly 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.399
 e us as 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:44.069
 not like friends as a family we have a purpose is to be able to show you 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.449
 to the world that can be changed 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.640
 the good music of johannes peil or modicos we have 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.010
 the different power and agree to summon many people to say something positive 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.549
 it's something super important 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.180
 talking about this musical production the world would change expected live was a 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.239
 technology that uses having been able to change lenny kravitz and the rolling 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.839
 stones for this technology 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:09.279
 well this is a recording system 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.869
 Pelarda Generation 12 was the first band that does not work 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.209
 proposed to win here in colombia this is the transmilenio system 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.859
 it is a system of a very high quality, better said and that because we 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.939
 he thought to premiere it last us that night this recording of the world 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:26.729
 switch to 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.189
 The party also includes other clubs 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.119
 not in high resolution 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.079
 night 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.459
 16 beds that photo a great 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.089
 large displacement of production technology that was made so no 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.389
 It is said that 20 thousand people worked 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.959
 in this production 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.299
 I did not imagine that I could work together with the ninth movie 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.719
 the credits are 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.679
 infinite but in a disc 20 thousand people 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.709
 Well, nothing to work 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.199
 at the end they saw cameron when reporting 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.709
 the concilor 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.790
 in parallel the bertone 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.259
 to work 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.459
 simple 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.459
 a total vision the attacker also 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.739
 admits he's behind the camera 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.609
 indesit that mention very very part of all 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.069
 what has been we always like 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:18.719

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.349
 band 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.870
 I assume the arrangements 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.870
 I like to be super well understood were months of incidents could 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.500
 being present in the edition will also be done that we carry all the time 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.370
 before a stretch approximately one year 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.509
