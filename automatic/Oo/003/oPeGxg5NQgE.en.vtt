00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.120 

we're<00:00:44.840> not<00:00:44.960> even<00:00:44.990> halfway<00:00:45.350> through<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.920> tune

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
we're not even halfway through the tune

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.380 
we're not even halfway through the tune
we've<00:00:46.340> only<00:00:46.520> just<00:00:46.610> started<00:00:46.910> throwing<00:00:47.210> a

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
we've only just started throwing a

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.180 
we've only just started throwing a

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
little bit of boosted it and it's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.040 
little bit of boosted it and it's
already<00:00:49.520> smoking<00:00:49.910> up<00:00:50.000> with<00:00:50.120> 26<00:00:50.510> files<00:00:50.720> on<00:00:50.960> the

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.149 

obviously<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.630> Dinos<00:01:06.020> new<00:01:06.679> things<00:01:06.950> some

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
obviously the Dinos new things some

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.889 
obviously the Dinos new things some
people<00:01:07.189> basically<00:01:08.090> we<00:01:08.329> could<00:01:08.479> simulate<00:01:08.689> any

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
people basically we could simulate any

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.779 
people basically we could simulate any
power<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.770> we<00:01:09.890> want<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.369> then<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.609> could

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
power that we want and then we could

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:11.950 
power that we want and then we could
check<00:01:10.969> out<00:01:11.119> all<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.420> gear<00:01:11.600> make<00:01:11.810> sure

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
check out all the gear make sure

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.539 
check out all the gear make sure
everything's<00:01:12.289> operating<00:01:12.770> correctly<00:01:12.950> how<00:01:13.340> it

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
everything's operating correctly how it

always about the numbers that you get
for<00:01:18.619> us<00:01:18.710> it's<00:01:18.890> tuners<00:01:19.280> it's<00:01:19.460> more<00:01:19.729> about<00:01:19.850> how

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
for us it's tuners it's more about how

here at pulse performance we are now
finished<00:01:36.860> up<00:01:37.100> with<00:01:37.190> this<00:01:37.340> thing<00:01:37.520> on<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> dyno

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
finished up with this thing on the dyno

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.670 
finished up with this thing on the dyno
pump<00:01:38.480> that's<00:01:38.720> already<00:01:38.960> into<00:01:39.230> the<00:01:39.320> four<00:01:39.500> digit
