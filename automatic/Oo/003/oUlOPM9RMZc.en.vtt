put a three by three hole and fill up

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.439 
put a three by three hole and fill up
with<00:00:33.989> wood<00:00:34.340> or<00:00:35.340> any<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.790> your<00:00:35.940> building<00:00:36.270> block

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
so you want to put down then put on your

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.840 
so you want to put down then put on your
enchanter<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.300> dig<00:00:39.629> round<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.350> hole<00:00:40.850> this

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
enchanter and dig round that hole this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.939 
enchanter and dig round that hole this
is<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.570> Pistons<00:00:43.019> to<00:00:43.379> push<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
is for like the Pistons to push up the

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:55.009 
is for like the Pistons to push up the
bookcase<00:00:44.489> later<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:53.329> then<00:00:54.329> fill<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.809> hole

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
bookcase later on then fill up that hole

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.610 
bookcase later on then fill up that hole
with<00:00:56.510> sticky<00:00:57.510> pistons<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.140> normal<00:00:58.440> pistons

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
with sticky pistons not normal pistons

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:12.230 
with sticky pistons not normal pistons
cuz<00:00:59.519> they<00:00:59.640> won't<00:00:59.820> work<00:00:59.970> let's<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.140> sticky<00:01:11.240> then

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
cuz they won't work let's be sticky then

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
cuz they won't work let's be sticky then
put<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.659> floating<00:01:13.020> block<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
put like a floating block there so you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.640 
put like a floating block there so you
can<00:01:14.070> put<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.369> lever<00:01:14.700> down<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:16.020> put<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
can put your lever down then put a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.260 
can put your lever down then put a
restaurant<00:01:17.220> water<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> other<00:01:17.939> side<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
restaurant water on the other side of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.950 
restaurant water on the other side of
that<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.810> redstone<00:01:19.110> dust<00:01:19.890> underneath<00:01:23.960> now

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that and redstone dust underneath now

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.330 
that and redstone dust underneath now
dig<00:01:25.320> around<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.340> Pistons<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
dig around the Pistons like this and

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:58.390 
dig around the Pistons like this and
hook<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> redstone<00:01:30.450> dust

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.219 

now<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.460> need<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.730> fill<00:01:59.970> above<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.750> redstone

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
now you need to fill above the redstone

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.910 
now you need to fill above the redstone
dust<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.370> wood<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
dust with with wood so you can do that

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.360 
dust with with wood so you can do that
just<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.100> how<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.429> about<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:10.190> like<00:02:11.190> this

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
just like how I'm about to do like this

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.250 
just like how I'm about to do like this
but<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.150> doesn't<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.600> be<00:02:12.630> what<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.080> be

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
but it doesn't have to be what it can be

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.570 
but it doesn't have to be what it can be
wherever<00:02:14.600> wherever<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.750> want<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:19.580> as

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
wherever wherever you want it to be as

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.280 
wherever wherever you want it to be as
long<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.970> doesn't<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.480> break<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
long as it doesn't like break the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:50.479 
long as it doesn't like break the
redstone<00:02:22.620> signal<00:02:22.800> will<00:02:23.100> be<00:02:23.220> fine

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.490
