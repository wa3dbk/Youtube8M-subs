00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello I come to another one 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.400
 let's fly, and now similar to today 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.820
 after the back in the last 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.650
 session follow the trial on people 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.250
 the head in half a meter over the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.279
 Runway 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.660
 he is wonderful and with that I have 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.150
 I promised if he leaves then 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.789
 celik whether there exactly 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 Of course, I am mainly 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.090
 airplane pilots the hell comes that it 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720
 a brightly- watched arts hold themselves in 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.780
 border 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.020
 but it will be okay we fly 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.870
 straight with the e 10 530 from eurocopter 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.850
 ok to rescue police military purposes 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.450
 as well as passenger transport in action 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.370
 exactly four leaves and in this case here 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.500
 a diameter of almost 1 meter 70 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.239
 and a weight of 74 kilograms 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.010
 the map where I am right now namely 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.750
 forget we are just up 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:06.470
 us- saved Linkens horny I say 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.770
 just once dress in red-white is exactly 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.920
 much better 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:18.460
 you are free 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:24.979
 good and then we go off like that 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:30.409
 little feat is of course so bland 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.450
 now build again told my 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.049
 helicopter arts throughout the course have 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.549
 I still have problems 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.530
 you have to say you have to show that 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.140
 Querulanten mix with each other and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.539
 to get through 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.539
 and he also has small problems 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:56.119
 if you are not active in the many 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:58.039
 countries do not really move like that 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.700
 Space out the rocket to the helicopter 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:06.159
 fly out very very bad on 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.759
 end so not really cool 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.769
 so we come back to shit that 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.859
 those with the war now get the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.480
 true purpose because I figure one 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.480
 Oblique position had exactly 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.340
 In fact, I always wanted to 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.920
 active in front of a roll room 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.540
 then again and so around and 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.739
 At the same time the helicopter had stopped 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.810
 your own the snout third 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.980
 skew and I could have ideas 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.739
 have seen too late too late 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.310
 balanced and then customers could 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.060
 i do not pilot him as an amateur heli pilot 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.700
 get more 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.019
 when the plane thought so 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.579
 I would have succeeded in the 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.560
 helicopter as I said I fly 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.049
 Helicopter only on the simulator again 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.459
 a bit of movement and plane 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.900
 I stop actively and flow or 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.889
 right and also in the reality of me 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.359
 I have some planes 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.239
 Helicopter fly just like me 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.450
 her as an amateur again so one 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.450
 a bit louder 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.890
 so you do not get any tricks 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.780
 when we first make three delhis com 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.580
 is really fun because I can 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.540
 really because it takes time there it needs 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.970
 with the 3d is then an even higher 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.640
 responsiveness if not 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.130
 correct with the correct or off 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.290
 Do not fix cell phones again 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.050
 properly versed with the damn 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:42.099
 funny because as every ride here is that 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.099
 now hammer out now 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.130
 I would be a bit higher legal 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.080
 get to 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.060
 now once a landing against that can 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.670
 Fortunately, the number I can 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.310
 I it is unfortunately fakt forget 100pro 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.270
 now so if they are otherwise heli 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:03.980
 flying is not a problem that is once 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:07.280
 a curve, yes, I thank the jerk 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.280
 However, nothing is not important 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.330
 broken down so now we can get here 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:19.190
 hump, who does not hover the bridge 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:24.050
 slow down so slow down 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.350
 just put and then set up well 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.670
 this one was not the problem now 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.980
 go out right now I have one now 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.450
 do not say anything until next time 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.400
 perhaps he also again 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.300
 helicopter who knows who it is now 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.790
 say until next time 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.330
 since I pointed this time the heli like 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.740
 that's the ec and I know that 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.720
 because I have to yes in the video 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.060
 Describe again for writing his 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.760
 same in the bilge music looks as 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.960
 I do not have to play the game again 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.960
 good again until the next
