00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.240
 So then on the boat just go around it 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.410
 problem with the boat is a very big role 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.949
 skype water is immediately visible from here 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.869
 this god is lower a little higher 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:32.610
 but it's not so good here 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.100
 maybe the video will turn out like this 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.190
 or else if something needs to be done a video 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.260
 Perisu not we wait further immediately shoals 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.200
 which is visible to the naked eye in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.210
 which did not suffer for a long time like this 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.920
 or else found the first this limit switches 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.750
 cylinders 1 balloon here it can be seen as straight 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.989
 he has everything here going through the centers that is 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.940
 here it is a clear angle here it goes where 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.649
 this gain here she will make a hike 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.210
 center line here it is worth the limit switch 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:10.159
 now wait a minute 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:14.729
 further here is why the balloon 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.710
 You can immediately see this little bit 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.580
 here the angle is lower here it is not exactly worth it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:26.310
 Seen sticking unevenly from them as 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.220
 say this video review on the video here 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.759
 it is immediately apparent that he and them are even so visible 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.070
 this one is a little bit higher 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.009
 this lower 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.979
 go to from these shoals Russian boat 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.530
 water when going to the boat 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.409
 as if by these parts this campaign took 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.890
 falls on the water and this is not as driving 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:55.049
 slightly taxis and and displays water 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.590
 here you can see from here itâ€™s not like 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.590
 done 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:08.600
 cant straight damn normal here everything 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:15.250
 exactly so now these measurements 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.250
 now do it from here 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:30.830
 from the beginning of this to from the beginning of the beginning 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:35.270
 trance yes here it is this line which 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.710
 goes here means it turns out somewhere here 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.770
 41 centimeter 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.610
 it can be seen now move on to another 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.610
 the side 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:08.349
 here 45 pages 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.440
 campaign did not really crooked on 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.170
 the main problem is with these 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.340
 these parts here even show that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.100
 gets 41 45 years old somewhere on 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.780
 were on order somewhere but decent 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.780
 big cities wrong curves 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:32.940
 client balloon here it is visible here this 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.940
 part of it can be seen right on much higher 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.920
 here is the part below the main problem is 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.380
 different angles 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.739
 here here is the angle relative to this one 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.920
 straight a little big i mean she 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.060
 It is about but it is clear from what she 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.000
 right ok that's this balloon 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.330
 ok made in my opinion here 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.330
 here in general he has articles on centers 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.470
 the diameter of his boat hike made broken 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.470
 cap crooked crookedly
