00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
work is hot and cold lights the when you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.240 
work is hot and cold lights the when you
start<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.599> up<00:02:33.720> instead<00:02:34.379> of<00:02:34.439> the<00:02:34.769> cold<00:02:35.040> light

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
start it up instead of the cold light

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.220 
start it up instead of the cold light
coming<00:02:35.519> down<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.760> hot<00:02:35.909> light<00:02:36.120> comes<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.629> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
coming down the hot light comes on and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.050 
coming down the hot light comes on and
then<00:02:37.409> once<00:02:37.829> it<00:02:37.950> warms<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.640> called<00:02:38.849> light

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.000 
then once it warms up the called light
comes<00:02:39.329> on<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:40.470> that's<00:02:40.709> something

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
comes on so I think that's something

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
just the wires might not need to be

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.380 
just the wires might not need to be
switched

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
