see<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> corner<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.340> there's<00:00:11.580> two

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
see in the corner this is there's two

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.900 
see in the corner this is there's two
different<00:00:11.910> types<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.330> widget<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.809> one's<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
different types of widget this one's the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.550 
different types of widget this one's the
static<00:00:14.910> which<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.269> doesn't<00:00:15.660> change<00:00:15.990> there<00:00:16.440> is

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
static which it doesn't change there is

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.800 
static which it doesn't change there is
an<00:00:16.680> active<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:17.430> will<00:00:17.760> show<00:00:18.090> what

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
an active which it was will show what

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.920 
an active which it was will show what
speed<00:00:19.140> your<00:00:19.320> cpu<00:00:19.740> running<00:00:19.890> at<00:00:20.720> now<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.779> first

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
speed your cpu running at now the first

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.540 
speed your cpu running at now the first
thing<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.170> might<00:00:22.260> notice<00:00:22.320> I've<00:00:23.010> got<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> max

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
thing you might notice I've got a max

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.660 
thing you might notice I've got a max
speed<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:24.140> 1.1<00:00:25.140> Giga<00:00:25.320> outs<00:00:25.529> because<00:00:26.130> yes<00:00:26.460> i

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
speed of 1.1 Giga outs because yes i

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.689 
speed of 1.1 Giga outs because yes i
have<00:00:26.730> overclocked<00:00:27.300> my<00:00:27.510> nexus<00:00:27.990> anyway<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> when

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
have overclocked my nexus anyway so when

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.650 
have overclocked my nexus anyway so when
you<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.880> into<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.880> set<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.390> top

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you get into it you get to set the top

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
you get into it you get to set the top
or<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.420> minimum<00:00:36.860> speed<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.399> might<00:00:38.550> want

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
or the minimum speed that you might want

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.250 
or the minimum speed that you might want
your<00:00:38.879> processor<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.540> run<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.110> see

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
your processor to run out as you can see

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.250 
your processor to run out as you can see
there<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.160> i'm<00:00:41.280> saying<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.450> busy<00:00:42.629> yep

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
there so i'm saying when it's busy yep

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.779 
there so i'm saying when it's busy yep
cranky<00:00:43.710> rather<00:00:43.890> way<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.280> i'm<00:00:44.370> saying<00:00:44.640> if

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
cranky rather way up and i'm saying if

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.000 
cranky rather way up and i'm saying if
I'm<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.360> doing<00:00:45.600> anything<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.829> all

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I'm not doing anything that's that's all

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
I'm not doing anything that's that's all
I<00:00:47.190> intensive<00:00:47.730> drop<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> drop<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> speed<00:00:49.050> down

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
I intensive drop the drop the speed down

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.040 
I intensive drop the drop the speed down
why<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.640> might<00:00:50.789> ask<00:00:50.850> well<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.840> going<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
why you might ask well it's going to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.600 
why you might ask well it's going to
save<00:00:52.199> battery<00:00:52.590> basically<00:00:54.079> there's<00:00:55.079> different

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
save battery basically there's different

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.799 
save battery basically there's different
bits<00:00:56.610> say<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> most<00:00:57.030> important<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.420> really

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
bits say the most important one really

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
bits say the most important one really
is<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> profiles<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.730> turn<00:00:59.879> on

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
is the profiles so I can turn on

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.900 
is the profiles so I can turn on
profiles<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> you'll<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.890> two<00:01:02.219> profiles<00:01:02.520> on

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
profiles and you'll see two profiles on

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
profiles and you'll see two profiles on
and<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.420> tick<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> different<00:01:04.199> profiles

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and you tick in the different profiles

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.130 
and you tick in the different profiles
themselves<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.519> modify<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.970> change<00:01:06.299> what

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
themselves you can modify to change what

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.149 
themselves you can modify to change what
I<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> most<00:01:07.740> important<00:01:08.040> ones

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I think one of the most important ones

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.820 
I think one of the most important ones
like<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> sleep<00:01:08.729> stand<00:01:09.299> by<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.770> see

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
like a sleep stand by now as you can see

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.060 
like a sleep stand by now as you can see
that<00:01:10.979> log<00:01:11.400> press<00:01:12.000> modify<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:13.560> drops<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that log press modify it drops the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.260 
that log press modify it drops the
squats<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.670> right<00:01:14.970> down<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.960> 384<00:01:16.729> megahertz<00:01:17.729> as

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
squats be right down to 384 megahertz as

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.370 
squats be right down to 384 megahertz as
a<00:01:18.509> maximum<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.650> even<00:01:20.009> 245<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> minimum<00:01:21.479> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a maximum and even 245 as a minimum so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.469 
a maximum and even 245 as a minimum so
what<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.740> does<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> when<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.970> phone<00:01:24.210> turns

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
what that does is when the phone turns

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.990 
what that does is when the phone turns
itself<00:01:24.750> off<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> clock<00:01:26.369> speed<00:01:26.610> drops<00:01:26.850> right

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
itself off the clock speed drops right

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.149 
itself off the clock speed drops right
now<00:01:27.150> obviously<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:28.530> phone<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:28.890> still<00:01:29.070> be

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
now obviously the phone will still be

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.219 
now obviously the phone will still be
trying<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.520> things<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.780> running

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
trying to do things is this it's running

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
trying to do things is this it's running
the<00:01:31.380> whole<00:01:31.530> time<00:01:31.710> obviously<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.220> what<00:01:32.970> you're

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the whole time obviously but what you're

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.700 
the whole time obviously but what you're
saying<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.479> don't<00:01:33.900> waste<00:01:34.049> battery<00:01:34.409> whatever

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
saying is don't waste battery whatever

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
saying is don't waste battery whatever
you're<00:01:34.860> doing<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.369> very<00:01:35.579> important<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you're doing it's not very important I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.359 
you're doing it's not very important I
don't<00:01:36.299> mind<00:01:36.420> waiting<00:01:36.799> two<00:01:37.799> seconds<00:01:38.189> rather

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
don't mind waiting two seconds rather

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.080 
don't mind waiting two seconds rather
than<00:01:38.610> half<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.909> second<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.710> theory<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
than half a second and in theory that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.389 
than half a second and in theory that
should<00:01:42.360> save<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.780> battery<00:01:43.159> there<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.250> other

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
should save your battery there are other

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.590 
should save your battery there are other
things<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.649> battery<00:01:46.649> profile<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.270> set<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
things so battery profile you can set it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
things so battery profile you can set it
so<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.229> battery<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.619> below<00:01:49.799> thirty

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
so if your battery just below thirty

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.850 
so if your battery just below thirty
percent<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.880> top<00:01:51.090> speed<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.600> use<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.990> 652

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
percent the top speed is can use is 652

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
percent the top speed is can use is 652
you<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:56.009> different<00:01:56.130> ones<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
you get different ones for like the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
slow the clock speed down

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.170 
slow the clock speed down
now<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.260> free<00:02:04.650> app<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.700> does<00:02:05.940> require
