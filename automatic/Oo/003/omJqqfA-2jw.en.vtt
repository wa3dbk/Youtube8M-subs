the<00:02:00.549> road<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.939> could<00:02:01.000> be<00:02:01.119> but<00:02:01.329> bad<00:02:01.539> you<00:02:01.780> don't

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
the road it could be but bad you don't

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.990 
the road it could be but bad you don't
know<00:02:02.020> whether<00:02:02.950> could<00:02:03.219> be<00:02:03.430> some<00:02:03.670> sort<00:02:03.850> of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
know whether could be some sort of

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.209 
know whether could be some sort of
construction<00:02:04.600> ahead<00:02:04.689> no<00:02:05.229> it's<00:02:05.409> clear<00:02:05.740> and

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
construction ahead no it's clear and

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.800 
construction ahead no it's clear and
then<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.579> distance<00:02:06.969> you<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.180> cease<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.570> 30

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
then the distance you can cease the 30

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.280 
then the distance you can cease the 30
31<00:02:08.350> I'll<00:02:08.709> limit<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.640> checking<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.119> we're

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
31 I'll limit so checking it we're

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.500 
31 I'll limit so checking it we're

if<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:14.019> one<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.590> gears<00:02:14.829> if<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.100> count

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
if you can one the gears if you count
