 Perez 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.730
 teaching how to fly 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.389
 It's like the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.130
 It has neckline projection will leave you 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.130
 fly 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.590
 as in this mode survival is not 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.520
 creative mode 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.520
 we have created 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.380
 I hope you like the video 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.840
 we wait for it to load 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.970

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.970
 how to see the two players 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.850

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.480
 my controls are configured so that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.850
 jump with 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.900
 That's how I would face the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.900
 to be able to fly 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.480
 we will have to press the back button that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.430
 is next to the xbox interface 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.430
 and we will put in our name 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.840
 we will put in the option to be able to fly 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.950
 we can also put invisible in 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.950
 our person who does not see 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.700
 I still do not know if it was because it can be good 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.700
 and now twice 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.050

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.800
 we will have to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.800
 press it 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.280
