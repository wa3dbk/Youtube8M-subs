00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this is the difference between fifa and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.499 
this is the difference between fifa and
PES<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.860> fifa<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
PES like for fifa for it to be like a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.800 
PES like for fifa for it to be like a
skillful<00:01:31.110> goal<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.939> run<00:01:33.390> all

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
skillful goal you have to like run all

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.600 
skillful goal you have to like run all
the<00:01:34.290> way<00:01:34.320> across<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.920> pitch<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> doing

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the way across the pitch and doing

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.280 
the way across the pitch and doing
roulettes<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> rainbow<00:01:36.630> flicks<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.079> stuff

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
roulettes and rainbow flicks and stuff

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.890 
roulettes and rainbow flicks and stuff
but<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.009> PES<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.210> skill<00:01:39.600> moves<00:01:39.780> are

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
but in PES because the skill moves are

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980 
but in PES because the skill moves are
just<00:01:40.170> um<00:01:40.460> more<00:01:41.460> difficult<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> pull<00:01:42.180> off<00:01:42.210> even

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
just um more difficult to pull off even

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.679 
just um more difficult to pull off even
that<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.590> there<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> pretty<00:01:45.270> skillful

how<00:03:43.590> he<00:03:43.650> managed<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.250> miss<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:45.180> think<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.990> was

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
how he managed to miss it I think it was

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.660 
how he managed to miss it I think it was
just<00:03:46.170> kind<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.380> an<00:03:46.500> awkward<00:03:46.770> contact<00:03:47.430> with<00:03:47.550> the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
just kind of an awkward contact with the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.940 
just kind of an awkward contact with the
ball<00:03:47.820> he<00:03:47.880> didn't<00:03:48.270> hit<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.750> as<00:03:48.990> sweet<00:03:49.680> as

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
ball he didn't hit it as sweet as

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.699 
ball he didn't hit it as sweet as
sweetly<00:03:50.340> as<00:03:50.550> he<00:03:50.910> wanted<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> then<00:03:52.080> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
sweetly as he wanted to and then the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.170 
sweetly as he wanted to and then the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
defender closing him down he takes the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.920 
defender closing him down he takes the
shot<00:03:56.370> his<00:03:56.550> blog<00:03:56.850> goes<00:03:57.090> way<00:03:57.330> for<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.690> corner

for me it's really important I really

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.540 
for me it's really important I really
like<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:10.080> Waco<00:07:10.439> looks<00:07:10.680> now<00:07:10.860> and<00:07:11.069> if<00:07:11.129> we<00:07:11.340> have

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
like the Waco looks now and if we have

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.300 
like the Waco looks now and if we have
to<00:07:11.699> change<00:07:11.939> it<00:07:12.090> make<00:07:12.749> it<00:07:12.930> a<00:07:13.020> badass<00:07:13.680> new<00:07:14.039> look

to change it make it a badass new look

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.610 
to change it make it a badass new look
but<00:07:14.759> um<00:07:15.029> this<00:07:15.389> the<00:07:15.599> final<00:07:15.930> match<00:07:16.229> was<00:07:16.409> against

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
but um this the final match was against

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.409 
but um this the final match was against
whole<00:07:16.830> city<00:07:17.039> and<00:07:17.249> finally<00:07:17.729> called<00:07:17.969> got<00:07:18.210> back

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
whole city and finally called got back

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:21.709 
whole city and finally called got back
to<00:07:18.659> his<00:07:19.279> form<00:07:20.279> because<00:07:20.610> the<00:07:20.729> match<00:07:20.939> where<00:07:21.599> he

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:21.719 
to his form because the match where he

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:23.119 
to his form because the match where he
didn't<00:07:21.930> score<00:07:22.139> was<00:07:22.349> the<00:07:22.379> first<00:07:22.740> match<00:07:22.919> in<00:07:23.069> a

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:23.129 
didn't score was the first match in a

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:24.679 
didn't score was the first match in a
while<00:07:23.279> that<00:07:23.310> he<00:07:23.639> didn't<00:07:23.969> have<00:07:23.999> a<00:07:24.120> really<00:07:24.539> good

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:24.689 
while that he didn't have a really good

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.629 
while that he didn't have a really good
game<00:07:24.930> which<00:07:25.439> is<00:07:25.620> I<00:07:25.710> guess<00:07:25.740> realistic<00:07:26.370> and<00:07:26.520> it's

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 
game which is I guess realistic and it's

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:28.399 
game which is I guess realistic and it's
cool<00:07:26.909> but<00:07:27.330> at<00:07:27.419> the<00:07:27.509> same<00:07:27.719> time<00:07:27.930> it's<00:07:28.169> just

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:28.409 
cool but at the same time it's just

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:30.679 
cool but at the same time it's just
annoying<00:07:28.860> to<00:07:29.189> not<00:07:29.339> to<00:07:29.610> keep<00:07:29.969> that<00:07:30.120> consistency

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:30.689 
annoying to not to keep that consistency

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:32.629 
annoying to not to keep that consistency
but<00:07:31.139> anyway<00:07:31.409> third<00:07:31.710> place<00:07:32.009> again<00:07:32.400> we<00:07:32.610> are

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 
but anyway third place again we are

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.269 
but anyway third place again we are
three<00:07:33.210> points<00:07:33.539> again<00:07:33.779> behind<00:07:34.319> United<00:07:34.860> only

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:35.279 
three points again behind United only

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:37.670 
three points again behind United only
one<00:07:35.460> point<00:07:35.699> to<00:07:35.819> get<00:07:35.969> behind<00:07:36.300> Chelsea<00:07:36.749> but<00:07:37.499> we

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 
one point to get behind Chelsea but we

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.010 
one point to get behind Chelsea but we
are<00:07:37.800> also<00:07:37.979> closing<00:07:38.460> down<00:07:38.669> on<00:07:39.060> United's<00:07:39.779> goal

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:41.969 
difference only a three or four goes

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:44.839 
difference only a three or four goes
away<00:07:42.710> from<00:07:43.710> their<00:07:44.009> goal<00:07:44.219> difference<00:07:44.550> but
