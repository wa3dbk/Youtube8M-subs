00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.329
 high-grade playstation 4 did 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.390
 small notes on extra 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.940

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.440
 another awesome ps4 chip works 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.350
 this is streaming your own games here 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.699
 for players this is not a novelty but if 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.220
 look at the console market then this 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.699
 absolutely something new and indeed in general 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:00.769
 pise and never was everything so 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.860
 simple and convenient magic Well 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.530
 believe me all who stream the game 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.570
 knows that hemorrhoids are enough but here's how 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.420

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.890
 you can make a screenshot and 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.540
 you can download it anywhere 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.750
