this would be it
the<00:02:37.300> floor<00:02:37.630> does<00:02:37.930> not<00:02:38.080> fit<00:02:38.410> well<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:39.310> doesn't

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
the floor does not fit well it doesn't

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.220 
the floor does not fit well it doesn't
it's<00:02:41.080> very<00:02:41.350> hard<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.680> get<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:43.209> steps<00:02:43.900> I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
it's very hard to get in the steps I

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.500 
it's very hard to get in the steps I
guess<00:02:44.530> are<00:02:45.300> acceptable<00:02:46.300> but<00:02:47.080> they<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.550> get

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
guess are acceptable but they just I get

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.150 
guess are acceptable but they just I get
there<00:02:49.720> just<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:49.990> such<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> way<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.530> make<00:02:50.950> life

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
there just in such a way that make life

there just in such a way that make life
like<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.120> difficult<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.930> get<00:02:53.050> this<00:02:53.260> floor<00:02:53.590> in

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
like so difficult to get this floor in

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.910 
like so difficult to get this floor in
it's<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.870> think<00:02:55.870> it's<00:02:56.170> just<00:02:56.320> awful

I<00:03:57.820> had<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.870> glue<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.410> pieces<00:03:59.440> like<00:03:59.890> right<00:04:00.070> here

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
I had to glue the pieces like right here

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.810 
I had to glue the pieces like right here
this<00:04:01.330> piece<00:04:01.830> here<00:04:02.830> no<00:04:02.950> matter<00:04:03.070> how<00:04:03.280> careful<00:04:03.519> I

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
this piece here no matter how careful I

this piece here no matter how careful I
was<00:04:04.000> it's<00:04:04.299> it<00:04:04.570> came<00:04:04.750> apart<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:05.769> um<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:08.470> was

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
was it's it came apart so um it was

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.380 
was it's it came apart so um it was
really<00:04:09.040> rough<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.519> so<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.850> best<00:04:10.120> way<00:04:10.360> to

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
really rough and so the best way to

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.220 
really rough and so the best way to
avoid<00:04:10.959> um<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:12.519> don't<00:04:13.030> know<00:04:13.180> looking<00:04:13.510> bad<00:04:13.780> was<00:04:14.079> to

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
avoid um I don't know looking bad was to

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.990 
avoid um I don't know looking bad was to
make<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.590> staircase<00:04:15.100> look<00:04:15.370> like<00:04:15.519> it<00:04:15.669> was<00:04:15.790> old

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
make the staircase look like it was old

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.789 
make the staircase look like it was old
and<00:04:16.120> roughed<00:04:16.389> up<00:04:16.630> so

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
and roughed up so

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.259 
and roughed up so
that's<00:04:17.919> what<00:04:18.069> I<00:04:18.129> did<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.489> made<00:04:18.549> it<00:04:18.849> look<00:04:18.970> old<00:04:19.120> and

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
that's what I did I made it look old and

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.089 
that's what I did I made it look old and
roughed<00:04:19.449> up<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:22.810> extra<00:04:23.409> security

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
roughed up for extra security

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.619 
roughed up for extra security
I<00:04:24.360> would<00:04:25.360> tidied<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.789> tabs<00:04:27.789> that<00:04:28.240> are

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:28.629 
I would tidied the tabs that are

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:31.320 
I would tidied the tabs that are
supposed<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.990> be<00:04:29.139> secured<00:04:29.789> it's<00:04:30.789> very<00:04:31.030> hard<00:04:31.240> to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
supposed to be secured it's very hard to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.570 
supposed to be secured it's very hard to
glue<00:04:32.039> this<00:04:33.039> this<00:04:33.580> floor<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:35.259> just<00:04:35.979> would<00:04:36.370> I

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
glue this this floor so I just would I

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.159 
glue this this floor so I just would I
would<00:04:36.970> putty<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:39.539> used<00:04:40.539> a<00:04:40.690> separate<00:04:40.990> kind

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
would putty that I used a separate kind

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.649 
would putty that I used a separate kind
of<00:04:41.289> glue<00:04:41.470> for<00:04:41.680> this<00:04:41.770> section<00:04:42.099> you<00:04:42.940> know<00:04:43.060> just<00:04:43.419> a

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:43.659 
of glue for this section you know just a

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:48.059 
of glue for this section you know just a
bunch<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.199> random<00:04:45.840> ways<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:47.169> getting<00:04:47.590> it<00:04:47.710> stuck

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
bunch of random ways of getting it stuck

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.730 
bunch of random ways of getting it stuck
together<00:04:48.310> basically<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:50.050> now<00:04:50.379> it's<00:04:50.560> just

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
together basically so now it's just

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.379 
together basically so now it's just
sitting<00:04:50.949> I'm<00:04:51.280> done<00:04:51.729> for<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.000> day<00:04:52.060> when<00:04:52.300> it

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
sitting I'm done for the day when it

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.339 
sitting I'm done for the day when it
