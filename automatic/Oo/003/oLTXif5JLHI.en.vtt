00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.090
 fellow citizens also a few days to read them and 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.669
 those who would like to represent me in the european parliament 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.359
 these deputies have a mission to defend our most vital interests such 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.129
 employment price stability health education environment 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.349
 so far our MPs from all sides of leaflets this mission some have it 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.609
 even betrayed by letting build a European Union that goes to 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.399
 counter-sense of independent and sovereign social europe that we 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.789
 let's call our wishes 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.170
 we now need a Europe at the service of men and peoples and not 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.020
 to the national leadership service and without a face 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.030
 the crisis comes to remind us that hard this basic truth 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.320
 and to change things you have to change the rules of the game in the state 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 current voters does not give blank warrant to the MP who are 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.170
 then free to do what they want without any control 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.310
 if you bring him your votes, the objective is to impose the 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.450
 citizens' initiative referendum 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.140
 which will finally give us the opportunity to control and correct 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.600
 Parliament's decisions 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.180
 no party in France and the French decide who should allow to do 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.110
 cancel this or that European directive 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.700
 particularly unjust cudon propose others more useful and better 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.090
 adapted 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.370
 the citizens' initiative referendum must therefore give us the right to 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.270
 word ie restore a popular sovereignty today a 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.510
 existence 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.270
 Finally, we will propose strengthening the powers of parliament in the face of 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.909
 Brussels bureaucracy sprawling more and more oppressive 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.620
 europe can only be effective if there is transparency of truth and 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.310
 of real democracy 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.970
 as long as parliament is just a theater, europe will continue 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.290
 to be just a globalized economic and trading space a space without 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.950
 limit and without weapon 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 in the present situation we have nothing else to expect than always 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.539
 more delocalisation of unemployment from poverty of destruction of services 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:55.660
 public 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.230
 but if June 7 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.320
 with the click we take back our destiny 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.330
 we can ensure our children a better future 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.600
 vote for the rique our ballots will not be in the polling stations 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 print them on our website 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.779
