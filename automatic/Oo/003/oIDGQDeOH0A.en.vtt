 the three players exactly 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.070
 individual rhythm changes and then 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:20.390

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.209
 focused on the possibility of effects 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.209

 is in a lateral center practically 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.750
 always has a reference to the 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.750
 population but always 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.630
 those things 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.120
