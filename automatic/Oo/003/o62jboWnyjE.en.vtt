00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.950
 hello there was a package in this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:18.770
 package processor and adapters 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:18.770
 fan will watch 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.500
 I'll close it like this 1 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.500
 I took the documents 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:12.240
 so this is transitions 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.310
 fan such as from this i think 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.890
 if not enough 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.340
 connectors on the motherboard will connect to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:33.890
 power supply here is an adapter 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:37.970
 so different and also increase molly 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:55.070
 two exits from one 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:03:07.580
 This fan is also German too 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:07.580
 a forty is easy but very warm 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:19.159
 while the process I ordered this such 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:28.230
 MDF X 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:40.890
 6200 it will be visible 38 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:49.349
 frequency 6th der than such a socket here m 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:52.040
 3 + now I will open let's see for yourself 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.040
 interesting 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:11.120
 and then there is this cooler included 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:21.150
 here it is the processor itself i won't 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:29.120
 pull it out fy 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:29.120
 Nakleechka Well, here is such a direct summer resident 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:43.760
 so but I think you can see the processes along the way 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.760
 instruction 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:05:12.620
 see cooler cooler where is it funny 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:12.620
 such some 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:22.970
 on a black day with copper 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:34.570
 the radiator from the tube is not all visible 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:40.090
 You can see it and raised such a such 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:45.320
 how many here 4 pin 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:48.290
 I do nâ€™t know if there is a cooler 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:54.620
 weak will be cooling weak 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:56.770
 I'll order higher in my process later 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:04.520
 this case 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:07.310
 allows up to 150 8 millimeters height 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.410
 cooler if you do not throw out the side 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:16.490
 fans and see later if if 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:19.970
 that you can pick up a big market there 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:28.250
 still want a wave of money pay and all 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:35.500
 it will be okay , so who cares? 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:39.169
 You can learn more about the processor 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:44.200
 can go to the site a md and all there 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:46.600
 find out what processors you want from 81 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.840
 I know 10 there is a mechanic 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:55.960
 in spite and in short in the new information 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:58.330
 different and you want to be like this with you 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:02.340
