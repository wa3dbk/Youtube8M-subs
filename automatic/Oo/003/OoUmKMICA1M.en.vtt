00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.240
 so now I'm under the car 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:18.830
 Altay say go and 4 ponds two chips 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 so he there they are connected clearly visible 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:28.789
 so also i wrote about the gimbal here i 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.850
 for some reason I do not see where and u unhook and 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.329
 I know that you can only tell me 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:40.140
 he is there you can unhook it that is you here 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:47.850
 cordon floor will stay here with it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.629
 will have to shoot most likely so 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 just disconnect 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:01:00.109
 grip on us to 1 nickname from here she 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.869
 was screwed 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:08.840
 so you need to unscrew the two bolts and here 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.220
 two bolts 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.220
 who is holding the box 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.819
 there are not only four chips there are still so 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:28.850
 I can not see where it is divided into two 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:34.359
 one goes up 2 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.359
 from here went two chips from there 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:47.409
 so there is also a chip 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.409
 it costs a little more 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.780
 so here it is the fuel hose 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.590
 unscrew this bolt that is just 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.190
 here is this hose 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:16.100
 will be removed and he will remain on the engine 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:22.630
 the tube itself so what else is here so here 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.630
 they are on the tube that goes to the tank surplus 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.950
 that's how i say cant unscrew here 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:49.670
 they 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:55.190
 bolts here one two three 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:03:00.280
 rests on three bolts apparently yes I have 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.280
 in general, no one even tried to touch and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:19.220
 For the first time, so here it is now visible sensors 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:27.370
 from which I removed the chips here comes here she 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.370
 or a little general or starter 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.530
 so you need to unscrew cradling me 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.030
 hangs here because of this campaign I 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.030
 starter and skrill 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.830
 pulling on a benzic si dangles 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:58.660
 the wire is so clear everything
