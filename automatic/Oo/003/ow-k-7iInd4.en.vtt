00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
teaching job was teaching a small school

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.659 
teaching job was teaching a small school
in<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.939> village<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.599> rural<00:00:30.840> Africa<00:00:31.460> so<00:00:32.460> I'd

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
in a village in rural Africa so I'd

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.549 
in a village in rural Africa so I'd
never<00:00:32.910> talked<00:00:33.149> before<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.780> thrown<00:00:34.320> into

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
never talked before I was thrown into

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.280 
never talked before I was thrown into
this<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:35.540> on<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> grounds<00:00:36.930> i<00:00:37.020> suppose<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
this on on the grounds i suppose that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.639 
this on on the grounds i suppose that
sir<00:00:38.390> I've<00:00:39.390> been<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.719> England<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.260> therefore<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
sir I've been to England and therefore I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.049 
sir I've been to England and therefore I
should<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.219> been<00:00:41.309> educated<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
should have been educated and so I

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.520 
should have been educated and so I
essentially<00:00:45.059> wind<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.660> from<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
essentially wind it from the from the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
essentially wind it from the from the
beginning<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> things<00:00:48.270> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
beginning but one of the things that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
beginning but one of the things that
struck<00:00:48.510> me<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:48.780> early<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.800> element

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
struck me very early on was the element

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
struck me very early on was the element
of<00:00:50.340> theatre<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.030> teaching<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> fact

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
of theatre in teaching that the fact

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.779 
of theatre in teaching that the fact
that<00:00:52.559> unless<00:00:53.129> you've<00:00:53.280> got<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> students

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
that unless you've got the students

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.340 
that unless you've got the students
attention<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.510> doesn't<00:00:54.960> matter<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.260> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
attention then doesn't matter what you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.900 
attention then doesn't matter what you
say<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.680> they're<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.280> listening<00:00:56.430> hey

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
say because they're not listening hey

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.319 
say because they're not listening hey
it's<00:00:58.190> virtually<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> state<00:00:59.789> religion<00:00:59.969> these

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it's virtually a state religion these

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.299 
it's virtually a state religion these
days<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.750> suppose<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.170> school<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.710> students

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
days I suppose in school that students

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.429 
days I suppose in school that students
are<00:01:02.719> indoctrinated<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.750> importance<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
are indoctrinated with importance of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.710 
are indoctrinated with importance of
saving<00:01:04.619> energy<00:01:05.000> keeping<00:01:06.000> environment<00:01:06.510> clean

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
saving energy keeping environment clean

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.399 
saving energy keeping environment clean
of<00:01:07.080> Satan<00:01:07.439> rainforests<00:01:08.130> etc<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.140> order<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of Satan rainforests etc so in order to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.560 
of Satan rainforests etc so in order to
talk<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.890> them<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.570> important

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
talk to them about this important

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
talk to them about this important
subject<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.260> no<00:01:14.250> use<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.030> saying<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that the best way to tackle global

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.110 
that the best way to tackle global
warming<00:01:34.260> is<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.920> clear-cut<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.430> rainforests
