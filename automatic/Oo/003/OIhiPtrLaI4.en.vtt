00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
now the next thing is innovation there's

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.510 
now the next thing is innovation there's
going<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.480> be<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.570> small<00:00:04.230> bit<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:05.250> that

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
going to be a small bit of this that

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.800 
going to be a small bit of this that
goes<00:00:05.700> through<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.089> again<00:00:06.359> we've<00:00:06.509> talked<00:00:06.690> about

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
goes through so again we've talked about

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.200 
goes through so again we've talked about
technology<00:00:07.470> we've<00:00:07.980> talked<00:00:08.280> about<00:00:08.429> community

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
technology we've talked about community

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.299 
technology we've talked about community
and<00:00:09.360> now<00:00:09.870> we're<00:00:10.050> going<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.290> true<00:00:10.769> innovation

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
and now we're going to true innovation

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.759 
and now we're going to true innovation
and<00:00:11.670> what<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.570> here<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.650> know<00:00:13.679> I

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
and what I have here is I you know I

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.650 
and what I have here is I you know I
still<00:00:14.370> want<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.670> say<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.030> I<00:00:15.059> believe<00:00:15.299> that

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
still want to say that I believe that

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.500 
still want to say that I believe that
the<00:00:16.289> Direct<00:00:16.710> X<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.279> change<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.880> directx<00:00:18.300> if

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the Direct X the change to directx if

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.900 
the Direct X the change to directx if
people<00:00:18.810> don't<00:00:18.960> understand<00:00:19.500> why<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.340> bring<00:00:20.730> that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
people don't understand why I bring that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120 
people don't understand why I bring that
up<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.119> such<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> big<00:00:21.660> deal<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.350> really<00:00:22.740> it's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
up is such a big deal you really it's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.470 
up is such a big deal you really it's
it's<00:00:23.369> going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> be<00:00:23.760> too<00:00:23.910> hard<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.180> me<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
it's going to be too hard for me to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.670 
it's going to be too hard for me to
describe<00:00:24.570> other<00:00:25.019> than<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.439> say<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
describe other than to say that

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.279 
describe other than to say that
Microsoft<00:00:26.310> has<00:00:26.369> put<00:00:26.640> its<00:00:26.760> foot<00:00:27.000> down<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.930> ever

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
Microsoft has put its foot down for ever

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.230 
Microsoft has put its foot down for ever
and<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> first<00:00:29.550> time<00:00:29.970> we're

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and this is the first time we're

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.700 
and this is the first time we're
basically<00:00:30.630> they're<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.619> they're

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
basically they're going in and they're

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.110 
basically they're going in and they're
cutting<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.219> bunch<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.520> blowed<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
cutting a bunch of blowed out and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.250 
cutting a bunch of blowed out and
removing<00:00:33.510> stuff<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> think<00:00:34.110> that's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
removing stuff and I think that's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.440 
removing stuff and I think that's
awesome<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.950> may<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.430> massive<00:00:36.059> change

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
awesome it may not be a massive change

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
awesome it may not be a massive change
to<00:00:36.960> other<00:00:37.200> people<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.070> me<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.550> somebody

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to other people but to me as somebody

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.069 
to other people but to me as somebody
who's<00:00:38.940> followed<00:00:39.300> Direct<00:00:39.540> X<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.840> somebody

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
who's followed Direct X is somebody

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.420 
who's followed Direct X is somebody
who's<00:00:40.200> talked<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.559> developers<00:00:40.980> who<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.129> so

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
who's talked to developers who are so

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250 
who's talked to developers who are so
tired<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> bloat<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.239> all<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.840> extra

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

tired of the bloat and all this extra
 to<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.489> much<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.450> removed<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.140> see

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
 to see much of that removed to see

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.959 
 to see much of that removed to see
some<00:00:46.500> improvements<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.250> into<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.940> see

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
some improvements going into it to see

overall upwelling of excitement around
that<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.480> got<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> mention<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.230> little

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that I just got to mention it one little

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.380 
that I just got to mention it one little
bit<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:55.980> innovation<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.059> say<00:00:57.210> I'm

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
bit here in innovation and say I'm

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
bit here in innovation and say I'm
really<00:00:57.510> excited<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.649> next<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.129> VR

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
really excited for it the next is VR

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
really excited for it the next is VR
it's<00:01:00.059> had<00:01:00.239> its<00:01:00.420> coming<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.750> party<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.109> talked

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it's had its coming out party I talked

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's had its coming out party I talked
about<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.739> technology<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.520> is

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
about it in technology but that is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
about it in technology but that is
different<00:01:02.910> than<00:01:03.449> innovation<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
different than innovation I think that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
different than innovation I think that
technology<00:01:05.670> wise<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:06.540> seeing<00:01:06.750> some<00:01:06.900> changes

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
technology wise were seeing some changes

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
technology wise were seeing some changes
here<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:07.680> innovation<00:01:08.070> true

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
here and there but innovation true

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
here and there but innovation true
innovation<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.689> VR<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.409> starting<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> see

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
innovation for VR we are starting to see

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.510 
innovation for VR we are starting to see
in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> game<00:01:11.850> space<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> mean<00:01:14.400> by

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
in the game space now what I mean by

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.109 
in the game space now what I mean by
that<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> delivery<00:01:15.450> system<00:01:15.659> itself<00:01:16.500> is

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
that is the delivery system itself is

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
that is the delivery system itself is
going<00:01:18.119> through<00:01:18.330> its<00:01:18.509> adjustment<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going through its adjustment in it and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.679 
going through its adjustment in it and
it's<00:01:19.770> its<00:01:20.070> phases<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.030> forth<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it's its phases and so forth but if you

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.420 
it's its phases and so forth but if you
follow<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> games<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.250> some

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
follow some of the games there are some

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.640 
follow some of the games there are some
pretty<00:01:24.390> amazing<00:01:24.540> stuff<00:01:25.229> coming<00:01:25.560> out

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
pretty amazing stuff coming out

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.700 
pretty amazing stuff coming out
and<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.280> ideas<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:28.200> this

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and the ideas that are there are this

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.600 
and the ideas that are there are this
blossoming<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:30.180> amazing<00:01:31.020> imagination

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
blossoming a just amazing imagination

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.149 
blossoming a just amazing imagination
station<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:33.090> there's<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.590> when

life<00:02:23.629> 3<00:02:23.660> anyway<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.860> when<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.430> comes<00:02:25.580> down<00:02:25.849> to

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
life 3 anyway so when it comes down to

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.449 
life 3 anyway so when it comes down to
it<00:02:26.209> i<00:02:26.300> think<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.349> delivery<00:02:27.800> system<00:02:28.010> is

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
it i think that the delivery system is

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.309 
it i think that the delivery system is
pretty<00:02:28.819> much<00:02:29.090> maybe<00:02:29.420> where<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:29.989> maybe<00:02:30.200> a

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
pretty much maybe where it is maybe a

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.380 
pretty much maybe where it is maybe a
little<00:02:30.590> bit<00:02:30.830> better<00:02:30.980> than<00:02:31.340> where<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:31.580> was<00:02:31.790> but

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
little bit better than where it was but

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.050 
little bit better than where it was but
the<00:02:32.660> games<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.379> ideas<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.340> ease<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.670> getting

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
the games the ideas the ease of getting

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.180

enough<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.310> push<00:03:10.549> high<00:03:11.000> fidelity

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
enough is to push high fidelity

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.619 
enough is to push high fidelity

you do have certain art styles such as

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.569 
you do have certain art styles such as

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.409 
tracking that was just out of this world
that<00:03:41.989> what<00:03:42.200> an<00:03:42.560> awesome<00:03:42.799> idea<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.489> use<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:43.910> to

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
that what an awesome idea to use that to

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.900 
that what an awesome idea to use that to
fort<00:03:44.660> for<00:03:44.959> tracking<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.440> person<00:03:45.829> in<00:03:46.040> space<00:03:46.400> you

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
fort for tracking a person in space you

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.580 
fort for tracking a person in space you
have<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.090> lot<00:03:47.359> of<00:03:47.389> really<00:03:47.750> cool<00:03:47.780> stuff<00:03:48.079> so<00:03:48.530> I

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
have a lot of really cool stuff so I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.819 
have a lot of really cool stuff so I
think<00:03:48.650> VR<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.430> coming<00:03:50.209> out<00:03:50.359> of<00:03:50.750> its<00:03:51.139> box<00:03:51.440> when

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
think VR is coming out of its box when

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.710 
think VR is coming out of its box when
it<00:03:51.859> comes<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.400> everything<00:03:52.880> around<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.419> not<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
it comes to everything around it not the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.229 
it comes to everything around it not the
technology<00:03:54.019> itself<00:03:54.319> not<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.010> headset<00:03:55.760> but

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
technology itself not that headset but

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.390 
technology itself not that headset but
all<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.989> delivery<00:03:57.290> systems<00:03:57.919> and<00:03:58.069> all<00:03:58.220> of

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
all of the delivery systems and all of

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.860 
all of the delivery systems and all of
the<00:03:58.519> thought<00:03:58.730> processes<00:03:59.239> on<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.630> side<00:03:59.840> and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
the thought processes on the side and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.809 
the thought processes on the side and
I'm<00:04:00.799> stoked<00:04:01.069> I<00:04:01.250> just<00:04:01.519> think<00:04:01.700> it's

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
I'm stoked I just think it's

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.020 
I'm stoked I just think it's
amazing<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.569> then<00:04:03.639> digital<00:04:04.639> has<00:04:04.819> been

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
amazing and then digital has been

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.479 
amazing and then digital has been
embraced<00:04:05.299> for<00:04:05.660> good<00:04:05.870> or<00:04:05.900> bad<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.500> when<00:04:07.370> it

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
embraced for good or bad and when it

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.610 
embraced for good or bad and when it
comes<00:04:07.669> to<00:04:07.910> digital<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.599> know<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.139> the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
comes to digital you know that that the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.440 
comes to digital you know that that the
innovation<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.459> don't<00:04:10.669> really<00:04:10.819> see<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.239> ton

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
innovation I don't really see that a ton

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.210 
innovation I don't really see that a ton
of<00:04:11.480> innovation<00:04:12.049> has<00:04:12.200> come<00:04:12.440> from<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.829> digital

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
of innovation has come from the digital

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.550 
of innovation has come from the digital
spectrum<00:04:14.180> when<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:14.660> comes<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:15.019> getting<00:04:15.230> a<00:04:15.380> game

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
spectrum when it comes to getting a game

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.140 
spectrum when it comes to getting a game
digitally<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.220> think<00:04:16.459> it's<00:04:16.609> really<00:04:16.910> cool<00:04:17.090> I

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
digitally I think it's really cool I

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.449 
digitally I think it's really cool I
think<00:04:17.329> that<00:04:17.750> with<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.919> know<00:04:19.039> you're<00:04:19.220> seeing

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
think that with a you know you're seeing

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.099 
think that with a you know you're seeing
games<00:04:19.820> now<00:04:20.120> if<00:04:20.329> you<00:04:20.660> follow<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:21.079> news

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
games now if you follow the news

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.050 
games now if you follow the news
sometimes<00:04:21.560> there'll<00:04:22.219> be<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.310> surprise<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:22.789> a

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
sometimes there'll be a surprise that a

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.370 
sometimes there'll be a surprise that a
games<00:04:23.360> getting<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.810> physical<00:04:23.990> version

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
games getting a physical version

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.870 
games getting a physical version
somebody<00:04:24.890> will<00:04:24.979> say<00:04:25.099> matter<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.520> fact<00:04:25.640> I<00:04:25.729> think

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
somebody will say matter of fact I think

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.640 
somebody will say matter of fact I think
it's<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.120> new<00:04:26.240> wolf<00:04:26.450> in

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
it's the new wolf in

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.290 
it's the new wolf in
Steyn<00:04:26.889> where<00:04:27.400> they<00:04:27.490> had<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.699> go<00:04:27.820> out<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.090> say

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
Steyn where they had to go out and say

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.240 
Steyn where they had to go out and say
that<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:28.780> know<00:04:28.900> on<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.350> Xbox<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:29.979> will

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
that you know on the Xbox it will

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.590 
that you know on the Xbox it will
actually<00:04:30.460> have<00:04:30.759> a<00:04:30.790> physical<00:04:31.180> version<00:04:31.330> like

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
actually have a physical version like

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.240 
actually have a physical version like
people<00:04:31.870> were<00:04:31.960> surprised<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.889> it<00:04:32.979> was<00:04:33.009> going

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
people were surprised that it was going

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.860 
people were surprised that it was going
to<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.880> kind<00:04:34.060> of<00:04:34.150> stuff<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.540> going<00:04:34.660> to

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
to that kind of stuff is going to

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.719 
to that kind of stuff is going to
continue<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.380> think<00:04:35.650> digital<00:04:35.860> is<00:04:36.190> great<00:04:36.490> I

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
continue I think digital is great I

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.700 
continue I think digital is great I
think<00:04:37.150> digital<00:04:37.300> has<00:04:37.600> some<00:04:37.750> caveats<00:04:38.020> including

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
think digital has some caveats including

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.290 
think digital has some caveats including
bandwidth<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.490> just<00:04:39.729> simply<00:04:39.970> can't

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
bandwidth that you just simply can't

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.570 
bandwidth that you just simply can't
fight<00:04:40.570> yeah<00:04:41.110> it's<00:04:41.740> one<00:04:42.009> of<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.190> things<00:04:42.250> I'll

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
fight yeah it's one of the things I'll

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.070 
fight yeah it's one of the things I'll
just<00:04:42.729> discuss<00:04:43.090> right<00:04:43.270> now<00:04:43.330> in<00:04:43.539> innovation<00:04:43.990> I

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
just discuss right now in innovation I

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.070 
just discuss right now in innovation I
think<00:04:44.110> innovations<00:04:44.949> major<00:04:45.370> hurdle<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.479> the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
think innovations major hurdle is the

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.980 
think innovations major hurdle is the
delivery<00:04:47.440> system<00:04:47.620> especially<00:04:48.280> for<00:04:48.789> games<00:04:49.060> or

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
delivery system especially for games or

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.110 
delivery system especially for games or
sorry<00:04:50.229> not<00:04:50.380> innovations<00:04:50.979> but<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.610> digital

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
sorry not innovations but the digital

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.999 
sorry not innovations but the digital
the<00:04:52.690> digital<00:04:53.139> part<00:04:53.259> of<00:04:53.410> innovation<00:04:53.889> I<00:04:53.979> think

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
the digital part of innovation I think

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.520 
the digital part of innovation I think
it's<00:04:54.340> major<00:04:54.550> hurdle<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.150> bandwidth<00:04:55.750> you<00:04:56.320> have

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
it's major hurdle is bandwidth you have

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.529 
it's major hurdle is bandwidth you have
a<00:04:56.740> situation<00:04:56.979> where<00:04:57.550> game<00:04:57.850> developers<00:04:58.389> are

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
a situation where game developers are

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.820 
a situation where game developers are
trying<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.870> make<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.169> most<00:04:59.199> high<00:04:59.560> fidelity

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
trying to make the most high fidelity

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.790 
trying to make the most high fidelity
whatever<00:05:00.490> they<00:05:00.639> can<00:05:01.139> including<00:05:02.139> music<00:05:02.590> and

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
whatever they can including music and

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.260 
whatever they can including music and
and<00:05:03.039> so<00:05:03.220> forth<00:05:03.460> when<00:05:03.610> people<00:05:03.820> are<00:05:03.910> starting<00:05:04.210> to

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
and so forth when people are starting to

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.909 
and so forth when people are starting to
do<00:05:04.449> more<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:04.810> more<00:05:04.840> and<00:05:05.110> these<00:05:05.320> things<00:05:05.740> are

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
do more and more and these things are

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.370 
do more and more and these things are
starting<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.280> get<00:05:06.490> higher<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.120> higher<00:05:07.389> bit

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
starting to get higher and higher bit

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.800 
starting to get higher and higher bit
rates<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.979> so<00:05:09.130> forth<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:09.520> then<00:05:09.940> you<00:05:10.060> have<00:05:10.240> the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
rates and so forth and then you have the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.379 
rates and so forth and then you have the
ISP<00:05:11.410> issue<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:12.039> especially<00:05:12.669> in<00:05:13.030> America

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
ISP issue and especially in America

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.570 
ISP issue and especially in America
where<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.139> have<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:14.740> many<00:05:14.860> bandwidth<00:05:15.340> caps

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
where you have so many bandwidth caps

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.070 
where you have so many bandwidth caps
and<00:05:15.760> you<00:05:15.820> have<00:05:15.940> so<00:05:16.210> many<00:05:16.300> issues<00:05:16.750> with

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
and you have so many issues with

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.860 
and you have so many issues with
bandwidth<00:05:17.770> where<00:05:18.430> we<00:05:18.820> really<00:05:19.090> are<00:05:19.360> looking<00:05:19.750> at

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
bandwidth where we really are looking at

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.930 
bandwidth where we really are looking at
a<00:05:19.930> situation<00:05:20.199> where<00:05:20.830> something<00:05:21.310> may<00:05:21.550> be<00:05:21.610> out

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
a situation where something may be out

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.850 
a situation where something may be out
there<00:05:22.210> for<00:05:22.419> a<00:05:22.449> gamer<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:23.050> they<00:05:23.440> quite

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.159 
there's any kind of true actual cap
that's<00:06:36.669> causing<00:06:37.120> these<00:06:37.240> companies<00:06:37.750> to<00:06:37.960> have

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
that's causing these companies to have

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.899 
that's causing these companies to have
to<00:06:38.409> do<00:06:38.560> this<00:06:38.740> they<00:06:39.190> want<00:06:39.310> to<00:06:39.460> do<00:06:39.580> it<00:06:39.700> to<00:06:39.820> get

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:39.909 
to do this they want to do it to get

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:40.350 
to do this they want to do it to get
money

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
money

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.270 
money
and<00:06:40.449> that<00:06:40.840> is<00:06:41.020> really<00:06:41.319> sad<00:06:41.530> that<00:06:41.680> our<00:06:41.770> industry

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
and that is really sad that our industry

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.670 
and that is really sad that our industry
is<00:06:42.430> in<00:06:42.580> some<00:06:42.759> way<00:06:42.909> a<00:06:42.939> slave<00:06:43.240> to<00:06:43.389> that<00:06:43.419> and<00:06:43.870> then

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
is in some way a slave to that and then

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.119 
is in some way a slave to that and then
I<00:06:44.919> think<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:46.060> UI<00:06:46.469> that<00:06:47.469> we're<00:06:47.710> seeing<00:06:47.949> on

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
I think the UI that we're seeing on

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.950 
I think the UI that we're seeing on
these<00:06:48.280> consoles<00:06:48.789> they're<00:06:49.360> coming<00:06:49.750> to

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
these consoles they're coming to

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.020 
these consoles they're coming to
fruition<00:06:50.500> we're<00:06:51.039> starting<00:06:51.370> to<00:06:51.460> see<00:06:51.490> more<00:06:51.879> and

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
fruition we're starting to see more and

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.779 
fruition we're starting to see more and
more<00:06:52.120> little<00:06:52.479> things<00:06:52.689> going<00:06:52.930> on<00:06:53.050> with<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.289> UI

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
more little things going on with the UI

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.790 
more little things going on with the UI
just<00:06:54.789> speak<00:06:54.909> about<00:06:54.969> Xbox<00:06:55.599> in<00:06:55.810> particular<00:06:56.229> Xbox

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
seems to have that each time they do an

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.110 
seems to have that each time they do an
update<00:07:00.009> they<00:07:00.189> really<00:07:00.460> do<00:07:00.639> seem<00:07:00.879> to<00:07:00.909> add

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
update they really do seem to add

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
the HUD itself on the OS when you turn

the HUD itself on the OS when you turn

your wii u whatever i really like the
idea<00:07:36.099> i<00:07:36.520> don't<00:07:36.819> think<00:07:37.000> it's<00:07:37.150> better<00:07:37.449> than<00:07:37.689> it

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:37.750 
idea i don't think it's better than it

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.179 
idea i don't think it's better than it
was<00:07:37.870> last<00:07:37.990> year<00:07:38.259> i<00:07:38.379> don't<00:07:38.560> think<00:07:38.680> it's<00:07:38.800> worse<00:07:38.979> i

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:39.189 
was last year i don't think it's worse i

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:40.740 
was last year i don't think it's worse i
think<00:07:39.370> it's<00:07:39.490> pretty<00:07:39.699> much<00:07:39.879> getting<00:07:40.599> the

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.750 
think it's pretty much getting the

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.450 
think it's pretty much getting the
constant<00:07:41.319> improvements<00:07:41.800> we<00:07:41.889> expect<00:07:42.310> there

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:42.460 
constant improvements we expect there

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.890 
constant improvements we expect there
hasn't<00:07:42.789> been<00:07:42.819> an<00:07:43.029> improvement<00:07:43.210> that<00:07:43.599> made<00:07:43.779> me

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:43.900 
hasn't been an improvement that made me

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.230 
hasn't been an improvement that made me
go<00:07:44.050> holy<00:07:45.009> and<00:07:45.729> they're<00:07:45.879> also<00:07:46.000> hasn't

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
go holy and they're also hasn't

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.089 
go holy and they're also hasn't
been<00:07:46.449> the<00:07:46.569> one<00:07:47.080> that<00:07:47.259> made<00:07:47.409> me<00:07:47.529> go<00:07:47.650> man<00:07:47.949> this

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099 
been the one that made me go man this

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:49.559 
been the one that made me go man this
sucks<00:07:48.370> in<00:07:48.580> fact<00:07:49.029> there's<00:07:49.240> been<00:07:49.360> a<00:07:49.389> couple

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:49.569 
sucks in fact there's been a couple

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.300 
sucks in fact there's been a couple
times<00:07:49.690> where<00:07:50.110> my<00:07:50.229> xbox<00:07:50.560> one<00:07:50.740> is<00:07:50.889> slowed<00:07:51.099> down<00:07:51.250> a

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.310 
times where my xbox one is slowed down a

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.860 
times where my xbox one is slowed down a
little<00:07:51.490> bit<00:07:51.639> because<00:07:51.729> now<00:07:52.029> it<00:07:52.150> can<00:07:52.300> do<00:07:52.449> so<00:07:52.690> much

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:52.870 
little bit because now it can do so much

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.170 
little bit because now it can do so much
they're<00:07:53.800> going<00:07:53.889> to<00:07:53.949> have<00:07:54.099> to<00:07:54.190> fix<00:07:54.370> that<00:07:54.580> but

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:55.180 
they're going to have to fix that but

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.730 
they're going to have to fix that but
overall<00:07:55.599> I<00:07:55.750> think<00:07:55.960> it's<00:07:56.229> really<00:07:56.440> cool<00:07:56.680> to

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:56.740 
overall I think it's really cool to

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.649 
overall I think it's really cool to
mention<00:07:57.460> that<00:07:57.639> kind<00:07:58.120> of<00:07:58.210> thing<00:07:58.389> because

00:07:58.649 --> 00:07:58.659 
mention that kind of thing because

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:00.510 
mention that kind of thing because
they're<00:07:58.839> getting<00:07:59.110> a<00:07:59.199> constant<00:07:59.770> interface

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:00.520 
they're getting a constant interface

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.790 
they're getting a constant interface
update<00:08:01.029> they're<00:08:01.210> getting<00:08:01.599> constant<00:08:02.110> once

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 
update they're getting constant once

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.010 
update they're getting constant once
again<00:08:03.069> you<00:08:03.190> could<00:08:03.339> say<00:08:03.580> it<00:08:03.729> connects<00:08:04.300> with<00:08:04.629> the

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:05.020 
again you could say it connects with the

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.339 
again you could say it connects with the
community<00:08:05.919> that<00:08:06.520> the<00:08:07.120> entire<00:08:07.389> industry<00:08:07.960> is<00:08:08.110> so

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:08.349 
community that the entire industry is so

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:11.070 
community that the entire industry is so
I<00:08:08.979> guess<00:08:09.460> you<00:08:09.639> would<00:08:09.759> say<00:08:09.789> hinged<00:08:10.330> on<00:08:10.509> and<00:08:10.779> I

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.080 
I guess you would say hinged on and I

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.689 
I guess you would say hinged on and I
like<00:08:11.319> that<00:08:11.349> I<00:08:11.529> like<00:08:11.620> that<00:08:11.860> the<00:08:12.069> os's<00:08:12.339> are

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:12.699 
like that I like that the os's are

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:14.369 
like that I like that the os's are
seeing<00:08:13.240> those<00:08:13.449> improvements<00:08:13.810> I<00:08:14.080> think<00:08:14.259> it's

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:14.379 
seeing those improvements I think it's

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:17.550 
seeing those improvements I think it's
very<00:08:14.680> very<00:08:15.009> important
