00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
I can talk right so I'm gonna replace

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.220 
I can talk right so I'm gonna replace
the<00:00:28.260> OEM<00:00:28.650> one<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:30.000> Steeda<00:00:30.599> pure

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230

aluminum<00:00:31.740> shift<00:00:32.610> knob<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.390> quite<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> bit

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
aluminum shift knob now it's quite a bit

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.840 
aluminum shift knob now it's quite a bit
heavier<00:00:33.930> than<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.680> obviously<00:00:35.160> so

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
heavier than this one is obviously so

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.280 
heavier than this one is obviously so
it's<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> make<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:36.719> nice<00:00:36.899> throws

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
it's going to make for some nice throws

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's going to make for some nice throws
nicely<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> nice<00:00:38.460> weighted<00:00:38.760> shift

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
nicely but it's a nice weighted shift

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.229 
nicely but it's a nice weighted shift
knob<00:00:39.680> now<00:00:41.750> few<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> love<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
knob now few what I love about this is

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.959 
knob now few what I love about this is
that<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> little<00:00:46.050> lip<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> front

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
that it's got a little lip on the front

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.880 
that it's got a little lip on the front
as<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:49.260> probably<00:00:51.079> right<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.410> see

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
as you can see probably right there see

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
as you can see probably right there see
how<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.399> lip<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.539> makes<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
how it's got a little lip it makes it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
how it's got a little lip it makes it
makes<00:00:55.379> excellent<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.370> gripping<00:00:56.670> purposes

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
makes excellent for a gripping purposes

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
makes excellent for a gripping purposes
and<00:00:57.920> when<00:00:58.920> you're<00:00:59.039> shifting<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.879> know

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and when you're shifting and you know

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.869 
and when you're shifting and you know
it's<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.570> lot<00:01:00.690> easier<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.109> shift<00:01:01.730> because<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it's a lot easier to shift because it's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.810 
it's a lot easier to shift because it's
got<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.180> lip<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:05.010> me<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:05.549> kind

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
got that lip and for me it's it's kind

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.020 
got that lip and for me it's it's kind
of<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.060> crucial<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.700> since

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of it's crucial so with this one since

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.609 
of it's crucial so with this one since
it's<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.540> straight<00:01:09.840> sides<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.439> kind

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it's just got straight sides it's kind

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.660 
it's just got straight sides it's kind
of<00:01:10.650> hard<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> grip<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.400> hands<00:01:11.549> are

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of hard to grip when your hands are

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.539 
of hard to grip when your hands are
sweaty<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.770> when<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.430> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
sweaty or you know when you're kind of

sweaty or you know when you're kind of
like<00:01:14.700> shifting<00:01:15.180> gears<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.509> lot<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:16.439> hands

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
like shifting gears a lot your hands

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.170 
like shifting gears a lot your hands
might<00:01:16.860> slip<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.700> these<00:01:17.790> you're<00:01:18.030> going

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
might slip off of these you're going

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.270 
might slip off of these you're going
back<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.380> miss<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> gear<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:19.920> something

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
back and then miss a gear or something

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.740 
back and then miss a gear or something
it's<00:01:21.060> happened<00:01:21.390> before

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
it's happened before

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.080 
it's happened before
so<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:25.290> tend<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.799> take<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.850> off

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
so you know I I tend to take this off

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.370 
so you know I I tend to take this off
every<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.229> don't

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
every now and then just because I don't

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.280 
every now and then just because I don't
like<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:28.770> hands<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:29.070> sweaty<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.460> whatever

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
like in my hands are sweaty or whatever

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.480 
like in my hands are sweaty or whatever
it's<00:01:31.290> hard<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.530> me<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> grip<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.369> some

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
it's hard for me to grip this for some

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
it's hard for me to grip this for some
reason<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.180> anyways<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:33.900> it's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
reason but anyways it's a lot it's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.749 
reason but anyways it's a lot it's
really<00:01:34.380> cold<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> winter<00:01:35.189> obviously<00:01:35.610> because

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
really cold and winter obviously because

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.890 
really cold and winter obviously because
it's<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> chunk<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> aluminum

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it's a chunk of aluminum

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.160 
it's a chunk of aluminum
it's<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.799> gripping<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> ice<00:01:38.549> cube<00:01:39.170> so

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it's like gripping on the ice cube so

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
it's like gripping on the ice cube so
we're<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.500> replace<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.180> into

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
we're going to replace this now get into

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
we're going to replace this now get into

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.719 
take it I have a nice firm grip and just
crank<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.899> break<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.389 

whatever<00:01:53.930> thread<00:01:54.930> lock<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.290> something<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
whatever thread lock or something that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.560 
whatever thread lock or something that
scratching<00:01:56.790> noise<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.299> heard<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
scratching noise that you heard was a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.990 
scratching noise that you heard was a
spring<00:01:57.930> inside<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.579> so<00:01:59.579> we're<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.729> going<00:01:59.909> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
spring inside it so we're just going to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.179 
spring inside it so we're just going to
square<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.600> remove<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> that's<00:02:01.799> that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
square just remove it that's that

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.630 
square just remove it that's that
and<00:02:02.790> you'll<00:02:02.939> leave<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> spring<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
and you'll leave the spring on there and

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.479 
and you'll leave the spring on there and
then<00:02:05.840> we're<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> take<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.069> one<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
then we're going to take this one and

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.490 
then we're going to take this one and
it's<00:02:09.060> kind<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:10.080> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.319> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it's kind of you're going to have to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.750 
it's kind of you're going to have to
kind<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.770> get<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.129> you're<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.640> play

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
kind of get it you're going to play

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.210 
kind of get it you're going to play
around<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.360> bit<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.800> when<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.040> put

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
around this a bit so like when you put

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.950 
around this a bit so like when you put
on<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.490> way<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:15.360> tighten<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.660> down<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
on this way we tighten it down all the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.740 
on this way we tighten it down all the
way<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.170> St<00:02:16.440> logo<00:02:16.740> might<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.360> it

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
way the St logo might be like that so it

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.690 
way the St logo might be like that so it
does<00:02:18.960> come<00:02:19.200> with<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.350> spacer<00:02:19.890> which<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.580> it

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
does come with a spacer which I have it

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.070 
does come with a spacer which I have it
in<00:02:20.790> there

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
in there

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.170 
in there
I<00:02:22.110> found<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.220> certain<00:02:23.970> size<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.600> be<00:02:24.860> pretty<00:02:25.860> good

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
I found a certain size to be pretty good

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.140 
I found a certain size to be pretty good
so<00:02:27.180> we're<00:02:27.270> shaky<00:02:27.600> sorry<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.730> pretty<00:02:29.940> good

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
so we're shaky sorry to be pretty good

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.980 
so we're shaky sorry to be pretty good
with<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.930> kind<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.260> stuff<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.740> there

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
with that kind of stuff that's in there

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.960 
with that kind of stuff that's in there
so<00:02:33.990> once<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.980> trim<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.520> get<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.760> set

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
so once you trim it and get it set

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.460 
so once you trim it and get it set
properly<00:02:36.300> take<00:02:36.570> your<00:02:36.690> time<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.410> it

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
properly take your time with that so it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.890 
properly take your time with that so it
looks<00:02:37.740> pretty<00:02:37.980> good<00:02:38.640> then<00:02:39.540> we're<00:02:39.660> just<00:02:39.780> going

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
looks pretty good then we're just going

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.040 
looks pretty good then we're just going
to<00:02:39.960> screw<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.200> back<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:44.840> we're<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:45.990> to

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
to screw this back on we're going to

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.390 
to screw this back on we're going to
screw<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.410> until<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.890> hits<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.190> rubber

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
screw it until it hits that rubber

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.520 
screw it until it hits that rubber
stopper<00:02:47.490> in<00:02:48.030> there<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.170> getting<00:02:49.290> pretty

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
stopper in there and it's getting pretty

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.360 
stopper in there and it's getting pretty
tight<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.610> want<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.910> squeeze<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:53.250> we

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
tight and we want to squeeze it so we

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.760 
tight and we want to squeeze it so we
just<00:02:53.400> kind<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.760> lines<00:02:53.970> up<00:02:54.800> with<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.530> does

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
just kind of lines up with that so does

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.940 
just kind of lines up with that so does
that<00:02:58.890> look<00:02:59.040> straight<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.430> me<00:02:59.810> yeah<00:03:00.830> okay<00:03:01.830> it's

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that look straight to me yeah okay it's

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.760 
that look straight to me yeah okay it's
good<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.310> that's<00:03:02.459> how<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.610> looks<00:03:03.650> when<00:03:04.650> it's

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
good so that's how it looks when it's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.410 
good so that's how it looks when it's
done<00:03:10.490> and<00:03:11.490> then<00:03:11.610> reverse<00:03:11.850> lockout<00:03:12.180> works

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
done and then reverse lockout works

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.990 
done and then reverse lockout works
pretty<00:03:12.600> well<00:03:12.690> with<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.740> still<00:03:14.010> till<00:03:14.250> but

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
pretty well with that still till but

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.780 
pretty well with that still till but
there<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.300> adapters<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:16.410> where<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:17.430> can<00:03:17.580> have

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
there are adapters to where you can have

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.720 
there are adapters to where you can have
just<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:18.090> regular<00:03:18.269> normal<00:03:18.660> shift<00:03:19.110> knob<00:03:19.320> on<00:03:19.530> it

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
just a regular normal shift knob on it

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.900 
just a regular normal shift knob on it
now<00:03:20.730> since<00:03:21.030> for<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.300> focuses<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.670> BRZ

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
now since for the focuses and the BRZ

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.880 
now since for the focuses and the BRZ
and<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.690> FRS<00:03:24.989> itself<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.709> have<00:03:25.860> a

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
and the FRS itself to have to have a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.350 
and the FRS itself to have to have a
reverse<00:03:26.250> lockout<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.640> think<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.910> Mustangs<00:03:27.269> are

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
reverse lockout I think the Mustangs are

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.320 
reverse lockout I think the Mustangs are
like<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.630> too<00:03:28.400> but<00:03:29.400> for<00:03:29.550> in<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.820> case<00:03:30.060> you

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
like that too but for in this case you

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.080 
like that too but for in this case you
have<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.540> push<00:03:30.750> up<00:03:30.959> on<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.860> in<00:03:32.519> order<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.910> get

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
have to push up on this in order to get

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.880 
have to push up on this in order to get
in<00:03:33.180> reverse<00:03:33.480> reverse<00:03:34.019> would<00:03:34.350> be<00:03:34.500> like<00:03:34.709> where

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
in reverse reverse would be like where

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.080 
in reverse reverse would be like where
first<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:37.220> but<00:03:38.220> enough<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.670> if<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.000> have

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
first is but enough of that if you have

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.660 
first is but enough of that if you have
this<00:03:39.209> kind<00:03:39.390> of<00:03:39.420> car<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.720> know<00:03:39.840> what<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.050> is<00:03:40.670> but

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
this kind of car you know what it is but

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.009 
this kind of car you know what it is but
there<00:03:41.850> are<00:03:41.970> adapters<00:03:42.209> like<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.690> was<00:03:42.810> saying

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
there are adapters like I was saying

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.600 
there are adapters like I was saying
earlier<00:03:43.170> where<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:43.950> can<00:03:44.160> buy<00:03:44.340> like<00:03:44.549> a

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
earlier where you can buy like a

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.729 
earlier where you can buy like a
threaded<00:03:45.030> piece<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.570> push<00:03:45.930> down<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.620> can

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
threaded piece to push down so you can

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.420 
threaded piece to push down so you can
still<00:03:46.950> access<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.430> reverse<00:03:47.820> lockout<00:03:48.269> and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
still access the reverse lockout and
