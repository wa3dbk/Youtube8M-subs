his other matches with Punk and he did
Jericho<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.040> do<00:01:53.220> different<00:01:53.729> stuff<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
Jericho and just do different stuff you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.609 
Jericho and just do different stuff you
know<00:01:54.240> he<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.540> he<00:01:54.750> wasn't<00:01:55.079> looking<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.350> at

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
know he just he wasn't looking good at

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.719 
know he just he wasn't looking good at
all<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.899> time<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.290> diminishing

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
all so this time is diminishing

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.510 
all so this time is diminishing
diminishing<00:02:00.049> this<00:02:01.049> could<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.860> his<00:02:01.979> final<00:02:02.009> year

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
diminishing this could be his final year

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.709 
diminishing this could be his final year
I<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.700> they<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> try<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> push<00:02:03.570> that

I know they want to try to push that
thing<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:03.990> 20<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.409> 0<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.250> could

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
thing at 20 and 0 but this could

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.749 
thing at 20 and 0 but this could
possibly<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.540> his<00:02:06.899> last<00:02:07.500> year<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.580> need<00:02:08.700> to
