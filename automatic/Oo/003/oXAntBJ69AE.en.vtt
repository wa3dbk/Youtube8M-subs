test<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.490> have<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> series<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.059> ingredients

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
test we have a series of ingredients

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.299 
test we have a series of ingredients
here<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.870> we've<00:00:13.139> pretty<00:00:13.440> wide<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.740> measured

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
here that we've pretty wide and measured

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.560 
here that we've pretty wide and measured
I'm<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> put<00:00:15.089> those<00:00:15.240> through<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
I'm going to put those through the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
I'm going to put those through the
machine<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.260> then<00:00:16.650> measure<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> results<00:00:17.550> at

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
machine and then measure the results at

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.939 
machine and then measure the results at
the<00:00:17.699> end<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.330> let's<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:18.750> get<00:00:18.869> started<00:00:19.439> I'm

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949

the end so let's just get started I'm
going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> turn<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> machine<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.970> we'll<00:00:21.750> start

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
going to turn the machine on we'll start

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.410 
going to turn the machine on we'll start
off<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.350> cucumber<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.160> put<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> couple<00:00:24.359> of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
off with the cucumber I put a couple of

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660 
off with the cucumber I put a couple of
pieces<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.750> cucumber<00:00:24.930> through<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:26.580> I'm

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
pieces of cucumber through and then I'm

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.640 
pieces of cucumber through and then I'm
going<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.849> alternate<00:00:27.359> my<00:00:27.570> ingredients<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
going to alternate my ingredients and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.609 
going to alternate my ingredients and
put<00:00:28.800> some<00:00:28.980> celery<00:00:29.250> through<00:00:30.199> put<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> piece<00:00:31.470> of

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
food through so to quickly make sure you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
food through so to quickly make sure you
give<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.070> time<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.610> actually<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:39.120> guy<00:00:39.360> just

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
give it time to actually get guy just

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.860 
give it time to actually get guy just
open<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.950> drip<00:00:41.700> cap<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:42.239> we've<00:00:42.660> got

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
open up the drip cap there we've got

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.690 
open up the drip cap there we've got
pulp<00:00:43.170> coming<00:00:43.440> through<00:00:43.770> which<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> good<00:00:44.460> sign

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
pulp coming through which is a good sign

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.799 
pulp coming through which is a good sign
that<00:00:44.730> things<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.329> moving<00:00:45.450> through<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that things are moving through the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.290 
that things are moving through the
machine<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.530> put<00:00:47.489> some<00:00:47.700> carrot<00:00:48.090> through

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
machine I put some carrot through

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.569 
machine I put some carrot through
because<00:00:48.539> carrots<00:00:48.930> very<00:00:49.140> good<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:50.309> pushing

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
because carrots very good at pushing

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
because carrots very good at pushing
through<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> produce<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.410> we'll<00:00:52.590> put<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
through the produce and we'll put a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.580 
through the produce and we'll put a
little<00:00:52.980> bit<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> pineapple<00:00:53.870> it<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.899> important

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
little bit of pineapple it is important

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.139 
little bit of pineapple it is important
to<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:55.920> sure<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.280> do<00:00:56.489> alternate<00:00:57.000> your

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
to make sure you do alternate your

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
to make sure you do alternate your
produce<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.410> put<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
produce and don't just put all of the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.069 
produce and don't just put all of the
same<00:00:59.190> things<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.760> once<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
same things in at once because the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
same things in at once because the
different<00:01:01.469> textures<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.160> produce<00:01:02.609> do

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
different textures in the produce do

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.479 
different textures in the produce do
help<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> machine<00:01:03.719> feed<00:01:04.019> through<00:01:04.320> better<00:01:04.619> if

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
help the machine feed through better if

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.700 
help the machine feed through better if
you've<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> nice<00:01:06.060> pace<00:01:06.420> coming<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you've got a nice pace coming of the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.200 
you've got a nice pace coming of the
pulp<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.189> pulp<00:01:08.640> coming<00:01:08.850> through<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
pulp the pulp coming through the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
pulp the pulp coming through the
ejection<00:01:09.479> port<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
ejection port like this and that's a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.370 
ejection port like this and that's a
great<00:01:11.369> sign<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.729> things<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.330> working<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
great sign that things are working it is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.320 
great sign that things are working it is
important<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> note<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.490> doesn't<00:01:14.970> always

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
important to note that it doesn't always

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.770 
important to note that it doesn't always
travel<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.900> quickly<00:01:16.369> but<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:18.210> long<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.509> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
travel this quickly but as long as it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.679 
travel this quickly but as long as it's
moving<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.320> means<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.799> still<00:01:19.890> working<00:01:20.689> so

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
moving it means it's still working so

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.179 
moving it means it's still working so
we're<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.320> ahead<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.799> put

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
we're just going to go ahead and put

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.060 
we're just going to go ahead and put
through<00:01:23.460> all<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.799> produce<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.860> put

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
through all of this produce and put

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.359 
through all of this produce and put
through<00:01:29.280> some<00:01:29.490> more<00:01:29.610> sorry<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:32.189> bit<00:01:32.280> of

pineapple<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.600> apple<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.250> always<00:01:53.250> try<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
pineapple and apple I always try and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.280 
pineapple and apple I always try and
save<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> piece<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.299> carrot<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> last

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
save a piece of carrot for the last

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.980 
save a piece of carrot for the last
piece<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.890> through<00:01:56.479> just<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.750> help

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
piece to go through just just help

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
piece to go through just just help
everything<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.590> through<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.159> clear<00:01:59.399> out<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
everything go through and clear out the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.170 
everything go through and clear out the
order<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.439> we'll<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.430> put<00:02:02.610> through<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> less

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
order so we'll just put through the less

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.649 
order so we'll just put through the less
piece<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.630> carrots<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:05.180> then<00:02:06.180> we'll<00:02:06.360> give<00:02:06.540> it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
piece of carrots and then we'll give it

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.169 
piece of carrots and then we'll give it
a<00:02:06.750> few<00:02:06.930> minutes<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.459> did<00:02:08.670> notice<00:02:08.879> I

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
a few minutes now if you did notice I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.160 
a few minutes now if you did notice I
didn't<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> pusher<00:02:09.869> once<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.410> all<00:02:10.560> then

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
didn't use the pusher once it's all then

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.380 
didn't use the pusher once it's all then
and<00:02:11.800> try<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.070> prepare<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.550> produce<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.210> way

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
and try and prepare the produce in a way

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.450 
and try and prepare the produce in a way
that<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.990> can<00:02:14.140> feed<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.530> through<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.250> just

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
that I can feed it through and it just

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.460 
that I can feed it through and it just
falls<00:02:15.700> into<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.120> Machine<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.080> machine

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
falls into the Machine and the machine

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.380 
falls into the Machine and the machine
as<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.710> can<00:02:17.860> see<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.250> had<00:02:18.640> no<00:02:18.850> problem<00:02:19.240> going

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
as you can see is had no problem going

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.240 
as you can see is had no problem going
through<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.810> produce<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.830> didn't<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.130> to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
through the produce and I didn't have to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.550 
through the produce and I didn't have to
use<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.520> pusher<00:02:21.730> once<00:02:22.090> that's<00:02:22.960> your<00:02:23.170> aim<00:02:23.350> if

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
use the pusher once that's your aim if

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.080 
use the pusher once that's your aim if
you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.800> do<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:24.520> you're<00:02:24.670> feeding<00:02:24.910> it

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you can do that then you're feeding it

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.000 
you can do that then you're feeding it
nicely<00:02:25.380> occasionally<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.500> still<00:02:26.740> have<00:02:26.890> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
nicely occasionally you still have to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.910 
nicely occasionally you still have to
use<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.280> pusher<00:02:27.490> but<00:02:28.240> it's<00:02:28.390> not<00:02:28.630> required<00:02:29.530> if

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
use the pusher but it's not required if

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.650 
use the pusher but it's not required if
you<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.460> know<00:02:30.610> ninety<00:02:31.060> percent<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.480> time

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
you you know ninety percent of the time

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.400 
you you know ninety percent of the time
doing<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.990> properly

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
doing it properly

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.860 
doing it properly
now<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.640> also<00:02:33.880> important<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.540> note<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
now it is also important to note that

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.350 
now it is also important to note that
while<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.590> pulp<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.190> moving<00:02:36.820> in<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> ejection

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
while the pulp is moving in the ejection

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.080 
while the pulp is moving in the ejection
port<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:38.050> machine<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.590> still<00:02:38.800> juicing<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:40.030> you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
port the machine is still juicing so you

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.700 
port the machine is still juicing so you
can<00:02:40.360> see<00:02:40.570> we've<00:02:40.780> still<00:02:40.900> got<00:02:41.200> pulp<00:02:41.500> coming

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
can see we've still got pulp coming

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.800 
can see we've still got pulp coming
through<00:02:42.070> here<00:02:42.310> we've<00:02:43.120> got<00:02:43.270> drips<00:02:43.600> coming

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
through here we've got drips coming

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.470 
through here we've got drips coming
through<00:02:44.460> so<00:02:45.460> we'll<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:45.760> give<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.090> Machine<00:02:46.450> a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
through so we'll just give the Machine a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.500 
through so we'll just give the Machine a
couple<00:02:46.900> more<00:02:47.050> seconds<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.970> get<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.090> most<00:02:49.300> out

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
couple more seconds to get the most out

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.470 
couple more seconds to get the most out
of<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.720> yield<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.160> slowing<00:02:54.610> down<00:02:54.640> now<00:02:55.150> so

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
of the yield it is slowing down now so

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.850 
of the yield it is slowing down now so
we<00:02:55.630> might<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:56.459> stop<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.640> there<00:02:57.850> if<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:59.680> want

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
we might just stop it there if you want

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.590 
we might just stop it there if you want
to<00:02:59.920> be<00:03:00.040> sure<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.459> can<00:03:00.670> actually<00:03:00.880> just<00:03:01.300> put<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
to be sure you can actually just put the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.530 
to be sure you can actually just put the
Machine<00:03:01.930> in<00:03:02.080> Reverse<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.680> few<00:03:02.920> seconds<00:03:06.420> give<00:03:07.420> it

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
Machine in Reverse a few seconds give it

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.210 
Machine in Reverse a few seconds give it
a<00:03:07.600> second<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:07.990> stop<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.560> then<00:03:08.680> put<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.010> back

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
a second to stop and then put it back

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.030 
a second to stop and then put it back
into<00:03:09.430> forward<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:11.440> make<00:03:11.590> sure<00:03:11.620> there's

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
into forward I just make sure there's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.680 
into forward I just make sure there's
nothing<00:03:12.220> still<00:03:12.730> in<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.000> auger<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.390> got

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
nothing still in the auger that got

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.750 
nothing still in the auger that got
caught<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.440> reverse<00:03:14.740> just<00:03:14.950> moves<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.430> around

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
caught the reverse just moves it around

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.310 
caught the reverse just moves it around
and<00:03:16.000> then<00:03:16.120> when<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.600> put<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.840> back<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:17.050> to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
and then when you put it back in to

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.009 
and then when you put it back in to
forwards<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.800> moves<00:03:18.040> again<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:19.150> we'll<00:03:19.840> just

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
forwards it moves again so we'll just

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.620 
forwards it moves again so we'll just
close<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.590> drip<00:03:21.630> cover<00:03:22.630> there<00:03:22.989> we'll<00:03:23.410> get<00:03:23.830> the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
close the drip cover there we'll get the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.210 
close the drip cover there we'll get the
produce<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:25.870> have<00:03:26.230> we'll<00:03:26.680> tear<00:03:27.010> the

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
produce that we have we'll tear the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.890 
produce that we have we'll tear the
Machine<00:03:27.610> this<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.030> going<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.239> weigh<00:03:28.420> in<00:03:28.450> milk

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
Machine this is going to weigh in milk

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.150 
Machine this is going to weigh in milk
mils<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:31.780> on<00:03:31.959> zero<00:03:32.320> we'll<00:03:32.590> just<00:03:32.800> pour<00:03:33.040> it

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
mils so it's on zero we'll just pour it

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.920 
mils so it's on zero we'll just pour it
off<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:38.590> looks<00:03:39.160> like<00:03:39.489> we<00:03:39.820> have<00:03:40.000> four

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
off and it looks like we have four

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.050 
off and it looks like we have four
hundred<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.470> thirty<00:03:41.560> two<00:03:42.040> milliliters<00:03:42.519> so

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
hundred and thirty two milliliters so

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.390 
hundred and thirty two milliliters so
there<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.300> go<00:03:43.540> so<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.590> kuvings<00:03:45.100> whole<00:03:45.190> slow

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
there you go so the kuvings whole slow

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.699 
there you go so the kuvings whole slow
