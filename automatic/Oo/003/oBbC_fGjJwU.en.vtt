00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
harder work that way but I find it much

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.580 
harder work that way but I find it much
more<00:00:14.400> stimulating<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.420> tour<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.780> don't<00:00:16.139> envy<00:00:16.320> my

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
more stimulating on tour I don't envy my

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.109 
more stimulating on tour I don't envy my
colleagues<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.220> want<00:00:17.369> only<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.640> play<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.090> or

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
two concertos during the year because I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.920 
two concertos during the year because I
think<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:21.240> into<00:00:21.449> rut<00:00:21.630> doing

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
think that they can get into rut doing

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.429 
think that they can get into rut doing
that<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.730> really<00:00:24.330> imp<00:00:24.480> Lane<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> great<00:00:25.230> many

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
that so I I really imp Lane a great many

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.620 
that so I I really imp Lane a great many
different<00:00:25.800> works<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.189> orchestra<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.939> it's

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
different works with orchestra and it's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.689 
different works with orchestra and it's
an<00:00:27.750> exciting<00:00:28.140> experience<00:00:28.340> why<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.400> these

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
an exciting experience why do these

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.790 
an exciting experience why do these
summer<00:00:29.970> people<00:00:30.210> decide<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:31.769> two

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
summer people decide on one or two

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.430 
summer people decide on one or two
pieces<00:00:32.189> per<00:00:32.550> year<00:00:32.820> well<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> really<00:00:34.140> don't<00:00:34.350> know

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
pieces per year well I really don't know

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.620 
pieces per year well I really don't know
it<00:00:34.710> could<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:35.070> laziness<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.880> perhaps<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.450> lack

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it could be laziness or perhaps a lack

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.590 
it could be laziness or perhaps a lack
of<00:00:36.660> security<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:38.120> prefer<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.360> way<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
of security but I prefer it this way I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.139 
of security but I prefer it this way I
think<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.500> makes<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.100> musical<00:00:41.520> season<00:00:41.850> far

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
think it makes the musical season far

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.180 
think it makes the musical season far
