audio and video right to your receiver

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.910 
audio and video right to your receiver
right<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.520> your<00:01:51.640> TV<00:01:52.170> optical<00:01:53.170> out<00:01:53.350> whatever<00:01:53.740> it

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
right to your TV optical out whatever it

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.340 
right to your TV optical out whatever it
was<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:55.390> most<00:01:55.720> people<00:01:55.840> were<00:01:56.020> good<00:01:56.200> with

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
was and so most people were good with

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.770 
was and so most people were good with
this<00:01:56.560> but<00:01:57.250> just<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.240> other<00:01:58.330> day<00:01:58.600> they

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
this but just the other day they

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.440 
this but just the other day they
released<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.290> new<00:01:59.470> Mac<00:02:00.040> Mini<00:02:00.460> which<00:02:00.759> kind<00:02:01.210> of

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
released the new Mac Mini which kind of

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.600 
released the new Mac Mini which kind of
at<00:02:01.689> least<00:02:01.840> at<00:02:02.470> first<00:02:02.680> glance<00:02:02.979> at<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.280> best<00:02:03.490> of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
at least at first glance at the best of

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.230 
at least at first glance at the best of
both<00:02:03.790> worlds

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
both worlds

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.289 
both worlds
it<00:02:04.689> improves<00:02:05.080> upon<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:06.340> original<00:02:06.880> Mac<00:02:07.060> Mini

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
it improves upon the original Mac Mini

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.229 
it improves upon the original Mac Mini
design<00:02:07.689> as<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:08.019> see<00:02:08.229> here<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:08.799> thinner<00:02:09.239> it's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
design as you see here it's thinner it's

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.180 
design as you see here it's thinner it's
about<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.140> same<00:02:11.350> size<00:02:11.620> but<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:11.980> thinner

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
about the same size but it's thinner

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.280 
about the same size but it's thinner
it's<00:02:12.280> more<00:02:12.610> durable<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.690> easier<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.110> upgrade

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it's more durable it's easier to upgrade

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.180 
it's more durable it's easier to upgrade
due<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
due to the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.340 
due to the
the<00:02:16.340> open<00:02:16.610> panel<00:02:16.880> at<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> bottom<00:02:17.330> but<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
the open panel at the bottom but the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.720 
the open panel at the bottom but the
other<00:02:18.530> thing<00:02:18.740> is<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.920> gives<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.250> HDMI

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
other thing is it gives you the HDMI

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.170 
other thing is it gives you the HDMI
port<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.480> older<00:02:20.990> Mac<00:02:21.140> Mini<00:02:21.380> was<00:02:21.560> lacking

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
port that the older Mac Mini was lacking

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.730 
port that the older Mac Mini was lacking
so<00:02:23.180> when<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> compare<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.320> Apple<00:02:24.620> TV

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
so when you compare this to the Apple TV

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.340 
so when you compare this to the Apple TV
and<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.600> they're<00:02:29.750> pretty<00:02:29.780> much

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
and you can see they're pretty much

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.620 
and you can see they're pretty much
there<00:02:30.710> right<00:02:30.920> about<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.280> same<00:02:31.460> size<00:02:31.760> they're

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
there right about the same size they're

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.530 
there right about the same size they're
a<00:02:32.660> little<00:02:33.170> different<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:33.710> not<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.070> much<00:02:34.540> so

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
a little different but not that much so

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.610 
a little different but not that much so
size<00:02:35.870> wise<00:02:36.940> as<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.000> can<00:02:38.270> see<00:02:38.420> there<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.080> Mac

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
size wise as you can see there the Mac

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.910 
size wise as you can see there the Mac
Mini<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.890> just<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.070> tiny<00:02:40.730> bit<00:02:40.970> taller<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.710> size

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
Mini is just a tiny bit taller the size

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.310 
Mini is just a tiny bit taller the size
wise<00:02:43.190> are<00:02:43.370> very<00:02:43.670> similar<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.810> know<00:02:45.080> they

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
wise are very similar so you know they

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.270 
wise are very similar so you know they
would<00:02:45.470> pretty<00:02:45.650> much<00:02:45.770> take<00:02:45.920> up<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.160> same

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
would pretty much take up the same

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.020 
would pretty much take up the same
amount<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.580> space<00:02:47.020> but<00:02:48.220> hardware<00:02:49.220> wise<00:02:49.460> now

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
amount of space but hardware wise now

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.380 
amount of space but hardware wise now
that<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.240> have<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.420> HDMI<00:02:50.690> port<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:53.000> really

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
that you have the HDMI port this really

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.660 
that you have the HDMI port this really
can<00:02:53.750> or<00:02:54.260> should<00:02:54.770> be<00:02:54.980> able<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.190> replace<00:02:55.490> your

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
can or should be able to replace your

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.370 
can or should be able to replace your
Apple<00:02:55.970> TV<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.420> only<00:02:56.480> thing<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.260> it's

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
Apple TV the only thing that it's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.550 
Apple TV the only thing that it's
missing<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.820> Apple<00:02:59.180> TV<00:02:59.570> software<00:02:59.930> the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
missing is the Apple TV software the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
missing is the Apple TV software the
Apple<00:03:00.770> TV<00:03:01.010> runs<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:02.030> have<00:03:02.500> front<00:03:03.500> row<00:03:03.710> so<00:03:04.520> you

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
Apple TV runs you have front row so you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.100 
Apple TV runs you have front row so you
can<00:03:04.790> kind<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.090> get<00:03:05.240> something<00:03:05.420> close<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.960> get

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
can kind of get something close you get

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.600 
can kind of get something close you get
like<00:03:06.290> what<00:03:06.470> was<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.620> original<00:03:06.890> Apple<00:03:07.250> TV

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
like what was the original Apple TV

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.280 
like what was the original Apple TV
software<00:03:07.820> with<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.390> front<00:03:08.630> row<00:03:08.780> you're<00:03:09.200> not

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
software with the front row you're not

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.650 
software with the front row you're not
gonna<00:03:09.410> get<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.710> new<00:03:09.830> 3.0<00:03:10.460> but<00:03:10.760> it's<00:03:11.330> kind<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.570> a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
gonna get the new 3.0 but it's kind of a

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.180 
gonna get the new 3.0 but it's kind of a
toss-up<00:03:11.900> if<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.230> want<00:03:12.440> something<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:13.070> know<00:03:13.100> a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
toss-up if you want something you know a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.760 
toss-up if you want something you know a
little<00:03:13.370> more<00:03:13.550> robust<00:03:14.080> go<00:03:15.080> with<00:03:15.230> this<00:03:15.440> if<00:03:15.680> you

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
little more robust go with this if you

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.500 
little more robust go with this if you
want<00:03:15.920> something<00:03:16.100> more<00:03:16.280> inexpensive<00:03:17.090> or<00:03:17.420> you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
want something more inexpensive or you

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.760 
want something more inexpensive or you
just<00:03:17.630> want<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.930> default<00:03:18.290> you're<00:03:18.440> big<00:03:18.620> into
