like that go through in our peers of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.590 
like that go through in our peers of
around<00:01:24.990> six<00:01:25.560> months<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.030> did<00:01:27.240> exactly

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
around six months so if we did exactly

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.990 
around six months so if we did exactly
that<00:01:27.810> i<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> full<00:01:28.500> line<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.130> servers<00:01:29.549> i<00:01:29.729> put

what is the composite of the plastic

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.110 
what is the composite of the plastic
it's<00:02:43.120> simply<00:02:43.569> not<00:02:44.140> up<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.470> scratch<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.160> you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
it's simply not up to scratch and you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.229 
it's simply not up to scratch and you
get<00:02:46.330> elections<00:02:47.050> in<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.500> servos<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.730> the

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
get elections in the servos so the

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.210 
get elections in the servos so the
result<00:02:49.569> of<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.319> process<00:02:50.799> will

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
result of that of that process will

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.990 
result of that of that process will
develop<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.940> 6311<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.830> is<00:02:53.980> currently<00:02:54.760> at

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
develop the 6311 and it is currently at

years<00:03:04.030> that's<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.810> server<00:03:05.049> i'm<00:03:05.290> using<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:05.890> i

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
years that's the server i'm using and i

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.630 
years that's the server i'm using and i
fly<00:03:06.580> almost<00:03:06.850> on<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.180> weekly<00:03:07.650> basis<00:03:08.650> quite

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
fly almost on a weekly basis quite

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.520 
fly almost on a weekly basis quite
aggressive<00:03:10.209> flight<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:12.400> giant<00:03:12.670> scale<00:03:12.910> and

aggressive flight for giant scale and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.990 
aggressive flight for giant scale and
those<00:03:14.530> ever<00:03:14.799> seems<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.220> do<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.760> seemed<00:03:15.970> to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
those ever seems to do it and seemed to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.229 
those ever seems to do it and seemed to
do<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.390> quite<00:03:16.989> well<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.500> reliable<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.730> if<00:03:19.000> you
