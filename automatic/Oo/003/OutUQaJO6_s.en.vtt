likings<00:00:46.289> I'll<00:00:47.250> make<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:48.090> loop<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.930> some

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
likings I'll make a loop for this some

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.840 
likings I'll make a loop for this some
example<00:00:50.329> then<00:00:51.329> hit<00:00:52.110> down<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.530> um<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.670> can

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
example then hit down here um you can

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.250 
example then hit down here um you can
make<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> condition<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> feel<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
make a condition if you feel like it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.760 
make a condition if you feel like it
it's<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.309> necessary<00:00:56.820> I'll<00:00:57.510> make<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:57.930> I'll

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it's not necessary I'll make one I'll

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.240 
it's not necessary I'll make one I'll
just<00:00:59.039> make<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> simple<00:00:59.460> simon<00:01:00.210> condition<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
just make a simple simon condition and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
just make a simple simon condition and
you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.609> when<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:02.850> typing<00:01:03.059> some<00:01:03.480> reason

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you can see when I'm typing some reason

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.980 
you can see when I'm typing some reason
I<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.799> something<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.729> my

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
I think it's something with with my

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.440 
I think it's something with with my
recording<00:01:06.990> software<00:01:07.130> doesn't<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.450> record

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
recording software doesn't really record

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.800 
recording software doesn't really record
the<00:01:10.140> boxes<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.220> um<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.790> type<00:01:12.270> too<00:01:12.570> because

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the boxes but um I type too because

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.469 
the boxes but um I type too because
that's<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.010> equivalent<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.970> second<00:01:15.390> in

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that's the equivalent to one second in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.190 
that's the equivalent to one second in
real<00:01:15.720> life<00:01:15.979> when<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.130> play<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.960> fast

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
real life when you play on the fast

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.149 
real life when you play on the fast
speed<00:01:20.150> which<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.500> why<00:01:24.619> now<00:01:25.619> let's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
speed which I do so that's why now let's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.070 
speed which I do so that's why now let's
make<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> tribute<00:01:26.850> effect<00:01:27.299> by<00:01:27.509> clicking<00:01:28.049> new

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
make the tribute effect by clicking new

player 1 and the tiger player to be Gaia
and<00:01:52.670> yeah<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:53.939> very<00:01:54.060> rational<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.840> do

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and yeah it's not very rational just do

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.980 
and yeah it's not very rational just do
it<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:56.070> work<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.420> we're<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.840> to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
get that minus symbol you will have to

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.770 
get that minus symbol you will have to
go<00:02:17.320> out<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> game<00:02:18.330> find<00:02:19.330> somewhere<00:02:19.600> where

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
go out of the game find somewhere where

and choose paste and that will bring the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.280 
and choose paste and that will bring the
mind<00:03:08.050> simple<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.070> now<00:03:09.250> type<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.900> amount<00:03:10.960> of

resources you you want to tribute for

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.010 
resources you you want to tribute for
some<00:03:18.100> reason<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.550> doesn't<00:03:18.730> work<00:03:18.880> when<00:03:19.840> you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
some reason it doesn't work when you

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.530 
some reason it doesn't work when you
make<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:21.220> quantity<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.850> be<00:03:22.030> one<00:03:23.070> not<00:03:24.070> for<00:03:24.250> me

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
make the quantity to be one not for me

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.390 
make the quantity to be one not for me
but<00:03:25.540> maybe<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.620> don't<00:03:26.890> know<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.250> can

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
but maybe for you I don't know you can

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.500 
but maybe for you I don't know you can
try<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.590> suggest<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.460> you<00:03:30.580> make<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.940> too

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
try so I suggest that you make it too

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.130 
try so I suggest that you make it too
and<00:03:31.860> if<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.040> want<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.830> be<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:37.330> be<00:03:37.360> one<00:03:37.660> you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
and if you want it to be to be one you

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.780 
and if you want it to be to be one you
could<00:03:38.320> make<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.700> system<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.940> gives<00:03:40.930> one<00:03:41.790> back

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
could make a system that gives one back

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.650 
could make a system that gives one back
to<00:03:43.120> Gaia<00:03:43.330> every<00:03:43.870> time<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:45.040> get<00:03:45.730> one<00:03:45.760> get<00:03:46.480> two

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
to Gaia every time you get one get two

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.530 
to Gaia every time you get one get two
or<00:03:47.140> something<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.740> so<00:03:48.130> just<00:03:48.700> yeah<00:03:49.000> use

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
or something like that so just yeah use

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.410 
or something like that so just yeah use
your<00:03:49.660> imagination<00:03:50.580> anyway<00:03:51.580> now<00:03:52.090> this<00:03:52.360> is

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
your imagination anyway now this is

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.600 
your imagination anyway now this is

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
as you can see we get to food every

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.289 
as you can see we get to food every
second<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.139> it's<00:04:17.130> working<00:04:17.489> there's<00:04:18.030> no

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
second so it's working there's no

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.779
