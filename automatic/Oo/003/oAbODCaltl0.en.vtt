probably<00:01:59.219> would<00:01:59.369> mentalism<00:01:59.850> even<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.780> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
probably would mentalism even but you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
probably would mentalism even but you
can<00:02:01.409> see<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.590> he's<00:02:01.860> dropped<00:02:02.189> bunches<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
defense on the top at the bottom he's

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
defense on the top at the bottom he's
dropped<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:10.020> larva<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> couple<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:10.979> loons<00:02:11.220> and

come into play to look at where it's put
his<00:02:27.630> rages<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.319> see<00:02:28.500> he's<00:02:29.400> using<00:02:29.640> his<00:02:29.760> rage

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
his rages you see he's using his rage

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.699 
his rages you see he's using his rage
both<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.450> speed<00:02:30.720> into<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> internos<00:02:31.470> but

both the speed into the internos but
also<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.190> see<00:02:32.340> pretty<00:02:32.519> high<00:02:32.730> value<00:02:33.060> one

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.729 
positions we've got based a lot you can
actually<00:02:45.330> use<00:02:45.600> your<00:02:45.750> rage<00:02:45.900> base<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.290> run<00:02:46.470> into

he<00:02:52.019> let<00:02:52.290> these<00:02:52.410> guys<00:02:52.620> take<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.860> bit<00:02:53.069> of<00:02:53.100> damage

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
he let these guys take a bit of damage

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.890 
he let these guys take a bit of damage
and<00:02:53.610> then<00:02:54.209> he'll<00:02:54.420> plug<00:02:54.989> these<00:02:55.140> fries<00:02:55.500> on<00:02:56.900> here

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
and then he'll plug these fries on here

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
and then he'll plug these fries on here
and<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.700> that<00:03:00.060> way<00:03:00.530> he'll<00:03:01.530> preserve

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
and here and that way he'll preserve

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.160 
and here and that way he'll preserve
them<00:03:02.099> from<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.580> use<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.180> actual<00:03:03.299> partly

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
them from and use the actual partly

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.630 
them from and use the actual partly
damaged<00:03:04.440> balloons<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.950> cool<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.220> informatics

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
damaged balloons to cool the informatics

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.890 
damaged balloons to cool the informatics
so<00:03:06.269> let's<00:03:06.420> see<00:03:06.540> how<00:03:06.599> he<00:03:06.720> goes<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:09.480> freeze

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
so let's see how he goes so freeze

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.990 
so let's see how he goes so freeze
freeze<00:03:10.799> didn't<00:03:11.340> even<00:03:11.489> let<00:03:11.549> them<00:03:11.700> take<00:03:11.849> much

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
freeze didn't even let them take much

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640 
freeze didn't even let them take much
damage<00:03:12.299> at<00:03:12.420> all<00:03:12.540> probably<00:03:13.319> thinks<00:03:13.500> they<00:03:13.530> can

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
damage at all probably thinks they can

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.509 
damage at all probably thinks they can
get<00:03:13.799> most<00:03:13.920> away<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:16.470> they<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:16.980> get<00:03:17.250> most

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
get most away in and they do get most

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.060 
get most away in and they do get most
the<00:03:17.670> way<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.060> inferno<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:19.920> got<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
the way to that inferno and it's got a

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.599 
the way to that inferno and it's got a
ton<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.310> balloons<00:03:20.609> left<00:03:20.880> here<00:03:21.859> no<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:22.890> know<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
ton of balloons left here no I know and

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.250 
ton of balloons left here no I know and
pretty<00:03:23.880> much<00:03:23.940> no<00:03:24.209> elephants<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> rate<00:03:25.109> is

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
pretty much no elephants so the rate is

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.390 
pretty much no elephants so the rate is
pretty<00:03:25.410> much<00:03:25.560> over<00:03:27.739> it's<00:03:28.739> amazing<00:03:28.980> rate<00:03:29.370> I

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
pretty much over it's amazing rate I

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400 
pretty much over it's amazing rate I
thought<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.760> say<00:03:29.970> gotta<00:03:30.810> love<00:03:30.989> watching<00:03:31.319> these

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
thought I say gotta love watching these

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.729 
thought I say gotta love watching these
raids<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:34.049> don't<00:03:34.290> know<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.470> looks<00:03:34.620> like

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
raids and I don't know it looks like

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.080 
raids and I don't know it looks like
it's<00:03:34.859> got<00:03:34.920> about<00:03:35.069> half<00:03:35.250> his<00:03:35.400> balloons<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.910> left

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
it's got about half his balloons it left

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.150 
it's got about half his balloons it left
there<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:36.630> I'm<00:03:37.440> not<00:03:37.530> sure<00:03:37.560> he's<00:03:37.859> got<00:03:37.980> many

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
there and I'm not sure he's got many

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.530 
there and I'm not sure he's got many
lovers<00:03:38.400> actually<00:03:38.850> popped<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.209> think<00:03:39.390> he<00:03:39.450> had

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
lovers actually popped I think he had

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
two lovers in the road but it's got 50

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.270 
two lovers in the road but it's got 50
57<00:03:43.170> seconds<00:03:43.440> these<00:03:43.590> only<00:03:43.859> issue<00:03:43.980> here<00:03:44.100> is

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
57 seconds these only issue here is
