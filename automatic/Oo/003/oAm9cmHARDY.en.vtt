00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.100
 well i am crazy water very good be 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.770
 welcome to a more video here in the 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.600
 channel in gt5 online and now that I am 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.000
 seeing my chorus of this my mask looks 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.880
 well macabre I know well damn asia its 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.829
 Suarez from your eyes see or see the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.570
 beast but good as they are I hope that 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.610
 be very good i am crazy motherfucker 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.250
 you are welcome to a mini 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.630
 trick here in gta 5 as you could see 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.820
 in the title this time I come to do 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.190
 what would be a little trick so that 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.230
 you can shoot what would be your 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.750
 weapon and without recharging keep firing 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.180
 that or rather remove as the recharge and 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.280
 keep shooting fast not the example 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.929
 it would be clearer with the mosquitia that 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.820
 it takes good this new shotgun that 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.160
 they came up with what this new dlc would be 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.800
 this shotgun that takes to put what 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.629
 it would be gunpowder and all that we are going to 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.310
 cut all this transaction and with a 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.650
 simple step we will be able to follow 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.720
 shooting normally ok this same thing 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.250
 we can do with an rpg with one more law 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.350
 chingÃ³n and with all those weapons that 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.090
 take longer to recharge and so be able to continue 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.159
 shooting loading ammo without having to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.420
 do the animation ok a clear example 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.860
 is to see well 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.750
 let's use the new shotgun 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.909
 poplars that we catch we are going to shoot and 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.200
 as we are going to have to recharge by 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.520
 at least we have to move and do not 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.649
 we hit the enemy and we're going to have to 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.390
 doing sanders doing this but not 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.070
 here what would this method be a method 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.110
 very simple the first thing we would have 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.549
 what to do would be to press here the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.170
 weapons we go here where is our 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.090
 little hand and here where is our little hand 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.369
 let's put the knife that 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.810
 it works with the c4 but I recommend it 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.880
 the knife because it's easier when 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.799
 we are in a fight then what here then 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.509
 if we put the knife and it would be ready 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.789
 not once we have the knife 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.009
 down there as main what we're going to 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.840
 to do would be to put what would be the 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.250
 shotgun and once I have the shotgun 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.080
 the gray would be ready 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.299
 here nothing else we could shoot and a 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.000
 once we shoot the fast we put him 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.069
 the knife again to the shotgun and 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.170
 we can continue shooting and so the 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.239
 times we want ok is a 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.130
 good step so a very simple glitch to 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.019
 the truth to be able to shoot the times 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.850
 that we want we can here I am 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.900
 making a massacre with the micros 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.330
 but I do not matter 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.010
 bonet shot and well we could continue 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.290
 with weapons here we are going to put another 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.510
 example with what it would be I do not know the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.180
 large do not know how big where it is 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.569
 normal here the biggest inmates the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.430
 that is in the dam the one that takes in and 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.379
 to use the rockets as 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.540
 here we have to do this it grabs the 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.610
 rocket and all this not so one step here 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.140
 very simple nothing gets out here again and 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.360
 we can continue shooting here again 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.370
 here and we can continue shooting is not a 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.810
 very simple trick very easy is nothing more 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.220
 a little video so I put what 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.870
 learn or to apply it this 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.579
 I find when they are there in one against 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.769
 one with musket shotguns that 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.239
 some are well rudders and shotguns 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.980
 that are a bit treacherous, not because 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.440
 how can he kill the first one can 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.849
 to kill you at 20 so it's a 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.409
 little glitch and I could do it 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.150
 with what would be the files and we 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.620
 they could do it with any weapon let's go 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.599
 to put up the image that the one that takes 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.370
 in reloading we are going to shoot some at 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.560
 shoot us there are far and instead of recharging 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.530
 and instead of recharging as a recharge 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.760
 weapons with weapons recala instead of 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.349
 recharge the ma we put to that the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.049
 knife and we would have what it would be 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.909
 all the ammunition again ok and very good 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.620
 that would almost be all greetings 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.389

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.190
