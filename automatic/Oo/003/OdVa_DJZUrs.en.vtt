Welcome to Skates.co.uk, my name is Ben and today I am going to be showing you the Tilt Legacy Threadless Forks

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:13.000
These are top end forks and I will be explaining why they are so good in just a second

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:26.000
Basically to start off with they have been CFC'd from one piece of 6061 grade Aluminium and what that means is that they have been made from one solid piece of Aluminium so it is not a couple of pieces that have been welded together

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, the benefit of this is, that it will weigh less and it will be much much stronger

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:38.000
What tilt have done with these forks is they have tried to make them as strong and as light weight as possible

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:45.000
So they have cut out pieces here to make them as light as possible but again, by cutting out the pieces here it doesnt actually affect the strength in any way

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.000
It comes with an axle bolt as well. Now the other really interesting thing is the top cap here

00:00:51.001 --> 00:01:05.000
Tilt have installed a screw in top cap. There is a load of benefits to this, the first one being that you don't need a star nut anymore if you are running a HIC or an SCS compression kit

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:19.000
The benefit of this, which can be tightened with an allen key, is that when you screw it in, it puts more pressure onto your headset bearings, but it puts is over nice and evenly

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:27.000
so you will get a really really smooth ride, much much smoother than if you were running a compression kit with a starnut

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:34.000
The other benefit is that its stronger than a star nut and as well, these are replaceable so if you do need to replace it you can do

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:43.000
So instead of having to replace your forks when the star nut goes, or bashing it down even further, this top cap will actually extend the life of your forks.

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:52.000
