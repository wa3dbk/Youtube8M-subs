27-inch CG this self calibrates as well
and<00:01:19.500> you'll<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.159> device<00:01:20.549> pop<00:01:20.939> up

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and you'll see the little device pop up

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
and you'll see the little device pop up
in<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.360> second<00:01:21.780> there<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> corner<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
in a second there in the corner here I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830 
in a second there in the corner here I
just<00:01:23.009> saw<00:01:23.250> self<00:01:23.490> calibration<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.180> got

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
just saw self calibration and then got

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.240 
just saw self calibration and then got
the<00:01:24.930> device<00:01:25.200> pop<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.040> that's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the device pop up there and what that's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
the device pop up there and what that's
doing<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.909> measuring<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.659> color<00:01:28.409> inside

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
doing is it's measuring the color inside

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
doing is it's measuring the color inside
the<00:01:29.189> monitor<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> setting<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> monitor<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the monitor and setting the monitor to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.380 
the monitor and setting the monitor to
keep<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.290> color<00:01:31.530> accurate<00:01:32.100> yeah<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.210> will

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
keep the color accurate yeah this will

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.960 
keep the color accurate yeah this will

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
we had to get over the fact that the

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.430 
we had to get over the fact that the
main<00:05:29.610> thing<00:05:29.849> that<00:05:29.880> an<00:05:30.120> ISO<00:05:30.479> can<00:05:30.630> do<00:05:30.810> over<00:05:31.080> a<00:05:31.110> lot

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
main thing that an ISO can do over a lot

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.230 
main thing that an ISO can do over a lot
of<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.620> competitors<00:05:31.889> is<00:05:32.370> that<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.669> shows<00:05:32.909> true

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
of the competitors is that it shows true

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.050 
of the competitors is that it shows true
blacks<00:05:33.509> whites<00:05:34.020> grays<00:05:34.860> but<00:05:35.340> also<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.909> the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
blacks whites grays but also it the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.930 
blacks whites grays but also it the
colour<00:05:36.300> reproduction<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:37.080> spot-on<00:05:37.440> so<00:05:38.400> the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
colour reproduction is spot-on so the

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.060 
colour reproduction is spot-on so the
only<00:05:39.090> way<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:39.300> could<00:05:39.479> think<00:05:39.810> of<00:05:40.020> showing<00:05:40.919> that

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
only way I could think of showing that

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.040 
only way I could think of showing that
apart<00:05:41.400> from<00:05:41.490> static<00:05:42.180> charts<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:42.750> boring

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
apart from static charts and boring

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.320 
apart from static charts and boring
things<00:05:43.320> was<00:05:43.889> to<00:05:43.919> actually<00:05:44.159> have<00:05:44.430> red<00:05:45.090> green

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
chrome and everything so that we could

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.480 
chrome and everything so that we could
then<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.289> then<00:05:55.650> we<00:05:55.770> had<00:05:55.949> to<00:05:56.070> have<00:05:56.159> something

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
then and then we had to have something

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.310 
then and then we had to have something
that<00:05:56.520> was<00:05:56.699> a<00:05:56.729> bit<00:05:56.909> more<00:05:57.090> dynamic<00:05:57.300> with<00:05:57.750> motion

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
that was a bit more dynamic with motion

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.439 
that was a bit more dynamic with motion
and<00:05:58.469> everything<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.830> we<00:05:59.550> decided<00:06:00.180> on<00:06:00.360> the

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
and everything and we decided on the
