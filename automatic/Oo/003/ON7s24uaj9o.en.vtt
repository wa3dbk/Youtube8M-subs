00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:22.959 
don't really sighs the way I want it you

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.719 
don't really sighs the way I want it you
can<00:01:23.110> let<00:01:23.229> burn<00:01:23.500> up<00:01:23.649> software<00:01:23.920> tell<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.340> tables

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
can let burn up software tell the tables

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.100 
can let burn up software tell the tables
for<00:01:24.910> you<00:01:25.030> so<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.360> can<00:01:25.539> see<00:01:25.690> everything<00:01:26.020> at

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
for you so you can see everything at

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.990 
for you so you can see everything at
once<00:01:26.319> but<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:26.890> really<00:01:27.069> distorts<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.640> windows

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
once but it really distorts the windows

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.609 
once but it really distorts the windows
and<00:01:28.209> makes<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:28.450> look<00:01:28.479> really<00:01:28.750> ugly<00:01:28.899> the

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
and makes it look really ugly the

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:30.930 
and makes it look really ugly the
software<00:01:30.009> really<00:01:30.429> doesn't<00:01:30.640> have<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.759> lot<00:01:30.910> of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
software really doesn't have a lot of

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.910 
software really doesn't have a lot of
options<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.539> as<00:01:31.690> along<00:01:31.959> with<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.200> go<00:01:32.349> but<00:01:32.890> I

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
options and as along with it go but I

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.260 
options and as along with it go but I
still<00:01:33.160> like<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.369> because<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.819> design<00:01:34.090> is

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
still like it because the design is

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.270 
still like it because the design is
really<00:01:34.300> nice<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.750> clean<00:01:35.110> numbers<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.069> parts

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
really nice and clean numbers and parts

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.400 
really nice and clean numbers and parts
are<00:01:36.369> easy<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.729> see<00:01:36.910> so<00:01:37.240> while<00:01:37.390> this<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.810> towards

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
are easy to see so while this is towards

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.290 
are easy to see so while this is towards
the<00:01:38.500> bottom<00:01:38.649> of<00:01:38.890> software<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.550> still<00:01:40.119> like<00:01:40.270> it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300
