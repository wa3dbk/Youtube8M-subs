00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.899 
queue if they like ever take a Killam
Lane<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.229> usually<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.619> raged<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.700> are

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
Lane they usually get raged at there are

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
Lane they usually get raged at there are
pros<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.630> cons<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.140> were<00:01:25.259> talking

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
pros and cons that you were talking

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.740 
pros and cons that you were talking
about<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.950> supports<00:01:26.729> either<00:01:26.880> getting<00:01:27.150> farm<00:01:27.509> or

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
about of supports either getting farm or

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.910 
about of supports either getting farm or
getting<00:01:27.900> kills<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.350> are<00:01:28.439> those<00:01:28.590> well

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
getting kills what are those well

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.039 
getting kills what are those well
basically<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.640> started<00:01:30.000> off<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.180> Zyra<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
basically it started off with Zyra you

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.929 
basically it started off with Zyra you
could<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.799> cs<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.280> Zyra<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.790> used

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
could get a lot of cs on Zyra you used

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.550 
could get a lot of cs on Zyra you used
to<00:01:33.030> take<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.299> 30<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:33.659> 40<00:01:33.689> CS<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.229> Lane<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
to take like 30 or 40 CS in Lane and I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.719 
to take like 30 or 40 CS in Lane and I
don't<00:01:34.650> know<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> P<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
don't know a P and then you have a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.539 
don't know a P and then you have a
secondary<00:01:36.180> ap<00:01:36.540> player<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.200> also<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:38.070> kill<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
secondary ap player and also a kill and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.830 
secondary ap player and also a kill and
support<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.970> better<00:01:39.090> than<00:01:39.299> no<00:01:39.390> kill<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.720> all

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
support is better than no kill at all

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.620 
support is better than no kill at all
yeah<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> don't<00:01:40.770> really<00:01:40.950> care<00:01:41.630> also

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
yeah so I don't really care also

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.969 
yeah so I don't really care also

why<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.979> give<00:01:50.159> him<00:01:50.250> an<00:01:50.369> exhaust<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.909> he<00:01:51.030> can

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
why not give him an exhaust so he can

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.520 
why not give him an exhaust so he can
defend<00:01:51.450> against<00:01:51.810> himself<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.320> bruiser

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that ignite guy I can ignite him sure I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.740 
that ignite guy I can ignite him sure I
might<00:01:56.460> take<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> kill<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.180> they're<00:01:57.329> dead

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
might take the kill but if they're dead

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.330 
might take the kill but if they're dead
they're<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.229> getting<00:01:58.320> creeps<00:01:58.680> we're<00:01:59.189> still

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
they're not getting creeps we're still

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.830 
they're not getting creeps we're still
winning<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.670> yeah<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.180> that's<00:02:00.390> often<00:02:00.570> why<00:02:00.780> you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
winning out yeah so that's often why you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.270 
winning out yeah so that's often why you
probably<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.500> gambit<00:02:01.890> gaming<00:02:01.920> will<00:02:02.219> be

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
probably see like gambit gaming will be

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
probably see like gambit gaming will be
the<00:02:02.340> prime<00:02:02.520> example<00:02:02.909> Edward<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.630> guy<00:02:03.899> who

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the prime example Edward is the guy who

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.300 
the prime example Edward is the guy who
steals<00:02:04.350> more<00:02:04.560> kills<00:02:04.770> than<00:02:04.829> almost<00:02:05.070> everyone

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
steals more kills than almost everyone

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980 
steals more kills than almost everyone

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
separates your support style from like

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.669 
separates your support style from like
someone<00:02:09.420> else<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> play<00:02:09.810> support<00:02:10.170> there's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
someone else you play support there's

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.140 
someone else you play support there's
this<00:02:10.860> different<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.459> support<00:02:11.879> Styles

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
this different like support Styles

this different like support Styles
aggressive<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.989> then<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:13.470> like<00:02:13.620> passive

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
aggressive and then there's like passive

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.440 
aggressive and then there's like passive
dentists<00:02:14.340> people<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.730> always<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.120> into<00:02:15.330> two

long then you tower at the other side of
the<00:04:33.310> map<00:04:33.460> might<00:04:33.639> go<00:04:33.789> down<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.629> all<00:04:34.840> just

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
the map might go down it's all just

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.749

reacting on what to do and 2v1 is a lot

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.939 
reacting on what to do and 2v1 is a lot
more<00:04:36.909> reactive<00:04:37.419> then<00:04:38.020> that's<00:04:38.229> tail<00:04:38.469> to<00:04:38.680> be<00:04:38.800> two

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
more reactive then that's tail to be two

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.980 
more reactive then that's tail to be two
lanes<00:04:39.099> that's<00:04:39.490> why<00:04:39.639> there's<00:04:39.879> so<00:04:40.090> much<00:04:40.240> room
