00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello everyone with you Lera and today I 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.220
 talk about ships yes yes here he is 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.599
 sensational creations by other game only 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.519
 out in closed beta test 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.740
 it means that thousands and thousands of new 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.049
 players do not take the first steps 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 but I will not delay, unlike 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.130
 tanks where most of the calculations 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.590
 aiming makes the player very much 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.090
 greatly helps automatic sight 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.560
 it's strange without shooting sometimes 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.510
 is up to 20 kilometers 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.150
 define exactly from this angle the goal 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.430
 just impossible in this helps us 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.410
 automatic sight yes yes the same 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.450
 white sight above the ship on the right 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.160
 but I shot the ship on the left exactly 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.739
 automatic sight adjusted 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.780
 shells highlighted the ship sight almost 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 always taken automatically but if you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.860
 need to look any goal for this 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 use the default x key for 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.449
 visibility i made a sound in enemy 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.460
 aircraft carrier with and without and as a result 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.480
 the second hall flew much farther 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.579
 don't forget possesses i think you are already in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.469
 course that on every ship in the game there 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.660
 a lot of guns that are controlled 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.159
 automatically but for more efficient 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.530
 use you can set 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.180
 priority targets for attack for example with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.030
 canned all such a ticker 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.400
 quinsy the calling port just holding 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 control and clicking on the desired target is not 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.460
 underestimate the refueling 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.049
 just as you can put priority 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 for air defense weapons 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.130
 take aim for example the most dangerous 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.439
 torpedo webasto concentrate 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.719
 your strength to the bottom spout drawer shoot 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.310
 if you're on a battleship with a good right 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:37.079
 believe she will just not trust well 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.360
 now for lovers beautiful 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.520
 hold down the middle mouse button and instead 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.009
 simple shot our camera follows 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.420
 a shell agree much more convenient 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.450
 watch where your shells fly 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.060
 especially for sighting shots well 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.280
 and if you already shot trouble press z and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.140
 We look where all your hall leave by the way 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.310
 it even works with torpedoes and sometimes 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.909
 you can conveniently see 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.369
 will be lazy still distracted from the enemy 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.289
 but now a little utility for mother 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.000
 commander unlike tanks even in 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.629
 sniper mode holding the right button 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.399
 mice 

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:11.400
 our camera is back to normal 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.260
 the position also blocks 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.280
 fish movement 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.379
 thanks to this you can fully 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.160
 look do not go either we do not measure 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.670
 distracting from 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.790
 do not forget this you will avoid a lot 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.260
 ally critics 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.239
 I would also like to tell in known 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.190
 feature for tankers such as tagging 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.290
 the purpose of my surprise is the key to this 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.060
 the function is not a plan assigned therefore if 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.099
 you play in the squad set convenient 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.709
 key to more dedicate themselves to the allies 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.709
 and when you click all links with the target 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.630
 agree it is convenient 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.460
 aircraft carriers video I better do 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.190
 separate video but still the case 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.620
 few moments holding shift you can 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.420
 select multiple control squadrons 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.220
 will quickly select the next 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.440
 Karelia is not distracted by trifles 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.750
 but if you need to quickly select all 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.440
 looking for believe in the air bold stuff 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.840
 contra na 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.270
 do you remember get away from cross attack 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.900
 torpedo is much more difficult than 2 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.760
 single 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.340
 so try to coordinate your 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.200
 actions action of their squadrons 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.420
 right but if you are already enough 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.180
 an experienced player can attack came 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.720
 To do this, hold down alt and set the point 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.240
 reset 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.900
 torpedoes and lebon and then everything is old 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.190
 I have a scheme for this all remember that 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.200
 Fnaf skill game first 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.630
 is that we consider everything 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.850
 even the smallest details, use 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.240
 the benefits of all this and 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.870
 to develop into a common more profitable apartment 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.760
 the next issue I will try 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.200
 tell about the types of shells them 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.480
 application so do not forget 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.920
 subscribe to the channel with you was hatch 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.920
 good luck in battles now 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.310
 about life
