00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.809
 if we have josé luis martínez university professor of salamanca 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.139
 expert in neuropsychology 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.680
 efe is clear is ecology and that neuropsychology normalizes inc good 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.060
 it is the science that studies 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.019
 but the processes of the human mind 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.130
 say that how the brain works 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.980
 the whole brain in force after being here as a chopped support 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.500
 in the behaviors of human beings as we think and so on 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.800
 inter and ford dedela psychology 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.210
 go against the brain 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.110
 appears a new discipline that is neuromarketing what is the application of 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.770
 that knowledge that we are alien to the human being 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.900
 ap the processes that enter the world marketing 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.500
 and how the people 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.940
 they perceive information as they analyze how to make their decisions 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.190
 tolo that would affect the purchase purchase 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.819
 that kind of knowledge 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.190
 can they somehow 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.160
 help 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.670
 that is to say to know better the future this 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.760
 of the person 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.200
 shopping bouquets 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.400
 it is the tequio bought this they form it voluntarily opposed to the one I bought a 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.860
 obviously good way and patience the purchase go a lot of phenomena 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.120
 very complex 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.090
 and from one of the issues that is currently 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.610
 p work is expected before within the euro area if it takes the neuromarketing 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.549
 this end 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.330
 like that does not excuse buying 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.280
 certainly we have made decisions the rational way 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.610
 apparently or we can make decisions in emotional ways let's say 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.300
 this second more complex part reported that emotions are complex 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.090
 but that even though he made the decisions part of the emotions 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.550
 divine studies say what 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.240
 per cent we are not so conscious or that we carry 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.990
 decisions are made by the brain before we have 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.740
 Awareness of it is as if you make decisions and I inform you of 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.770
 decisions that have taken touched touched know all this 3 a subject 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.460
 It seems fascinating to 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.890
 We wanted to know your marketing processes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.260
 and then of the companies nowadays before this of not authorizing this type of 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.449
 neuromarketing techniques 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:17.729
 good indeed is the market let's say your market very big knowledge 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:18.529
 about this 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:22.750
 but successfully failed ad campaigns 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.079
 one kind things 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.189
 will depend a lot on what we have more complex processes 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.499
 remove those decisions and within those decisions including that they are the 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.430
 the attention and then also by the in the reaction 11 if the flight min 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.929
 the basic representations 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.929
 because the attention is first as 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.379
 we stand before the information 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.860
 without dams tension the information is useless for as much as the first success 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.159
 before the information that they capacit in the information d adt iván and attention 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.879
 Oh no 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.519
 and then the emotional reactions thing to have before the sentence pray what for it 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.839
 those potato tens 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.359
 and that's where 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.439
 let's also made decisions 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.029
 said this just the crime of a second part 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.739
 the first chaste 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.250
 the increase goes zion 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.470
 I fixed the aralon information foral I made decisions to repurchase and those 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.819
 decisions he made 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.939
 may be linked 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.279
 let's deepen a rational 0 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:26.440
 January 11 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.249
 - the central for example 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:33.029
 there are studies that lived what in my film negative information 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.799
 that we perceive 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.759
 the process plus the left hemisphere right forgiveness 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:42.049
 while non-positive filtering 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.930
 activity let's say the processed left mast and that can not be 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.669
 determinant to know how we are emotionally before the iata information 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.680
 make decisions and do not go is a web development company 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.669
 discouraging irving standards techniques 6 in this way TV is what 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.900
 we pretend is that people can consciously and unconsciously reach 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.060
 to make decisions 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.590
 so you really laugh more at the contact forms that deal for 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.099
 hundred companies are really aware of all the benefits that 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.099
 this contribute the story neuromarketing 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.709
 It's not easy to answer that question and I think it's all that 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.739
 to know 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.330
 how the human mind works is always a plus a benefit 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.890
 for anyone 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.090
 try to ask that they work that world in because people make decisions already 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.840
 be eternal peace page 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.340
 to navigate through the network 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.110
 ccoo to be placed within this one answered the markets 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.110
 therefore everything that is contribution of the neurosciences 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.840
 You can be welcomed by 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.699
 the companies because 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.069
 maybe so far sometimes I played a lot with that pain 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.229
 desire to face if this works 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.280
 I am going to try 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.719
 That does not work 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:59.730
 but out with knowledge base now nor andrade more cautious point 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.610
 it will be better 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.699
 how not 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.020
 let's say a caste energies 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.460
 in what does not work 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.529
 while exports with being very important 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.139
 very well so thank you very much for hour 100 allocate from last night to 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.020
 salamanca 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.050
 and it will bring the press to the coast. There were many thanks to all
