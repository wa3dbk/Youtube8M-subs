year-round not just 2 to 3 months would
usually<00:01:40.770> keep<00:01:40.950> our<00:01:41.100> crop<00:01:41.400> around<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.299> year<00:01:42.570> or

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
usually keep our crop around a year or

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.350 
usually keep our crop around a year or
so<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.500> we'll<00:01:43.710> replant<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.430> keep<00:01:44.970> going

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so and then we'll replant and keep going

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
so and then we'll replant and keep going
sometimes<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> plant<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:46.829> tell<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.189> about

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
sometimes the plant will tell you about

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.940 
sometimes the plant will tell you about
how<00:01:47.970> much<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.299> producing<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:49.770> we're
