00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
let's say there's applications that i

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.730 
let's say there's applications that i
may<00:05:13.910> have<00:05:14.000> downloaded<00:05:14.570> that<00:05:14.660> decide<00:05:15.020> i<00:05:15.530> don't

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
may have downloaded that decide i don't

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.330 
may have downloaded that decide i don't
really<00:05:16.070> use<00:05:16.340> so<00:05:16.580> much<00:05:16.730> um<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:18.190> actually<00:05:19.190> once
