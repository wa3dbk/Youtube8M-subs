00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.319 
we got GTA 5 for Xbox one and
PlayStation<00:01:01.260> 4<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:02.370> long<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.969> download

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
PlayStation 4 how long that download

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.210 
PlayStation 4 how long that download
took<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.660> think<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.229> 50<00:01:04.650> gigabytes

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
took I think it was like 50 gigabytes

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.030 
took I think it was like 50 gigabytes
think<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.270> 15<00:01:07.020> more<00:01:07.290> gigabytes<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> space

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
think about 15 more gigabytes of space

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.670 
think about 15 more gigabytes of space
more<00:01:08.549> than<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.840> took<00:01:10.049> me<00:01:10.170> about<00:01:10.380> an

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
more than that so it took me about an

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130 
more than that so it took me about an
hour<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> half<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:11.820> hours<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.479> GTA<00:01:12.869> 5

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
hour and a half two hours to get GTA 5

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.980 
hour and a half two hours to get GTA 5
on<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.380> xbox<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.360> my<00:01:15.360> computer's<00:01:15.780> pretty

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
on my xbox one and my computer's pretty

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.270 
on my xbox one and my computer's pretty
fast<00:01:16.170> my<00:01:16.320> Internet's<00:01:16.710> pretty<00:01:16.890> fast<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
fast my Internet's pretty fast and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160 
fast my Internet's pretty fast and
everything<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.780> thinking<00:01:19.080> like

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
everything so I'm just thinking like

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.530 
everything so I'm just thinking like
hour<00:01:19.500> 2<00:01:19.890> hours<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:20.520> depending<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.420> your

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
computer speed it might take you 4 or 5

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
computer speed it might take you 4 or 5
hours<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.659> depends<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.140> know

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
hours and it just really depends I know
