00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 april a German expects us 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.790
 Family fantasy adventure in the cinemas 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.589
 at which the ghostbusters performed 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.910
 casper meet and we throw in the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.710
 look at the first trailer too 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.070
 Ghost hunters on icy track 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.240
 hidden in the underground operates one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.490
 top secret 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.750
 Listen to a professional ghost hunter 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.160
 which protects us from evil forces 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.390
 many of these spirits are in advance 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.230
 Some people are less likely to see something 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.230
 one says in such a situation 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.050
 eerie ghost that is perhaps 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.050
 only mediocre 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.019
 you want here 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.019
 They thought they needed our help 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.600
 a haunted house is not a place for one 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.600
 eleven-year-old child 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:16.159
 the liquid is top secret I know 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.090
 do not leave factory 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:26.670
 somewhere in the city has something very 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:28.439
 powerful nestling and greeting we have 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.000
 job or can I do with please 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.000
 the escort driver 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.010
 What the best friend had felt 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.010
 you are not really my type 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.200
 all for a beautiful side 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.270
 rest can know 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.270
 they never do no 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.090
 bake lidia peis 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:15.730
 we have to reconnect to that 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:17.319
 love scary movie a ghost you 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.730
 have said yes and thus a reference 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.200
 to Die Hard is somehow bizarre 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.090
 but also a bit sweet and I like 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.170
 find the trailer the dark moments 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.819
 I'm very cool , of course, very much 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.349
 valued for the german film but 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.970
 as well as be ghost hunter on 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.500
 icy track brings us warner bros 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.019
 expected from the second april 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.790
 2015 in German cinemas and tells 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.930
 the story of tom yes tom that has it 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.580
 not easy in the life of the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.590
 the whole world thinks it is a scaredy tale 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.940
 and that even as he one day the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.280
 made acquaintance with true at the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.959
 rather mediocre eerie ghost 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.430
 and the problem is hugo had to be 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.900
 Castle left because expelled there 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.000
 has been from another ghost 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.160
 only has seven days to return 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.140
 he dissolves in the air and wants that 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.700
 of course Hugo and Tom as new friends 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.530
 somehow help prevent them from getting help 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.519
 played by a ghost hunter 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.989
 by anke enke 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.370
 the problem is that unemployed the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.110
 I do not like kids and certainly not kids 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.330
 ghost so chaos is like this 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.920
 little perfect and the whole box 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.510
 Family comedy would be for big and small 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.010
 where you just dumb the little ones 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.480
 and say look at that and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.070
 especially on joints always proves 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.810
 a good sense of german stripes 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.370
 on which topics she participated that 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.959
 I believe that the movie is so much 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.090
 if you can just for this genre 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.470
 Can interest and family movies 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.660
 Germany is always running well too 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.220
 in the cinemas say little I have made 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.450
 not the teaser to ghost hunters 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.590
 I really think about the trailer 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.690
 actually made really sweet of course 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.579
 covered and child-friendly but so should 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.840
 they are also in the end and that's why 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.700
 I wonder what the film because then 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.049
 really can have something from 2 april 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.549
 her for this trailer I know her 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.930
 Do not be the primary target group though 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.010
 can you understand what I'm saying that 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.049
 I like to know in the comments 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.000
 For I am now ready to load like a 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.889
 perm this video did let it 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.150
 otherwise it will not stay that way 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.769
 There are still a few left around me 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.930
 around and tomorrow 15 clock of course 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.250
 at the latest a new video and until then 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.560
 I hope to stay here again for weeks 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.560
 of course at 3
