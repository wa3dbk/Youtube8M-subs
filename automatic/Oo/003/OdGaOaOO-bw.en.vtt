I<00:00:09.870> think<00:00:10.590> these<00:00:10.710> techniques<00:00:11.160> would<00:00:11.309> work<00:00:11.519> well

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
I think these techniques would work well

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.150 
I think these techniques would work well

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.980 
talk about well let me show you a couple
of<00:00:23.220> positions<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:23.970> let<00:00:24.150> me<00:00:24.240> put<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> camera

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
of positions here let me put the camera

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.750 
of positions here let me put the camera
down<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.350> little<00:00:25.590> bit<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.580> what

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
down a little bit so you can see what

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.060 
down a little bit so you can see what
I'm<00:00:26.849> doing<00:00:27.109> all<00:00:28.109> right<00:00:28.170> let's<00:00:28.470> take<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
I'm doing all right let's take like a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.549 
I'm doing all right let's take like a
basic<00:00:30.230> three<00:00:31.230> chord<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> c<00:00:32.369> e<00:00:33.410> on<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
basic three chord this is a c e on the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.810 
basic three chord this is a c e on the
high<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.100> makes<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> three<00:00:36.380> now<00:00:37.820> hand

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
high so that makes it a three now hand

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.240 
high so that makes it a three now hand
position<00:00:39.390> let's<00:00:39.660> look<00:00:39.809> at<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> thumb<00:00:40.260> my

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
position let's look at the thumb my

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.160 
position let's look at the thumb my
thumb<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.910> directly<00:00:42.450> behind<00:00:43.160> my<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.460> finger

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
thumb is directly behind my first finger

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
thumb is directly behind my first finger
that's<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.350> important<00:00:46.800> position<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.910> this

that's an important position for this

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580 
that's an important position for this
chord<00:00:48.300> because<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> gives<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
chord because that gives you that that

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.869 
chord because that gives you that that
pinch<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.030> strength<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.690> hold<00:00:52.579> those<00:00:53.579> two

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
pinch and the strength to hold those two
