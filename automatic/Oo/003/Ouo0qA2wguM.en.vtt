pellets from testing for accuracy this
was<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.780> 10<00:03:20.019> yards<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:22.030> crosman<00:03:22.480> hollow<00:03:22.660> point

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
was it 10 yards the crosman hollow point

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.339 
was it 10 yards the crosman hollow point
quite<00:03:24.430> happy<00:03:24.819> with<00:03:24.849> that<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.690> touch<00:03:25.959> Ingham

one just to one side the superdome
pellet<00:03:31.379> bit<00:03:32.379> of<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.620> wide<00:03:33.190> open<00:03:33.599> cloverleaf

pellet bit of a wide open cloverleaf

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.780 
pellet bit of a wide open cloverleaf
almost<00:03:35.640> what<00:03:36.640> surprised<00:03:37.060> me<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:38.549> super<00:03:39.549> point

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
almost what surprised me the super point

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.870 
almost what surprised me the super point
pellets<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.599> RDS<00:03:41.110> super<00:03:41.530> point<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.099> it's

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
pellets the RDS super point and I it's

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.850 
pellets the RDS super point and I it's
very<00:03:43.150> rare<00:03:43.390> or<00:03:43.540> user<00:03:43.780> pointed<00:03:44.319> pellets<00:03:44.500> I

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
very rare or user pointed pellets I

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.520 
very rare or user pointed pellets I
don't<00:03:45.130> even<00:03:45.250> look<00:03:45.459> at<00:03:45.610> them<00:03:45.730> normally<00:03:46.530> that

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
don't even look at them normally that

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.699 
don't even look at them normally that
produced<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.130> really<00:03:48.370> good<00:03:48.579> group<00:03:49.530> ragged<00:03:50.530> one

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
produced a really good group ragged one

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.509 
produced a really good group ragged one
whole<00:03:50.920> group<00:03:51.340> I'm<00:03:51.610> quite<00:03:52.269> pleased<00:03:52.510> with<00:03:52.780> that

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
and the gamo ball that was quite widely

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.339 
and the gamo ball that was quite widely
scattered<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.879> I'm<00:03:58.599> not<00:03:58.750> surprised<00:03:59.140> with

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
scattered and I'm not surprised with

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.789

that<00:03:59.470> really<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:00.900> one<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:01.989> my<00:04:02.079> favorites<00:04:02.650> at

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
that really and one of my favorites at

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.740 
that really and one of my favorites at
the<00:04:02.890> moment<00:04:03.360> what<00:04:04.360> I<00:04:04.390> use<00:04:04.690> quite<00:04:04.900> often<00:04:05.170> as<00:04:05.530> jsb

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
the moment what I use quite often as jsb

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.660 
the moment what I use quite often as jsb
that<00:04:07.750> was<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.959> bit<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.829> a<00:04:08.950> rugged<00:04:09.310> one<00:04:09.489> all

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
that was a bit of a rugged one all

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.330 
that was a bit of a rugged one all
cloverleaf<00:04:10.629> almost<00:04:11.110> I'm<00:04:11.440> quite<00:04:11.769> pleased<00:04:12.069> with

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
cloverleaf almost I'm quite pleased with

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.830 
cloverleaf almost I'm quite pleased with
that<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.620> then<00:04:14.739> I'll<00:04:14.859> move<00:04:15.040> date<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.639> 15<00:04:16.329> yards

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
that and then I'll move date to 15 yards

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.960 
that and then I'll move date to 15 yards
and<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:20.079> crosman<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:21.400> produced<00:04:21.820> a

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
and the crosman that produced a

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
and the crosman that produced a
reasonably<00:04:22.419> good<00:04:22.450> group<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:25.090> superdome<00:04:25.720> that

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
reasonably good group the superdome that

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.659 
reasonably good group the superdome that
seemed<00:04:26.289> to<00:04:26.380> tighten<00:04:26.770> up<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.950> little<00:04:26.979> bit<00:04:27.370> and

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
seemed to tighten up a little bit and

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.850 
seemed to tighten up a little bit and
that<00:04:27.970> was<00:04:28.120> quite<00:04:28.300> good<00:04:29.550> super<00:04:30.550> point<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:32.380> RWS

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
that was quite good super point the RWS

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.320 
that was quite good super point the RWS
super<00:04:33.220> point<00:04:33.490> was<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:34.060> large<00:04:34.360> one<00:04:34.660> whole<00:04:36.330> bit

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
super point was a large one whole bit

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.620 
super point was a large one whole bit
elongated<00:04:37.660> alright<00:04:38.620> so<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.190> bit<00:04:40.090> wide<00:04:40.330> for

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
elongated alright so it's a bit wide for

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.510 
elongated alright so it's a bit wide for
a<00:04:40.660> one<00:04:40.840> old<00:04:41.050> but<00:04:41.289> it<00:04:41.410> still<00:04:41.590> quite<00:04:42.220> happy<00:04:42.490> with

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
a one old but it still quite happy with

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.140 
a one old but it still quite happy with
that<00:04:42.700> result<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:44.560> jsb<00:04:44.950> that<00:04:45.639> gave<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> good

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
that result the jsb that gave a good

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.409 
that result the jsb that gave a good
results<00:04:46.660> as<00:04:46.810> well<00:04:46.840> quite<00:04:47.590> happy<00:04:47.919> with<00:04:47.950> that

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
results as well quite happy with that

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:55.080 
results as well quite happy with that
and<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:51.310> gamo<00:04:51.520> ball<00:04:51.910> um<00:04:53.490> I've<00:04:54.490> got<00:04:54.550> one<00:04:54.849> there

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
and the gamo ball um I've got one there

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.990 
and the gamo ball um I've got one there
and<00:04:56.020> I've<00:04:56.139> got<00:04:56.169> one<00:04:56.530> then<00:04:56.800> I'm<00:04:57.099> not<00:04:57.700> quite<00:04:57.970> sure

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
and I've got one then I'm not quite sure

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.770 
and I've got one then I'm not quite sure
where<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:58.539> other<00:04:58.720> one<00:04:58.750> wins<00:05:00.510> just<00:05:01.510> trying<00:05:01.750> to

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
where the other one wins just trying to

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.010 
where the other one wins just trying to
see<00:05:02.020> if<00:05:02.110> I<00:05:02.169> can<00:05:02.349> find<00:05:02.530> another<00:05:02.740> hole<00:05:03.460> ah<00:05:04.020> there

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
see if I can find another hole ah there

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.180 
see if I can find another hole ah there
it<00:05:05.169> is<00:05:05.349> it<00:05:06.310> actually<00:05:06.460> hit<00:05:06.789> the<00:05:06.820> ball<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
it is it actually hit the ball so the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.159 
it is it actually hit the ball so the
distance<00:05:09.370> between<00:05:09.729> them<00:05:10.270> I'm<00:05:10.479> not<00:05:10.780> very<00:05:10.930> happy

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
distance between them I'm not very happy

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.550 
distance between them I'm not very happy
about<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:13.450> obviously<00:05:13.660> is<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.110> mistake

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
about and that obviously is a mistake

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.200 
about and that obviously is a mistake
because<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.950> shouldn't<00:05:15.190> have<00:05:15.370> hit<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.639> center

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
because it shouldn't have hit the center

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.589 
because it shouldn't have hit the center
but<00:05:17.200> it's<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.410> only<00:05:17.440> one<00:05:17.800> that's<00:05:18.490> a<00:05:18.880> very

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
but it's the only one that's a very

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.780 
but it's the only one that's a very
clean<00:05:20.250> bullseye<00:05:21.250> kill<00:05:21.700> spot

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
clean bullseye kill spot

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.030 
clean bullseye kill spot
the<00:05:22.850> moment<00:05:23.300> but<00:05:24.230> I'm<00:05:24.320> not<00:05:24.470> very<00:05:24.590> impressed

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
the moment but I'm not very impressed

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.810 
the moment but I'm not very impressed
with<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.280> gumbo<00:05:25.580> ball<00:05:27.100> and<00:05:28.100> then<00:05:28.280> I<00:05:28.340> moved<00:05:28.610> out

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
with the gumbo ball and then I moved out

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.310 
with the gumbo ball and then I moved out
to<00:05:28.940> 20<00:05:29.330> yards<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:34.100> crosman<00:05:34.550> hollow<00:05:34.730> point

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
to 20 yards and the crosman hollow point

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.850 
to 20 yards and the crosman hollow point
quite<00:05:36.320> an<00:05:36.500> open<00:05:36.860> group<00:05:37.070> there<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:39.470> super

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
quite an open group there the super

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.180 
quite an open group there the super
field<00:05:42.280> three<00:05:43.280> separate<00:05:44.030> holes<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:45.770> grouping

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
field three separate holes the grouping

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.750 
field three separate holes the grouping
isn't<00:05:46.460> too<00:05:46.820> bad<00:05:47.120> for<00:05:47.570> distance<00:05:48.020> apart<00:05:48.760> but

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
isn't too bad for distance apart but

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.810
