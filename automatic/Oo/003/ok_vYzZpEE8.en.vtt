that no prophecy of Scripture is a

Spirit<00:00:35.969> spoke<00:00:36.480> from<00:00:37.170> God<00:00:38.450> they<00:00:39.450> claimed<00:00:39.750> these

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
Spirit spoke from God they claimed these

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.560 
Spirit spoke from God they claimed these
are<00:00:40.020> God's<00:00:40.290> words<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.010> theirs<00:00:41.570> that's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
are God's words and not theirs that's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.549 
are God's words and not theirs that's

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
why these prophecies were fulfilled

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.750 
why these prophecies were fulfilled
hundreds<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:46.890> thousands<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.700> years

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
hundreds or thousands of years

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.790 
hundreds or thousands of years
afterwards<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:48.989> why<00:00:49.170> they<00:00:49.289> used<00:00:49.469> phrases

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
afterwards that's why they used phrases

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.850 
afterwards that's why they used phrases
like<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.340> thus<00:00:50.879> says<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.390> Lord<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.559> Lord

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
like and thus says the Lord and the Lord

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.479 
like and thus says the Lord and the Lord
spoke<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.610> Moses<00:00:54.000> saying<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.719> God<00:00:55.320> said<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
spoke to Moses saying and God said to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
spoke to Moses saying and God said to
Abraham<00:00:56.690> they<00:00:57.690> say<00:00:57.930> these<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.170> God's<00:00:58.590> words

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
Abraham they say these are God's words

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.529 
Abraham they say these are God's words
and<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.460> men's<00:00:59.789> words<00:01:00.120> oh<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.719> hear<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:02.539> but

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and not men's words oh I hear you but

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
and not men's words oh I hear you but
see<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> problem<00:01:04.199> nobody<00:01:05.100> wants<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
see that's the problem nobody wants to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280 
see that's the problem nobody wants to
believe<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> men

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
believe that because they know that men

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800 
believe that because they know that men
who<00:01:07.530> wrote<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.010> Bible<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.479> say<00:01:09.659> it's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
who wrote the Bible and when we say it's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.060 
who wrote the Bible and when we say it's
the<00:01:09.900> Word<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> God<00:01:10.200> they<00:01:10.590> said<00:01:10.740> oh<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the Word of God they said oh it's the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
word of men because men took from the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
word of men because men took from the
paper<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.500> cannot<00:01:13.710> trust<00:01:14.130> things<00:01:14.790> that

you<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.700> math<00:01:20.909> class<00:01:20.960> well<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.170> got

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you know in my math class well you got

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
you know in my math class well you got
something<00:01:22.710> wrong<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.909> supposed

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
something wrong you know you're supposed

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670 
something wrong you know you're supposed
to<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> Pythagorean<00:01:25.049> theorem<00:01:25.290> there<00:01:25.560> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to use the Pythagorean theorem there you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.780 
to use the Pythagorean theorem there you
know<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> squared<00:01:26.340> plus<00:01:26.400> B<00:01:26.759> squared

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
know that a squared plus B squared

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
know that a squared plus B squared
equals<00:01:27.060> C<00:01:27.270> squared<00:01:27.390> thing<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.159> you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
equals C squared thing you know you

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.560 
equals C squared thing you know you
didn't<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.460> Pythagorean<00:01:30.030> theorem<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
didn't use Pythagorean theorem there you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.420 
didn't use Pythagorean theorem there you
got<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.869> wrong<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.320> can't<00:01:31.560> mark<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.070> off<00:01:32.220> for

you<00:04:33.899> don't<00:04:34.169> use<00:04:34.559> the<00:04:35.039> scientific<00:04:35.429> method

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
you don't use the scientific method

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.479 
you don't use the scientific method
there<00:04:36.239> you<00:04:36.959> have<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.289> use<00:04:37.499> a<00:04:37.529> more<00:04:37.829> evidentiary

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:38.489 
there you have to use a more evidentiary

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:41.149 
there you have to use a more evidentiary
method<00:04:38.969> there<00:04:39.149> so<00:04:40.019> what<00:04:40.229> you<00:04:40.259> do<00:04:40.589> is<00:04:40.799> like<00:04:41.009> what
