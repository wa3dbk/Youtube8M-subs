piece you want to put that back in there
scroll<00:03:19.390> all<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.630> way<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.930> bottom<00:03:20.140> that

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
scroll all the way to the bottom that

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.740 
scroll all the way to the bottom that
way<00:03:21.160> when<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.400> pour<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.730> wax<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.209> it'll

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
way when you pour the wax in it'll

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.600 
way when you pour the wax in it'll
basically<00:03:22.900> mold<00:03:23.350> with<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:24.340> don't<00:03:24.459> want

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
basically mold with that you don't want

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.920 
basically mold with that you don't want
to<00:03:24.640> get<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.940> very<00:03:25.120> very<00:03:25.300> top<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.750> don't

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.540 
to get it the very very top you don't
work<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.810> just<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.890> your<00:03:30.070> wax<00:03:30.310> won't

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
work and this is just so your wax won't

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.050 
work and this is just so your wax won't
melt<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:30.940> your<00:03:30.970> pocket<00:03:31.360> or<00:03:31.450> whatever<00:03:33.060> that's
