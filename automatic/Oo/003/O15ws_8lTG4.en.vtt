00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hey, guys, beauty, I'm here to record. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.150
 another video that this time from being a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.490
 video of my next poll 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.349
 campaign is I did the video voting 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.059
 past and if you remember to see 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 what campaign you play did not have 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 all these options here were proud 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.900
 champion in guaratinguetá and hung up 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 and the vote was very close to handball 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.710
 games won but it was with a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.930
 very small difference in votes and me 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.279
 deceit had 40% of votes to great 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 champion in 51% herd of 1 18% - there ô ô 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.050
 ô ô it is played it was the least voted 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.750
 with the vote was very tight then 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.270
 Please , please - you did not vote for the river. 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.460
 by majority decision then it is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.239
 therefore the vote is more 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.640
 I watched the campaign also maybe not 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 I do not know what someone can do 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 Sometimes I will not speak, I will not see it. 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.340
 because that's not what I chose, please 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.079
 but that's quite is is a game 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.309
 interesting that it will not take long and 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.320
 I'm sure most think so. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.949
 but I 'm just saying and it's also saying 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 so on the campaign is I want 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.030
 now choose a vote as I said 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.799
 last time you voted 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 choose the faction that I'm going to play right 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.250
 then the map of the Portuguese kingdom is this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.159
 as you see here is because love 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.900
 them and here we have cartago where 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 the first faction and the first option here 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.420
 for you choose is also that this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.159
 campaign of aníbal cavaco silva hu uma 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.140
 faction a nation historically 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.210
 which threatened much as it is 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.579
 in the second Punic war 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.049
 after the battle of reeds he did not 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.549
 You know until now why friend notes with 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.500
 Romulus was something truly one of the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.020
 mysteries and Itaguaí one of the options 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.850
 strong factions there for the dispute in 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.720
 ours but also pomegranate that many of 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.119
 You asked for a campaign with pomegranate. 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.390
 so much so that in the first vote it was soon 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.740
 released as it came in second place in 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.360
 Spain that ended up winning now 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.990
 who also wants to have the chance to 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.479
 to choose is that a campaign like here 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.090
 with you, you see that Rome was the market 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.500
 were the two main characters of the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.119
 second Punic war you can 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.039
 choose roma also to play with a 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.180
 faction very strong there that I liked a lot 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.890
 when I played 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.590
 in Rome and off it's only for me because 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.180
 some videos too but there the roma option 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.980
 then you win accuses a faction 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.620
 It starts very small here in that 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.540
 island of sicily and you can choose 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.159
 also to play a Greek faction 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.829
 no faction very interesting 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.549
 crew to choose if it was off 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.790
 that in this conflict 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.310
 we also have the luzitani which is a 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.280
 a faction that lived in portugal 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.019
 as you see here that you have to the one 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.239
 territory only begins a barbarian tribe 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.069
 in case you too can choose 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.349
 who will play and we also have the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.849
 that if the other Iberian tribe that 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.189
 You can choose to play another game. 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.230
 barbarian tribe where it begins there near 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.579
 and must have a challenge 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.010
 interesting as well as the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.049
 Lusitano, that's it, folks. 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.730
 chose very well because this is going to be 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.709
 the next main channel series with 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.540
 sure do not worry about the months there 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.459
 although the winning objectives are 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.540
 It is smaller but this will be the next 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.519
 campaign 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.980
 so that's where you chose, well chose 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.939
 I wisely hope you guys think it through. 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.189
 at the time of voting and that they liked 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.500
