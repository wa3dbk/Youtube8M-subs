but two tips and what you should do so
that<00:00:40.159> way<00:00:40.309> I<00:00:40.550> did<00:00:41.479> it<00:00:41.569> in<00:00:41.780> five<00:00:42.199> hours<00:00:42.469> but<00:00:42.949> I

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
that way I did it in five hours but I

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.219 
that way I did it in five hours but I
feel<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.609> if<00:00:43.819> I<00:00:44.030> knew<00:00:44.300> what<00:00:44.539> I<00:00:44.569> was<00:00:44.719> doing<00:00:45.050> I

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
feel like if I knew what I was doing I

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.349 
feel like if I knew what I was doing I
would<00:00:45.379> take<00:00:45.649> three<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.429> a<00:00:46.519> half<00:00:46.729> that<00:00:47.030> kind<00:00:47.300> of

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
would take three and a half that kind of

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.809 
would take three and a half that kind of
you<00:00:47.809> know<00:00:47.899> I<00:00:48.109> hope<00:00:48.859> that<00:00:48.889> you<00:00:49.219> really<00:00:49.519> like

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
you are going to try it then definitely

you are going to try it then definitely
do<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:56.019> recommend<00:00:57.019> at<00:00:57.289> least<00:00:57.530> two<00:00:57.889> to<00:00:58.039> three

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
do I recommend at least two to three

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.709 
do I recommend at least two to three
different<00:00:58.489> paints<00:00:59.059> in<00:00:59.179> the<00:00:59.269> same<00:00:59.420> color

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
different paints in the same color

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.959 
different paints in the same color
family<00:00:59.929> so<00:01:00.319> that<00:01:00.350> they<00:01:00.559> blend<00:01:00.829> well<00:01:01.159> what<00:01:01.850> we

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
family so that they blend well what we

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.840 
family so that they blend well what we
first<00:01:02.269> did<00:01:02.510> was<00:01:02.809> mask<00:01:03.409> off<00:01:03.769> everything<00:01:04.309> like

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
first did was mask off everything like

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.510 
first did was mask off everything like
the<00:01:05.030> edges<00:01:05.479> of<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.049> door<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.770> wall<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.310> crown

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
the edges of the door the wall the crown

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.640 
the edges of the door the wall the crown
molding<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.180> baseboard<00:01:08.780> that<00:01:09.290> way<00:01:09.440> it's

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
molding and the baseboard that way it's

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.920 
molding and the baseboard that way it's
a<00:01:09.740> cleaner<00:01:10.040> paint<00:01:10.460> job<00:01:10.760> we<00:01:11.450> started<00:01:11.480> with

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
a cleaner paint job we started with

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.050 
a cleaner paint job we started with
white<00:01:12.200> first<00:01:12.560> because<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:13.100> decide<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.850> it

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
white first because I decide to have it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.570 
white first because I decide to have it
go<00:01:14.420> from<00:01:14.660> light<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.170> dark<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.770> even<00:01:16.490> though

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
go from light to dark and even though

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.880 
go from light to dark and even though
it's<00:01:16.730> white<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:16.910> why<00:01:17.120> I<00:01:17.150> know<00:01:17.530> basically<00:01:18.530> what

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
it's white and why I know basically what

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.950 
it's white and why I know basically what
you<00:01:19.400> really<00:01:19.700> need<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.120> know<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:20.690> really

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
you really need to know and it's really

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.930 
you really need to know and it's really
important<00:01:21.500> is<00:01:21.650> that<00:01:21.710> when<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.400> try<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.670> blend

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
important is that when you try to blend

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.050 
important is that when you try to blend
into<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.570> next<00:01:23.840> color<00:01:24.050> if<00:01:24.410> your<00:01:25.160> first<00:01:25.910> color

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
into the next color if your first color

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.760 
into the next color if your first color
is<00:01:26.210> white<00:01:26.420> like<00:01:26.630> me<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.290> second<00:01:27.560> color

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
is white like me and the second color

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.810 
is white like me and the second color
like<00:01:28.430> me<00:01:28.640> sorry<00:01:29.170> white<00:01:30.170> like<00:01:30.410> my<00:01:30.730> lecture<00:01:31.730> the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
like me sorry white like my lecture the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.970 
like me sorry white like my lecture the
second<00:01:32.180> color<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.860> dramatically<00:01:33.860> different

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
second color is dramatically different

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.210 
second color is dramatically different
then<00:01:34.940> what<00:01:35.180> we<00:01:35.300> try<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.600> do<00:01:35.810> was<00:01:36.440> mix<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.070> two

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
then what we try to do was mix the two

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.890 
then what we try to do was mix the two
colors<00:01:37.370> together<00:01:37.730> because<00:01:38.300> we<00:01:38.420> thought<00:01:38.540> okay

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
colors together because we thought okay

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.510 
colors together because we thought okay
that<00:01:39.140> will<00:01:39.260> create<00:01:39.470> a<00:01:39.680> middle<00:01:39.980> color<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.430> that

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
that will create a middle color and that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.940 
that will create a middle color and that
will<00:01:40.700> be<00:01:40.880> great<00:01:41.300> for<00:01:41.570> blending<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:42.470> what<00:01:42.710> you

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
will be great for blending but what you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.490 
will be great for blending but what you
really<00:01:42.980> need<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.850> have<00:01:44.570> before<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:45.110> do<00:01:45.350> that

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
really need to have before you do that

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.850 
really need to have before you do that
is<00:01:45.740> if<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:46.700> want<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.060> mix<00:01:47.420> your<00:01:47.870> colors<00:01:48.350> to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
is if you want to mix your colors to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.280 
is if you want to mix your colors to
create<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:49.190> third<00:01:49.670> or<00:01:50.000> fourth<00:01:50.030> color<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:51.050> blend

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
create a third or fourth color to blend

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.649 
create a third or fourth color to blend
in<00:01:51.470> between<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.460> have<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.850> have<00:01:53.060> different

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
in between you have to have different

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.930 
in between you have to have different
being<00:01:53.960> trays<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.010> have<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.370> save<00:01:55.730> them

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
being trays and you have to save them

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.880 
being trays and you have to save them
there<00:01:56.210> because<00:01:56.540> what<00:01:56.720> we<00:01:56.840> did<00:01:57.080> was<00:01:57.290> we<00:01:57.530> just

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
there because what we did was we just

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.890 
there because what we did was we just
mixed<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:58.400> then<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:58.850> just<00:01:59.000> kept<00:01:59.210> adding<00:01:59.420> in

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
mixed it and then we just kept adding in

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.110 
mixed it and then we just kept adding in
the<00:02:00.110> color<00:02:00.320> what's<00:02:00.650> lost<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:01.430> decided<00:02:01.790> to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
the color what's lost and we decided to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.149 
the color what's lost and we decided to
you<00:02:02.450> know<00:02:02.630> go<00:02:02.960> back<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.320> patch<00:02:03.530> things<00:02:03.770> up<00:02:03.979> and

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
you know go back and patch things up and

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:04.850 
you know go back and patch things up and
the<00:02:04.280> color<00:02:04.460> was

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the color was

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.640 
the color was
and<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.160> all<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:06.000> messed<00:02:06.510> up<00:02:06.690> so<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.500> did

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
and it's all all messed up so what I did

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.440 
and it's all all messed up so what I did
afterwards<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.820> just<00:02:08.970> man<00:02:09.119> over

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
afterwards was I just man over

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.570 
afterwards was I just man over
everything<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.930> messed<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.320> on<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:11.130> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
everything we messed up on with the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.940 
everything we messed up on with the
solid<00:02:12.180> blue<00:02:12.390> color<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.990> then<00:02:13.350> after<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> did

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
solid blue color and then after I did

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.400 
solid blue color and then after I did
though<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:14.460> Ritter<00:02:14.760> oh<00:02:15.060> my<00:02:15.330> god<00:02:15.480> did<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.230> with

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
though with Ritter oh my god did so with

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.190 
though with Ritter oh my god did so with
the<00:02:16.530> roller<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:17.490> went<00:02:17.940> back<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.990> brush

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
the roller I went back with the brush

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.630 
the roller I went back with the brush
with<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.440> lighter<00:02:19.710> color<00:02:20.010> which<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.400> white

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
with the lighter color which is white

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.490 
with the lighter color which is white
and<00:02:20.910> implement<00:02:21.300> something<00:02:21.450> between<00:02:21.960> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
and implement something between and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.440 
and implement something between and
since<00:02:23.400> you're<00:02:23.700> trying<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.030> blend<00:02:24.210> with<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
since you're trying to blend with a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.230 
since you're trying to blend with a
brush<00:02:24.540> yourself<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.370> work<00:02:27.090> in

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
brush yourself you have to work in

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.630 
brush yourself you have to work in
sections<00:02:27.450> because<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.680> need<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.980> paint<00:02:29.160> both

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
sections because you need to paint both

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.270 
sections because you need to paint both
fairly<00:02:30.090> wet<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.380> can<00:02:31.590> blend<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:32.040> well

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
fairly wet so that you can blend it well

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.100 
fairly wet so that you can blend it well
so<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.700> first<00:02:33.030> start<00:02:33.300> from<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> left<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.990> then

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
so I first start from the left and then

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.700 
so I first start from the left and then
I<00:02:34.320> did<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.680> right<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.300> see<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.260> ombre

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
I did the right so as you see the ombre

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.830 
I did the right so as you see the ombre
later<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.220> you'll<00:02:38.460> see<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.240> ombre<00:02:39.570> from

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
later on you'll see that the ombre from

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.020 
later on you'll see that the ombre from
the<00:02:40.080> middle<00:02:40.620> color<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> darkest<00:02:41.760> color

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the middle color to the darkest color

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.870 
the middle color to the darkest color
was<00:02:42.690> really<00:02:43.260> well<00:02:43.470> blended<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.280> top<00:02:44.610> with

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
was really well blended but the top with

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.680 
was really well blended but the top with
the<00:02:45.030> white<00:02:45.060> was<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.110> complete<00:02:46.980> fail<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.300> hope

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the white was a complete fail so I hope

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.330 
the white was a complete fail so I hope
that<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.050> will<00:02:49.170> learn<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.770> do<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.160> well

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
that you will learn and do it well

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.580 
that you will learn and do it well
because<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.240> how<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.540> Blues<00:02:52.230> went

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
because I really like how the Blues went

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.260 
because I really like how the Blues went
together<00:02:52.740> for<00:02:53.100> not<00:02:53.250> how<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.580> white<00:02:53.970> one<00:02:54.240> with

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
together for not how the white one with

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.210 
together for not how the white one with
the<00:02:54.510> blue<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.230> honestly<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.950> was<00:02:56.160> just

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the blue but honestly I was just

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.490 
the blue but honestly I was just
exhausted<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.120> was<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.420> good<00:02:57.630> enough<00:02:57.930> as<00:02:58.200> long

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
exhausted I was like good enough as long

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.320 
exhausted I was like good enough as long
as<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.770> blends<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.640> kind<00:02:59.880> of<00:02:59.940> wish<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.300> I

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
as it blends but I kind of wish that I

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.150 
as it blends but I kind of wish that I
brought<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.810> white<00:03:00.959> down<00:03:01.230> more<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.770> was<00:03:01.950> so

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
brought the white down more but I was so

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.890 
brought the white down more but I was so
exhausted<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.000> wall<00:03:03.240> looks<00:03:03.570> really

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
exhausted the wall looks really

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.470 
exhausted the wall looks really
exhausted<00:03:04.500> too<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:06.030> was<00:03:06.180> good<00:03:06.330> enough

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
exhausted too so this was good enough

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.210 
exhausted too so this was good enough
for<00:03:06.660> me<00:03:06.780> but<00:03:06.810> hopefully<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.709> will<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:07.890> better

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
for me but hopefully you will be better

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.560 
for me but hopefully you will be better
than<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:10.220> as<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.670> Blues<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
than this and as for the Blues like the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.300 
than this and as for the Blues like the
middle<00:03:12.900> blue<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.440> darkest<00:03:13.830> blue<00:03:14.040> I

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
middle blue and the darkest blue I

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.670 
middle blue and the darkest blue I
actually<00:03:14.760> went<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.660> blended<00:03:16.410> them<00:03:16.530> together

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
actually went and blended them together

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.770 
actually went and blended them together
which<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.310> what<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.550> told<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.970> not<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.209> do<00:03:18.540> I

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
which is what I told you not to do I

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.470 
which is what I told you not to do I
know<00:03:19.080> but<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.370> reason<00:03:20.760> why<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.910> did<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.360> was

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
know but the reason why I did that was

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.410 
know but the reason why I did that was
because<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.989> had<00:03:22.080> another<00:03:22.980> clean<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.970> plastic

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
because I had another clean like plastic

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.110 
because I had another clean like plastic
bowl<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.170> saved<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.650> color<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.790> blend

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
bowl so I saved that color and I blend

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.070 
bowl so I saved that color and I blend
that<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.330> much<00:03:27.420> as<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.600> couldn't<00:03:27.840> that's<00:03:27.959> why

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
that so much as I couldn't that's why

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.840 
that so much as I couldn't that's why
you<00:03:28.140> see<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.560> bottom<00:03:28.860> color<00:03:29.010> right<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:29.340> it

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
you see the bottom color right there it

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.000 
you see the bottom color right there it
blends<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.239> really<00:03:30.269> really<00:03:30.840> well<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.440> so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
blends in really really well and so

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.220 
blends in really really well and so
pretty<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:32.940> wish<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.450> did<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:34.110> begin

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
pretty I just wish I did that to begin

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.550 
pretty I just wish I did that to begin
with

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
with

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.870 
with
so<00:03:34.709> hopefully<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:35.190> will<00:03:35.280> do<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.760> begin

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
so hopefully you will do that to begin

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.660 
so hopefully you will do that to begin
with<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.390> what<00:03:36.989> sucks<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.220> paints

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
with and what sucks is that the paints

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.340 
with and what sucks is that the paints
look<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:39.300> they're<00:03:39.450> different<00:03:39.750> colors<00:03:40.050> when

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
look like they're different colors when

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.650 
look like they're different colors when
they're<00:03:40.980> wet<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.310> when<00:03:41.610> they're<00:03:41.730> dry<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.510> as

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
they're wet and when they're dry so as

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.729 
they're wet and when they're dry so as
you<00:03:42.810> see<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.050> looks<00:03:43.110> like<00:03:43.320> I'm<00:03:43.440> painting<00:03:43.650> a

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
you see it looks like I'm painting a

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:44.990 
you see it looks like I'm painting a
lighter<00:03:43.890> color<00:03:44.160> but<00:03:44.430> it's<00:03:44.550> actually<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.940> same

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
lighter color but it's actually the same

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.130 
lighter color but it's actually the same
color<00:03:45.150> as<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.720> one<00:03:45.840> right<00:03:46.019> next<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.320> it

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
color as the one right next to it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.340 
color as the one right next to it
but<00:03:47.230> sadly<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:48.340> well<00:03:48.910> but<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.630> really<00:03:49.720> like<00:03:50.170> this
