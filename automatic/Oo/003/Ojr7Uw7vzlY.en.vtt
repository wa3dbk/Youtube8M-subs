00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:03.690
 we existed 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.530
 two systems fundamentally with regard to the color control of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.659
 an image 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.739
 On the one hand, there is control 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:13.269
 automatic color 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.269
 because we have already seen are an example and on the other hand 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.349
 found more sophisticated 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.349
 three curves for example javier next 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.759
 we click 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.669
 and we can see 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.320
 what in the image of the control curves must be part below there are three account 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.460
 drops 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.620
 that serve for the following 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.780
 this is to parameterize 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.570
 the brightest area 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.630
 from image 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.930
 this is for 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.620
 control 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.460
 in the zone b kevin another and this is to control the area 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
 Greater darkness or black dot 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 to begin with, it is convenient to say and that there is a fair 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.680
 the white point to the control of the white point 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.230
 because we see that by default 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.000
 we are shown a white composed of more values ​​and will look for jávea 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.440
 of these 155 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.760
 espinel shone more and more 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.210
 however it must be said that this combination or more interesting other 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.300
 things because the printing press 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.500
 if we want to reproduce this image is not capable 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.040
 to those values 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040
 being convenient to position ourselves 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.470
 in the brightness box 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.940
 and lower this value 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.720
 with the arrow down 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.660
 until getting 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.490
 that so much magenta 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 like yellow are still 3% 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.610
 we accept 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.810
 we see how it is configured 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.090
 the control of 'black point' 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.740
 the woman is left 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.469
 with zero where it resides then it's fine we work like this 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.990
 and now she 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.900
 we can act on the image 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.500
 what affects us 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.939
 we started with 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.369
 the control 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.789
 white point we position ourselves in the area of ​​the emt of the image 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.099
 which considers a white jean 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.989
 clear possible in this case that part of doing it 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.989
 we click 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.949
 we are going now to control 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:29.149
 of 'black point' and we position ourselves concretely 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.649
 in season it is backlit 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.009
 and we squeeze 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.169
 Finally 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.649
 He left never counted 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:45.409
 of grays 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.019
 and we position ourselves in this area 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.389
 that we have identified directing another 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.149
 the mountain in the background 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:55.979
 we accept 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.929
 we say yes we want 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:59.749
 save 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.429
 this control 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.189
 default 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.809
 for future jobs 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.869
 and I have chromatically corrected the image 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.239
 we can buy it 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.269
 counter cope back 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.419
 to see 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:16.299
 the difference
