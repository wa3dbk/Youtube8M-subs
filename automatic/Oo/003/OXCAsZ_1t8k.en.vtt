dawn of the human bodies to understand

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.490 
dawn of the human bodies to understand
proportions<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.030> like<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.719> saw<00:00:12.929> before<00:00:13.080> with

accordance<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.590> head<00:00:23.029> in<00:00:24.029> other<00:00:24.210> words

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
accordance to the head in other words

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.040 
accordance to the head in other words
you're<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.369> head<00:00:26.609> becomes<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.570> measuring

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you're the head becomes the measuring

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.380 
you're the head becomes the measuring
point<00:00:28.400> because<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.519> could<00:00:29.699> say<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
point because you could say that this is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.350 
point because you could say that this is
very<00:00:30.779> simple<00:00:31.520> later<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> videos<00:00:33.210> will

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
very simple later on in the videos will

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.970 
very simple later on in the videos will
go<00:00:33.510> more<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.780> depth<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.170> draw<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.440> each<00:00:34.649> part

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
go more in depth and draw on each part

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
go more in depth and draw on each part
like<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> head<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.820> muscles<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> torso<00:00:36.840> but

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
like the head the muscles the torso but

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.020 
like the head the muscles the torso but
for<00:00:37.170> now<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.640> understand<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.850> your

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
for now it's just understand so your

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.970 
for now it's just understand so your
head<00:00:39.620> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.010> certain<00:00:41.700> measurement<00:00:42.360> hi

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
head this is a certain measurement hi

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.240 
head this is a certain measurement hi
the<00:00:43.980> human<00:00:44.430> body<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.120> general<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.899> given<00:00:46.530> seven

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the human body in general is given seven

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
the human body in general is given seven
seven<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.210> these<00:00:48.329> lengths<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.200> take

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
seven of these lengths so if you take

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.639 
seven of these lengths so if you take
these<00:00:49.620> increments<00:00:49.969> it's<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.300> seven<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
these increments it's about seven to the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.569 
these increments it's about seven to the
feed<00:00:53.629> but<00:00:54.629> pretty<00:00:55.050> simply<00:00:56.329> we'll<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
feed but pretty simply we'll just do it

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.860 
feed but pretty simply we'll just do it
using<00:00:59.579> these<00:00:59.789> proportions<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> head<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
using these proportions so the head is

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.049 
using these proportions so the head is
one<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> neck<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:02.190> after<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.760> length

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
one the neck is about after the length

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
one the neck is about after the length
of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> head<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.220> now<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
of the head as you can see but now the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.289 
of the head as you can see but now the
torso<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.100> collar<00:01:08.400> bone<00:01:08.700> from<00:01:09.000> about

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
torso you have a collar bone from about

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
torso you have a collar bone from about
the<00:01:09.780> collarbone<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.820> packs<00:01:13.010> pectoral

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the collarbone the packs pectoral

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.149 
the collarbone the packs pectoral
muscles<00:01:14.369> about<00:01:14.700> another<00:01:15.090> head<00:01:15.450> length<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
muscles about another head length and to

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
muscles about another head length and to
this<00:01:17.689> that's<00:01:18.689> another<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.390> then<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this that's another one and then to the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.840 
this that's another one and then to the
belly<00:01:22.350> button<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> another<00:01:23.610> head<00:01:23.909> lane<00:01:25.729> it's<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
belly button is another head lane it's a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
belly button is another head lane it's a
really<00:01:27.030> bad<00:01:27.360> drawing<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.439> I'm

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
really bad drawing just because I'm

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.950

that's it's one from collarbone to the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.750 
that's it's one from collarbone to the
top<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> rib<00:01:49.799> cage

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
top of the rib cage

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.570 
top of the rib cage
one<00:01:50.970> head<00:01:51.300> length<00:01:51.890> from<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.370> belly

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
one head length from that to the belly

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.190 
one head length from that to the belly
buttons<00:01:54.030> too<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.510> then<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> belly

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
buttons too and then from the belly

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.300 
buttons too and then from the belly
button<00:01:55.410> down<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.670> three<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.180> had<00:02:01.310> one

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
button down is three so you have had one

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.570 
button down is three so you have had one
too<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> looks<00:02:04.440> off<00:02:04.680> proportion<00:02:05.430> because

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
too and it looks off proportion because

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.910 
too and it looks off proportion because

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the paper that the cameras at an angle

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.320 
the paper that the cameras at an angle
which<00:02:08.010> sucks<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.820> see<00:02:08.970> there's<00:02:09.180> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
which sucks was you can see there's the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.710 
which sucks was you can see there's the
head<00:02:09.540> that's<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.800> from<00:02:11.010> collarbone<00:02:11.720> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
head that's one and from collarbone to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.130 
head that's one and from collarbone to
the<00:02:12.840> packs<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:15.030> another<00:02:15.330> one<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:15.870> one

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the packs it's another one so that's one

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.690 
the packs it's another one so that's one
and<00:02:16.350> then<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.590> belly<00:02:16.860> button<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.430> their

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and then to the belly button to their

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 
and then to the belly button to their
it's<00:02:17.850> another<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> bed<00:02:19.740> going

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
it's another one then to the bed going

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.370 
it's another one then to the bed going
to<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.820> groin<00:02:21.060> that's<00:02:21.420> another<00:02:21.720> 10<00:02:22.170> minutes

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
to the groin that's another 10 minutes

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.990 
to the groin that's another 10 minutes
for<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:22.830> legs<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.630> legs<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.990> become<00:02:26.000> about

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
for the legs the legs just become about

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.500 
for the legs the legs just become about
four<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:28.620> something<00:02:29.100> interesting<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.450> terms

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
four it's something interesting in terms

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.250 
four it's something interesting in terms
of<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.590> legs<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:33.030> always<00:02:33.300> equal<00:02:33.960> from

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
of the legs is it's always equal from

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.840 
of the legs is it's always equal from
the<00:02:34.380> kneecaps<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:40.230> feet<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:41.400> length<00:02:41.670> of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
the kneecaps to the feet the length of

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.430 
the kneecaps to the feet the length of
the<00:02:41.970> legs<00:02:42.890> are<00:02:43.890> always<00:02:44.130> equal<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:48.690> portion

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
the legs are always equal this portion

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.490 
the legs are always equal this portion
this<00:02:49.470> portion<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:50.190> always<00:02:50.520> equal<00:02:51.290> which<00:02:52.290> is

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
this portion is always equal which is

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.960 
this portion is always equal which is
really<00:02:52.740> important<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.250> understand<00:02:53.790> this

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
really important to understand this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.030 
really important to understand this
later<00:02:54.240> on<00:02:54.480> when<00:02:54.780> when<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.200> go<00:02:55.440> more<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.800> depth

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
later on when when you go more in depth

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.790 
later on when when you go more in depth
and<00:02:56.310> draw<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.550> body<00:02:56.850> dangles<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.630> whatnot<00:02:58.020> it

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
and draw the body dangles and whatnot it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560 
and draw the body dangles and whatnot it
will<00:02:58.950> help<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.310> lot<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.880> understand<00:03:00.330> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
will help a lot to understand the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.670 
will help a lot to understand the
perspectives<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:02.100> then<00:03:02.280> for<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> arms

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
perspectives of it but then for the arms

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.360 
perspectives of it but then for the arms
it's<00:03:04.680> about<00:03:05.209> one<00:03:06.209> head<00:03:06.450> length<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.860> body<00:03:08.100> said

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it's about one head length the body said

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.699 
it's about one head length the body said
it's<00:03:08.580> about<00:03:08.790> three<00:03:09.120> total<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:09.989> for<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
it's about three total but for the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.290 
it's about three total but for the
easier<00:03:10.980> work<00:03:11.130> for<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.400> arms<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.850> if<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.150> get

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
easier work for the arms is if you get

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.320 
easier work for the arms is if you get
your<00:03:12.480> torso<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.320> just<00:03:14.160> remember<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.940> elbow

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
your torso in just remember the elbow

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.729 
your torso in just remember the elbow
stops<00:03:15.690> about<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.570> it's<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.440> little

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
stops about right here and it's a little

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.320 
stops about right here and it's a little
above<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.040> belly<00:03:20.370> button<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> elbow

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
above the belly button that the elbow

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.650 
above the belly button that the elbow
starts<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.980> hand<00:03:23.280> ends<00:03:23.670> about<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.120> thigh

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
starts and the hand ends about the thigh

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.890 
starts and the hand ends about the thigh
so<00:03:25.110> it's<00:03:25.260> about<00:03:25.320> like<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.920> longer<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:26.900> your

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
so it's about like that longer so your

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.040 
so it's about like that longer so your
charge<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> real<00:03:29.850> strong<00:03:30.690> looks<00:03:30.900> like

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
charge this is a real strong looks like

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.229 
charge this is a real strong looks like
 because<00:03:31.560> it's<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.580> not<00:03:32.790> concerned

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
 because it's it's not concerned

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.270 
 because it's it's not concerned
right<00:03:33.420> now<00:03:33.480> with<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.440> muscles<00:03:34.709> or<00:03:35.130> whatnot

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
right now with the muscles or whatnot

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.800 
right now with the muscles or whatnot
just<00:03:35.459> concerned<00:03:36.150> with<00:03:36.300> understand

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
just concerned with understand

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.890 
just concerned with understand
perspectives<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.709> what's<00:03:38.459> more<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
perspectives so what's more just the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.290 
perspectives so what's more just the
head<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.230> 11<00:03:40.860> length<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.310> neck<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.550> half<00:03:42.000> of

another and then from the bed when to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.050 
another and then from the bed when to
the<00:03:55.500> groin<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.099> these<00:03:56.280> are<00:03:56.430> just<00:03:56.520> muscles

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
the groin and these are just muscles

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.449 
the groin and these are just muscles
these<00:03:57.239> lines<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.780> another<00:03:58.709> head<00:03:58.950> length<00:03:59.250> and

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
these lines is another head length and

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.199 
these lines is another head length and
then<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.670> legs<00:04:00.080> so<00:04:01.080> overall<00:04:01.410> that's<00:04:02.120> kind<00:04:03.120> of

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
then the legs so overall that's kind of

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.010 
then the legs so overall that's kind of
proportions<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.410> general<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:06.060> did<00:04:06.480> this<00:04:06.750> I

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
proportions in general and I did this I

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.920 
proportions in general and I did this I
took<00:04:07.790> Michelangelo<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.819> picture<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.510> Sistine

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
took Michelangelo a picture the Sistine

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.490 
took Michelangelo a picture the Sistine
Chapel<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:12.180> David<00:04:12.690> figure<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.380> you

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
Chapel and the David figure and if you

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.620 
Chapel and the David figure and if you
say<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.739> just<00:04:14.130> drew<00:04:14.340> circles<00:04:14.610> on<00:04:15.090> these<00:04:15.269> these

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
say I just drew circles on these these

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.659 
say I just drew circles on these these
parts<00:04:16.079> but<00:04:16.230> everything<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.799> proportion<00:04:17.579> and

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
parts but everything is proportion and

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.340 
parts but everything is proportion and
that's<00:04:17.850> that's<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.660> biggest<00:04:18.900> key<00:04:19.230> to

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
that's that's the biggest key to

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.720 
that's that's the biggest key to
understand<00:04:19.799> if<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.040> can<00:04:20.250> understand

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
understand if you can understand

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.760 
understand if you can understand
proportions<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.419> really<00:04:21.720> can<00:04:21.959> draw<00:04:22.740> anything

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
proportions you really can draw anything

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.250 
proportions you really can draw anything
it's<00:04:23.430> just<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.700> matter<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.060> remember<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:25.139> you

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
it's just a matter of remember so as you

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.810 
it's just a matter of remember so as you
can<00:04:25.350> see<00:04:25.590> there's<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:26.010> head<00:04:26.250> which<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.610> drew<00:04:26.790> a

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
can see there's this head which I drew a

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.250 
can see there's this head which I drew a
circle<00:04:27.200> then<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.650> neck<00:04:28.889> down<00:04:29.810> once<00:04:30.810> again<00:04:31.110> to

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
circle then the neck down once again to
