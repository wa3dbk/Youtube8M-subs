00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello friends with you now on 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.030
 and today we have vidosik eat 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.400
 comments under the past video you me 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.710
 actively asked to show different tanks 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.039
 could was asking to show fireflies a 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.160
 it is 1390 and t71 that I must them 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.460
 show but a little later here is almost 91 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.710
 which is kind of like today should come out 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.619
 will be changed a bit 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.410
 level fights countrymen in particular t71 he 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.040
 will now fall into not 1 st and levels 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.559
 battles 10 and 13 90 though it will not affect 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.290
 that is, he got into 11 levels of battles 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.180
 so it will fall but still and here I am 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.480
 I decided that now there is no special meaning 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.910
 do something as a mediator therefore 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.750
 Vidosik floor for us 90 and 71 will be a little 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.190
 later and today we have a vidos on e100 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.050
 long ago I already had a vidos 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.559
 so the gloomy German barn 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.510
 somewhere in the annotations or in the description I 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.850
 I'll give a link to this video if you want 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.680
 look there in some detail I'm in 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.180
 time described technical 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.970
 characteristics that yourself e100 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.000
 presents but today show you the fight 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.650
 one more in Karelia by the way that vidos 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.409
 Karelia was also such a confluence 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.990
 circumstances funny and we ride here 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.470
 a platoon on two hundred square meters, I'm very angry with them 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.180
 nyashka 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.790
 but also let's talk about how 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.390
 To this, the Germans today live in a random house 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.939
 all this 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.220
 abundance of level 10 pt is very fast and 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.860
 sth-shkami and a small amount 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.470
 artillery well in living in principle not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 so bad that is, there is of course tyazh 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.799
 which is better for example universal 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.250
 110 and 5 or 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.170
 t57 heavy imba but here weaving 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.000
 Much better than the mouse itself 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.399
 feels in randomness due to the fact that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.380
 she has a great fun can say 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.600
 cannon this gun has excellent 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.399
 cumulative piercing shells 330 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.460
 that break almost everything 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.350
 can and there are very good bombs but 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.509
 armor-piercing shells that have 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.490
 pretty mediocre break through 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.550
 my two hundred thirty five millimeters 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.060
 there for gun 10 left and the more 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.700
 heavy tank is like well in principle 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 it would be fine if there were guns 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.560
 there was good accuracy 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.260
 accuracy and and such through on 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.220
 pretty though you can even now immediately 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.190
 hit and 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.120
 from the guard and anything for now 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.310
 accuracy again nerf the principle 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.280
 you can shoot without calling below but here's how 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.250
 an hour later I have a moment only this time I 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.080
 I didnâ€™t hit it but weaving quite often 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.850
 without information I am surprised myself 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.520
 how is it like not soviet 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.830
 tank but often you just have me 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.470
 that nyashka nyashka so generally with the guard 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.450
 constantly shoots her for 500 by 600 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.670
 meters projectile flies where necessary and all that 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.950
 it is necessary to punch in general, in principle, implements 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.450
 pretty good if you have enough 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.640
 number of credits then shoot 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.770
 cumulative and problems do not know if 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.140
 no credits then you shoot gods 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.450
 try to aim something there pray 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.370
 vbr and so that the projectile flew to the horns 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.470
 well and do not forget about a landmine because 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.989
 bombs are also quite serious like 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.660
 especially now with the presence of these here 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.120
 German new pies and with shares with 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.390
 shares on them a lot of them divorced 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.880
 there any borsch of waffentragers and everything 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.070
 the rest and so they love 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.140
 soak up a landmine this clean even 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.500
 and thousands can fly new mostly 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.989
 Of course smaller 900 well, too, in 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.480
 principle, not bad plus 5 modules and fidelo 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.120
 I also often charge a mine and 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.930
 let's say if I can't even break through 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.750
 cumulative seven tower too and its not 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.270
 difficult to break through a multivan but maybe in 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.890
 cheeks but here blasts me he comes 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.350
 excellent at 300 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.739
 sometimes even 400 damage just 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.860
 wonderful seven supposedly tanked and you 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.690
 and mine throwing on the spark that and ty 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.239
 gun there crew members in general 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.190
 pretty good size 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.720
 ammunition weave allows you to carry 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.420
 enough different 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.970
 ammunition and with this no problem 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.310
 I get along fine 10 to 10 big class 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.740
 your everything else is cumulative and never 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.770
 there was no such 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.720
 ended up some type of shells well if 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.970
 I would just head off not shooting head off not 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.870
 shoot so i don't have them 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.000
 run out 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.410
 Well, except for a good ore precipitation of course 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.990
 have some armor 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.750
 she suffers of course very much in nld 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.850
 when it is pierced from the fires of summer 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.100
 nedvizhka permanent you could see it 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.760
 but with all this if you sometimes 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.240
 hiding 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.800
 and opponents on whether enough big 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.440
 average distance trying on you 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.930
 shoot not cumulative shells then 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.430
 They basically will not punch you if 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.840
 you still with the tower turn away 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.200
 you will try 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.850
 rhombic interpreters board but here's how 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.610
 only charges cumulative projectiles 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.160
 weaving begins to suffer the tower suffers 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.220
 she is almost always especially 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.320
 against medium tanks and stacks constantly 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.770
 charges active projectiles especially 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.480
 soviet 60 second forties not easy 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.580
 just for you on the same can go 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.680
 get one shot from you and 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.760
 after all, and not cumulative shells just 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.800
 the tower rape you with their tdp he would 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.140
 for which they do not shoot well and plus to 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.360
 around the basics they whirl pleases 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.640
 that shielded boards save Anya from 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.920
 cumulative and from podkaliberov if suddenly 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.340
 there are true he thinks centenary 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.290
 the tower board then most likely they will not 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.290
 will strike unless at right angles and 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.120
 the upper part of the screen is somewhere supreme 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:42.470
 part of the board where the screen is thinner 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.230
 well, so basically weaving ourselves in the role 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.830
 the tank that tank I mean 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:52.070
 feels like well let's say C grade 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.520
 on a five-point system it seems to me even 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.720
 mono higher mouse tanks because here 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.270
 due to these screens on 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.240
 many shells can kill but few 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.220
 with unfortunately in the hull board is very 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.620
 suffers greatly in general here such me 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.930
 impression upon renewal 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.540
 pokatushek on weave and now pretty 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.300
 I actively ride a platoon and 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:20.160
 Well, in principle, I like her together. 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:23.130
 approximately 25-30 fights per session 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.940
 win rate 70 percent and average he where 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:30.090
 then three and a half of 4000 that is, well 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.220
 so the principle of a good day lives if 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.990
 especially fight some normal where 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.480
 can push direction like us 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.020
 done in this fight and yet in the end there 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.620
 shoot a couple of thousand damage then all 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.840
 excellent, but if in combat there are a lot of level 10 pt 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.620
 and some artillery then of course 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.350
 have to play 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.900
 less active and no pushing 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.370
 the direction is often out of the question though 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.550
 you can try in principle 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.740
 Well, something like this for me today 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.620
 the landing view is cocked up 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.930
 her 1 she's well let's say so 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.060
 much worse well on this fight fits 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.919
 the end is now before you will end up and we 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.320
 we will say goodbye friends 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.450
 the results of this fight in front of you I think 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.970
 This is not my last vidos trip to 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.070
 soon there will be others but 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.090
 today everyone thanks for your attention with 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.860
