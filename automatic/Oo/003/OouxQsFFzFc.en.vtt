00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
but I chose not to because he didn't

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.710 
but I chose not to because he didn't
have<00:04:01.410> as<00:04:01.590> good<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.859> shading<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:03.329> just<00:04:03.540> liked

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
have as good of shading and I just liked

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.170 
have as good of shading and I just liked
the<00:04:03.750> shading<00:04:04.230> on<00:04:04.319> this<00:04:04.500> guy<00:04:04.620> much<00:04:04.829> more<00:04:05.100> he<00:04:06.060> is

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
the shading on this guy much more he is

the shading on this guy much more he is
better<00:04:06.359> dabbling<00:04:06.840> I<00:04:06.989> think<00:04:07.260> he<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.530> very<00:04:07.560> rich

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
better dabbling I think he is very rich

better dabbling I think he is very rich
shading<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.700> um<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:09.840> all<00:04:09.870> he<00:04:10.200> has<00:04:10.319> is<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.530> few

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
