lack of oxygen and it's a nice car to
drive<00:04:34.340> it's<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.450> nice<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.870> fact<00:04:36.020> that

it's also very refined and silent but
that's<00:04:44.870> quite<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.350> opposite<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:45.950> what<00:04:46.070> you

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
that's quite the opposite of what you

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.810 
that's quite the opposite of what you
would<00:04:46.580> say<00:04:46.790> about<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.270> Fabia<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:49.490> engine<00:04:49.700> is

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
would say about the Fabia the engine is

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.640 
would say about the Fabia the engine is
a<00:04:49.880> bit<00:04:50.030> noisy<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.660> clattery<00:04:51.200> and<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.440> sounds

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
a bit noisy and clattery and it sounds

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.960 
a bit noisy and clattery and it sounds
like<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.800> tractor<00:04:52.130> coming<00:04:52.370> out<00:04:52.580> of<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:52.729> woods

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
like a tractor coming out of the woods

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.120 
like a tractor coming out of the woods
but<00:04:53.660> that<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:53.990> why<00:04:54.139> this<00:04:54.200> cabin<00:04:54.800> has<00:04:54.979> been

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
but that is why this cabin has been

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.850 
but that is why this cabin has been
built<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.970> perfection<00:04:56.390> it<00:04:57.050> isolates<00:04:57.590> all

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
built to perfection it isolates all

the<00:05:07.580> extreme<00:05:08.090> altitude<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.810> lack<00:05:09.020> of<00:05:09.050> oxygen

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
the extreme altitude and lack of oxygen

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.190 
the extreme altitude and lack of oxygen
was<00:05:10.070> now<00:05:10.280> beginning<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.790> tell<00:05:11.150> on<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.930> Stars
