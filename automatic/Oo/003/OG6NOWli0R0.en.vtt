00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.250
 hello good morning today we are going to teach 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.650
 make a paper cross in organism 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.869
 for this a sheet of paper is required 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.420
 square a leaf fall 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.850
 preferably green to perform the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.580
 Stalk and scissors 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.670
 sheet your sheet of double square paper the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.000
 well on the diagonal sea that the fold and 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.450
 open the sheet again do the same thing 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.490
 on the other diagonal marks the foot that 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:39.380
 as before and open your daughter again 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.380
 now explain horizontally 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.470
 and reopen the sheet after it arrives 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.520
 vertically and open again is also 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.520
 I have to see this 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.150
 and then you have to enter a part here 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.150
 On the other hand there 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.880
 to get a square 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 this is the result that you get 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.860
 I go on his sheet later so that the part 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.860
 open is up 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.910
 and I came downtown in this way 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.580
 to the same thing from here 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.450
 and I will come back to repeat again the same 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.450
 operation 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.740
 the result is this 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.120
 now grab the edges here turn around no 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.010
 have another side like that 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.010
 and you have that way 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.780
 there will be a side and some thing 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.850
 you have to repeat this operation for the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.270
 four degrees of the sheet to perform 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.270
 the flower 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.819
 then sheet the scissors to cut 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.819
 slightly below 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.870
 and leave your flower aside for the moment 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.140
 grab the small piece of paper and make 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.850
 one stem 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.850
 this is quite random 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.739
 it is done as you want but the 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.700
 stem must be quite thin to be able 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.700
 pass in the hole 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.970
 now its happened fell inside the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.560
 florida and if necessary you can 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.560
 cut the area a bit more 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.720
 here is your paper flower in origami
