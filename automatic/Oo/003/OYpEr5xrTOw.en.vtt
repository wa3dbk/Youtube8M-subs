00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.350 
ventures you know there's a lot of
backing<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.810> think<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.440> got<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> strong<00:02:23.360> front

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
backing I think it's got a strong front

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.510 
backing I think it's got a strong front
and<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.930> think<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.350> w<00:02:25.620> network<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.310> even

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and I think the w network you know even

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.830 
and I think the w network you know even
though<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:26.820> got<00:02:27.120> only<00:02:27.330> seven<00:02:27.630> hundred

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
though it's got only seven hundred

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.150 
though it's got only seven hundred
thousand<00:02:28.170> subscribers<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.800> really<00:02:29.010> hasn't

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
thousand subscribers and really hasn't

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.500 
thousand subscribers and really hasn't
gained<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.550> much<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:29.970> last<00:02:30.090> few<00:02:30.330> months

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
gained that much in the last few months

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.530 
gained that much in the last few months
I<00:02:30.890> think<00:02:31.890> when<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.490> know<00:02:32.610> next<00:02:32.790> year<00:02:32.910> comes<00:02:33.270> in

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
I think when you know next year comes in

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.170 
I think when you know next year comes in
and<00:02:33.810> they<00:02:33.900> expanded<00:02:34.410> more<00:02:34.530> markets<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.220> AH<00:02:35.430> you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
and they expanded more markets in AH you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.600 
and they expanded more markets in AH you
know<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:37.290> w<00:02:37.770> network<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:38.340> going<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.520> be

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
know the w network it's it's going to be

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.880 
know the w network it's it's going to be
