00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.090
 hi we are here again and may 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.960
 record this week 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.880
 So we'll start our ideas. 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 for the total is that it's coming Christmas 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 and today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.170
 do that he in daddy's slipper 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.210
 Noel and liam for hanging matters to decorate 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.029
 the house do what you want 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 that I tried on the wall let's give a 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.910
 Look at you is the idea that the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.550
 my house I'm still decorating then 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.560
 I did not want to put the abortion in the moment anymore. 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.870
 there 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.700
 I put it here for you to see if you 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.670
 Wonder how it went? Continue 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.300
 watching if it to the end 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.870
 it's good 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 and come with me 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.710
 so we're going to need this link 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.790
 materials 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.010
 first you will need 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.840
 of the scissors 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.730
 You too, can you? 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.220
 needing ribbons 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.300
 You can use green yellow the color you 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.580
 you want 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.870
 so I have here that is several colors 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.220
 together I think it's really cool that it goes 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.080
 to flicker 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.580
 Then you need glue too. 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.369
 hot 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.140
 Sure or glue cloth I'd rather put 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.590
 hot glue because the flat glue that I 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 It's been a while since it took so long to dry and then 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.080
 back to the same hot glue area 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.130
 there you will also need a 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.290
 as this template is making available 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.570
 for you guys and favela arts fan page 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.900
 How beautiful, it's good, you can be 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.910
 taking it or if you have 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.670
 ability to draw you may be 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:57.130
 designing right there is what I already cut 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.460
 I already passed the filter will give the name 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.070
 of the following red color filters 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.720
 black and white is that I already 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.050
 I cut off the traffic command 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.530
 you need two units of the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.540
 front brings here like there was no other 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.260
 white I cut a piece of fabric 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.730
 Same white right in two units 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.840
 here I cut two floods to make a 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.020
 black santa's belt and here I 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.030
 I cut a yellow square that I doubled 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.069
 that's how I got rid of the daughter 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.660
 it was with such openness to 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:45.760
 put it like this and made a little ball for 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:50.620
 put in the middle of the belt certain tone 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.050
 let the good people will here we go 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.040
 do the following, we'll just 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.040
 pass for granted 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.180
 and let's paste 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.110
 here I have already put now just take the 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.500
 excess of the column to give a better 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.500
 finishing 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.930
 iaaf has already formed a half-dozen 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:51.760
 fully enclosed 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:56.489
 both we'll be picking em up 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.489
 tim and we'll be sticking here 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:21.360
 and it's like this part we go all 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:24.870
 soft back and stayed that way 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.120
 now we'll be taking this part 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:35.010
 and we will be gluing centralizing to the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.010
 Do not just put 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.040
 and stayed like this 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:25.230
 now we'll have a necklace the part of 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:28.050
 up from here is that we 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:43.710
 Let's do this, let's put it a lot. 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:52.350
 Colo up let's fix let's turn and 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:06:01.740
 Let's fit the equal part to 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:06:05.000
 put another side then pass 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.000
 pretty place 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:28.370
 and let's put it this way 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:42.529
 remembering that from above always 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.529
 open to form a little shoe 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:54.619
 Now just paste but the little ribbon here to 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.619
 we are pindorama 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:02.479
 As I said, I'll be using a 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:02.479
 little piece of this one was colorful 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.950
 I just screamed that the dots 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:29.329
 I'll paste mussak inside. 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:32.299
 Good people are ready now. 

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:34.159
 stocking Santa's little foot right 

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:36.649
 here I put it on the wall for you 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:38.059
 view but you can 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:41.119
 to go anywhere that you 

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:43.579
 want but the same model is that of 

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:46.999
 hang on the door 

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:50.509
 It's good and it was exactly like that both 

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:53.179
 sides and decorated and here you are feeling 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:56.899
 that part alone in the sock like you 

00:07:53.179 --> 00:08:00.589
 you know and I put on a 

00:07:56.899 --> 00:08:04.009
 antÃ³n to give the impression of 

00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:06.829
 that the shoe is full that there is something 

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:08.569
 Inside, I hope you have. 

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:10.309
 Do you like it or do not forget to 

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:13.789
 I click I like sharing this idea 

00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:16.610
