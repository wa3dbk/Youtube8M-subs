00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
skateboarding bearing because you've

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.340 
skateboarding bearing because you've
you've<00:01:27.240> got<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> bear<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.689> mind<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.930> bearings

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you've got a bear in mind that bearings

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.240 
you've got a bear in mind that bearings
used<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.799> everything<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.689> hoovers<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250

skateboard will put into a bearing is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.130 
skateboard will put into a bearing is
nothing<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.979> comparison<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.140> what

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
nothing in comparison to what a what

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.010 
nothing in comparison to what a what
what<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> drill<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:51.479> more

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
what a what a drill will so the more

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.429 
what a what a drill will so the more
important<00:01:52.439> things<00:01:52.649> are<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:54.290> hardness<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
important things are the hardness of a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
important things are the hardness of a
steel<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> actual<00:01:56.490> grade<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.270> steel

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
steel so the actual grade of the steel

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.830 
steel so the actual grade of the steel
which<00:01:58.259> has<00:01:58.890> an<00:01:59.009> impact<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.460> its<00:02:00.240> impact

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
which has an impact on its impact

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.660 
which has an impact on its impact
resistance<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.509> your<00:02:03.509> average<00:02:03.780> drill<00:02:04.140> is

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
resistance so your average drill is

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.910 
resistance so your average drill is
important<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.000> able<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.420> spin

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
important that it's able to spin

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.290 
important that it's able to spin
thousands<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> thousands<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.789> thousands<00:02:09.209> of

thousands of thousands and thousands of

thousands of thousands and thousands of
times

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
times

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.740 
times
but<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.430> important<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.599> can

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
but it's not so important that you can

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.210 
but it's not so important that you can
flash<00:02:13.049> it<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.440> things<00:02:13.680> because<00:02:13.830> let's<00:02:14.159> be

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
flash it on things because let's be

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.399 
flash it on things because let's be
honest<00:02:14.549> like<00:02:14.640> yeah<00:02:15.030> you're<00:02:15.870> going<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:16.110> spin<00:02:16.379> a

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
honest like yeah you're going to spin a

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.280 
honest like yeah you're going to spin a
drill<00:02:17.269> but<00:02:18.269> you're<00:02:18.390> not<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.959> bash<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
drill but you're not going to bash it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.720 
drill but you're not going to bash it
against<00:02:19.500> things<00:02:19.709> whereas<00:02:20.010> given<00:02:20.459> an<00:02:20.549> ally

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
against things whereas given an ally

lubricate a skateboard bearing I know a

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.180 
lubricate a skateboard bearing I know a
lot<00:03:18.569> you<00:03:18.780> will<00:03:18.959> use<00:03:19.169> three<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.590> one<00:03:19.829> third

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
lot you will use three in one third

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.670 
lot you will use three in one third
lubrication<00:03:20.910> purely<00:03:21.450> because<00:03:21.599> that's<00:03:22.349> what

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
lubrication purely because that's what

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.159 
lubrication purely because that's what
you've<00:03:22.859> got<00:03:23.099> around<00:03:23.730> your<00:03:23.910> house<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.419> believe

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
you've got around your house but believe

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.530 
you've got around your house but believe
me<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.829> light<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.519> oil<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.180> use<00:03:27.209> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
me that the light of the oil you use the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.750 
me that the light of the oil you use the
better<00:03:27.810> your<00:03:28.109> bearing<00:03:28.470> will<00:03:28.650> perform<00:03:29.069> now

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
better your bearing will perform now

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.170 
better your bearing will perform now
what<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.150> like<00:03:30.359> about<00:03:30.389> bones<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:32.190> when<00:03:33.060> you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
what I like about bones is that when you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.430 
what I like about bones is that when you
take<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.470> inner<00:03:34.590> box<00:03:34.829> out<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.430> outer<00:03:35.790> box

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
take the inner box out of the outer box

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.839 
take the inner box out of the outer box
I'm<00:03:37.440> not<00:03:37.590> sure<00:03:37.769> how<00:03:38.040> well<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.370> shows<00:03:38.549> up<00:03:38.760> on

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
I'm not sure how well that shows up on

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.110 
I'm not sure how well that shows up on
camera<00:03:39.150> but<00:03:39.419> you<00:03:39.750> can<00:03:39.900> see<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:41.010> oil<00:03:41.220> started

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
camera but you can see the oil started

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.659 
camera but you can see the oil started
to<00:03:42.269> penetrate<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.169> cardboard<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.280> that's<00:03:44.579> a

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
to penetrate the cardboard so that's a

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:45.890 
to penetrate the cardboard so that's a
good<00:03:44.790> sign<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.060> they're<00:03:45.269> well<00:03:45.599> lubricated

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
good sign that they're well lubricated

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.360 
good sign that they're well lubricated
and<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:48.230> opening<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.319> box<00:03:49.500> we<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:52.370> classic

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
and so opening the box we have a classic

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.750 
and so opening the box we have a classic

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.730 
colors here you go on them so they're
they're<00:04:34.090> really<00:04:34.360> cool<00:04:34.540> as<00:04:34.690> well<00:04:34.720> now<00:04:35.110> I've

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
they're really cool as well now I've

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.780 
they're really cool as well now I've
taken<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.280> liberty<00:04:36.360> with<00:04:37.360> these<00:04:37.570> bearings<00:04:37.930> of

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
taken the liberty with these bearings of

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.190 
taken the liberty with these bearings of
copping<00:04:39.790> one<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> shields<00:04:40.750> off<00:04:40.930> now<00:04:42.180> each

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
copping one of the shields off now each

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.410 
copping one of the shields off now each
bearing<00:04:44.200> comes<00:04:44.710> with<00:04:45.040> a<00:04:45.070> shield<00:04:45.430> on<00:04:45.640> one<00:04:46.120> side

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
bearing comes with a shield on one side

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.280 
bearing comes with a shield on one side
and<00:04:46.810> only<00:04:47.110> one<00:04:47.290> side<00:04:47.500> now<00:04:48.720> just<00:04:49.720> find<00:04:50.110> the

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
and only one side now just find the

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.420 
and only one side now just find the
focus<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.070> go<00:04:52.410> what<00:04:53.410> you're<00:04:53.620> seeing<00:04:53.890> here<00:04:54.010> is

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
focus and go what you're seeing here is

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.190 
focus and go what you're seeing here is
the<00:04:54.760> side<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.330> would<00:04:55.570> normally<00:04:55.900> be

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
the side that would normally be

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.280 
the side that would normally be
protected<00:04:57.010> by<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.240> rubberized<00:04:58.240> metal<00:04:58.960> shield

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
protected by a rubberized metal shield

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.130 
protected by a rubberized metal shield
so<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.280> shield<00:05:00.550> is<00:05:00.850> made<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.270> metal<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.810> then

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
so the shield is made of metal and then

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.530 
so the shield is made of metal and then
it's<00:05:02.440> coated<00:05:02.740> with<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.220> rubber<00:05:03.730> which<00:05:04.090> helps<00:05:04.390> it

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
it's coated with a rubber which helps it

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.250 
it's coated with a rubber which helps it
create<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:04.930> seal<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:05.970> now<00:05:06.970> what<00:05:07.540> this<00:05:07.690> does<00:05:07.750> is

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
create a seal and now what this does is

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.620 
create a seal and now what this does is
it<00:05:08.320> keeps<00:05:08.770> lubricant<00:05:09.730> inside<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.270> bearing

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
it keeps lubricant inside the bearing

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.870 
it keeps lubricant inside the bearing
and<00:05:10.720> it<00:05:10.810> stops<00:05:11.050> from<00:05:11.170> dust<00:05:11.920> from<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.460> getting

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
and it stops from dust from it getting

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.180 
and it stops from dust from it getting
in<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.270> damaging<00:05:14.230> the<00:05:14.350> polish<00:05:14.740> on<00:05:14.980> the

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
in and damaging the polish on the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.250 
in and damaging the polish on the
bearing<00:05:15.520> that<00:05:15.610> you<00:05:15.730> can<00:05:15.880> see<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.020> higher

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
bearing that you can see the the higher

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.350 
bearing that you can see the the higher
the<00:05:17.590> polish<00:05:18.190> and<00:05:18.550> we're<00:05:18.940> talking<00:05:19.240> at<00:05:19.330> a

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
the polish and we're talking at a

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.960 
the polish and we're talking at a
microscopic<00:05:19.720> level<00:05:20.110> here<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.550> smoother

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
microscopic level here the the smoother

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.000 
microscopic level here the the smoother
your<00:05:22.090> bearing<00:05:22.390> will<00:05:22.510> be<00:05:22.690> so<00:05:23.050> this<00:05:23.560> is<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.710> fairly

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
your bearing will be so this is a fairly

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.970 
your bearing will be so this is a fairly
popular<00:05:24.930> way<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:25.960> run<00:05:26.290> your<00:05:26.440> bearings<00:05:26.770> in

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
popular way to run your bearings in

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.850 
popular way to run your bearings in
skateboarding<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:28.600> to<00:05:29.260> be<00:05:29.380> honest<00:05:29.530> it's<00:05:29.710> not

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
skateboarding and to be honest it's not

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.840 
skateboarding and to be honest it's not
a<00:05:29.890> way<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.220> I<00:05:30.250> personally<00:05:31.169> would<00:05:32.169> do<00:05:32.410> it<00:05:32.850> so

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
a way that I personally would do it so

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.720 
a way that I personally would do it so
all<00:05:34.270> we<00:05:34.450> have<00:05:34.480> here<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:34.990> we've<00:05:35.320> got<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.860> the

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
all we have here is we've got the the

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.890 
all we have here is we've got the the
outer<00:05:36.880> race<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:38.260> inner<00:05:38.590> race<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:40.180> 7<00:05:40.570> ball

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
outer race the inner race and the 7 ball

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.930 
outer race the inner race and the 7 ball
bearings<00:05:41.410> and<00:05:41.680> they're<00:05:41.950> held<00:05:42.220> in<00:05:42.370> place<00:05:42.520> by<00:05:42.640> a

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
bearings and they're held in place by a

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.230 
bearings and they're held in place by a
nylon<00:05:43.660> retainer<00:05:44.260> so<00:05:44.950> they<00:05:45.190> keep<00:05:45.400> them<00:05:45.610> equally

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
nylon retainer so they keep them equally

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.440 
nylon retainer so they keep them equally
spaced<00:05:46.600> to<00:05:47.410> keep<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:48.070> load<00:05:48.370> evenly<00:05:48.790> distributed

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
spaced to keep a load evenly distributed

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.480 
spaced to keep a load evenly distributed
and<00:05:49.570> so<00:05:49.720> forth<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:52.450> the<00:05:52.960> downside<00:05:53.590> of<00:05:53.770> this<00:05:53.800> is

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
and so forth the the downside of this is

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.580 
and so forth the the downside of this is
obviously<00:05:54.850> that<00:05:54.940> your<00:05:55.169> lubricant<00:05:56.169> will<00:05:56.350> dry

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
obviously that your lubricant will dry

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.650 
obviously that your lubricant will dry
out<00:05:56.620> dry<00:05:57.520> out<00:05:57.669> quicker<00:05:57.910> and<00:05:58.030> your<00:05:58.240> bearings

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
out dry out quicker and your bearings

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.230 
out dry out quicker and your bearings
will<00:05:58.780> come<00:05:58.990> noisy<00:05:59.260> now<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.800> lot<00:06:00.340> of<00:06:00.370> people<00:06:00.490> like

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
will come noisy now a lot of people like

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.270 
will come noisy now a lot of people like
to<00:06:01.270> have<00:06:01.510> really<00:06:01.870> really<00:06:02.020> noisy<00:06:02.290> bearing<00:06:03.010> so

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
to have really really noisy bearing so

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.690 
to have really really noisy bearing so
people<00:06:03.640> can<00:06:03.760> hear<00:06:03.970> them<00:06:04.120> coming<00:06:04.419> and<00:06:04.720> it<00:06:05.700> is

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
people can hear them coming and it is

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.640 
people can hear them coming and it is
personal<00:06:07.060> preference<00:06:07.510> really<00:06:07.780> personally<00:06:08.440> I

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
personal preference really personally I

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.610 
personal preference really personally I
would<00:06:09.340> keep<00:06:09.610> shield<00:06:10.360> popped<00:06:10.930> on<00:06:11.140> you<00:06:11.470> could

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
would keep shield popped on you could

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.720 
would keep shield popped on you could
hear<00:06:11.770> it<00:06:11.860> click<00:06:12.520> into<00:06:12.700> place<00:06:12.730> there<00:06:16.350> so<00:06:17.730> these

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
hear it click into place there so these

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.190 
hear it click into place there so these
bangs<00:06:19.500> can<00:06:20.500> be<00:06:20.590> taken<00:06:20.950> take<00:06:21.700> two<00:06:21.850> pieces

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
bangs can be taken take two pieces

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.020 
bangs can be taken take two pieces
lubricated<00:06:23.200> really<00:06:23.740> really<00:06:24.070> easily<00:06:24.280> if<00:06:24.790> you

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
have a really light oil you can drip it

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.969 
have a really light oil you can drip it

year it's just a spare so tracks I have
lying<00:06:51.490> around<00:06:51.580> and<00:06:52.199> the<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.680> bones<00:06:53.949> reds<00:06:54.310> in

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
lying around and the the bones reds in

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.770 
lying around and the the bones reds in
these<00:06:54.819> wheels<00:06:55.090> are<00:06:55.409> about<00:06:56.409> six<00:06:56.889> years<00:06:57.069> old<00:06:57.310> and

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
these wheels are about six years old and

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.839 
these wheels are about six years old and
you'll<00:06:58.780> note<00:06:58.960> that<00:06:58.990> very<00:06:59.349> very<00:06:59.379> old<00:06:59.830> and<00:07:00.250> very

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:00.849 
you'll note that very very old and very

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:04.230 
you'll note that very very old and very
very<00:07:01.360> noisy<00:07:01.960> but<00:07:02.590> I<00:07:02.620> mean<00:07:02.830> they<00:07:03.819> still<00:07:04.060> have<00:07:04.210> a

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
very noisy but I mean they still have a

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.300 
very noisy but I mean they still have a
very<00:07:04.539> very<00:07:04.720> good<00:07:04.960> spin<00:07:05.379> on<00:07:05.409> them<00:07:05.680> that's

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
very very good spin on them that's

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.700 
very very good spin on them that's
because<00:07:06.610> in<00:07:06.879> the<00:07:07.000> six<00:07:07.270> years<00:07:07.539> ago<00:07:07.719> had<00:07:08.409> them

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
because in the six years ago had them

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.899 
because in the six years ago had them
every<00:07:09.610> now<00:07:09.969> and<00:07:10.150> again<00:07:10.180> every<00:07:11.400> six<00:07:12.400> months<00:07:12.789> or

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:12.909 
every now and again every six months or

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:16.070 
every now and again every six months or
so<00:07:12.969> maybe<00:07:13.590> you'll<00:07:14.590> take<00:07:15.159> them<00:07:15.310> to<00:07:15.430> pieces

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
so maybe you'll take them to pieces

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.409 
so maybe you'll take them to pieces
clean<00:07:17.080> any<00:07:17.319> crap<00:07:17.620> out<00:07:17.830> of<00:07:17.860> it<00:07:18.159> and<00:07:18.460> lubricate

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
clean any crap out of it and lubricate

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.510 
clean any crap out of it and lubricate
them<00:07:19.629> and<00:07:19.870> they'll<00:07:20.680> make<00:07:20.860> your<00:07:20.949> bearings<00:07:21.310> last

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
them and they'll make your bearings last

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.010 
them and they'll make your bearings last
longer<00:07:21.969> and<00:07:22.060> longer<00:07:22.180> and<00:07:22.360> longer<00:07:22.479> I<00:07:22.750> know<00:07:22.810> as

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
longer and longer and longer I know as

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.719 
longer and longer and longer I know as
far<00:07:23.199> as<00:07:23.289> a<00:07:23.379> spin<00:07:23.620> test<00:07:23.919> that's<00:07:24.099> not<00:07:24.280> very<00:07:24.400> good

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:24.729 
far as a spin test that's not very good

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:27.209 
far as a spin test that's not very good
and<00:07:25.120> they're<00:07:25.330> not<00:07:25.449> they<00:07:26.139> have<00:07:26.289> spaces<00:07:26.650> in<00:07:26.979> any

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:27.219 
and they're not they have spaces in any

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.909 
and they're not they have spaces in any
more<00:07:27.370> so<00:07:27.729> the<00:07:28.150> warning<00:07:28.449> all<00:07:28.569> over<00:07:28.990> so<00:07:29.379> a<00:07:29.620> bad

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
more so the warning all over so a bad

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.770 
more so the warning all over so a bad
example<00:07:30.129> but<00:07:30.940> as<00:07:31.659> I<00:07:31.719> said<00:07:33.539> bones<00:07:34.539> reds

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780 
example but as I said bones reds

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.689 
example but as I said bones reds
bearings<00:07:35.050> you<00:07:35.500> can<00:07:35.680> pick<00:07:36.039> them<00:07:36.219> up<00:07:36.280> for<00:07:36.520> less

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:36.699 
bearings you can pick them up for less

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:38.189 
bearings you can pick them up for less
than<00:07:36.819> fifteen<00:07:37.210> dollars<00:07:37.599> at<00:07:37.780> Skate<00:07:38.169> America

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 
than fifteen dollars at Skate America

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:41.309 
than fifteen dollars at Skate America
calm<00:07:38.979> at<00:07:39.190> the<00:07:39.250> moment<00:07:39.400> and<00:07:39.900> these<00:07:40.900> bearings

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 
calm at the moment and these bearings

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:44.339 
calm at the moment and these bearings
will<00:07:41.529> last<00:07:41.949> you<00:07:42.310> years<00:07:43.000> if<00:07:43.270> you<00:07:43.509> look<00:07:43.990> after

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:44.349 
will last you years if you look after

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:48.300 
will last you years if you look after
them<00:07:44.500> and<00:07:44.620> don't<00:07:45.580> shatter<00:07:45.909> them<00:07:46.979> you'll<00:07:47.979> be

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.310 
them and don't shatter them you'll be

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.459 
them and don't shatter them you'll be
hard-pressed<00:07:48.729> to<00:07:49.029> shatter<00:07:49.389> them<00:07:49.599> but<00:07:50.229> that's

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:50.469 
hard-pressed to shatter them but that's

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:52.830 
hard-pressed to shatter them but that's
why<00:07:50.680> they<00:07:50.830> make<00:07:50.860> bones<00:07:51.340> super<00:07:52.060> reds<00:07:52.300> which<00:07:52.569> are

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 
why they make bones super reds which are

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.519 
why they make bones super reds which are
a<00:07:53.370> higher<00:07:54.370> grade<00:07:54.669> steel<00:07:55.150> to<00:07:55.569> prevent<00:07:56.349> you<00:07:56.500> from

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:56.529 
a higher grade steel to prevent you from

00:07:56.529 --> 00:07:59.580 
a higher grade steel to prevent you from
doing<00:07:56.979> just<00:07:57.460> that<00:07:57.719> we'll<00:07:58.719> talk<00:07:58.900> more<00:07:59.139> others

00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.590 
doing just that we'll talk more others

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.909 
doing just that we'll talk more others
