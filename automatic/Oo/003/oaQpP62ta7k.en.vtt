00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:14.219
 r already in stream 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 The network is already gaga and I did not speak of beauty that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.150
 Who is speaking or am I bringing one more? 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.119
 video for you today here yes 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.760
 andrÃ© responds are from the middle river cuca 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.289
 br foot if you think the new core 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
 are becoming unmotivated by this 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.410
 we stopped playing as it was with many 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.160
 others 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.680
 until the future clapton is rich i agree 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 fully with you to the black ops 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.239
 robocop 2 with the future that everyone 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.000
 played to the end face the lig play was 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 something that also helped a lot the black ops 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.950
 2 that the time that everyone only stayed 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.170
 no plug play there playing with your team with 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.390
 his clan and disputing there to check 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.930
 gauchos come next 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 I played until March I think but I am 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.710
 praying very well I could not stand 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.570
 that stop on goal if they come to wwf 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.430
 our part in February practically 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 I'm not playing much and they play a lot. 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.290
 Record the videos for you. I'll pass. 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 The time when there's nothing to do. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.860
 but throwing cups greatly 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.770
 software as I played the authors did not 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.900
 in jorge for goodness sake check it out 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.909
 be good but I do not know what to call me 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.979
 attention and the issue of playing the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.990
 time without trying to pick up the match 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.049
 cool and so many meters and we're going to the next 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.820
 question of the highlander br br 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:36.509
 do you think it's going to be 3rd george 2 or 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.750
 what future board does not have the good lines 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.400
 How to hide this kind I think even though 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.780
 they give three faces but anyone for me 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.200
 What happened? What's going? 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.700
 hay a balanced and fun game he 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.799
 get at least make everyone 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.009
 play until November of the year that goes from 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.049
 2016 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.320
 it's still too good cuts too hard 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.540
 but black ops 2 mw 3 managed to hold 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.850
 the ends until now, right? 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.070
 cox 2 there if you enter there will be people 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.099
 playing still right then he could not 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.080
 to hold the players very well was 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.260
 What is missing at school? 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.910
 lately they have managed to hold and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.280
 innovate not to be confused by surfing and 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.040
 but again there was not an innovation that 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.900
 if you talk about how to configure top such 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.060
 first moments you dig playing 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.910
 ends up having fun but then by the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.580
 estimate is always that same stop 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.920
 of any fred antal dash intervention 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.440
 I do not know how much I would rather it was before 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.209
 from black ops 2 to the same taste 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.590
 with normal movement I prefer 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.510
 that way I think some agree 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.410
 remembering that this is my opinion 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.930
 huh 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.299
 b's next question is highlander by 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.730
 that you left the yen and enter 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.000
 they knew everything immortal xinhua 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.799
 I want xbox year is right competitive team 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.900
 I know because I was more at the end of 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.430
 A software environment is also 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.230
 false that the owner also pulled me out button 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.329
 As always, all the clans I 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.970
 I participate in competition with both 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.010
 end up getting dignified from the plan is 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.680
 but because I also know there 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.480
 Adriano's competitive 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.120
 I'd rather be more comfortable in the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.670
 bell 222 I played several championships 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.040
 several even think I played around 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.889
 of the black ops a 30 outer championships 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.900
 The championship sucked a lot. 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.150
 I participated with a lot too. 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.730
 but it is that which made me happy 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.970
 for being playing and disputing right 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.750
 then establishing the wk is the yen in the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.400
 a W 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.250
 they play very competitive way 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.930
 I do not know, he does not draw much attention. 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.389
 Bruno Mayan asked why you did not 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.799

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.530

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:03.349
 It's how I feel about recording the expensive video. 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.740
 I really like it so much that it already has a channel 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.810

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.210
