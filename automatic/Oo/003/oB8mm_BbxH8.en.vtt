00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:14.099
 hello to all famous painter friends 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.900
 now we'll show you how with a type 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.109
 of paint that we have already used 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.470
 that is the neutral pearl acrylic vi 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.919
 we will show another type of technique 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.839
 last time we used the 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.230
 pad to do the technique of 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:34.260
 buffered now we will use a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:40.410
 brush to show you the technique 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:44.100
 of the brushed this kind of effect 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 it can be made with either a paintbrush 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.400
 medium size either with a paintbrush 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.200
 minimum dimensions therefore also has the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.120
 half of the brush you see in this 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:01.910
 moment is also still can be done 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.910
 same technique using a spatula 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 preferably the plastic spadola 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:14.580
 because it is much more suitable with colors and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.940
 with much softer fillers as in 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940
 this case 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.920
 the effect that is created is always the same 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.740
 or the brushstroke that is made 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.550
 downwards it gives a more color 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.810
 clear the stroke that goes upwards 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.810
 gives a darker color 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.610
 this particular effect is due to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.650
 particles present inside the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.930
 paintings that are arranged in a way 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.200
 particular the in the moment of the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.200
 brush stroke 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.430
 if you can't see the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.799
 backlight we will show you in detail 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.470
 the photos 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.740
 moreover this type of technique as 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.590
 see the brush passage 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.160
 forming the known very narrow one can 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.050
 do the same way doing a very 8 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:24.470
 much wider then widen the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:29.330
 brushstroke ee if it will have another effect 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.330
 particular as in this way 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.340
 and also for today we have concluded with 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.460
 a new special technique for decorating 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.800
 I expect the walls of my hand from home 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.280
 to the next on famous painters dot it 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.280
