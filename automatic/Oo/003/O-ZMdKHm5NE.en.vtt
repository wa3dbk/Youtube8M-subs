 Cane is in the history of Brazil since

 the discovery 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.930
 joining this story was a saga 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.689
 if the sugar was strong the entrance of the 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.660
 alcohol as fuel was a 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:38.800
 revolution turned power plants into 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.800
 engines of economy 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.269
 a source of food and energy for the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.440
 world 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:56.140
 but the cane sector is different has 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:00.040
 particularities requires those who participate 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.040

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.049
 how many pains require so much work and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.930
 residence of their participants to 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.720
 keep going 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.939
 only who lived in the industry for many years 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.939
 knows what the industry is capable of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.950
 even with contrary winds we are 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:28.049

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.380
 we work together and we work together to keep 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.280
 things working and move on

 we were born with it 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.079
 we work side by side with the producer 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.729
 we invest heavily in technology and 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.569
 functionality 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.469
 we have created complete planting solutions 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:07.409

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.670
 new water plant to offer the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:17.450
 cane production to strength and resistance 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.160
 all to help our customers
