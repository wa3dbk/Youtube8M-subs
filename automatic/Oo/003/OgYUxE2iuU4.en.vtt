this<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:16.580> that<00:04:16.850> takes<00:04:17.209> us<00:04:17.450> all<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.750> way<00:04:17.780> into

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
this so that takes us all the way into

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.740 
this so that takes us all the way into
phase<00:04:18.380> 3<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:19.190> at<00:04:19.640> this<00:04:19.790> point<00:04:20.090> keep<00:04:20.540> in<00:04:20.720> mind

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
phase 3 and at this point keep in mind

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.350 
phase 3 and at this point keep in mind
we're<00:04:21.140> almost<00:04:21.229> seventy<00:04:22.160> percent<00:04:22.370> through<00:04:23.120> the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
we're almost seventy percent through the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.060 
we're almost seventy percent through the
product<00:04:23.900> we've<00:04:24.140> gone<00:04:24.350> through<00:04:24.560> phase<00:04:24.800> one

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
product we've gone through phase one

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.500 
product we've gone through phase one
we've<00:04:25.310> got

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
we've got

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.840 
we've got
through<00:04:25.750> phase<00:04:25.960> two<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.470> now<00:04:26.980> here<00:04:27.340> we<00:04:27.490> are<00:04:27.520> in

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
through phase two and now here we are in

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.700 
through phase two and now here we are in
phase<00:04:28.090> 3<00:04:28.420> so<00:04:28.630> hopefully<00:04:29.080> we're<00:04:29.290> starting<00:04:29.650> to

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
phase 3 so hopefully we're starting to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.980 
phase 3 so hopefully we're starting to
warm<00:04:29.950> up<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.370> some<00:04:30.580> cool<00:04:30.790> stuff<00:04:30.970> here<00:04:31.390> but

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
warm up to some cool stuff here but

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.630 
warm up to some cool stuff here but
unfortunately<00:04:32.140> that's<00:04:32.590> really<00:04:33.100> just<00:04:33.220> not<00:04:33.430> the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
unfortunately that's really just not the

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.360 
unfortunately that's really just not the
case<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:34.180> phase<00:04:34.630> 3<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.320> tubelaunch<00:04:35.830> you're

going<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.470> cost<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.890> money<00:04:57.190> which<00:04:57.760> is

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
going to cost you money which is

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.540 
going to cost you money which is
something<00:04:58.120> again<00:04:58.530> ineffective<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.680> tube

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
something again ineffective and tube

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.430 
something again ineffective and tube
launch<00:05:00.790> is<00:05:01.030> taking<00:05:01.360> you<00:05:01.480> down<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.810> wrong<00:05:02.080> path

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
launch is taking you down the wrong path

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.960 
launch is taking you down the wrong path
they're<00:05:02.680> teaching<00:05:02.890> you<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.340> wrong<00:05:03.580> things

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
they're teaching you the wrong things

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.430 
they're teaching you the wrong things
these<00:05:04.180> are<00:05:04.360> not<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.780> things<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:05.140> you<00:05:05.230> should

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
these are not the things that you should

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.950 
these are not the things that you should
be<00:05:05.590> doing<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:06.490> try<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:06.940> make<00:05:07.210> money<00:05:07.600> online

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
be doing to try and make money online

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.380 
be doing to try and make money online
and<00:05:08.710> ultimately<00:05:09.520> that's<00:05:09.700> what<00:05:09.850> they<00:05:10.030> promise

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
and ultimately that's what they promise

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.210 
and ultimately that's what they promise
you<00:05:10.630> they<00:05:10.780> would<00:05:10.960> teach<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:11.920> now<00:05:12.100> if

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
you they would teach you and so now if

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.040 
you they would teach you and so now if
we<00:05:12.280> as<00:05:12.550> we've<00:05:12.880> moved<00:05:13.150> through<00:05:13.480> phase<00:05:13.690> 1<00:05:14.020> and

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
we as we've moved through phase 1 and

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.930 
we as we've moved through phase 1 and
phase<00:05:14.290> 2<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.740> phase<00:05:14.950> 3<00:05:15.130> so<00:05:15.580> we've<00:05:15.730> looked

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
phase 2 and phase 3 so we've looked

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.360 
phase 2 and phase 3 so we've looked
we've<00:05:16.450> moved<00:05:16.720> through<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.080> entire<00:05:17.440> training

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
we've moved through the entire training

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.390 
we've moved through the entire training
section<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:19.300> tube<00:05:19.720> launch<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.470> want<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.070> kind<00:05:21.310> of

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
section of tube launch I want to kind of

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.850 
section of tube launch I want to kind of
make<00:05:21.580> my<00:05:21.730> next<00:05:21.790> point<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:22.840> this<00:05:23.230> is<00:05:23.470> my

make my next point and and this is my

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.120 
make my next point and and this is my
big<00:05:24.250> big<00:05:24.660> gripe<00:05:25.660> about<00:05:25.930> tube<00:05:26.380> launch<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:26.860> that

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
big big gripe about tube launch is that

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.150 
big big gripe about tube launch is that
the<00:05:27.400> quantity<00:05:27.760> of<00:05:28.060> videos<00:05:28.510> just<00:05:28.840> isn't<00:05:29.830> there

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
the quantity of videos just isn't there

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.770 
the quantity of videos just isn't there
we<00:05:30.550> already<00:05:30.850> talked<00:05:31.060> about<00:05:31.150> quality<00:05:31.660> you<00:05:31.720> can

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
we already talked about quality you can

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.750 
we already talked about quality you can

easily you can find better lessons for

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.830 
easily you can find better lessons for
free<00:05:36.160> but<00:05:36.760> on<00:05:36.820> top<00:05:37.060> of<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.270> they're<00:05:37.480> not<00:05:37.600> even

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
free but on top of that they're not even

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.510 
free but on top of that they're not even
giving<00:05:38.020> you<00:05:38.170> a<00:05:38.200> whole<00:05:38.470> bunch<00:05:38.800> of<00:05:38.980> lessons

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
giving you a whole bunch of lessons

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.460 
giving you a whole bunch of lessons
they're<00:05:39.790> giving<00:05:40.030> you<00:05:40.120> kind<00:05:40.240> of<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.450> handful<00:05:41.140> and

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
they're giving you kind of a handful and

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.000 
they're giving you kind of a handful and
for<00:05:42.310> example<00:05:42.670> you<00:05:42.700> paid<00:05:42.970> thirty<00:05:43.300> four<00:05:43.660> dollars

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
for example you paid thirty four dollars

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.500 
for example you paid thirty four dollars
for<00:05:45.010> tube<00:05:45.520> launch<00:05:45.730> if<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:46.090> go<00:05:46.210> into<00:05:46.390> the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
for tube launch if you go into the

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.480 
for tube launch if you go into the
members<00:05:46.750> area<00:05:46.930> there<00:05:47.590> are<00:05:47.710> less<00:05:47.920> than<00:05:47.950> thirty

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
members area there are less than thirty

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.270 
members area there are less than thirty
four<00:05:48.820> videos<00:05:49.240> significantly<00:05:50.080> less<00:05:50.350> so<00:05:51.070> you're

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
four videos significantly less so you're

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.520 
four videos significantly less so you're
actually<00:05:51.400> paying<00:05:51.730> over<00:05:52.210> a<00:05:52.240> dollar<00:05:52.780> per<00:05:53.320> video

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
actually paying over a dollar per video

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.650 
actually paying over a dollar per video
which<00:05:54.010> in<00:05:54.160> my<00:05:54.280> opinion<00:05:54.400> means<00:05:55.330> that<00:05:55.510> those

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
which in my opinion means that those

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.570 
which in my opinion means that those
should<00:05:55.870> be<00:05:55.990> pretty<00:05:56.290> high<00:05:56.530> quality<00:05:56.560> videos<00:05:57.310> but

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
should be pretty high quality videos but

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.990 
should be pretty high quality videos but
who<00:05:57.850> ever<00:05:58.000> published<00:05:59.190> tubelaunch<00:06:00.190> apparently

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
who ever published tubelaunch apparently

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.880 
who ever published tubelaunch apparently
had<00:06:01.210> something<00:06:01.960> a<00:06:02.020> little<00:06:02.170> bit<00:06:02.380> different<00:06:02.800> in

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
had something a little bit different in

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.230 
had something a little bit different in
mind<00:06:03.100> they<00:06:03.460> thought<00:06:03.670> that<00:06:03.730> they<00:06:04.210> could

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
mind they thought that they could

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.910 
mind they thought that they could
justify<00:06:04.840> those<00:06:05.020> costs<00:06:05.290> by<00:06:05.530> teaching<00:06:05.740> you

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
justify those costs by teaching you

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.710 
justify those costs by teaching you
really<00:06:06.640> really<00:06:06.760> basic<00:06:07.210> things<00:06:07.450> and<00:06:07.660> not

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
really really basic things and not

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.500 
really really basic things and not
giving<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.110> a<00:06:08.140> whole<00:06:08.380> lot<00:06:08.590> of<00:06:08.620> lessons<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:10.210> so

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
giving you a whole lot of lessons and so

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.480 
giving you a whole lot of lessons and so
I<00:06:10.750> want<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.110> talk<00:06:11.290> next<00:06:11.530> about<00:06:11.710> what<00:06:12.190> tube

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
I want to talk next about what tube

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.490 
I want to talk next about what tube
launch<00:06:12.730> needs<00:06:13.210> what<00:06:13.600> it<00:06:13.720> what<00:06:13.990> it's<00:06:14.140> really

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
launch needs what it what it's really

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.010 
launch needs what it what it's really
lacking<00:06:14.980> and<00:06:15.460> of<00:06:15.880> course<00:06:16.120> I<00:06:16.270> think<00:06:16.510> by<00:06:16.750> this

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
lacking and of course I think by this

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.870 
lacking and of course I think by this
point<00:06:17.260> in<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.530> review<00:06:17.920> its<00:06:18.490> kind<00:06:18.760> of

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
point in the review its kind of

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.090 
point in the review its kind of
self-evident<00:06:19.810> what<00:06:20.050> tube<00:06:20.290> launch<00:06:20.530> is<00:06:20.830> lacking

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
self-evident what tube launch is lacking

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.920 
self-evident what tube launch is lacking
and<00:06:21.580> that<00:06:21.880> they're<00:06:22.000> lacking<00:06:22.180> on<00:06:22.480> multiple

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
and that they're lacking on multiple

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.690 
and that they're lacking on multiple
levels<00:06:22.960> but<00:06:23.860> I<00:06:23.890> want<00:06:24.070> to<00:06:24.190> highlight<00:06:24.370> two

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
levels but I want to highlight two

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.540 
levels but I want to highlight two
points<00:06:25.150> the<00:06:26.140> first<00:06:26.410> point<00:06:26.710> is<00:06:26.830> if<00:06:27.070> you're

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
points the first point is if you're

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.370 
points the first point is if you're
looking<00:06:27.970> at<00:06:28.120> selling<00:06:28.540> things<00:06:28.870> on<00:06:29.170> the
