talked during picks and bans on this
night<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.600> thought<00:00:33.840> perhaps<00:00:34.050> at<00:00:34.320> first<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.710> was

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
night I thought perhaps at first it was

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.250 
night I thought perhaps at first it was
a<00:00:34.829> little<00:00:34.890> bit<00:00:35.250> bold<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.360> maybe<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.110> is

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
a little bit bold with the maybe this is

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
a little bit bold with the maybe this is
where<00:00:37.380> they<00:00:37.559> lost<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> game<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.670> problem<00:00:39.030> was

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
where they lost the game the problem was

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
where they lost the game the problem was
they<00:00:39.719> continue<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.410> then<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.100> pic<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
they continue to then kind of pic the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.880 
they continue to then kind of pic the
Nautilus<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.329> when<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:42.989> end<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.739> with

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
Nautilus which when you then end up with

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.950 
Nautilus which when you then end up with
the<00:00:43.950> Alister<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> first<00:00:44.870> rotation<00:00:45.870> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the Alister in the first rotation you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
the Alister in the first rotation you
can't<00:00:46.140> flex<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.590> Nautilus<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.219> end<00:00:47.399> up

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
can't flex the Nautilus you end up

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.090 
can't flex the Nautilus you end up
locked<00:00:47.910> into<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.390> composition<00:00:48.719> with

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
locked into this composition with

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.470 
locked into this composition with
ultimately<00:00:50.100> fairly<00:00:50.550> low<00:00:50.700> damage<00:00:50.910> after<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
ultimately fairly low damage after the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.029 
ultimately fairly low damage after the
Lucian<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> pick<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> cog<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
Lucian and then you pick a cog more and

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
Lucian and then you pick a cog more and
in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> lanes<00:00:53.760> don't<00:00:54.120> play<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.420> particularly

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
in the lanes don't play out particularly

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
in the lanes don't play out particularly
well<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.350> low<00:00:55.949> damage<00:00:56.160> until<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.699> COG<00:00:56.879> more

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
well so low damage until the COG more

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.040 
well so low damage until the COG more
and<00:00:57.180> he's<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> COG<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.750> needs<00:00:57.930> like

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and he's in the COG more needs like

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.680 
and he's in the COG more needs like
35-40<00:00:59.039> minutes<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.879> become<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
35-40 minutes to really become that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.709 
35-40 minutes to really become that
dominant<00:01:01.170> yeah<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:02.570> phonetic<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
dominant yeah I think phonetic is a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
dominant yeah I think phonetic is a
really<00:01:03.930> good<00:01:04.019> choice<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> burning<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.860> mid

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
really good choice of burning of the mid

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.289 
really good choice of burning of the mid
laners<00:01:05.369> he<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> game<00:01:05.850> even<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.210> they

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
laners he in that game even when they

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.969 
laners he in that game even when they
bent<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.630> themselves<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.470> made<00:01:07.740> sure<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
bent out themselves they made sure that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.760 
bent out themselves they made sure that
right<00:01:08.479> Paul<00:01:09.479> feel<00:01:09.720> doesn't<00:01:09.960> add<00:01:10.080> any<00:01:10.260> safe<00:01:10.530> mid

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
right Paul feel doesn't add any safe mid

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
right Paul feel doesn't add any safe mid
laners<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.159> blind<00:01:11.400> pig<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.330> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
laners to blind pig that they can that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.870 
laners to blind pig that they can that
Hindus<00:01:13.020> farm<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.340> game<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.580> always

Hindus farm on but the game was always
so<00:01:15.270> quickly<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.630> he<00:01:15.780> didn't<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.080> any

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
so quickly that he didn't have any

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.539 
so quickly that he didn't have any
impact<00:01:16.619> he<00:01:16.830> couldn't<00:01:17.070> even<00:01:17.100> play<00:01:17.280> league<00:01:17.460> of

what<00:02:47.220> they<00:02:47.370> should<00:02:47.580> do<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> first

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
out the same way I think they should

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.020 
out the same way I think they should

try to win early game and hope for the

best problem here in this series though

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.070 
best problem here in this series though
which<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.220> somewhat<00:03:05.730> unique<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:06.330> with<00:03:06.750> size

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
which is somewhat unique is with size

means if you want to change up one of
those<00:03:10.500> bands<00:03:10.800> fanatic<00:03:11.340> you're<00:03:11.460> going<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.670> have

those bands fanatic you're going to have

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.910 
those bands fanatic you're going to have
either<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> janitor<00:03:13.050> Calista<00:03:13.380> or<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> Lulu

either the janitor Calista or the Lulu
available<00:03:14.550> Kallis<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.540> probably<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.930> only

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
available Kallis is probably the only

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.780 
available Kallis is probably the only
one<00:03:16.170> there<00:03:16.290> first<00:03:16.500> rotation<00:03:16.980> out<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.580> lot

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
one there first rotation out of that lot

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.060 
one there first rotation out of that lot
but<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.390> be<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.290> know<00:03:19.380> if<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.590> locked<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:19.920> that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
but to be you know if you locked in that

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.860 
but to be you know if you locked in that
situation<00:03:20.370> when<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.090> start<00:03:21.390> having<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.690> mix

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
situation when you start having to mix

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.560 
situation when you start having to mix
up<00:03:22.020> bands<00:03:22.230> then<00:03:22.770> it<00:03:22.920> becomes<00:03:23.160> very<00:03:23.220> tricky<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
up bands then it becomes very tricky to

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.620 
up bands then it becomes very tricky to
actually<00:03:24.840> orchestrate<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> successful<00:03:26.190> pics

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
actually orchestrate a successful pics

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.940 
actually orchestrate a successful pics
once<00:03:27.630> again<00:03:27.780> like<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> series<00:03:28.680> against

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
once again like in the series against

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.340 
once again like in the series against
the<00:03:29.040> sleep<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.490> John<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.730> lotta<00:03:30.000> sole<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.510> in

the sleep and John a lotta sole and in
this<00:03:31.470> series<00:03:31.680> they<00:03:31.890> decided<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> ban<00:03:32.460> jana<00:03:32.640> so

this series they decided to ban jana so

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.150 
this series they decided to ban jana so
sure<00:03:33.210> we've<00:03:33.420> played<00:03:33.690> jana<00:03:33.990> but<00:03:34.230> i<00:03:34.440> think<00:03:34.710> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
sure we've played jana but i think the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.800 
sure we've played jana but i think the
only<00:03:35.190> reason<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.000> would<00:03:36.120> ever<00:03:36.240> pick<00:03:36.450> Jana's

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
only reason you would ever pick Jana's

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.510 
only reason you would ever pick Jana's
into<00:03:37.170> alistair<00:03:37.560> sure<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.950> first<00:03:38.190> rotation

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
into alistair sure the first rotation

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.650 
into alistair sure the first rotation
alistair<00:03:38.880> but<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.090> want<00:03:39.300> them<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.450> first

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
alistair but I want them to first

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.300 
alistair but I want them to first
rotation<00:03:40.080> Nautilus<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.650> not<00:03:41.010> let<00:03:41.190> us

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
rotation Nautilus and not let us

rotation Nautilus and not let us
consider<00:03:41.670> one<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.910> better<00:03:42.120> supports

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
consider one of the better supports

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.810 
consider one of the better supports
against<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.260> Jana<00:03:43.500> because<00:03:43.860> not<00:03:44.010> loose<00:03:44.220> as<00:03:44.459> a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
against the Jana because not loose as a

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.790 
against the Jana because not loose as a
top<00:03:45.120> laner<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:46.080> example<00:03:46.140> Shanna's<00:03:46.620> all

top laner and for example Shanna's all

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.740 
top laner and for example Shanna's all
really<00:03:47.220> strong<00:03:47.459> before<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.910> first<00:03:48.120> base<00:03:48.390> and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
really strong before the first base and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.150 
really strong before the first base and
can<00:03:49.080> do<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> lot<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.440> damage<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.890> channel

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
can do a lot of damage to the channel

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.860 
can do a lot of damage to the channel
we'll<00:03:50.670> see<00:03:50.910> what<00:03:51.060> they<00:03:51.209> adapt<00:03:51.570> on<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
we'll see what they adapt on the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.480 
we'll see what they adapt on the
analysis<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.290> almost<00:03:52.590> longer<00:03:52.980> than<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> game

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
analysis is almost longer than the game

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.980 
analysis is almost longer than the game
so<00:03:53.730> let's<00:03:53.880> hope<00:03:54.090> for<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.390> all<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.810> goes<00:03:54.959> a

so let's hope for you all that it goes a

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.840 
so let's hope for you all that it goes a
bit<00:03:55.290> better<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:55.890> Game<00:03:56.130> two<00:03:56.160> it's<00:03:56.459> time<00:03:56.640> for<00:03:56.820> a

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
bit better in Game two it's time for a

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
bit better in Game two it's time for a
quick<00:03:57.090> break<00:03:57.360> as<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.780> will<00:03:57.990> look<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.200> recover
