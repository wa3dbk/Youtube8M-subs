00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:16.749
 Friday 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.479
 good conditions I think we are not ready 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.879
 true the death nor with the seven sites for how long 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.799
 to try to walk them around the world

 p it's too much pressed on nuke r1 and 15 dead the season 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.449
 the film realized what happens to you you must not under any circumstances 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.199
 of a certain age 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:53.199
 but nasser started to resume a normal course

 Taillefer a new adaptation 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.719
 this last third 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.029
 it's long 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.209
 that's it's a lot of work but it's worth it to believe 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:10.219
 but what is the hardest 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.199
 The constancy 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.169
 we will have scored last year 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.639
 but not turned off this week his first weeks when my wife's 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.639
 show at an asm n 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.079
 his some 120 to do a meal show dancing his mother was telling me 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.169
 that she was capable 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.480
 we are left to know in which are your kids who do not share his share 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.419
 ferrari all over the newspapers during the winners this number is a 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.869
 true jewel 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:36.799
 left alone in leading roles more touched with the hiv-aids st martin 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.659
 business show for calls to the inseparable here is what 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.659
 daniel lamarre of the big bosses of this business 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.219
 which is especially true to lighten its participation to participate 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.170
 indeed when the sun 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.800
 but I think the place p hart is that he is and is really pushed to 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.290
 the extreme in this trapeze number has always been practiced 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.000
 but already a good point too that our two Quebecers arrived with a 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.130
 artistic approach that was very advanced 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.130
 special interest and that I think it looks like us 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.830
 obviously 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.320
 yes to be as good as it takes a lot of practice each 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.109
 day in all edges of each chicken c 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.819
 he had lost the landmarks and the dance and the scope of this call had mostly 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.150
 not when we see moreover 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.779
 and it's still a little salt on Tuesday because yesterday 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:30.789
 neftali no show at 1 76 m -and I talked about it with carious petraeus 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:31.970
 a good day the skin 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.749
 who does not know the city 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:37.259
 result women can be commented on Tuesday so it needs to be 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.080
 changes are actually m question of doing 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.929
 yet the researchers tested on august 9th i will quote nobody m ap 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.729
 had first days the barn 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.440
 it makes progress 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.440
 this is where the costumes are for all the artists 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.610
 and for reminder only voices of the ump 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.719
 it was done but I'm it's true a sanction that work 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.210
 this village 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.379
 and he helped us in retirement but showed his muscles 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.539
 to have the bank esteem sts after a particular challenge this is one of 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:12.960
 items 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.960
 we do not know 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.460
 but a lot of time very short pasquier castings and matra everywhere I 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.879
 can go under a drizzle with high potential 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.389
 but if muck henjak and on the gardens to give up I think a 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.389
 been approached chi for design week is m 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.040
 so if you can go see that he said the other benefit chapter 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.570
 6% in July because this time that were discovered by employees 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.300
 while what to do 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.629
 for sandrine this sum would be very good idea to tell these 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.250
 investors could advance its agenda 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.340
 it is the share of these active investors
