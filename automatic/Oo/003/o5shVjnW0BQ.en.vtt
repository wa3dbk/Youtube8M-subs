00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.040 
girls are as lucky as me but I want to
do<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.239> well<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.930> have

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
do this for you as well so you can have

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.139 
do this for you as well so you can have
a<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.410> bit<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> escapism<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.969> life

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a little bit of escapism from your life

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
a little bit of escapism from your life
because<00:00:54.539> many<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.140> probably<00:00:55.530> won't<00:00:55.770> get

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
because many of you probably won't get

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.819 
because many of you probably won't get
engaged<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:56.879> married<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.600> all<00:00:57.809> she's<00:00:58.410> awful

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
engaged or married at all she's awful

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.330 
engaged or married at all she's awful
really

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
really

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.549 
really
so<00:01:00.059> perhaps<00:01:00.239> treat<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.469> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so perhaps treat this as a little bit of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.950 
so perhaps treat this as a little bit of
escapism<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.940> reality<00:01:03.210> TV<00:01:03.600> or
