00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.420
 Hello such friends as are good the 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.020
 today I'm going to make a video of 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.830
 a chia water yes it is true that chia 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.840
 It is great to lose weight 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.980
 I know people from my family who do not 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.750
 are taking and lately they have 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.749
 I went to the doctor and the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.749
 cholesterol triglycerides and then 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.820
 has many benefits I know that the 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.820
 chia also because on the facebook that 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.910
 I've been seeing that it's bad for 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.399
 certain people or do not believe that 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.430
 because the chia is where you want to be 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.510
 is listening is because they will lose 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.879
 weight and it's very miraculous before you take it 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.960
 investigate talk to your doctor before 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.120
 to be taking it I know it's bad 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.660
 for people suffering from pressure 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.210
 high I do not know that I read it on the internet 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.510
 Well, I 'm not a doctor for 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 tell them if it's true not then before 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.180
 take it talk to your doctor so that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.240
 tell them if they can take it or not 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.920
 you can obviously take the chia 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.040
 great because it has omega 3 has 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.430
 fiber has many things then here 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.660
 in the description I'm going to put 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.960
 some of the benefits that the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.260
 chia 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.590
 all that chia needs is that the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.490
 soak because they absorb 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 a lot of water I've read that absorb 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.369
 more than 20 times some people say 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.909
 that more than 30 times I do not know what the 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.220
 true its original size I do not know if 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.440
 you put imagine these seeds 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.290
 they are tiny if you put them in the water 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.680
 they are going to become huge then not 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.810
 the well must be dry before 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.440
 take the the have to moisturize so 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.760
 minus 10 minutes 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.400
 and this has no taste has no smell 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.890
 knows nothing can be taken the only thing 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.620
 that it is a bit unpleasant that it has 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.780
 a gel that is made as it is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.810
 it's half bavosÃ­ is but from there in 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.810
 outside does not know anything the way that in 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.120
 I love that sometimes prepare 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.400
 nothing grabbed a glass of water and 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.090
 I put a spoonful of chia I leave it there 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.090
 about 10 minutes and I take it but the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.000
 another day I made it with lemon and it tastes very 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.620
 very good indeed neither feel and nor do 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.710
 they are not even aware that they are 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.650
 taking nothing then easy then and 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.500
 I'm going to prepare the water right now 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.210
 to not be here this grabbing of 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.400
 its good time friends look here now 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.400
 I have a jug with water I will not do 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.080
 a lot because I like to finish it and it's 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.180
 very good to have jugs because if the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.300
 they have in sight and reminds them that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.690
 they should drink water obviously first 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.540
 I'll sweeten with sugar this will 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.580
 be therefore obvious to your liking of you that 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.320
 want to add since they sweetened the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.640
 water will add what's coming 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.910
 being the lemon juice 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.000
 here already squeeze like 4 or lemons 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.400
 I have lemon 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.080
 what is being the chia I'm going to 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.080
 put about 3 tablespoons 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.210
 [Music] 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.640
 and I 'm also going to put some slices of 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.130
 lemon to make it richer I'm going to 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.490
 make an approach for them to see how 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.250
 you see the seeds 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.950
 and wait in about ten minutes two 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.840
 vana sponge then I'll wait 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.620
 a moment of going back to agitate 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.440
 to make them look 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.440
 enough 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.150
 then I'll wait a little while and 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.340
 now they will see that they are going to do 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.730
 more I expose they are going to sponge more because 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.930
 they will absorb liquid is very dangerous 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.610
 to take them and so be dry because as 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.070
 It absorbs a lot of liquid 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.459
 dehydrating that is why they must 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.350
 hydrate before consuming it I will leave 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.260
 spend 10 minutes and right now I'll be back 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.310
 as you can see here and the seeds 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.350
 already sponge aaron and well they already passed 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.320
 10 minutes now we can take our 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:36.289
 with before taking the lajita so that 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:39.439
 do not stay all the way down 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:43.930
 well I'll serve here in a glass I'll 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:43.930
 to try and I've tried but 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.760
 I have also read that they should not be taken 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.370
 and a lot of milestones are taking 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.980
 little by little so that it will not be 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.050
 damage the only thing that before they leave it 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.230
 a little time the seeds are going to sit 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.630
 but with a spoon they move him and 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.000
 again they take again is the 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.100
 really very good as I say the no longer 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.560
 knows nothing has no smell 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.630
 taste I hope you liked the 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.880
 video do not forget to share it if you 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.630
 he liked to take care and see you 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.900
 the next 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.900
 goodbye
