00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.920
 hey people today was yours 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.500
 desired recipe I asked myself 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.660
 If I compare this recipe for you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.920
 to prepare for a video 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.500
 should and until tuesday at 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.119
 Posted at that time and he wanted it so 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.800
 you want to see him and that's why he wants to do it 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.170
 this colorful noodles men beautiful 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 yummy sauce and you first see 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.279
 how do you already have tablet 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 just turn it on and with one 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.969
 bit equipped and color one 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.360
 I have already had paprika 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.660
 gutted and what an electrician likes 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:47.670
 Next we cut these the hitlers 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.230
 the very fine strip what, why 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.110
 Is there a wall? Why is that? 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.090
 once cut very finely 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.649
 for the simple reason the enemies of 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.989
 tailor even if magath it right 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.940
 by the vegetables once a banner 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.739
 pivoted 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.559
 I will show you then but still 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.869
 before we have to do everything nice 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.920
 cut doner kebab 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.860
 is the next I take here 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.960
 zucchini martini cut front 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.619
 let hintendran 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.689
 What are we going to do ? 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.670
 once we have one automatically 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.009
 cheerful and that's a nice way 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.900
 many wages zucchini slices too 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.750
 and I always do that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.759
 until the center sue to the cores 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.180
 are 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.470
 because the housing is often the works in the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.229
 do the same but with a carrot 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.560
 the next I still mister red cabbage 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.930
 and I'll take a little red one 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.610
 because I do not have many buttons right 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.460
 to process salad first 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.800
 or the red cabbage but do for this 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.360
 video I need halt 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.080
 45 sheets therefore relatively stupid but what 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.630
 you should do it 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.240
 so now I have my red cabbage here 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.840
 who now could not be solved so beautiful 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.850
 the first time as a video did 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.880
 That's why I have here now 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.030
 relatively explanatory and what am I doing 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.590
 that of course once around and catch 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:36.310
 now on and schneider stripe here too 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:39.580
 down thin strips are the same 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.440
 like all the drivers have in the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.190
 pan the bee once and that 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.390
 always take me full grain 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.790
 because that's just more 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.940
 yes and we will now just 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.060
 Cook when the noodles are cooking 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.870
 because it's our super delicious sauce 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.300
 there we need it once and that 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.799
 I have in my leaves but I have 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.019
 of course, a glass on stock 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.870
 always enough now for breakfast is 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:16.450
 not always sometimes interrupted exactly 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:23.700
 Honey does not throw away honey and honey 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.739
 the guy there is once one 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.470
 tablespoon in here 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:34.840
 it was not enough by the way very good 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:38.940
 mother then we take soy sauce 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.670
 and only once and a half 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:48.519
 tablespoon we take two more 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.170
 teaspoon honey then take for the 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.239
 keen a bit boss need yes 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.209
 a bit cayenne or 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:00.420
 spicy paprika powder and then take 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.420
 We then a quarter teaspoon 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.409
 that crush here now 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.530
 stir 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:15.730
 me is a nice crowd is what you 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.919
 I have forgotten that I always 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.769
 to have some choice of water and have that 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:24.550
 I now have two and a half tablespoons of water 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.990
 to give what I do now I do that 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.919
 club scores peeled and my fingers 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.770
 are really already from the blue of the 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.600
 motto I rub her after her one more 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.840
 Do not make garlic cloves rows mister 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.820
 I like it just for the taste, the 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.070
 here just stir and me 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.370
 had nonsense except bits 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.270
 in it 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.190
 I do not think that's really tasty 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.260
 agree that I find the very delicious 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.789
 noodles are in the water what are we doing 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.919
 now our mens and then 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.960
 Let's add some oil in there 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.449
 In this case you already have one 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.430
 Asian little touch of I take 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:08.680
 You would not have to do anything with coconut oil that way 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.669
 theme once all look 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.360
 let it melt and then we give 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:19.090
 our vegetables from it but just here 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.669
 everything by panning throughout 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.780
 mix 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:27.010
 that I mix all vegetables and 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.260
 in itself just these shine 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.910
 beautiful colors here that comes easy 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.080
 not all things heart 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.740
 Dangerous it takes four more 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.410
 minutes 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.900
 and then we almost have one 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.570
 delicious recipe so that's it 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.210
 vegetable shield on brushed noodles 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.550
 I drained it three seconds ago and 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.070
 come in here just like 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.550

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.229

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.620
 Of course, here are our beautiful ones 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:06:00.340
 peanut sauce this once and that 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.900
 is simply completely lowered by the 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.729
 flag special story that's why 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.190
 I also used an iron object 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.650
 could respond like to look after 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.770

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:15.810

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:20.560
 in the cellar then give with toasted 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:22.900
 sesame and flowers can scatter over it 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.520
 that's my stock of last 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.440

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:42.000
 and then we discuss everything was something 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.590

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.720
 last seen these delicious modules too 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.830
 It's easy when you just do it 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.539
 only if you were vegetables 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.530

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:54.010
