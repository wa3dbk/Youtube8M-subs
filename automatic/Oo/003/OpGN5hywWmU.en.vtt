00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello welcome to this new issue 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.820
 build your choo and today we're going 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.340
 make garlands origami here 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.730
 pretty deco pretty and that can be 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.400
 decline to infinity to make a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.039
 origami garland you need some 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.890
 paper make sure you take a paper 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.720
 because and mine is only one centimeter 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.260
 15 cm otherwise it's missed 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.480
 a good nylon thread needle and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.940
 scissors just to cut the thread for 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.540
 to make the babies grunt just cut into 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:46.920
 four my 15 by 15 sheet this bar the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:49.789
 band bar the meat or whatever 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.789
 thing in the other direction 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.480
 so I have means 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.500
 mnemonics at every step so I 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:09.120
 wanted said it can serve 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:09.120
 the cfnr then the diagonals him 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.340
 m 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.740
 you fold in half that makes a triangle 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.510
 point to the bottom 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.500
 you will fold his sides there to 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:33.450
 inside to make a small lot zinc 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:35.960
 square but so here are the pieces 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.800
 that they were there they are two in 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.310
 then you take the corner so here 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.750
 you have a line in the middle of the first 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.300
 point and you're just going to have it stick 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.540
 the edge on the middle line of the two 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.540
 sides 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.320
 and you bend the top there is the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:13.130
 diamond you open you take this flap 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:26.060
 there you're going to flatten it oise 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:27.709
 no flatten its light partition it's 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.220
 the symbol by keeping parents not 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:34.090
 return to me and you do the same 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.090
 thing on the other side 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.760
 then now that you have the 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.200
 rhombus that you 'll do as if 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:11.099
 you turn a forgotten page for 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:15.400
 turn the same and there is the dso 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:20.069
 then you will fold this piece 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.890
 there up to have a triangle 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.750
 an isosceles triangle I say no it's me 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.340
 I think it's good we come to the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.079
 end now you have to go out your head and 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:36.639
 the tail of the crane head there I 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:42.280
 see a little to flatten the same 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:44.769
 the other side and after you choose the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.310
 side more missed you saw that one 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.810
 that I tore to make head 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.139
 since after that catches the group you 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.139
 believe 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:03.610
 and is it to finalize you are going 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:05.770
 fold the wings twirl you 'll be able 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.970
 also do with a grease pencil 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.950
 screwdriver it depends what are you going to 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.830
 office I put a black background for that 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.560
 you better see this little son then 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.160

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.440
 choice of your church hop and you 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:26.320
 pierce the small mountain in the middle 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:33.040
 of your crane by m here you are redone 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:41.100
