00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.969
 hello everyone and welcome to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.340
 another lesson knitting father shimon and in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 In this lesson we will analyze the most 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.579
 simple kind of loops when crocheting 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.990
 this is exactly knitting air loop in 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.380
 the moment you see before you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.929
 chain of air loops 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 it usually begins with this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.730
 any 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.370
 crochet with a set of chains 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.370
 from air loops and let's see 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 how are we these air loops 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 will knit 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.380
 first do the first crochet loop 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.630
 use for this 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.120
 any method that you like me 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:57.690
 use my favorite way after 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.970
 how we made the first loop now our 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.000
 the task is to take in hand itself 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:07.979
 knitting we have a short tip thread 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.490
 we have a long thread tip short 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.770
 the tip of the thread we should lie here 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.610
 so in the palm we can for it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.720
 stay a little longer but the tip 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.940
 the threads i put on my index finger here 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.820
 in this way that is medium and large 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.830
 finger I hold hold on 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.060
 short thread tip in this way 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.150
 sticking knitting 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.900
 and working thread that comes from the ball 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.460
 I put on my index finger a little bit 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.479
 sticking it out so that it was 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.890
 space to grab the thread and what we 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.470
 we do further continue to capture the work 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.170
 the thread I do it this way 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.330
 someone does it like this but personally 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.100
 with such a capture worker strings 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.710
 the thread often flies off the hook runs away from 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.140
 capture so much more comfortable for me 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.780
 how to hold a hook under the thread and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:16.760
 grab her captured working thread and 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.760
 we stretch it to our first loop 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:26.190
 ready we tied the first air loop 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.299
 grab the working thread again and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.209
 again we stretch into the loop 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.040
 the loop which is on the hook is called 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:41.220
 working grab the thread and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.200
 stretch grab and stretch 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.120
 try not to delay knitting 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:54.840
 air loops must be free 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:56.910
 stretched captured and stretched for example 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.430
 when we have the chain has become quite 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.590
 big we just 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.140
 intercepted and begin to hold 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.230
 already the air chain itself is medium and 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.819
 thumb closer to the handle so knit 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.400
 it will be much more convenient to capture and 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.859
 we stretch how 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.200
 count the number of air loops 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.299
 a chain of air loops look like here 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.930
 so we practically 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.560
 it turns out a spikelet from the front 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.030
 and her 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:35.040
 and here are the links of the chain with the purl 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.010
 consider loops on the front side loop 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.569
 which is on the hook does not accept 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.120
 participation in the calculation 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.160
 she is working and as long as 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.220
 she is not tied she is not considered 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.840
 so start counting with the next 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:04:03.470
 loops in c3 and so you see two links 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:13.980
 This is our 1 air loop 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:16.470
 8 9 10 10 air loops nothing 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.199
 there is no complicated knitting of air loops 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.209
 so wish you a pleasant knitting and to 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.860
 meeting in the next lesson 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.860
 sincerely your sachet moon
