00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.430
 very proud to represent a brand 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.040
 as history as as alfano with so much 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.040
 history in racing especially 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.420
 not long ago but they are also 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.210
 coming back again and good since 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.610
 we do is so stylish contact so much 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 style so much charisma man of the 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.840
 Italians are artists in design 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.119
 of our very good has nothing to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.680
 see with for example the Japanese or the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.220
 Germans have something else not that makes them 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.220
 makes very beautiful cars very beautiful 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.630
 compared to the Germans are more 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.470
 conservatives or the Japanese are more 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.470
 more conservatives 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.820
 more classics more enrolled in the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.430
 because it provides the giulietta and the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.370
 myth I could not prove it but outside 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 it also seemed similar to giulietta the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.559
 rising star product right now is 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.830
 the 407 as I said before super light in 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.450
 the curves looks like a big kart and the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.960
 time to change I have seen very few 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.750
 changes so fast with even 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 is practically the one for the change that 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.590
 I wear on my motorcycle is not different is not 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 a racing motorcycle is a prototype 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.060
 which is specially designed for 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.100
 run 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.690
 with the car that I ran with him with 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.610
 the award or with him 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.650
 with the salt of banquinas 24 hours are 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.830
 series cars modified for the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.830
 condition 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.270
 two 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.280
 the previous step to formula 1 are the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.490
 that impresses me a lot because it was very 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.890
 complicated to adapt defined 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.890
 45 hours of test 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.330
 and a gp2 car is bigger than that of 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.610
 motorcycle gp 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.060
 in fact it's 7 seconds faster than 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.070
 my time in motogp in the race of 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.040
 2012 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.930
 on the straight it ran less but the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.240
 cars run less on the straight if 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.050
 we take the motogp curves with the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.640
 time is slower I prefer that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.960
 take but if there is no other way 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.310
 so why me why 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.060
 the truth that I train very hard 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.410
 physically when I go home 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.140
 during the ride I'm tired 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.180
 and if I have someone to my father 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.210
 or a friend who can drive I leave 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.260
 drive to them and I go to sleep at 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.379
 side but sometimes 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.049
 I like to drive or to drive in the 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.620
 track if I have to compete and that 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.299
 like but just circular possible 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.970
 I have to do something but but if not 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:53.100
 I can avoid it 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.990
 by car because the bike is delicate 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.640
 It is very comfortable it is very practical in town 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.580
 for example go between scooters you want 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.730
 now his motorcycle in time 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.270
 and the freedom of a motorcycle does not have to 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.920
 see with 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.460
 with the freedom that a car offers you 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.320
 that is covered up for one more bike 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.320
 more to the air and a freedom is offered 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.000
 special but it's a bit dangerous what 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.000
 a little dangerous 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.720
 they make photos, some said they have helped 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.140
 and sometime next if you analyzed them has 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.930
 uploaded enough 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.239
 depends on policy depends 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:38.750
 It depends on caravan caravan I remember 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.359
 2001 two years we did in bed 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.720
 europe we have a team we have the 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.520
 competition 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.460
 I do not know if the sportsmen accompanied 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.380
 we travel all europe with hawk with 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.850
 van that there was 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.790
 many members the team that was very 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.410
 horny if we put all of the trip 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.410
 shining and very good roll
