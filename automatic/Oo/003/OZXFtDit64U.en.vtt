00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hong Kong 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:28.509
 and van classics is born from a hobby 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:32.710
 I love classic cars 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.990
 can you can that's why at the birth of a 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 hobby 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.500
 is my idea is that somehow it's 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.430
 a business that people when they come 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 here you are at home in fact the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.830
 office is mounted in homes at home to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.260
 the British in a garage next door I have 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.830
 a garage where I make my own 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.210
 projects I ride my cars and finally 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.390
 what it's about is that people 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.140
 when he comes here he is at home 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.140
 calm and relaxed 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.630
 and 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.180
 We are specialized in many brands 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.460
 of classic cars especially in car 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.400
 British and we can work on axes 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.310
 morris austin healey lotus bentley rolls 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.620
 aston martin competition force from 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.050
 a point to a cosmos even cetex 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.990
 current 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.420
 in fact the funny thing is that sometimes we 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.550
 we gather friends come here they take a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.400
 coffee they come for their refill and 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.890
 we started doing the coÃ±a of you that is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.260
 better than the other mine is more expensive than 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.010
 keep but instead I enjoy it more 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.770
 in short this type of car is somewhat 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.680
 special is that they are not usually 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.170
 easy to maintain because they are covered 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.630
 also here 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.619
 our latest project 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.920
 a miracle it's about a mini frames it's 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.890
 It's really fun because it's a mini with 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.140
 fiberglass body built 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.019
 so the drivers of the amc will 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.030
 they passed pipe running Germans like the 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.480
 mini was small they were not allowed to run 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.370
 by category and made them grow to 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.450
 to be able to enter German they did not gain anything but 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 they had a pipe 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.390
 this is the mini frame project 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:37.170
 he is a minister of fiberglass 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:39.900
 body with slightly wider for 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.790
 all right 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.250
 now he is in a sorry state the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.660
 sanding process and its fruit we have 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.620
 arrived we did not have to arrive I'm 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.870
 working inside or outside 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.550
 changing for the rotten the few that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.090
 they are metallic and the only thing that we lack 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.370
 is to give a final touch to paint and then 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.870
 will be something 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.379
 Type the next you have to go 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.379
 quiet 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.510
 In short, what you will find in 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.739
 Ivan Classics is a home business 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.890
 where will you find yourself at ease 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.420
 relaxed and where you can find everything 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.480
 the spare part that your 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.480
 classic without complications see you 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.650
