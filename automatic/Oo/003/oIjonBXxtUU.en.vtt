00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
the beer flames return we're finishing

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.039 
the beer flames return we're finishing

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049

our college for the competitive hey look
3d<00:00:04.319> maps<00:00:04.560> now<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:04.920> map<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.220> called<00:00:05.250> contract

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
3d maps now this map is called contract

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.340 
3d maps now this map is called contract
and<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> pretty<00:00:06.390> vertical<00:00:06.629> map<00:00:07.080> it<00:00:07.230> is

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
and is a pretty vertical map it is

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.990 
and is a pretty vertical map it is
asymmetrical<00:00:08.130> so<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> same<00:00:08.519> calls<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.849> not

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
asymmetrical so the same calls to not

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.700 
asymmetrical so the same calls to not
apply<00:00:09.210> for<00:00:09.450> both<00:00:09.599> sides<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.380> really<00:00:10.590> have

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
apply for both sides so you really have

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.709 
apply for both sides so you really have
to<00:00:10.860> remember<00:00:11.340> all<00:00:11.610> these<00:00:11.790> memorize<00:00:12.389> them<00:00:12.540> so

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
to remember all these memorize them so

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.030 
to remember all these memorize them so
you<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:12.929> play<00:00:13.170> them<00:00:13.259> really<00:00:13.530> effectively

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
you can play them really effectively

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.680 
you can play them really effectively
when<00:00:14.190> you're<00:00:14.280> playing<00:00:14.460> on<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.759> map<00:00:15.000> also<00:00:15.480> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
did say I was gonna do the halo 2 mass

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.500 
did say I was gonna do the halo 2 mass
but<00:00:17.460> now<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:17.580> gonna<00:00:17.670> wait<00:00:17.880> until<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.210> Master

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you see like I said earlier in the intro

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.830 
you see like I said earlier in the intro
that<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> pretty<00:00:50.700> vertical<00:00:50.910> map<00:00:51.300> there's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that is a pretty vertical map there's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.479 
that is a pretty vertical map there's
about<00:00:52.199> three<00:00:52.530> different<00:00:52.680> levels<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
about three different levels to it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.860 
about three different levels to it
though<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> mean<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.270> pretty<00:00:54.510> much<00:00:54.719> you're

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
though I mean it's pretty much you're

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
though I mean it's pretty much you're
always<00:00:54.989> scaling<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> map<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.100> off<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.760> RIP

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
always scaling the map so off the RIP

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
always scaling the map so off the RIP
the<00:00:57.030> spawns<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.870> either<00:00:58.050> spawn<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.280> on

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the spawns you either spawn here or on

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.709 
the spawns you either spawn here or on
the<00:00:59.460> opposite<00:00:59.850> side<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.300> playing<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the opposite side when playing the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.660 
the opposite side when playing the
competitive<00:01:01.199> mode<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.219> side<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.520> called

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
competitive mode now this side is called

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
competitive mode now this side is called
open<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> reason<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.570> knot<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.870> called<00:01:03.930> open

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
open the reason this knot is called open

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
open the reason this knot is called open
because<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.250> pretty<00:01:05.460> much<00:01:05.580> open

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
because you see it's pretty much open

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.330 
because you see it's pretty much open
there's<00:01:06.240> an<00:01:06.330> open<00:01:06.659> ramp<00:01:06.900> there's<00:01:07.710> an<00:01:07.830> open<00:01:08.159> way

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
there's an open ramp there's an open way

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250 
there's an open ramp there's an open way
and<00:01:08.700> over<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.270> only<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.840> little

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and over here there's only one little

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
and over here there's only one little
street<00:01:10.950> over<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.220> which<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.970> why<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.240> call

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
street over here which is why we call

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
street over here which is why we call
that<00:01:12.540> side<00:01:12.810> close<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.380> starting<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.189> this

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that side close so starting with this

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.020 
that side close so starting with this
side<00:01:14.930> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.200> owed<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.250> because

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
side this is owed to right here because

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
side this is owed to right here because
this<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> second<00:01:18.900> main<00:01:19.110> floor<00:01:19.439> that's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
this is the second main floor that's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.469 
this is the second main floor that's
over<00:01:20.549> there<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:21.060> -<00:01:21.409> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.590> called<00:01:22.830> donut

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
over there see - this is called donut

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
over there see - this is called donut
big-ass<00:01:24.479> hole<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.710> doesn't<00:01:25.770> look<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
big-ass hole it doesn't look like a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.749 
big-ass hole it doesn't look like a
donut<00:01:26.790> unless<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.470> Krispy<00:01:28.470> Kremes<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
donut unless you like Krispy Kremes and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
donut unless you like Krispy Kremes and
so<00:01:30.150> that's<00:01:30.329> why<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.570> called<00:01:30.630> donut<00:01:31.049> over

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
so that's why it's called donut over

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.940 
so that's why it's called donut over

here before the glass ends is called

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.490 
here before the glass ends is called
River<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:03.149> continue<00:02:03.659> down<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> river<00:02:04.229> this

River as we continue down the river this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.560 
River as we continue down the river this
is<00:02:04.560> called<00:02:04.920> laser<00:02:05.189> because<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> default

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
is called laser because in the default

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.240 
is called laser because in the default
map<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.259> Spartan<00:02:07.649> laser<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.950> spawns

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
map there is a Spartan laser that spawns

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.770 
map there is a Spartan laser that spawns
there<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.729> that's<00:02:08.819> why<00:02:09.030> people<00:02:09.060> call<00:02:09.509> this

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
there and so that's why people call this

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.740 
there and so that's why people call this
entire<00:02:10.410> from<00:02:10.649> section<00:02:10.950> right<00:02:11.099> here<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> laser

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
entire from section right here the laser

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.710 
entire from section right here the laser
now<00:02:12.750> over<00:02:12.989> here<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:13.290> have<00:02:13.410> our
