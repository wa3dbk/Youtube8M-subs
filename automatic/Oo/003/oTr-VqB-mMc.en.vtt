00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.469
 this time I'm going to tell you all 10 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.020
 commandments to use good law the 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.300
 number 1 is to wear underwear the same 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.189
 color of your leggins and avoid the 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.810
 stamped on your underwear over 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.210
 all for example when you are going to use 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.510
 law inflate things with this happens 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.520
 use a pink underwear or a 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.100
 color that stands out too much if you go 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.649
 use a white law of preference 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.230
 use white underwear 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.600
 of skin color so that they do not notice and in 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.969
 case of using black equally not 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.469
 use nothing white and do not use 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.719
 also the prints because you have 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:47.239
 notice that the leggings are made of a fabric 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.039
 which is elastic and when one has 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.210
 spent when they make a kind of 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.429
 movement stretches the fabric and color 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.239
 of the garment is exposed the point 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.190
 number 2 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.649
 is that you also give the leggings the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.359
 leggins for being an elastic fabric 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.390
 as I mentioned it in general 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.960
 come one size or one unit 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.479
 so 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.240
 many times they are supposedly going to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.920
 look good leggings for being 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.390
 adaptable for its elasticity but the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.220
 most of the time it's not like that there's 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.260
 some people who have left or 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 too loose and there are some people to 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.159
 those that are too tight 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.869
 then to people especially that 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.640
 they are too tight that this 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.740
 make your underwear because your 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.930
 skin translucent on the fabric and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.140
 this is not going to look good 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.540
 third commandment the means are not 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.030
 laws many women think that by the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.190
 made to be able to use leggings you can 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.200
 use the stockings in the same way but 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.360
 this is completely wrong the stockings 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.880
 They are made of a lot more material 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 thin so your underwear or your 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.820
 skin can be seen through the fabric 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.729
 then never use the stockings as 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.160
 fourth commandment laws are not clothes 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.440
 sporty many women will be able to believe 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.910
 that by the elasticity of the garment 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.160
 These are very comfortable to do 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.020
 exercise but keep in mind that also 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.780
 They are made of a material too 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.780
 thin so by doing some kind 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.360
 of effort could make you something much 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.610
 oven then never use it as 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.650
 garment to do sport and better ponte 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.830
 something comfortable and suitable to do 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.780
 sport fifth commandment never 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.520
 use underwear that fits you 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.740
 too tight 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.420
 because this is only going to make you 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.530
 Mark those parts you want 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.300
 hide then instead of disguise 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.940
 you a little logic what will do 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.790
 that breaks it is going to make you look 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.860
 like a hoax is to achieve everything 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.550
 flat 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.220
 Do not wear white leggings to many 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.660
 women love to use leggings 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.790
 white forgiveness 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.100
 even me when I was too young 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.990
 I remember having used leggings dishes 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.410
 but the reality is that white is a 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.000
 color that stands out instead of disguising 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.850
 the things that we want 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.740
 consult the color is very good with the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.870
 Black forgiveness is a good color for 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.150
 hide 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.430
 especially cellulite and white is 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.349
 very good to highlight especially the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.690
 cellulite then if what you want is 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.269
 hide I recommend you do not use 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.150
 white laws in addition to that being of 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.370
 color are garments that are more delicate 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.670
 and therefore more likely to break 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.670
 easily know how to say goodbye 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.709
 when a garment is already broken and is 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.989
 too worn out will be too much 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.209
 well for the dog as you want here in 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.400
 mexico then it's best to tell 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.099
 goodbye the lakers have already complied with 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.200
 your assignments and if they are your favorites 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.879
 You can find other favorites or 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.709
 you can look for others that are very 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.010
 like instead of using 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.250
 some logs that no longer serve 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.900
 Leggings are not girdles, I know that 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.239
 elastic sutel many think that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.700
 they can become like sashes but not 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.799
 they are not good for you to try 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.230
 disguise those chubby on the contrary 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.030
 sometimes when you put on a legend 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.909
 too tight the only thing you do is 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.129
 highlight the most so do not use a 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.140
 link as a better girdle uses one 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.479
 completely of your size and that 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.209
 adjust well to your body so that it looks 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.799
 even in your body and do not stand out 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.240
 those chubby that we do not want 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.380
 show learn to combine them 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.380
 for example 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.819
 learn to combine them is not the same 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.460
 use a plain color link as 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:42.340
 black to use some prints with 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.740
 animal print note your weight and 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.630
 way and your body shape then to 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.690
 the gorditas we are better to use 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.330
 smooth colors because this will disguise 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.910
 the areas that we have where we have a 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.470
 little bit more and wings that are too many 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.449
 skinny if you should use 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.190
 prints because this will create more 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.380
 volume in them 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.770
 finally remember that fashion 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.730
 that accommodates you so we better see you 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.730
 the next video
