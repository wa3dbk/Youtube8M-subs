00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
got it backwards ah looks like that's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.940 
got it backwards ah looks like that's
the<00:01:53.759> zoom<00:01:54.090> right<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.840> let's<00:01:55.020> i<00:01:55.259> guess

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the zoom right there so let's i guess

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
the zoom right there so let's i guess
we'll<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.280> flip<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.729> over<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.390> all

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
we'll just flip this over and get all

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
we'll just flip this over and get all
this<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.890> I'll<00:01:58.890> set<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.219> down<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:01.399> right

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
this out I'll set that down so right

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.639 
this out I'll set that down so right
here<00:02:02.610> we've<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.450> zune<00:02:03.930> everywhere<00:02:04.500> this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
here we've got the zune everywhere this

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.970 
here we've got the zune everywhere this
is<00:02:04.740> actually<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> first<00:02:05.100> zoo

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
is actually the first zoo

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.740 
is actually the first zoo
rad<00:02:06.160> because<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.970> zune<00:02:07.180> hasn't<00:02:07.600> been<00:02:07.720> very

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
rad because the zune hasn't been very

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.590 
rad because the zune hasn't been very
appealing<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.620> me<00:02:08.740> so<00:02:08.980> let's<00:02:09.220> take<00:02:10.120> a<00:02:10.150> look<00:02:10.540> at

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600

this folder you're not for it but little

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.650 
this folder you're not for it but little
punched<00:02:16.330> her<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.480> guess<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.750> would<00:02:16.840> say<00:02:16.870> I

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
punched her I guess you would say I

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.970 
punched her I guess you would say I
basically<00:02:19.660> explaining<00:02:20.350> all<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.650> stuff<00:02:20.830> it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
walkthrough of the zune and then we got

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.880 
walkthrough of the zune and then we got
something<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.460> back<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.640> suits<00:02:31.030> all<00:02:31.150> right

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
think the accessories forward stuff are

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.580 
think the accessories forward stuff are
sold<00:02:36.430> separately<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.780> thing<00:02:37.990> about<00:02:38.020> this<00:02:38.380> one

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
sold separately the thing about this one

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.430 
sold separately the thing about this one
is<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:39.100> zoom<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:40.450> doesn't<00:02:40.870> actually<00:02:41.050> do

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
is this zoom is it doesn't actually do

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.560 
is this zoom is it doesn't actually do
HD<00:02:41.830> video<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.520> device<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.000> plug<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.360> up<00:02:43.420> to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
HD video on the device you plug it up to

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.510 
HD video on the device you plug it up to
your<00:02:43.660> HDMI<00:02:44.260> or<00:02:44.590> HDTV<00:02:45.130> find<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.300> outputs<00:02:47.520> HD

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
your HDMI or HDTV find it outputs HD

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.630 
your HDMI or HDTV find it outputs HD
video<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.470> let's<00:02:50.500> see<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.950> guess<00:02:50.980> we<00:02:51.280> pull<00:02:51.520> this

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
video so let's see I guess we pull this

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.160 
video so let's see I guess we pull this
little<00:02:51.790> tab<00:02:52.150> right<00:02:52.180> here<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:52.900> thing

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
little tab right here to get this thing

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.480 
little tab right here to get this thing
out<00:02:54.630> there<00:02:55.630> we<00:02:55.870> go<00:02:56.020> slid<00:02:56.770> it<00:02:56.860> right<00:02:56.890> out<00:02:57.130> set

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
out there we go slid it right out set

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.090 
out there we go slid it right out set
that<00:02:57.610> down<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.500> let's<00:02:59.500> go<00:02:59.590> ahead<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.770> look<00:03:00.010> at

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
that down and let's go ahead and look at

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.740 
that down and let's go ahead and look at
the<00:03:00.250> device<00:03:00.520> instead<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.300> making<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.630> guys

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
the device instead of making you guys

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.180 
the device instead of making you guys
wait<00:03:02.220> let's<00:03:03.220> peel<00:03:03.490> this<00:03:03.610> plastic<00:03:04.120> off<00:03:05.190> all

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
wait let's peel this plastic off all

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.770

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
right so I'm getting my first

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.480 
right so I'm getting my first
impressions<00:03:08.770> of<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:11.860> there<00:03:12.010> we<00:03:12.130> go<00:03:12.160> there's

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
impressions of it so there we go there's

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:24.680 
impressions of it so there we go there's
the<00:03:12.640> back<00:03:18.780> here's<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.930> front<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:23.440> there<00:03:23.590> we<00:03:23.739> go

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
I'm not going to do any comparisons to

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.250 
I'm not going to do any comparisons to
the<00:03:27.670> ipod<00:03:27.970> yet<00:03:28.270> in<00:03:28.480> this<00:03:28.570> video<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.020> i<00:03:29.080> will

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
the ipod yet in this video but i will

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.350 
the ipod yet in this video but i will
show<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.100> size<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.640> screen<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.060> correct

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
show you the size the screen is correct

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.770 
show you the size the screen is correct
on<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.660> one<00:03:31.720> um<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:33.280> screen<00:03:33.850> resolution<00:03:34.540> is

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
on this one um the screen resolution is

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.060 
on this one um the screen resolution is
a<00:03:35.260> bit<00:03:35.739> bigger<00:03:35.980> on<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.280> ipod<00:03:36.580> touch<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:39.010> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
a bit bigger on the ipod touch and the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.400 
a bit bigger on the ipod touch and the
size<00:03:39.640> of<00:03:39.910> in<00:03:40.060> thickness<00:03:40.660> they're<00:03:41.050> actually

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
size of in thickness they're actually

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.380 
size of in thickness they're actually
about<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.709> same<00:03:41.739> size<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.640> thickness<00:03:42.880> as<00:03:43.300> you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
about the same size and thickness as you

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.970 
about the same size and thickness as you
can<00:03:43.570> see<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.260> course<00:03:44.440> they're<00:03:44.650> different

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
can see of course they're different

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.510 
can see of course they're different
shaped<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.540> zune<00:03:46.900> HD<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.560> smaller<00:03:47.980> than

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
shaped and the zune HD is smaller than

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.460 
shaped and the zune HD is smaller than
the<00:03:48.640> out<00:03:48.760> part<00:03:48.970> as<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.239> can<00:03:49.390> see<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.260> there's

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
the out part as you can see so there's

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.140 
the out part as you can see so there's
the<00:03:50.739> size<00:03:51.010> compared<00:03:51.430> story<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:51.880> i<00:03:51.910> will<00:03:52.120> be

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
the size compared story but i will be

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.930 
the size compared story but i will be
doing<00:03:52.360> a<00:03:52.570> HD<00:03:53.140> zune<00:03:53.350> HD<00:03:53.890> vs<00:03:54.400> ipod<00:03:54.730> touch

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
doing a HD zune HD vs ipod touch

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.729 
doing a HD zune HD vs ipod touch
comparison<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.200> looks<00:03:56.290> like<00:03:56.440> we<00:03:56.620> only

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
comparison and it looks like we only

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.660

figure this out okay the power button it

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.439 
figure this out okay the power button it
looks<00:05:53.510> like<00:05:53.720> is<00:05:53.840> only<00:05:54.020> top<00:05:54.760> know<00:05:55.760> if<00:05:55.970> it<00:05:56.150> want

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
looks like is only top know if it want

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.689 
looks like is only top know if it want
to<00:05:56.510> focus<00:05:56.659> in<00:05:56.930> and<00:05:56.960> there<00:05:57.139> we<00:05:57.199> go<00:05:57.229> I<00:05:57.699> suppose

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
to focus in and there we go I suppose

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.210
