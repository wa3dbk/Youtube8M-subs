00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
help match that it's probably an SMG for

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
few levels and you only get that for

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.969 
few levels and you only get that for
seven<00:01:02.520> days<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> capsule<00:01:03.809> shop<00:01:03.989> sig<00:01:04.320> 551

seven days with the capsule shop sig 551
iron<00:01:05.339> gun<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.270> 30<00:01:06.479> days<00:01:06.689> it's

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
got a pretty cool red and gold color

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.480 
got a pretty cool red and gold color
scheme<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.649> similar<00:01:10.829> to<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> certain

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
scheme kind of similar to a certain

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.059 
scheme kind of similar to a certain
superhero<00:01:12.030> also<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.259> ACOG<00:01:13.590> scope<00:01:13.709> on<00:01:14.039> it

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:14.069 
superhero also got the ACOG scope on it

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.849 
superhero also got the ACOG scope on it
I'm<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.850> real<00:01:15.479> down<00:01:15.869> points<00:01:16.319> on<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
I'm one of the real down points on the

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.370 
I'm one of the real down points on the
average<00:01:17.159> sig<00:01:17.609> itself<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.389> the<00:01:18.869> fact<00:01:19.109> that<00:01:19.200> it's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
average sig itself is the fact that it's

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.160 
average sig itself is the fact that it's
not<00:01:19.679> that<00:01:20.009> good<00:01:20.280> long-range<00:01:20.579> made<00:01:21.450> es<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> okay

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
not that good long-range made es is okay

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.139 
not that good long-range made es is okay
with<00:01:22.289> it<00:01:22.499> but<00:01:23.279> the<00:01:23.429> scope<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:23.969> kind<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
with it but the scope really kind of

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.819 
with it but the scope really kind of
augments<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.109> have<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.289> lot<00:01:25.499> clearer

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
augments that you have a lot clearer

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.539 
augments that you have a lot clearer
vision<00:01:26.579> 80s<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.719> well<00:01:27.929> so<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.289> can<00:01:28.380> really<00:01:28.679> aim

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
vision 80s as well so you can really aim

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.099 
vision 80s as well so you can really aim
a<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:29.819> bit<00:01:30.029> better<00:01:30.149> from<00:01:30.539> long<00:01:30.719> range<00:01:30.749> so

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
a little bit better from long range so

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:32.300 
a little bit better from long range so
it<00:01:31.170> kind<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> makes<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.709> gun<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.100> bit

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it kind of makes the gun a little bit

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.069 
it kind of makes the gun a little bit
more<00:01:32.490> roll<00:01:32.700> around<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.359> dangerous<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
more roll around it's dangerous like I

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.629 
more roll around it's dangerous like I
said<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.469> close<00:01:34.649> quarters<00:01:35.069> but<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.429> still

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
said in close quarters but you still

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.940 
said in close quarters but you still
have<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.909> long-range<00:01:36.810> lethality<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.859> the

have that long-range lethality with the

have that long-range lethality with the

ACOG scope on the sig 552 an iron gun

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.219 
ACOG scope on the sig 552 an iron gun
I'd<00:01:41.279> probably<00:01:41.490> go<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.359> personally

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
I'd probably go for that on personally

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.109 
I'd probably go for that on personally
speaking<00:01:43.679> since<00:01:44.459> that's<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:44.999> the<00:01:45.060> only

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
speaking since that's really the only

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.699 
speaking since that's really the only
surefire<00:01:45.389> way<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.749> get<00:01:45.959> it<00:01:46.109> is<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.469> with<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
surefire way to get it is just with the

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:47.989 
surefire way to get it is just with the
air<00:01:46.859> and<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.159> through<00:01:47.249> the<00:01:47.369> capsule<00:01:47.789> shop
