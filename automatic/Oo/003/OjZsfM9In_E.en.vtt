might<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.769> seen<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.070> some<00:00:11.309> previous<00:00:11.580> videos

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
might have seen in some previous videos

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.180 
might have seen in some previous videos
the<00:00:12.809> various<00:00:13.230> different<00:00:13.559> methods<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:13.980> I've

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the various different methods that I've

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.310 
the various different methods that I've
been<00:00:14.369> trying<00:00:14.760> to<00:00:14.910> set<00:00:15.180> up<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.480> connect<00:00:15.840> my

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
been trying to set up to connect my

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.130 
been trying to set up to connect my
slider<00:00:16.740> systems<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> tripod<00:00:18.240> system<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
slider systems to a tripod system in a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.759 
slider systems to a tripod system in a
way<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.250> strong<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.470> gives<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.740> much

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
way that is strong and gives as much

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.950 
way that is strong and gives as much
tilt<00:00:23.189> ability<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.609> possible<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.119> is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
tilt ability as possible and is

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
tilt ability as possible and is
lightweight<00:00:25.589> and<00:00:25.800> quick<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.640> set<00:00:26.820> up<00:00:26.909> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
lightweight and quick to set up and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.479 
lightweight and quick to set up and
hopefully<00:00:27.539> fairly<00:00:28.380> low<00:00:28.560> cost<00:00:28.589> as<00:00:29.130> well<00:00:29.279> so

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
hopefully fairly low cost as well so

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.640 
hopefully fairly low cost as well so
it's<00:00:29.909> a<00:00:30.060> lot<00:00:30.329> of<00:00:30.419> things<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.749> ask<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.199> in

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it's a lot of things to ask for in

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
it's a lot of things to ask for in
something<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:32.850> difficult<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.360> do

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
something that is very difficult to do

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.780 
something that is very difficult to do
and<00:00:33.810> so<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.130> you've<00:00:35.280> tried<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.700> do

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
and so you know if you've tried to do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.790 
and so you know if you've tried to do
something<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.810> would<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.170> known

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
something like this you would have known

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
something like this you would have known
that<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.130> know<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> large<00:00:39.090> camera<00:00:39.480> system

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that you know with a large camera system

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.580 
that you know with a large camera system
most<00:00:40.730> most<00:00:41.730> fluid<00:00:42.210> heads<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.660> most<00:00:43.230> heads

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
most most fluid heads and most heads

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.180 
most most fluid heads and most heads
whether<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> full<00:00:44.550> head<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:45.000> even<00:00:45.390> heads

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
whether it's a full head or even heads

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.040 
whether it's a full head or even heads
specifically<00:00:47.190> intended<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.510> holding<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
specifically intended for holding a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.500 
specifically intended for holding a
slider<00:00:49.380> like<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> pro<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> Mon<00:00:50.580> most<00:00:51.330> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
slider like like a pro a Mon most of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
slider like like a pro a Mon most of
them<00:00:51.630> just<00:00:51.810> fail<00:00:52.080> they<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.650> can't<00:00:52.950> do<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.130> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
them just fail they just can't do it and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.940 
them just fail they just can't do it and
then<00:00:53.940> some<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> limit<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.740> is

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
then some of them have a limit that is

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.210 
then some of them have a limit that is
you<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.400> the<00:00:56.880> the<00:00:57.110> G<00:00:58.110> yang<00:00:58.380> had<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> three

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
you know like the the G yang had a three

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.090 
you know like the the G yang had a three
kilogram<00:00:59.640> limit<00:00:59.970> with<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.960> meter<00:01:01.650> slider

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
kilogram limit with a one meter slider

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189 
kilogram limit with a one meter slider
which<00:01:02.970> is<00:01:03.060> a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.360> longer<00:01:03.510> than<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.810> about

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
which is a little longer than this about

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.170 
which is a little longer than this about
that<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:05.009> is<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.250> 80<00:01:05.519> centimeters<00:01:06.090> here

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that this is about 80 centimeters here

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.050 
that this is about 80 centimeters here
and<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.920> most<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> them<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and so so most of them you know have a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.360 
and so so most of them you know have a
limit<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.049> suck<00:01:10.650> completely<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
limit or they just suck completely and

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.310 
limit or they just suck completely and
some<00:01:12.120> of<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.300> have<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.480> limit<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.050> like<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
some of them have a limit that's like a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.710 
some of them have a limit that's like a
tiny<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.159> camera<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.880> any<00:01:15.030> X<00:01:15.240> camera

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
tiny little camera like in any X camera

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.910 
tiny little camera like in any X camera
and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.440> can<00:01:16.650> use<00:01:16.800> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and then that's all you can use the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.610 
and then that's all you can use the
slider<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> needed<00:01:18.840> something<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
slider with so I needed something that

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.700 
slider with so I needed something that
like<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.400> said<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.909> strong<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.050> fast<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.409> set<00:01:22.620> up

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
like I said is strong and fast to set up

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.640 
like I said is strong and fast to set up
and<00:01:22.940> so<00:01:23.940> I've<00:01:24.420> been<00:01:24.600> thinking<00:01:24.960> about<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.530> know

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and so I've been thinking about you know

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.830 
and so I've been thinking about you know
for<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> while<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.729> various<00:01:27.450> different

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
for a while now some various different

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.740 
for a while now some various different
ways<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.530> connect<00:01:28.860> something<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.330> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
ways to connect something like this to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
ways to connect something like this to
the<00:01:30.900> singles<00:01:31.320> tripod<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.460> I've

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the singles tripod because as I've

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.580 
the singles tripod because as I've
mentioned<00:01:33.120> before<00:01:33.330> working<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:33.990> two

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
mentioned before working with two

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.980 
mentioned before working with two
tripods<00:01:35.190> either<00:01:35.700> end<00:01:36.000> doesn't<00:01:36.479> work<00:01:36.690> for<00:01:36.870> me

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
tripods either end doesn't work for me

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
tripods either end doesn't work for me
and<00:01:37.080> my<00:01:37.140> work<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.590> some<00:01:37.740> people<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.460> might

work for really really big systems

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.760 
work for really really big systems
personally<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.140> an<00:01:43.320> option<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.620> me<00:01:43.740> I

done is I've connected the Manfrotto arm
you<00:02:02.909> could<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.479> lower-cost<00:02:04.470> options<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
you could do lower-cost options in this

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.969 
you could do lower-cost options in this
to<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> similar<00:02:06.150> effect<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.439> mean<00:02:07.590> if

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
to get a similar effect but I mean if

to get a similar effect but I mean if
you've<00:02:08.250> got<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.759> bit<00:02:08.939> of<00:02:09.030> budget<00:02:09.299> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
you've got a little bit of budget to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.669 
you've got a little bit of budget to
spend<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.810> mean<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.019> Manfrotto<00:02:10.349> arm<00:02:10.530> is

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
spend I mean the Manfrotto arm is

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.990 
spend I mean the Manfrotto arm is
awesome<00:02:11.009> anyways<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.549> really<00:02:11.819> really

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
awesome anyways it's really really

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.740 
awesome anyways it's really really
useful<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:12.930> basically<00:02:13.769> an<00:02:14.040> awesome

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
useful this is basically an awesome

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.590 
useful this is basically an awesome
awesome<00:02:15.410> little<00:02:15.740> setup<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.550> gives<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.150> ton<00:02:17.570> of

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
awesome little setup that gives a ton of

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.720 
awesome little setup that gives a ton of
strength<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.320> don't<00:02:18.950> think<00:02:19.130> anything<00:02:19.580> would

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
strength I don't think anything would

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.730 
strength I don't think anything would
make<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.120> move<00:02:20.330> out<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.600> position<00:02:21.050> until

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
make this move out of position until

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.740 
make this move out of position until
like<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.700> could<00:02:22.880> just<00:02:23.060> hang<00:02:23.270> off<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.600> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
like like you could just hang off it and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.840 
like like you could just hang off it and
it<00:02:23.900> will<00:02:24.050> break<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.310> won't<00:02:25.490> move<00:02:25.640> out<00:02:25.820> of

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
it will break but it won't move out of

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.520 
it will break but it won't move out of
position<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.330> like<00:02:26.600> your<00:02:26.810> tripod<00:02:27.110> leg<00:02:27.380> won't

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
position so like your tripod leg won't

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.920 
position so like your tripod leg won't
break<00:02:27.800> if<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.010> hang<00:02:28.250> off<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.580> but<00:02:29.570> but<00:02:29.780> this

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
break if you hang off it but but this

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.680 
break if you hang off it but but this
thing<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.170> think<00:02:30.410> will<00:02:30.530> still<00:02:30.680> hold<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.360> is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
thing I think will still hold so it is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.770 
thing I think will still hold so it is
you<00:02:33.320> know<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:34.090> fantastically<00:02:35.090> like

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
you know just a fantastically like

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.830 
you know just a fantastically like
strong<00:02:36.290> method<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:37.610> gives<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.450> tilt

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
strong method that gives you tilt

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.040 
strong method that gives you tilt
ability<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.590> basically<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.610> undo<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:41.690> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
ability so basically you undo this and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.740 
ability so basically you undo this and
then<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.590> took<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.370> whole<00:02:43.490> system<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.090> you

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
then you took the whole system and you

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.080 
then you took the whole system and you
lock<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.140> back<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.860> as<00:02:46.459> long<00:02:46.640> as<00:02:46.700> you're<00:02:46.910> only

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
lock it back so as long as you're only

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.180 
lock it back so as long as you're only
tilting<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:48.320> way<00:02:48.530> because<00:02:48.680> obviously<00:02:48.860> this

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
tilting this way because obviously this

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.580 
tilting this way because obviously this
can't<00:02:50.060> go<00:02:50.180> any<00:02:50.330> longer<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.320> can<00:02:51.410> very

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
can't go any longer but it can very

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.590 
can't go any longer but it can very
easily<00:02:51.770> go<00:02:52.010> shorter<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.030> can<00:02:53.270> tell<00:02:53.480> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
easily go shorter so you can tell the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.979 
easily go shorter so you can tell the
entire<00:02:53.840> system<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.410> way<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.830> then<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:56.030> do<00:02:56.870> I

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
entire system this way and then I do I

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.479 
entire system this way and then I do I
don't<00:02:57.290> ever<00:02:57.500> see<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.980> being<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.310> problem

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
don't ever see that being a problem

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.250 
don't ever see that being a problem
because<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.910> don't<00:02:59.060> ever<00:02:59.209> need<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.630> tilt<00:02:59.870> my

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
because I don't ever need to tilt my

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.690 
because I don't ever need to tilt my
slider<00:03:00.709> both<00:03:01.070> ways

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
slider both ways

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.280 
slider both ways
I<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.090> tilt<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.420> one<00:03:02.630> way<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:02.930> then<00:03:03.020> set<00:03:03.200> up

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
I just tilt it one way and then set up

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.940 
I just tilt it one way and then set up
the<00:03:03.410> camera<00:03:03.800> on<00:03:04.550> on<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.450> slider<00:03:05.690> as<00:03:05.989> needed<00:03:06.739> to

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
the camera on on the slider as needed to

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.920 
the camera on on the slider as needed to
do<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.400> vertical<00:03:07.580> shot<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.670> am<00:03:10.930> really

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
do the vertical shot so I am really

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.990 
do the vertical shot so I am really
really<00:03:12.050> happy<00:03:12.140> with<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:13.520> is<00:03:13.700> connected

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
really happy with this this is connected

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.060 
really happy with this this is connected
with<00:03:14.300> two<00:03:14.600> clamps<00:03:15.350> oh<00:03:15.470> no<00:03:15.590> sorry<00:03:15.800> that's<00:03:15.920> one

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
with two clamps oh no sorry that's one

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.310 
with two clamps oh no sorry that's one
clamp<00:03:16.370> there<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:17.510> then<00:03:17.720> underneath<00:03:18.020> here

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
clamp there and then underneath here

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.440 
clamp there and then underneath here
it's<00:03:18.769> just<00:03:18.890> screwed<00:03:19.340> into<00:03:19.489> place<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.030> this<00:03:20.360> is

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
it's just screwed into place and this is

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.199 
it's just screwed into place and this is
an<00:03:20.540> 80<00:03:20.690> centimeter<00:03:21.200> slider<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.209> some

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
an 80 centimeter slider and so some

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.030 
an 80 centimeter slider and so some
sliders<00:03:23.480> would<00:03:23.959> be<00:03:24.140> longer<00:03:24.530> than<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.769> some

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
sliders would be longer than this some

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.020 
sliders would be longer than this some
sliders<00:03:25.250> would<00:03:25.430> have<00:03:25.549> various<00:03:25.910> different

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
sliders would have various different

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.479 
sliders would have various different
other<00:03:26.330> kinds<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.870> connections<00:03:27.170> with<00:03:28.130> any

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
other kinds of connections with any

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.840 
other kinds of connections with any
slider<00:03:29.000> that's<00:03:29.269> really<00:03:29.840> long<00:03:30.080> like<00:03:31.070> 150

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
slider that's really long like 150

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.670 
slider that's really long like 150
centimeters<00:03:32.360> or<00:03:32.480> something<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:33.200> could<00:03:33.410> still

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
centimeters or something you could still

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.680 
centimeters or something you could still
get<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.860> ton<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.250> extra<00:03:34.760> strength<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.450> because

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
get a ton of extra strength just because

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.240 
get a ton of extra strength just because
of<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:35.870> by<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.110> way<00:03:36.230> this<00:03:36.709> provides

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
of this by the way this provides

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.580 
of this by the way this provides
strength<00:03:38.000> in<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.540> opposite<00:03:39.080> direction<00:03:39.350> as

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
strength in the opposite direction as

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.310 
strength in the opposite direction as
well<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.010> when<00:03:40.250> you're<00:03:40.400> here<00:03:40.940> this<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.959> giving

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
well so when you're here this is giving

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.069 
well so when you're here this is giving
you<00:03:42.530> sort<00:03:43.519> of<00:03:43.579> what<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.570> know<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.780> camera<00:03:45.049> is

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
you sort of what you know the camera is

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.229 
you sort of what you know the camera is
pressing<00:03:45.470> down<00:03:45.500> here<00:03:45.980> but<00:03:46.640> this<00:03:46.880> can't

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
pressing down here but this can't

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.690 
pressing down here but this can't
stretch<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:48.320> it's<00:03:48.500> still<00:03:48.709> again<00:03:49.070> won't<00:03:49.370> allow

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
stretch so it's still again won't allow

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.910 
stretch so it's still again won't allow
it<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.000> go<00:03:50.150> up<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.510> this<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:51.170> ideally<00:03:51.739> done

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
it to go up and this is ideally done

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.449 
it to go up and this is ideally done
with<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:53.000> strong<00:03:53.530> tripod<00:03:54.530> system<00:03:54.709> because

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
with a strong tripod system because

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.979 
with a strong tripod system because
obviously<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.880> is<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.269> know<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.570> is<00:03:56.690> putting

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
obviously it is you know it is putting

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.979 
obviously it is you know it is putting
more<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.410> that<00:03:57.620> pressure<00:03:57.980> onto<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.459> leg<00:03:58.700> and

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
more of that pressure onto the leg and

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.319 
more of that pressure onto the leg and
so<00:04:00.400> but<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.430> found<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:01.820> in<00:04:02.060> whatever

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
so but I found that in whatever

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.410 
so but I found that in whatever
situation<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.140> use<00:04:03.320> this<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:04.370> does<00:04:04.760> make<00:04:05.390> a

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
situation you use this it does make a

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.640 
situation you use this it does make a
very<00:04:05.630> big<00:04:05.810> difference<00:04:05.959> cuz<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.290> didn't<00:04:06.440> try<00:04:06.590> it

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
very big difference cuz I didn't try it

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.520 
very big difference cuz I didn't try it
with<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.799> cheap<00:04:07.160> with<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.269> fancier<00:04:08.900> tripod

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
with a cheap with the fancier tripod

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.370 
with a cheap with the fancier tripod
legs<00:04:09.739> as<00:04:09.860> well<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.720> did<00:04:11.870> work<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:12.290> it

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
legs as well so and it did work so it

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.610 
legs as well so and it did work so it
did<00:04:12.500> actually<00:04:12.769> help<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.610> lot<00:04:13.880> but<00:04:14.630> it<00:04:15.410> is

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
did actually help a lot but it is

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.259 
did actually help a lot but it is
obviously<00:04:15.950> definitely<00:04:16.430> more<00:04:16.700> ideal<00:04:17.030> with

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
obviously definitely more ideal with

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.659 
obviously definitely more ideal with
something<00:04:17.600> like<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:17.870> because<00:04:18.400> cheap<00:04:19.400> legs

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
something like this because cheap legs

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.300 
something like this because cheap legs
tend<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.209> have<00:04:20.390> flex<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.079> legs<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.590> so

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
tend to have flex in the legs and so

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.970 
tend to have flex in the legs and so
again<00:04:22.880> this<00:04:23.360> adds<00:04:23.630> stability<00:04:24.349> it<00:04:24.740> helps

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
again this adds stability it helps

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.340 
again this adds stability it helps
you<00:04:26.250> know<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:27.060> not<00:04:27.300> quite<00:04:27.630> as<00:04:27.780> good<00:04:27.810> as<00:04:28.140> with

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
you know it's not quite as good as with

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.630 
you know it's not quite as good as with
the<00:04:28.500> Manfrotto<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.160> wanted<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.460> demonstrate

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
the Manfrotto so I wanted to demonstrate

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.660 
the Manfrotto so I wanted to demonstrate
it<00:04:29.940> with<00:04:30.000> Manfrotto<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:31.230> now<00:04:31.410> you<00:04:32.070> could<00:04:32.430> use

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
it with Manfrotto and now you could use

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.940 
it with Manfrotto and now you could use
I<00:04:33.240> mean<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.540> could<00:04:33.720> use<00:04:33.870> various<00:04:34.200> DIY<00:04:34.590> options

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
I mean you could use various DIY options

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.740 
I mean you could use various DIY options
like<00:04:35.100> just<00:04:35.340> some<00:04:35.580> sticks<00:04:36.030> but<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.480> mean<00:04:36.660> that

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
like just some sticks but I mean that

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.050 
like just some sticks but I mean that
wouldn't<00:04:36.990> be<00:04:37.110> very<00:04:37.320> quick<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.560> set<00:04:37.830> up<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.130> it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
wouldn't be very quick to set up and it

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.330 
wouldn't be very quick to set up and it
wouldn't<00:04:39.510> allow<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.990> very<00:04:40.740> quick

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
wouldn't allow you very quick

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.330 
wouldn't allow you very quick
adjustability<00:04:42.050> so<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.620> do<00:04:43.830> want<00:04:44.040> it<00:04:44.070> quick

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
adjustability so if you do want it quick

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.950 
adjustability so if you do want it quick
to<00:04:44.520> set<00:04:44.700> up<00:04:44.730> with<00:04:45.030> adjustability<00:04:45.540> then<00:04:45.870> you

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
to set up with adjustability then you

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.630 
to set up with adjustability then you
can<00:04:46.140> use<00:04:46.380> something<00:04:46.920> like<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.550> you

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
can use something like this and you

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.240 
can use something like this and you
could<00:04:47.760> connect<00:04:48.120> this<00:04:48.600> from<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.530> tripod<00:04:50.010> leg

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
could connect this from the tripod leg

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.500 
could connect this from the tripod leg
to<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.630> pan<00:04:52.620> bar<00:04:52.920> and<00:04:53.130> so<00:04:53.790> if<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.120> were<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.390> do

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
to the pan bar and so if you were to do

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.710 
to the pan bar and so if you were to do
that<00:04:54.830> then<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.160> wouldn't<00:04:56.850> get<00:04:57.120> any<00:04:57.360> extra

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
that then you wouldn't get any extra

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.590 
that then you wouldn't get any extra
strength<00:04:58.400> from<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.610> know<00:04:59.760> from<00:05:00.000> here<00:05:00.360> and

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
strength from you know from here and

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600 
strength from you know from here and
above<00:05:01.050> because<00:05:01.680> obviously<00:05:01.980> you<00:05:02.220> know<00:05:02.340> you'd

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
above because obviously you know you'd

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.880 
above because obviously you know you'd
still<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.390> know<00:05:03.480> if<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.890> quick-release

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
still you know if the quick-release

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.550 
still you know if the quick-release
system<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:05.970> was<00:05:06.090> here<00:05:06.300> wasn't<00:05:06.570> super<00:05:07.260> stable

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
system that was here wasn't super stable

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.350 
system that was here wasn't super stable
then<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.430> still<00:05:08.640> might<00:05:08.670> have<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.030> little<00:05:09.210> bit

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
then you still might have a little bit

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.690 
then you still might have a little bit
of<00:05:09.420> flex<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:09.840> did<00:05:10.020> try<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:11.280> noticed

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
of flex and I did try that and I noticed

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.750 
of flex and I did try that and I noticed
that<00:05:11.880> there<00:05:12.660> was<00:05:12.840> much<00:05:13.230> more<00:05:13.260> flex<00:05:13.770> when<00:05:14.460> I

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
that there was much more flex when I

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.510 
that there was much more flex when I
used<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.330> small<00:05:15.690> one<00:05:15.900> connected<00:05:16.890> from<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.280> pan

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
used a small one connected from the pan

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.090 
used a small one connected from the pan
arm<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:18.570> there<00:05:19.020> because<00:05:19.260> it<00:05:19.560> simply<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:20.010> know

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
arm to there because it simply you know

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.740 
arm to there because it simply you know
I<00:05:20.340> didn't<00:05:20.760> think<00:05:20.850> it<00:05:21.000> could<00:05:21.300> really<00:05:21.330> easily

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
I didn't think it could really easily

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.750 
I didn't think it could really easily
reach<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:22.740> slide<00:05:23.010> I<00:05:23.040> mean<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.310> really<00:05:23.430> depends

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
reach the slide I mean it really depends

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.950 
reach the slide I mean it really depends
on<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:23.940> slider<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.330> what<00:05:24.420> connections<00:05:24.870> you

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
on the slider and what connections you

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.310 
on the slider and what connections you
have<00:05:24.990> connecting<00:05:25.950> to<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.100> pan<00:05:26.310> bar<00:05:26.520> is<00:05:27.260> it's<00:05:28.260> a

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
have connecting to the pan bar is it's a

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.340 
have connecting to the pan bar is it's a
good<00:05:28.560> second<00:05:29.490> option<00:05:29.910> that<00:05:30.060> does<00:05:30.810> help<00:05:31.110> as

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
good second option that does help as

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.710 
good second option that does help as
well<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.650> does<00:05:31.800> give<00:05:32.010> strength<00:05:32.340> but<00:05:33.120> might

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
well and does give strength but might

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.410 
well and does give strength but might
still<00:05:34.310> retain<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.340> bit<00:05:35.550> more<00:05:35.700> wobble<00:05:36.060> because

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
still retain a bit more wobble because

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.690 
still retain a bit more wobble because
of<00:05:36.890> you<00:05:37.890> know<00:05:38.040> because<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:38.490> don't<00:05:38.520> have

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
of you know because you don't have

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.550 
of you know because you don't have
anything<00:05:38.910> here<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.690> strengthen<00:05:39.960> this<00:05:40.320> piece

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
anything here to strengthen this piece

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.200 
anything here to strengthen this piece
so<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:41.160> slider<00:05:41.400> might<00:05:41.640> still<00:05:41.850> have<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.000> bit

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
so the slider might still have a bit

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.950 
so the slider might still have a bit
more<00:05:42.240> model<00:05:42.600> but<00:05:43.200> this<00:05:44.000> is<00:05:45.000> lovely<00:05:45.420> and<00:05:45.750> I'm
