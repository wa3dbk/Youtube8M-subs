00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.669
 now we are in crochet origami and today 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.700
 I'm going to show you something as simple as 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:11.070
 the previous video I will show you how 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.840
 make a heart 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.830
 Well all we need is a 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.830
 paper of any color 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.940
 with a triangle 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.050
 ah 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.860
 a triangle and then again a time 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.860
 but the other way around 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.840
 now we take the tip to the middle 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.690
 the other part until the end of the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.010
 it would be like that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.010
 and pretty a heart 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.960
 this part 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 we fold like this 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.280
 and so on up to half of the pains 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.420
 and we do the same 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.050
 yes 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.710
 and always in the middle 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.890
 do not carry this 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.890
 Now if you take new forms we do not want 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.400
 not very much because it will be very misshapen 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.110
 and on the other side we do the same in the 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.280
 top part that would be the and all 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.600
 we also do it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.600
 they have to be the same 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.710
 to stay 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:07.320
 now also with the fake person course 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.320
 and ready 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.810
 maybe not just god itself 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.230
 that's all if they liked it please 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.640
 subscribe and lay upside down does not 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.489
 always hurt your video link I do not think 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.459
 stop doing it and it's always basic 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.130
 so they will serve them and then I will 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.180
 start making videos more difficult 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.180
 that is all
