00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.270
 ah 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.389
 return to your fears to a race of 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.620
 mario kart or 8 let's see how we 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:16.510
 come out this game we are going to super mega 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.510
 already as little by little 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.860
 you're not from the map that you voted for me 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.560
 quite pretty and one more if 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.939
 I would have left 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.470
 I was for the truth that I think a 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.470
 little pastels of the lame 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.680
 good 4200 dots is already starting to cost 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.620
 climbing is very difficult to win and so on 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.840
 it's costing a lot a lot a lot 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.020
 and good indeed more competitive the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.640
 ladies game but 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.060
 it also means that I will go up less 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.060
 victories 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.280
 every time they cost a little more and a 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.769
 little bit more and a little bit more 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.240
 although arriving in 1999 I will be happy 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.720
 and point 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.720
 this 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.670
 this curve I always have something of 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.670
 problems I do not know why 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.110
 the easiest circuits 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.900
 I the truth is that it takes many 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.900
 circuits are very easy for me 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.810
 but basically that be all the time 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 like a bastard 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.200
 and then I do not know how easy to do it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.530
 they cried the first 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 without any strange problems 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.130
 when only a ray or a blue shell 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.130
 or me that hell dog 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.539
 we go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.090
 the truth is that with motorcycle there are curves that 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.630
 can not be done the same as with a kart 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.670
 but it's what I like the bike 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.579
 and I already got used to it too much 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.009
 thank you very much parts of the letter 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.009
 now and I do not even look like 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.360
 that is, it is very different from a car 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.000
 of a motorcycle very much 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.780
 those who have many differences in 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.780
 control and others 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.579
 a solo number spin I think 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.220
 without any problem 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.040
 we go 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.810
 clin clin love like dog 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.319
 mental neighborhoods are not people who 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.319
 they do not usually choose 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.940
 I would like a little bit I wanted to change 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.940
 I wanted to change a little 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.769
 we go on the turn vito I shit on the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.769
 milk 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.890
 it fucked up the thing was already clear 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:07.000
 that will be in bringing me since I was 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.550
 because it was very clear from the balls 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.820
 I have not advance me or I think so 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.820
 I believe it 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.670
 I do not believe it I swear I do not believe it 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.670
 true 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.180
 young 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.530
 good to all united in a race of 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.120
 mario kart 8 let's see how not only 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.780
 this game 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.959
 do not 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.510
 good man man varied his map very 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.530
 good fun and like the pretty 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.530
 we got there 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.640
 as you see here the people of points we are going 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:55.400
 easy for five thousand 615 thousand 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.440
 another with 6000 another with 3500 is 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.620
 balanced let's leave it where it is 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.620
 balanced 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.049
 or not only take away points 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.730
 they do not take us away so much logically if 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.930
 we are from a position of people who do not 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.420
 Possesses fucking mother 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.950
 efe 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.950
 what happens when we hit slipstream 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.370
 badly take that curve 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.400
 Y 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.389
 we are not going to see the pirouette has 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.389
 that man is a bitch 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.910
 with the explosion 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.910
 expressions taste or in your mouth 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.569
 good 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.550
 we launched our package and I 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.090
 for say 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.090
 do not 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.830
 we have achieved everything for the shortcut and 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.430
 you know the shortcut this through 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.430
 cast 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.100
 in the perfect there is an object there all 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.340
 it's a very good shortcut the best in this 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.340
 Map 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.750
 send balls 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.040
 the night dish of the cojones not me what 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.040
 food is not my job I swear 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.310
 OK 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.060
 seconds 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.340
 it curves it takes it to the limit 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.650
 let's praise 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.610
 but it was not all 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.610
 and in a fucking shit 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.360
 nothing 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.520
 red 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.770
 the bed operated full 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.210
 has loaded me full is that I did not have 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.520
 I have to have everything fast and 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.069
 that's what happened has the bomb 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.270
 exploit the other objects has been 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.990
 Awesome 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.990
 philip a 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.519
 well they were not seconds not always 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:28.159
 can help first sent a quantity 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:30.610
 of interesting points so nothing 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:30.610
 until next time
