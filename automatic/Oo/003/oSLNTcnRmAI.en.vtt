00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
all right here we are at home brew

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.700 
all right here we are at home brew
school<00:00:03.000> again<00:00:03.210> doing<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.600> quick<00:00:03.899> equipment

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
school again doing a quick equipment

school again doing a quick equipment
check<00:00:04.940> for<00:00:05.940> all-grain<00:00:06.450> brewing<00:00:06.589> let<00:00:07.589> me<00:00:07.680> show

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
check for all-grain brewing let me show

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.259 
check for all-grain brewing let me show
you<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.040> first<00:00:08.250> thing<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.880> think<00:00:09.150> is

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
you the first thing of that I think is

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.080 
you the first thing of that I think is
most<00:00:09.420> important<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.200> our<00:00:10.530> mash<00:00:10.830> tun<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.759> mash

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
most important is our mash tun this mash

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.460 
most important is our mash tun this mash
tun<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.719> my<00:00:13.139> gatorade<00:00:13.559> cooler<00:00:14.009> right<00:00:14.309> here<00:00:14.730> and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
tun is my gatorade cooler right here and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
tun is my gatorade cooler right here and
essentially<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.710> where<00:00:17.070> I'm<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.369> to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
essentially this is where I'm going to

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.000 
essentially this is where I'm going to
match<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.910> grains<00:00:18.210> are<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> 150<00:00:19.470> degrees

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
match the grains are about a 150 degrees

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.090 
match the grains are about a 150 degrees
I'm<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.880> single<00:00:21.390> infusion<00:00:22.100> brew

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
I'm going to a single infusion brew

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.620 
I'm going to a single infusion brew
today<00:00:23.340> where<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> keep<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> at

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
today where I'm going to keep it at

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.179 
today where I'm going to keep it at
consistent<00:00:25.320> temperature<00:00:25.849> for<00:00:26.849> 1<00:00:27.180> hour<00:00:27.240> and

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
consistent temperature for 1 hour and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.130 
consistent temperature for 1 hour and
basically<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.340> use<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.910> mergi<00:00:30.330> products<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.990> got

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
basically I use I mergi products and got

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.400 
basically I use I mergi products and got
this<00:00:31.340> ball<00:00:32.340> valve<00:00:32.610> spigot<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.230> can

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
this ball valve spigot and if you can

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.430 
this ball valve spigot and if you can
see<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:35.460> what<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> did<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.870> took<00:00:36.899> some

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
see here what I did is I took some

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.010 
see here what I did is I took some
stainless<00:00:38.010> steel<00:00:38.219> thread<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.899> at

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
stainless steel thread I got that at

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
stainless steel thread I got that at
home<00:00:40.170> depot<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> got<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> tea<00:00:41.850> pipe<00:00:43.460> with<00:00:44.460> some

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
home depot and got a tea pipe with some

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.639 
home depot and got a tea pipe with some
valves<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.110> threaded

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
valves right here that are threaded

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.840 
valves right here that are threaded
where<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.460> hook<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.940> thread<00:00:48.690> onto<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
where I can hook this thread onto it and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
where I can hook this thread onto it and
this<00:00:50.850> allows<00:00:51.239> me<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.539> strain<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> ward<00:00:52.590> out

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
this allows me to strain the ward out

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.590 
this allows me to strain the ward out
I'm<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.699> put<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> grains<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
I'm going to just put all the grains in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
I'm going to just put all the grains in
here<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:54.840> 150<00:00:55.500> degrees<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
here at 150 degrees it's just going to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.180 
here at 150 degrees it's just going to
sit<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.320> soon<00:00:58.320> enough<00:00:58.620> I'll<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.070> able

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
sit in here and soon enough I'll be able

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.939 
sit in here and soon enough I'll be able
to<00:00:59.489> get<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.719> wort<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.170> into<00:01:01.530> my<00:01:01.680> brew

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
to get all this wort out into my brew

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.130 
to get all this wort out into my brew
kettle<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> ready<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> boil<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
kettle and ready for a boil this is a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.109 
kettle and ready for a boil this is a
very<00:01:04.229> important<00:01:04.799> step<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.729> also<00:01:06.000> use

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
very important step you can also use

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.480 
very important step you can also use
another<00:01:06.479> zymurgy<00:01:06.990> product<00:01:07.530> called<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.920> bazooka

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
another zymurgy product called a bazooka

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.359 
another zymurgy product called a bazooka
screen<00:01:08.790> which<00:01:09.000> will<00:01:09.030> hook<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.140> here

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
screen which will hook up to right here

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.830 
screen which will hook up to right here
to<00:01:11.369> where<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> ball<00:01:11.880> valves<00:01:12.150> Vic<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to where the ball valves Vic it is and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.380 
to where the ball valves Vic it is and
it<00:01:12.900> offers<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.530> nice<00:01:13.799> screen<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.180> thing

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
it offers a nice screen but this thing

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.030 
it offers a nice screen but this thing
is<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.659> important<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.710> grain

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
is really important for all grain

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
is really important for all grain
brewing<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.490> I'll<00:01:17.580> show<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.820> more<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.540> how

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
brewing and I'll show you more of of how

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.929 
brewing and I'll show you more of of how
to<00:01:19.080> use<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.070> again<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> simple
