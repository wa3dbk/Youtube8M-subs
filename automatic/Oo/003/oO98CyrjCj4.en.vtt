00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.480
 gone are the days when everyone was eager to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.639
 tourism and products were similar to either 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.950
 aliens either on their alien 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.350
 creations and now retro fashion 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.600
 clothes transportation style all this 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.820
 reinterpreted echoes of the 20s 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.740
 last century and now this trend 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.660
 I got to the camera 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.330
 if someone release digital 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.310
 range finders then somebody digital SLR 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.310
 film eras nikon df 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.059
 after all the pictures I saw in 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.280
 the internet 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.769
 waiting for the camera with great impatience and 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.140
 true wow cry flies sound when 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.769
 unpacking but immediately afterwards 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.900
 appears puzzled and what kind of body 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.940
 cast is made of magnesium alloy 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.280
 sense of solidity are present 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.809
 Only here in the hand of the device lies softly 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.840
 let's say not very good 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.210
 too light too toyy same 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.090
 film device from nikon much 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.229
 cooler and even modern cameras from nikon 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.210
 also cooler and immediately the first niggle 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.100
 the body is not only magnesium alloy with 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.860
 meter looks like cheap plastic 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.539
 which will be bare in a month so also on 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.000
 touch the same impressions 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.770
 besides nikon decided to add the same 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.729
 silver plastic and a couple of items 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 of management 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.070
 If the glossy fn buttons are still so-so, then 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.840
 focus mode switch 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.240
 makes use of it very 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.729
 neatly and suddenly another one will fall off 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.920
 minus this seams device I don't know who 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.630
 but how many had the impression 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.880
 that the joints will quickly be collected 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.220
 dirt and dust which will lead to one of 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.229
 two outcomes of karatektes everything will be 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.689
 otter and to shine a ya nihilists 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.820
 the camera would be counter sense 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.360
 would be disgusted to take such 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.759
 the camera 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.040
 if of course my fears are confirmed 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.200
 back side looks like 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.360
 modern cameras have a large display with 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.479
 excellent viewing angles buttons 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.739
 controls on the right and left side 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.989
 joystick switch in live view 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.510
 wheel changing parameters what 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.910
 drastically different is the upper bound 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.430
 to the left of the big speakers recognized 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.250
 mine are two wheels change 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.200
 photosensitivity and exposure compensation 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.230
 on the right wheel change the exposure mode 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.019
 shooting from canonical psm shutter release 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.540
 with wheel switching modes 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.790
 shooting from single frame to blue or 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.730
 lift plates mirror and small display 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.769
 with mapping 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.599
 them additional information under 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.209
 index finger is the second 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.659
 control wheel parameters first 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.780
 under the big one and here comes the second joint 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.510
 You can be stupid for a long time, wondering 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.360
 what lever you need to delay what 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.340
 press what turn about what a click 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.769
 By the way, the built-in flash can not 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.569
 look here i don't have any film 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.459
 chambers polaziv on the menu I'm a little 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.510
 disappointed it is the same as in 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.750
 other models 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.319
 i was expecting something more unusual more 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.780
 rotara 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.879
 but alas speaking of camera speed 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.280
 it is worth mentioning that it is rather slowly 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.670
 rather than quickly removing photos 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.950
 I would like to review materials a little 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.090
 more speed matrix is ​​the same here 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.400
 like the flagship 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.950
 up to 4 well, as always, it was possible to install 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.170
 d7000 autofocus system 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.510
 I still do not understand as before 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.910
 I hope that the engineers just messed up 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.579
 modules in d7000 everything is cool but in 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.769
 full-frame models of the same 39 points 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.840
 too close to the center 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.030
 focusing fast and false 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.099
 Passages noticed a little but problems in 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.169
 basically begin when you try to hover 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.630
 focus on objects at the edge of the frame 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.620
 still in such a cell 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.500
 positioning would like to see 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.459
 cooler solutions 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.569
 sensitivity of the camera and makes 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.819
 many competitors 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.739
 They say that it is even cooler than before 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.260
 41 of the recognized leaders 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.930
 so I say this in a full review 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.389
 d 4 but for now we are looking at retro futurism 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.370
 apart working value 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.510
 damn it is strange to say 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.690
 almost all 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.209
 operating range from 100 to 12800 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.849
 and expanding to 4 steps above and to 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.500
 one step lower you can calmly 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.330
 enjoy almost all 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.630
 the values ​​are worth remembering 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.090
 rules shot in jpeg from 12,800 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.400
 go to raw even maximum value 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.400
 after processing easily fit for bean 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.900
 we decided to print photos from this 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.300
 glad in the mirror to see what 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.700
 iso values will become boundary for 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.370
 print in 4 and compare this to ours 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:01.020
 reference print 100 iso 800 units 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:04.110
 1603 206 400 I personally make a difference completely 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.590
 I see neither in details nor in noise 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.990
 email 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.020
 12 thousand 800 viewed 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.330
 a little noise as a show of noise under a magnifying glass 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.940
 in principle, you can print formats and 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.650
 more everything will be top at 25600 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.110
 there is a slight loss 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.060
 details on small textures but about this i 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.230
 Does anyone tell you considering 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.169
 picture on the wall 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.630
 but 51200 more I better not 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.270
 print appears soap noise loss 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.380
 details if previous value is easy 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.530
 could print 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.320
 again the gain is three notches higher than 10 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.020
 15 is not worth it though for the web is quite 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.780
 come down with a gain of 4 steps all 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.190
 sad even in 10 by 15 format and all 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.110
 it's because of the color noise 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.450
 but it is worth translating this mush into 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.789
 black and white and you will become great somehow 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.250
 Realistic video device of course not 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.740
 writes that it is a pity because it turns out 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.350
 that the universal camera is not exactly 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.300
 will the inner possibilities be the same 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.419
 as in the rest of the mirror mirrors 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.280
 dynamic range expansion 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.229
 bracketing is nothing special yes 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.479
 the pictures are the same as in 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.890
 the rest of the full frame mirrors juicy 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.940
 beautiful rich and 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.250
 detailed 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.360
 and two more minuses about which I just don’t 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.850
 I can keep silent 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.710
 if you have already created a retro style camera and 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.760
 put the shutter speed control like 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.610
 single wheel 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.940
 If you have already released Nicole 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.950
 50 f-18 g which is essentially normal 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.680
 fifty kopecks only with white metal 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.510
 the border is where I ask him the management 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.150
 diaphragm through the wheel on 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.240
 lens lack of intermediate 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.650
 shutter speeds between one 60 and 1 125 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.020
 and 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.710
 but just killed and let it be a principle but I 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.780
 I want to shoot for 1 80 absence 1 8 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.820
 thousand on a bit sad and for whom 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.949
 this camera turns out for three pieces 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.259
 hard earned bucks someone 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.990
 says for hipsters someone for retro 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.300
 filov and someone for professionals but 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.889
 retro fil and continue to film 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.530
 hipsters instagram 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.840
 and professionals will never change their 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.360
 black big monstrous carcasses and 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.639
 potential buyer nikon df this 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.370
 a man who is selflessly in love with 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.410
 SLRs of this company which 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.510
 needs modern technology with their 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.639
 conveniences simplicity is absolutely not 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.340
 needs video filming and ready 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.979
 spend 3 thousand dollars for 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.750
 stand out either nikon frost will reduce 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:30.220
 price and for many it will become 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.220
 emotional purchase
