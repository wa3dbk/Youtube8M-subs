 There the camera is not going here. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 he does not know the shell here and she's a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 turbocharged guitar 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 He put it that I come back to train this. 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.730
 here in my motorcycle oxygen 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.750
 here in the technological arm of the fender 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 so the guitar was show 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.850
 so here is a dream, copa do brasil 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.829
 those chords of always to you 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:46.520

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:46.520
 1 now from arm as middle 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.989
 I'll talk about this soon 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:59.760
 position 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:01:02.760
 the middle in 1 to 1 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 1 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:22.050
 will now make a gap in the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.050
 half out of date 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.759
 now the following as double health and the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.430
 in 15 minutes 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:50.090
 so they kind of fell out of it. 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:50.090
 house stays the same thing then fell 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:58.799
 even make a guy who has this 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.709
 thing sometimes does not match we will get there 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.950
 sometimes it has not married 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:07.289
 sometimes so happens when 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.049
 probably here to home would 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.630
 who pick up the positive wire have cirrhosis and 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.660
 put in place of the earth and the negative of 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.150
 range if put in the key team to marry 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.459
 but then it happens that you are invested with 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.130
 cpf in the case of pain and contact that is 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.750
 invested in the phase is a common practice if 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.769
 Do this for a couple, I'm a taster. 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.769
 now I'll put a drive 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.420
 I was not here but being so I am 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.099
 with a new song 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.250
 You'll hear her we're standing. 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.689
 so I closed it here then one 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.689
 A little and I was here 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.190

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:26.290

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:29.359
 i and ii 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.040
 This is this kind of thing, so I 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.170
 Fuck you, because singing when 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.370
 You play the game that I closed 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.739
 more by volume 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:45.889
 It will look cool but I put more 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:47.659
 a dream note the functions of mouth shed 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:52.659
 gross thing I want one more thing 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.659
 close to life for the bahiano 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.830
 here comes 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.360
 baby 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.620
 So I heard that combination is very 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.859
 so cool you have a combination 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.450
 different from pickups you hit a 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.770
 model you have these options of tite 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.320
 promises 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.520
 I'll play it later in his hand. 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:37.760
 record the song with her I trust is 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.760
 just see the son 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:59.020
 i and ii 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.590
 Do not trust that, that's it. 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:10.580
 so wood diploma 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.979
 you have a legal way, cool legal 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.979
 then in this case here is this shell model 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:18.979
 It has the same configuration and a given 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.360
 a standing fair in the wood of the cup 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.280
 of arm things 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.229
 this is what was bad so more 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.930
 cheap you will give you a souped 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.750
 Can you have a team? 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.159
 cool, nice, yes, the label matters 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.610
 it's not because the main one in itÃ¡alia 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.629
 flags we forget that the flag 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.370
 That's a combination right here. 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:47.930
 is not a stratum or put these 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:54.949
 settings that we use a lot 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:57.940

 your good prices as maicon price is 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.690
 Fortunately in Brazil, we have to 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:10.759
 run for the most 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:12.590
 Why are you expensive? 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.900

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.719
