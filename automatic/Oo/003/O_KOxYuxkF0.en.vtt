recommend<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.040> you<00:02:07.220> have<00:02:07.400> a<00:02:07.430> head<00:02:07.790> like

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
recommend it if you have a head like

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.539 
recommend it if you have a head like

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
mines that's a large the extra large or

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.699 
mines that's a large the extra large or
