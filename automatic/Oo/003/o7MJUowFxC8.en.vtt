00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649

saw Ross long um I was like you know
what<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.920> hell<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.519> thought

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
what the hell is going on I thought

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
what the hell is going on I thought
maybe<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.510> um<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.830> those

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
maybe it was a um you know one of those

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.010 
maybe it was a um you know one of those
maps<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.880> throw<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
maps where you just throw in there and I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
maps where you just throw in there and I
it'd<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.710> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> cool<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.490> Raven<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.030> but

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it'd be kind of cool like Raven down but

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.260 
it'd be kind of cool like Raven down but
it's<00:01:12.780> probably<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.100> raven<00:01:14.430> down<00:01:14.760> feel<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
it's probably got a raven down feel to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
it's probably got a raven down feel to
it<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.540> mean<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.810> course<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.409> environment

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it I mean of course not the environment

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.550 
it I mean of course not the environment
or<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.460> know<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> looks<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.270> but

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
or you know what it looks like but

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.020 
or you know what it looks like but
definitely<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> map<00:01:20.009> size<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.759> very

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
definitely with the map size and very

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
definitely with the map size and very
limited<00:01:21.450> weapons<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.619> Raven<00:01:22.979> down

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
limited weapons I think in Raven down

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.330 
limited weapons I think in Raven down
from<00:01:23.520> years<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.330> war<00:01:24.600> one<00:01:24.960> only<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.619> grenades

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
from years of war one only had grenades

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
from years of war one only had grenades
I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.060> was<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.210> only<00:01:27.479> power<00:01:27.780> weapon

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I think that was the only power weapon

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.670 
I think that was the only power weapon
uh<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.220> ya<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> think<00:01:30.689> about<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> how<00:01:31.650> sick

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
uh but ya know I think about it how sick

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.010 
uh but ya know I think about it how sick
would<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.189> be<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.670> remade<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> raven

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
would it be if they remade like a raven

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.929 
would it be if they remade like a raven
down<00:01:34.200> or<00:01:34.439> an<00:01:34.560> old<00:01:34.770> bones<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.280> would<00:01:35.400> love<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> see

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
down or an old bones I would love to see

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.460 
down or an old bones I would love to see
that<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.299> seems<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.810> keep<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.170> back

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that it seems like they keep going back

pretty sure tomorrow ram shadow comes
out<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.930> there's<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> new

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
out so there's going to be a new

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.030 
out so there's going to be a new
campaign<00:01:54.119> i<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.990> new<00:01:55.259> chapters<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
campaign i think a new chapters for the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.580 
campaign i think a new chapters for the
campaign<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.850> i<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:58.200> i<00:01:58.380> heard

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
campaign and i think if i heard

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.010 
campaign and i think if i heard
correctly<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.460> prequel<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.270> they're

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
correctly it's a prequel so they're

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
correctly it's a prequel so they're
going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> show<00:02:01.409> what<00:02:01.710> happened<00:02:02.130> before<00:02:02.520> gears

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
going to show what happened before gears

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.030 
going to show what happened before gears
one<00:02:03.030> maybe<00:02:03.329> don't<00:02:04.020> quote<00:02:04.170> me<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.890> i'm

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
one maybe don't quote me on that so i'm

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.500 
one maybe don't quote me on that so i'm
assuming<00:02:05.450> from<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.750> heard

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
assuming from what I heard

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.480 
assuming from what I heard
but<00:02:08.320> I'm<00:02:08.470> excited<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:09.100> get<00:02:09.220> some<00:02:09.460> new

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450

and don't forget that little tip where
um<00:03:13.000> if<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.930> spawns<00:03:14.590> actually<00:03:15.250> flip<00:03:15.580> someone

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239

that's<00:03:23.200> actually<00:03:23.380> extremely<00:03:24.780> important<00:03:25.780> when

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
that's actually extremely important when

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.479

if I mean I know that gb is just

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.220 
if I mean I know that gb is just
execution<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.660> really<00:03:31.870> doesn't<00:03:32.110> help

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
execution so that really doesn't help

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.470
