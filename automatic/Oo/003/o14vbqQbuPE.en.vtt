Games what's so good about the 002 and
why<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> pro<00:00:46.910> we<00:00:47.910> improved<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.539> our

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
why is it pro we improved on our

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
why is it pro we improved on our
original<00:00:49.559> chain<00:00:49.770> catcher<00:00:50.010> by<00:00:50.280> putting<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
original chain catcher by putting a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.639 
original chain catcher by putting a
locking<00:00:51.180> mechanism<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> keep<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.410> place

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
locking mechanism in to keep it in place

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
locking mechanism in to keep it in place
we<00:00:53.190> used<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:54.000> good<00:00:54.210> crosshatch

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
we used to have a very good crosshatch

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.180 
we used to have a very good crosshatch
system<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.289> held<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.649> place<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
system that held it in place but this

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.459 
system that held it in place but this
absolutely<00:00:56.879> locks<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.480> place<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:58.260> also

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
absolutely locks it in place it also

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.130 
absolutely locks it in place it also
allows<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> mechanic<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.910> yourself<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.989> owner

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
allows a mechanic for yourself the owner

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
allows a mechanic for yourself the owner
of<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.379> bike<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.770> check<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> derailleur<00:01:02.579> make

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
of the bike to check the derailleur make

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
of the bike to check the derailleur make
sure<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.420> tight<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.530> other<00:01:04.680> chain<00:01:04.920> catchers

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
sure it's tight the other chain catchers

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.980 
sure it's tight the other chain catchers
on<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> market<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.909> come<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> derailleur

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
on the market that come on a derailleur

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.330 
on the market that come on a derailleur
they<00:01:07.170> actually<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:07.619> allow<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.189> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
they actually don't allow you to do that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.460 
they actually don't allow you to do that
they're<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> bolt<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.020> we've

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
they're in the way of that bolt so we've

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
they're in the way of that bolt so we've
improved<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> last<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.610> pieces<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.270> felt

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
improved on the last two pieces we felt

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.140 
improved on the last two pieces we felt
we're<00:01:12.720> missing<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.939> chain

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
we're missing of the of the chain

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.090 
we're missing of the of the chain
catcher<00:01:15.420> world<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.530> lighter<00:01:16.770> than<00:01:16.890> our

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
catcher world and it's lighter than our

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
catcher world and it's lighter than our
original<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> lot<00:01:18.180> faster<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.200> more

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
original and a lot faster and more

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.910 
original and a lot faster and more
aerodynamic<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.360> 002<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.320> course

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
aerodynamic so that's the 002 of course

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.710 
aerodynamic so that's the 002 of course
we<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.369> two<00:01:23.729> catchers<00:01:24.150> for<00:01:24.180> every

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
we have two catchers for every
