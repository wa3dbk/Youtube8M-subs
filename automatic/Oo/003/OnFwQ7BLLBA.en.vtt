00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:20.890
 Look, it's going to be the hard driver to where 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 People are another video from Channel 123 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 physics 1 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:31.000
 in this video where I will teach how to 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:34.329
 you do the front part of the plane 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.929
 not in case this is my jet 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:46.600
 that I did is the part to canopla your 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:51.249
 name health goes ahead there you go 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.579
 forward modeling is the case takes a 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:57.100
 bottle of guarana or soda 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.800
 whichever is the preferred medium 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.440
 diagonal that is to enjoy and quickly 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.270
 because in your easy understand 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.119
 let's assume that this is ahead of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.060
 plane may be smaller also than this 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.880
 here will shrink is practically shrink 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 up to almost half 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.280
 I put here is that the front of the plane 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.649
 put there a newsletter 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.100
 you cut a distance that is the engine 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:34.689
 will be alone with the airbus to strong 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:40.960
 sure to do now is get a 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:43.990
 hair dryer and will go through the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.759
 edges close up 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.740
 This is just because the technician can not be 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.289
 with hair dryer same I will do 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.659
 here you will notice that it will shrink this 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.509
 part or is going to model in the body of the 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.950
 plane can be round triangular video 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.950
 that is'll call here 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 17 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.560
 from here it works 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.180
 no retractable internal 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:48.019
 Hey, look, this model is ready. 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:50.060
 It is difficult to draw the box model here 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.530
 which becomes different around a 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:59.959
 little to lacie there is caring to instruct 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.629
 play a little bit because the more you 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.930
 kentaro plus he will squeeze the gent not 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:11.180
 it will shrink there until it crushes styrofoam 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:16.569
 in case Styrofoam should try to boot 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.569
 I like making video in real time 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.819
 I get there is only the small square 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.859
 format that was box 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.019
 if you want to fill the box there clear 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:41.620
 You're going to come in very well just think 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.620
 cut chubby and look what benin does 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.750
 that is put in the beak of the airplane calculate 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.909
 what is going to be the cut here 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:54.290
 then just spray this from here with spray 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:57.049
 any one sprint dries fast as I 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.810
 I was doing this for my p 51 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:05.379
 I said I'll take and and for those who do not 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:09.829
 know is right the idea is to model din 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:13.220
 singing it goes on shrinking even more 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.769
 It's okay, people, there's a tip to the beak. 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.310
 of the plane gets plastic debate 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.639
 cushions also have to it do not beat 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.419
 in front of the wind of the airplane so common 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.880
 diagonally 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.880
 the wind tends to come out on the sides 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:36.500
 It's a young man on the channel if he writes 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.159
 add videos to favorites 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.159
 the ball
