00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.760 
do and like I said we just wanted to go
after<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.340> didn't<00:02:02.490> want

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
after we didn't want

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.099 
after we didn't want
any<00:02:02.890> regrets<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.820> our<00:02:04.420> overtime<00:02:04.689> showed

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.479 
that and I thought that if we went in
with<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.509> rate<00:02:07.780> great<00:02:08.289> mentality<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.009> we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489
