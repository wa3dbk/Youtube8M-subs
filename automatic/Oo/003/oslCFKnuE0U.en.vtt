00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.910
 we are on the road today with the 435 convertible 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.110
 to yes in our our favorite days too 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.510
 relive 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.400
 last year we were here with one with the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.400
 previous generation m3 cabrio 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.550
 and today we're going to do it 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.360
 redo with the new 4 5 and 13 kw oh 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.520
 yes it was a 3 series convertible it's called 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.370
 nowadays 4 series as you know 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.559
 he is here he is and yes let's go right away 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.479
 start with a feature of this car 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.100
 which is very convenient for us to 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.740
 normal cabrio we can store our things 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.790
 lost and need research cap we can 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.170
 no longer with 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.460
 but we have them very handy at BMW 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.410
 solved because yes we have reasonable 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.750
 some things with us 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.000
 as you can see he took the camera off 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.600
 a greater chance and he must do something like that 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.180
 then it doesn't go well won't 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.369
 but we bmw have thought of them 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.479
 to see how does it again 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.479
 he here the button 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.320
 has the top ym old 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.290
 a whole roof construction 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.750
 just take a step up because you do 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.240
 Put this up and you just have one 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.060
 I am allowed to load a lot of luggage space with stuff 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.130
 really well thought out 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.570
 we will do this again just do this 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.950
 down again 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.950
 real extremely easy 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.440
 a tire we're ready to drive you in 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.899
 is very bmw again 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.370
 not very pronounced or something but yes 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.720
 very nice place 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.720
 beautiful bmw stick 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.230
 nice screen 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.100
 we have the 35th with us 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.720
 it is also available as 28i and our 20d 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.670
 I can be very brief about that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.820
 just take 5 and adrie and 28 in 245 hp 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.820
 6000 euros is around cheaper 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.360
 yes believe me that 35 is the extra cost of 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.030
 6,000 euros more than worth it in one 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.970
 fantastic 6 and line engine with the turbo 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.950
 and yes, this engine has been around for so long 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.540
 from the previous generation that is that 3 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.110
 series and it's only gone 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.770
 evolved and he's so bad now 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.770
 nice 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:09.190
 To avoid this 305 horsepower four below zero and 5 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.280
 us could only go 100 250 km per hour 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.420
 the sound of their six-cylinder delicious 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.420
 real one 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.510
 so you just have to take that we 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.250
 we have just 3 we are over and then 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.470
 do you have the choice for a manual gearbox or 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.379
 a vending machine 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.950
 we again a vending machine well porches 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.950
 Keep up 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.810
 it is really a problem 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.250
 he really switches 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.460
 do not normally it's just normal 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.860
 vending machine 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.240
 he is not as nervous as the double 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.520
 headline 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.320
 my profession but it does offer that speed 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.240
 is really not normally fast and yes so 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.730
 say this is the best gearbox 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.520
 is ever really he is really fantastic 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.520
 team or 10 to not normal 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.000
 ours as long as that equipped with 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.600
 the m package 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.850
 and that makes a name with this convertible 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.919
 a bit tighter a bit a bit more 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.460
 that more refined or something like that really drives it 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.949
 lovely it's not a real m so he 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.020
 is not super tight in a bend is 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:40.330
 not so that you really go circuit 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.330
 drive but it is nice 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.729
 as usual with bmw you can yes 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.189
 take everything as an option 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.800
 including a fantastic harman card 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.110
 sound system yes you think it is 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.120
 superfluous luxury what should I do with it 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.419
 its hi-fi systems is normal system 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.979
 fine then i think i always say if 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.169
 you we this real the we volume button 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.939
 open running well then surely than brands 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:28.029
 really something special 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:28.029
 and yes the sound is really yes or equator 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.310
 you fucking nowhere and bass upstairs 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.310
 a turtle 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.180
 like I said it does not send fine 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.520
 super tight you have to wait a while for the 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:56.930
 and again 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.480
 this block is great anyway 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.860
 because it has evolved a bit older 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.990
 blocks 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.540
 know when there are also all of that is 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.410
 also a nice one at around 35 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.410
 you can if you want 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.039
 how real and achievement are, I have it 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.039
 about 400 hp plus 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:19.530
 by a fairly simple tuning yes 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.930
 so just like us those s4 those marsyas 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.419
 This is also a car testing universe 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.520
 can evolve with you 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.259
 as soon as you need more power or 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.970
 a better sound through one 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.889
 other exhaust 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.599
 then that is possible at one of the many 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.599
 tuners that are BMW drivers 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.310
 and yes in particular type of exhaust you this is 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.169
 then a 35i and it sounds good you hear 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.940
 gets a nice roll even then 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:51.139
 grain of little dance and he sounds 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:54.840
 just neat it is a nice sound 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:57.110
 but very exist as with a 35 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.110
 heard 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:10.909
 today we have the same feeling again 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:13.699
 nice day falls like with that m3 cabrio 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:16.309
 lovely weather nice power a 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:18.679
