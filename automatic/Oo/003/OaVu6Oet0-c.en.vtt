Maleficent fan art so the reason as to

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.930 
Maleficent fan art so the reason as to
why<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.660> decided<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.410> draw<00:00:45.950> Maleficent<00:00:46.670> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
why I decided to draw Maleficent and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.240 
why I decided to draw Maleficent and
Aurora<00:00:47.480> is<00:00:47.780> because<00:00:48.199> I<00:00:48.230> thought<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.860> movie

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
Aurora is because I thought the movie

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.460 
Aurora is because I thought the movie
pretty<00:00:49.879> much<00:00:50.090> focused<00:00:50.780> on<00:00:50.989> their

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
pretty much focused on their

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.369 
pretty much focused on their
relationship<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.670> also<00:00:53.360> because<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:53.720> had<00:00:54.170> this

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
relationship and also because I had this

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.979 
relationship and also because I had this
initial<00:00:54.830> confusion<00:00:55.250> as<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:56.210> why<00:00:56.330> Maleficent

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
initial confusion as to why Maleficent

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.170 
initial confusion as to why Maleficent
developed<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.559> sort<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:58.040> love<00:00:58.339> for<00:00:58.580> Aurora<00:00:58.879> I

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
developed that sort of love for Aurora I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.090 
developed that sort of love for Aurora I
mean<00:00:59.390> she<00:00:59.600> was<00:00:59.720> pretty<00:01:00.019> much<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:00.440> child<00:01:00.769> of

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
mean she was pretty much the child of

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.689 
mean she was pretty much the child of
the<00:01:01.129> king<00:01:01.750> with<00:01:02.750> another<00:01:03.230> woman<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.460> King

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
the king with another woman and the King

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.210 
the king with another woman and the King
betrayed<00:01:05.150> Maleficent<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:05.990> if<00:01:06.470> I<00:01:06.890> was

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
betrayed Maleficent and if I was

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.810 
betrayed Maleficent and if I was
Maleficent<00:01:07.790> I<00:01:07.970> would<00:01:08.360> be<00:01:08.540> very<00:01:08.870> hateful<00:01:09.229> I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
Maleficent I would be very hateful I

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.340 
Maleficent I would be very hateful I
think<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.940> confusion<00:01:11.119> was<00:01:11.930> because<00:01:12.320> I

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
think the confusion was because I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.190 
think the confusion was because I
initially<00:01:12.979> expected<00:01:13.820> Maleficent<00:01:14.540> or<00:01:14.720> her

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
initially expected Maleficent or her

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.080 
initially expected Maleficent or her
character<00:01:15.530> in<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.010> new<00:01:16.190> movie<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.729> be<00:01:16.850> very

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
character in the new movie to be very

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.870 
character in the new movie to be very
similar<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.960> character<00:01:18.560> in<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.400> animated

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
similar to the character in the animated

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.000 
similar to the character in the animated
movie<00:01:20.030> Sleeping<00:01:20.780> Beauty<00:01:21.049> which<00:01:21.170> was<00:01:21.409> purely

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
movie Sleeping Beauty which was purely

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.950 
movie Sleeping Beauty which was purely
evil<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:22.939> I<00:01:22.970> found<00:01:23.299> out<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:23.780> obviously

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
evil but I found out that obviously

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.500 
evil but I found out that obviously
Maleficent<00:01:24.950> in<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.189> new<00:01:25.340> movie<00:01:25.760> was<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.240> lot

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
Maleficent in the new movie was a lot

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.719 
Maleficent in the new movie was a lot
nicer<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:27.229> just<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:27.770> something<00:01:28.549> bad

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
nicer it's just that something bad

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.090 
nicer it's just that something bad
happened<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.299> her<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:29.689> that's<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.590> reason<00:01:30.950> as

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
happened to her and that's the reason as

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.929 
happened to her and that's the reason as
to<00:01:31.130> why<00:01:31.460> she<00:01:31.760> became<00:01:31.880> somewhat<00:01:32.780> evil<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:34.549> I

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
to why she became somewhat evil so I

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.209 
to why she became somewhat evil so I
wanted<00:01:35.299> to<00:01:35.390> translate<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:36.170> confusion<00:01:36.829> as

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
wanted to translate that confusion as

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.919 
wanted to translate that confusion as
well<00:01:37.820> as<00:01:37.969> the<00:01:38.090> understanding<00:01:38.570> that<00:01:38.810> I

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
well as the understanding that I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.410 
well as the understanding that I
developed<00:01:39.590> after<00:01:39.920> watching<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.429> movie<00:01:40.460> into

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
developed after watching the movie into

00:01:41.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
developed after watching the movie into
a<00:01:41.450> drawing

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.800 

if<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.130> can't<00:02:53.370> already<00:02:53.610> tell<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.510> actually

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
if you can't already tell I actually

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.010 
if you can't already tell I actually
used<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.590> reference<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.940> pose<00:02:57.240> in<00:02:57.660> this

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
used a reference for the pose in this

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.550 
used a reference for the pose in this
drawing<00:02:58.440> which<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.130> from<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.570> famous<00:03:00.810> artwork

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
drawing which is from the famous artwork

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.220 
drawing which is from the famous artwork
by<00:03:01.790> Michelangelo<00:03:02.790> which<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.300> called<00:03:03.600> pa<00:03:03.930> da

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
by Michelangelo which is called pa da

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.620 
by Michelangelo which is called pa da
and<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:06.030> sculpture<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.020> depicts<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
and it is a sculpture that depicts the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.690

mother<00:03:09.630> who<00:03:10.080> mourns<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.980> loss<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.460> her

mother who mourns for the loss of her
child<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.840> felt<00:03:13.110> like<00:03:13.320> that's<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
child and I felt like that's the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.010 
child and I felt like that's the
relationship<00:03:14.730> between<00:03:14.940> Maleficent<00:03:15.840> and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020

of<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.049> but<00:04:22.290> I'm<00:04:22.380> not<00:04:22.560> entirely<00:04:23.070> sure<00:04:23.280> how

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
of that but I'm not entirely sure how

of that but I'm not entirely sure how
that<00:04:23.760> was<00:04:24.270> properly<00:04:24.870> conveyed<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.800> did<00:04:26.370> this

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
that was properly conveyed I did this

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.120 
that was properly conveyed I did this
drawing<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:27.090> few<00:04:27.390> weeks<00:04:27.630> back<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.350> I<00:04:28.680> remember

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
drawing a few weeks back and I remember

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.370 
drawing a few weeks back and I remember
being<00:04:29.640> entirely<00:04:30.090> happy<00:04:30.690> when<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:30.870> finished<00:04:31.230> the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
being entirely happy when I finished the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.410 
being entirely happy when I finished the
coloring<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.950> this<00:04:32.100> one<00:04:32.310> but<00:04:32.790> now<00:04:32.970> looking

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
coloring of this one but now looking

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.630 
coloring of this one but now looking
back<00:04:33.480> at<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.200> feel<00:04:34.230> like<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:35.220> could<00:04:35.610> have

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
back at it I feel like it could have

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.280 
back at it I feel like it could have
been<00:04:35.910> better<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.570> there<00:04:36.810> are<00:04:37.020> some

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
been better that there are some

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.080 
been better that there are some
improvements<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.100> can<00:04:38.340> do<00:04:38.580> especially

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090

with<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.840> coloring<00:04:40.170> or<00:04:41.300> how<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.360> characters

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
with the coloring or how the characters

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.620 
with the coloring or how the characters
convey<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.100> emotion<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:44.670> I<00:04:44.820> want<00:04:45.240> them<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.600> I
