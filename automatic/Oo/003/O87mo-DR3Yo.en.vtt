00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
pebble kind effect where you put the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.890 
pebble kind effect where you put the
concrete<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.479> let<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.600> settle

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
concrete in kind of let it settle

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.960 
concrete in kind of let it settle
sprinkle<00:01:28.380> stones<00:01:28.710> push<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.880> get

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
sprinkle stones push them in and you get

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
sprinkle stones push them in and you get
this<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.240> bump<00:01:30.479> pedal<00:01:30.930> effect<00:01:31.259> pebble

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
this like bump pedal effect pebble

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.490 
this like bump pedal effect pebble
effect<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:33.030> um<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:34.110> thinking<00:01:34.170> something

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
effect but um I was thinking something

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.690 
effect but um I was thinking something
like<00:01:34.590> maybe<00:01:34.920> since<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
like maybe since it's going to the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
like maybe since it's going to the
horseshoe<00:01:36.090> pit<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.570> set<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.900> horseshoes<00:01:37.439> in

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
horseshoe pit it set like horseshoes in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
horseshoe pit it set like horseshoes in
the<00:01:37.680> concrete<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.909> was<00:01:39.509> thinking<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.840> we're

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the concrete I was thinking if we're

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.109 
the concrete I was thinking if we're
doing<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> pebbles<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> concrete<00:01:41.430> maybe

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
doing the pebbles in the concrete maybe

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.690 
doing the pebbles in the concrete maybe
doing<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.869> really<00:01:43.110> abstract<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
doing some really abstract kind of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.969 
doing some really abstract kind of
mosaics<00:01:45.570> with<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> pebbles<00:01:46.170> he's<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
mosaics with the pebbles he's a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.530 
mosaics with the pebbles he's a
well-traveled<00:01:47.579> guy<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.119> thinking<00:01:48.390> maybe

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
well-traveled guy so it's thinking maybe

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.069 
well-traveled guy so it's thinking maybe
some<00:01:49.310> mosaics<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.790> places<00:01:51.000> I've<00:01:51.270> been<00:01:51.299> San

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
some mosaics of the places I've been San

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.889 
some mosaics of the places I've been San
Francisco<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.710> Golden<00:01:53.009> Gate<00:01:53.130> bridges

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
Francisco like the Golden Gate bridges

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
Francisco like the Golden Gate bridges
we<00:01:54.899> worked<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> lot<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.770> Italy<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.189> maybe<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
we worked a lot in Italy so maybe it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.609 
we worked a lot in Italy so maybe it
should<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.689> Italian<00:01:58.229> Italian<00:01:58.799> Italy<00:02:00.619> he's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
should have Italian Italian Italy he's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.959

ideas<00:02:05.850> guys<00:02:05.880> again<00:02:06.869> here's<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> steps

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
ideas guys again here's the steps

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.760 
ideas guys again here's the steps
they're<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:10.250> due<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> do

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
they're going to be like that due to do

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.130 
they're going to be like that due to do
they<00:02:12.890> going<00:02:13.190> up<00:02:13.340> they<00:02:13.610> rise<00:02:13.790> six<00:02:14.660> inches<00:02:14.930> per

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
they going up they rise six inches per

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.400 
they going up they rise six inches per
step<00:02:15.440> with<00:02:15.710> an<00:02:15.860> average<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.550> anywhere<00:02:17.000> from<00:02:17.410> 30

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
step with an average of anywhere from 30

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.440 
step with an average of anywhere from 30
to<00:02:18.620> two<00:02:19.310> about<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:20.000> probably<00:02:20.210> going<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.390> be

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
to two about it's probably going to be

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.270 
to two about it's probably going to be
about<00:02:21.070> 55<00:02:22.070> 60<00:02:22.550> inch<00:02:22.810> length<00:02:24.130> concrete<00:02:25.130> pad

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
about 55 60 inch length concrete pad

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.630 
about 55 60 inch length concrete pad
there<00:02:25.520> I'm<00:02:26.480> hoping<00:02:26.690> for<00:02:26.960> some<00:02:27.110> lights<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.860> think

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
there I'm hoping for some lights I think

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.500 
there I'm hoping for some lights I think
we<00:02:28.700> really<00:02:28.970> sharp<00:02:29.210> with<00:02:29.360> some<00:02:29.540> lights<00:02:30.500> oops

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
we really sharp with some lights oops

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.060 
we really sharp with some lights oops
going<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.600> whole<00:02:32.690> way<00:02:32.750> up<00:02:32.960> either<00:02:33.380> alongside

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
going the whole way up either alongside

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.060 
going the whole way up either alongside
or<00:02:34.700> maybe<00:02:34.940> set<00:02:35.330> into<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.780> wood<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.440> was

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
or maybe set into the wood I was

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.230 
or maybe set into the wood I was
actually<00:02:37.160> thinking<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.850> would<00:02:37.940> be<00:02:37.970> cool<00:02:38.210> to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
actually thinking it would be cool to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.470 
actually thinking it would be cool to
have<00:02:39.610> what<00:02:40.610> they<00:02:40.700> called<00:02:40.850> like<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.000> Japanese

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
have what they called like the Japanese

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.450 
have what they called like the Japanese
candle<00:02:41.990> lanterns<00:02:42.350> hanging<00:02:42.800> out<00:02:43.040> here<00:02:43.250> maybe

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
candle lanterns hanging out here maybe

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.250 
candle lanterns hanging out here maybe
this<00:02:44.240> area<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.570> really<00:02:44.750> nice<00:02:44.870> because<00:02:45.020> it's

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
this area is really nice because it's

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.280 
this area is really nice because it's
below<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.710> wall<00:02:46.160> up<00:02:46.730> there<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:47.960> kind<00:02:48.200> of

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
below the wall up there so it's kind of

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.440 
below the wall up there so it's kind of
out<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.770> houses<00:02:49.010> view<00:02:49.460> and<00:02:49.730> there's<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.240> lot

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
out of the houses view and there's a lot

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.890 
out of the houses view and there's a lot
of<00:02:50.480> natural<00:02:51.130> shrubbery<00:02:52.540> surrounding<00:02:53.540> us<00:02:53.690> and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
of natural shrubbery surrounding us and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.350 
of natural shrubbery surrounding us and
his<00:02:54.770> house<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.010> up<00:02:55.280> on<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.490> hill<00:02:55.670> so<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.120> kind

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
his house is up on the hill so it's kind

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.730 
his house is up on the hill so it's kind
of<00:02:56.420> got<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> secluded<00:02:57.080> feel<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:57.620> it's

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
of got the secluded feel so it's

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.880 
of got the secluded feel so it's
thinking<00:02:58.010> maybe<00:02:58.640> something<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.240> could<00:02:59.890> like

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
thinking maybe something that could like

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.010 
thinking maybe something that could like
a<00:03:00.920> soft<00:03:01.250> glow<00:03:01.460> at<00:03:01.730> night<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:02.180> would<00:03:02.300> bring

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
a soft glow at night that would bring

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.170 
a soft glow at night that would bring
your<00:03:03.350> view<00:03:03.650> into<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.130> path<00:03:04.340> Reth<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.880> looking

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
your view into the path Reth and looking

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.490 
your view into the path Reth and looking
out<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.660> make<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.930> feel<00:03:06.080> even<00:03:06.290> more

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
out to it make it feel even more

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.700 
out to it make it feel even more
enclosed<00:03:07.300> so<00:03:08.300> almost<00:03:08.570> done<00:03:08.870> again<00:03:09.440> there's

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
enclosed so almost done again there's

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.990 
enclosed so almost done again there's
the<00:03:09.800> steps<00:03:12.340> see<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:13.460> got<00:03:13.580> some<00:03:13.820> natural

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
the steps see it's got some natural

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.490 
the steps see it's got some natural
curve<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.680> go<00:03:15.770> up<00:03:15.830> there<00:03:16.040> and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
curve to it going to go up there and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.980 
curve to it going to go up there and
eventually<00:03:18.500> try<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.240> tie<00:03:20.240> it<00:03:20.300> into<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:20.780> up

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
eventually try to tie it into this up

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.830 
eventually try to tie it into this up
here<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:22.610> that's<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.880> walkway<00:03:23.120> that<00:03:23.420> goes<00:03:23.480> over

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
here so that's a walkway that goes over

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:35.620 
here so that's a walkway that goes over
here<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:29.620> bah<00:03:30.620> bah<00:03:30.920> bah<00:03:30.980> bum<00:03:34.630> barbecue

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
here and you bah bah bah bum barbecue

stuff like I'll show you the wall rather
than<00:03:55.490> doing<00:03:55.700> straight<00:03:56.420> wall<00:03:56.660> with<00:03:56.900> maybe<00:03:57.140> like

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230
