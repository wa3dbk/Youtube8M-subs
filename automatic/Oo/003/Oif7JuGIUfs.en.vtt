00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.270
 we are in volkswagen to test the 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.610
 new tiguan 2012 that between its 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.320
 features is the only truck in 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.509
 the peru that can be parked alone and 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.950
 that also has a fatigue detector that 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.950
 will be that let's try it 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.770
 plus 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.680
 well we are already inside the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 tiguan and this new model welcomes you with 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 this huge touchscreen screen in the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.420
 center of the console and in can 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 control your ipod any mp3 you 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.620
 cellular by bluetooth and also good the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.290
 radio and everything forget the lever 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.360
 giant so on the handbrake now it's 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 this is electronic is a lever 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.519
 small and fulfills the same function and here 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.199
 there is the auto hold button that is for 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.850
 that when you are on slope if 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.710
 you are with the car there and you do not want 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.750
 go out and let the car go back a bit 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.820
 suddenly go ahead what 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 you put and it gives you up to five seconds to 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.780
 that can go perfect and for her to be 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.440
 forward or suddenly backward 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.440
 etc 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.750
 good the engine of the tiguan 2012 is 2.0 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.460
 tsi has 200 horsepower and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.260
 It also has the power to tow 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.260
 up to 2.5 tons 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.920
 Well it's super comfortable the tiguan also 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.840
 the rudder is quite ergonomic which 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.760
 makes it even more comfortable to maneuver in 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.140
 the car and you can control everything 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.140
 the water entertainment system 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.840
 but the moon function of the old in 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.280
 2012 is the fatigue detector for those 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.560
 long trips 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.080
 once you are on a road in a 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.910
 straight line more than 15 minutes 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.500
 the car automatically knows and goes to 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.570
 feel if it's that suddenly you're 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.150
 falling asleep and there are some trips in 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.190
 the rudder or unexpected is going to come out a 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.500
 a little cup of coffee made in the 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.390
 screen and you will see an acoustic alert 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.550
 what is going to make you realize that 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.760
 It is definitely time to take a 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.760
 break 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.730
 another of the functions that it has is 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.220
 dual climate makes each 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.100
 passenger can determine how 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.770
 hot or cold wants the temperature of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.810
 your side of the cabin and also here is 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.660
 the off road button that good astonishment 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.340
 that the truck is 4x4 all the time 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.580
 but at the time that you suddenly enter 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.290
 to a sandy or pedroso terrain you tighten 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.730
 the off load and your driving experience 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.730
 It will be much more comfortable 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.140
 good one of the most qualities 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.300
 important that the tiguan has is its 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.550
 parking attendant which is what it does 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.740
 monitors the front and the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.260
 back of the car with these sensors 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.970
 here me what are the distances 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.350
 between the car in front and the car 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.270
 back if you're going to square 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.610
 parallel and you just have to 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.209
 accelerate or brake because the car does 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.209
 everything else 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.560
 good now let's use the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.379
 park assistant or just 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.120
 press this button you indicate to the car 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.890
 with your directionals that the side of 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.739
 the track you want to park and 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.569
 you start to move the car now with 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.870
 your sensors will start to monitor 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.700
 the whole area to know what the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.590
 distances between one car and another and if it is 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.450
 that the car fits perfectly into a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.520
 site where we want squares 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.470
 already indicated to me that there is an empty space 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.240
 now they tell me to go back 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.100
 this is the place at the moment this is 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.980
 the moment in which I go to nothing again 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.980
 only good and loose look at 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.860
 yes yes yes we feel it is moving alone not 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.460
 believe that this is a paranormal thing and 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.080
 now he tells me 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.620
 right you have to put drive 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.620
 d 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.410
 ready 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.560
 parking 5 belt grab wallet and we 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.560
 we go
