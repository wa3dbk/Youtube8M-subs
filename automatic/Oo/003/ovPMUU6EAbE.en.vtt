00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
can see it can only go in this way and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
can see it can only go in this way and
it<00:01:07.830> won't<00:01:08.100> work<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.549> other<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.210> kind

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
guess the words to go like this and it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.390 
guess the words to go like this and it
pulls<00:02:11.960> up<00:02:13.870> at<00:02:14.870> least<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:16.340> is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
pulls up at least this is the this is

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
then that goes to the stand and then

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.550 
then that goes to the stand and then
when<00:02:23.210> you<00:02:23.330> flip<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.660> like<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.050> all<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.470> a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
when you flip it like this all of a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.900 
when you flip it like this all of a
sudden<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.130> have<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.430> go<00:02:25.550> like<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.850> and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
sudden you just have to go like this and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.130 
sudden you just have to go like this and
that's<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.300> other<00:02:26.420> work<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.900> really

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
that's the other work so you really

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.960 
that's the other work so you really
deserve<00:02:27.590> only<00:02:27.620> one<00:02:27.980> real<00:02:28.220> way<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.430> fold<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.910> I

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
deserve only one real way to fold it I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.490 
deserve only one real way to fold it I
guess<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:30.620> two<00:02:30.830> different<00:02:30.920> positions<00:02:32.500> so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
guess just two different positions so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.050 
guess just two different positions so
that's<00:02:33.680> about<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:33.950> I'm<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.610> play<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:34.910> a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that's about it I'm going to play with a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.570 
that's about it I'm going to play with a
little<00:02:35.270> wine<00:02:35.530> there's<00:02:36.530> no<00:02:36.650> magnet<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:39.050> does

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
little wine there's no magnet so it does

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.570 
little wine there's no magnet so it does
stay<00:02:40.580> on<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.690> minute<00:02:41.990> you<00:02:42.170> kind<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.680> you

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
stay on but the minute you kind of you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.410 
stay on but the minute you kind of you
know<00:02:43.640> if<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.030> go<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:45.050> here<00:02:46.420> eventually

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
know if you go like this here eventually

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.010 
know if you go like this here eventually

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
it just follow I namely got it for a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.920 
it just follow I namely got it for a
cover<00:02:51.410> I'm<00:02:52.160> not<00:02:52.790> sure<00:02:53.030> again<00:02:53.480> if<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.720> didn't

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
cover I'm not sure again if I didn't

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.000 
cover I'm not sure again if I didn't
want<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.170> keep<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:56.710> think<00:02:57.710> it's<00:02:57.860> probably

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
want to keep it I think it's probably

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.980 
want to keep it I think it's probably
better<00:02:58.340> just<00:02:58.460> to<00:02:58.730> get<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.880> little<00:02:58.970> case<00:02:59.450> but<00:02:59.810> we
