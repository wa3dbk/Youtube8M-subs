00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.170
 let's start 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.010
 I think that in a dozen steps to perform 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.749
 assigned tasks 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.199
 the first and software 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.429
 ensuring kayseri malatya make sure 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.429
 the fact that it is registered to ours 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.550
 connects with the machine we check 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.079
 connection correctness 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.919
 there are no parents choosing you can but 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.919
 group control unit 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.750
 After that, look again at heart 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 bulletins 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.920
 serial firmware 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.200
 out of 70 that is a necessity then 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.710
 we carry out transitions 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.150
 reprogramming program 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.320
 rather helpfully special explanation not 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.600
 requires 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.530
 the main thing is to carry out all of it 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.530
 instructions 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 we reach the necessary firmware 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.890
 matching portfolio with generics 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.380
 Kiev 23 34 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 reasons for the process itself 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.689
 therefore, the shield pressure is warmer 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.689
 current and new calibers 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.280
 click on the experiments of the plant 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.770
 ignition assumptions 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.770
 accessory 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 communication systems with this need 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.890
 she is 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.890
 she is 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 she is 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.810
 she is 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.660
 all is ready 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.250
 and after ignition on 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.410
 pushing a button 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 the process has begun 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.509
 the main thing is not to interfere with communication 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.059
 since our columns use 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.109
 as a communication protocol 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.579
 multi-caliber recording 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.579
 happens automatically 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.979
 turn on the ignition for at least ten 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:36.659
 seconds 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.659
 pressing 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.309
 she is 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:46.709
 she is 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.109
 but 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.509
 she is 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.029
 word points including 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.749
 we played not reported 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.639
 the result of overlap 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.289
 checking lead engineer acting 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:01.180
 vice premier 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.629
 motor control 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.139
 and box control problems pressing 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.489
 finish craftsmanship 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.269
 now we check that the process is successful 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.109
 completed on computer recorded 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.109
 new version 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:19.669
 you can sleep on it
