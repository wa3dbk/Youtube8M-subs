floors first I'm going to talk about the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.849 
floors first I'm going to talk about the
general<00:00:20.730> structure<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.570> book<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.650> first

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
general structure of the book the first

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.740 
general structure of the book the first
three<00:00:23.220> chapters<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.880> introductory<00:00:24.330> in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
three chapters are introductory in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.420 
three chapters are introductory in
nature<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.380> they're<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> ones<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.220> would

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
nature and they're the ones that I would

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.730 
nature and they're the ones that I would
recommend<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.000> everybody<00:00:27.359> reads<00:00:27.840> because

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
recommend that everybody reads because

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.900 
recommend that everybody reads because
they<00:00:28.890> tell<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.220> what's<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> book<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
they tell you what's in the book and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.089 
they tell you what's in the book and
what's<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> book<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.199> also<00:00:31.830> they

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
what's not in the book and also they

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
what's not in the book and also they
tell<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.640> how<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.000> look<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
tell you about how to look at the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.380 
tell you about how to look at the
evidence<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:34.620> present<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> hall<00:00:35.880> with

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
evidence they present in the hall with

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.170 
evidence they present in the hall with
regard<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.430> telling<00:00:38.430> us<00:00:38.550> whether<00:00:38.700> there<00:00:38.969> has

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
regard to telling us whether there has

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.860 
regard to telling us whether there has
been<00:00:39.420> any<00:00:40.020> prior<00:00:40.700> incidences<00:00:41.700> of

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
been any prior incidences of

been any prior incidences of

certain herbs and that's an important

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.400 
certain herbs and that's an important
aspect<00:00:47.010> because<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.090> lack<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.750> real

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
aspect because there is a lack of real

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.549 
aspect because there is a lack of real
clinically<00:00:50.129> relevant<00:00:50.309> evidence<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.780> that

as to how much they're going to factor

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210 
as to how much they're going to factor
that<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:06.900> they're<00:01:07.110> deciding<00:01:07.740> whether<00:01:08.130> to

pharmacodynamics that's important

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
pharmacodynamics that's important
because<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.290> need<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.710> understand<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
because you need to understand the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.440 
because you need to understand the
concepts<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.710> happens<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> patient

takes a pharmaceutical drug and because
we<00:01:27.270> lack<00:01:27.540> real<00:01:27.930> chemical<00:01:28.590> information<00:01:28.979> about

the<00:01:33.299> body<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> use<00:01:34.850> conceptual

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
they could potentially be a negative

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.289 
they could potentially be a negative
interaction<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.590> students<00:01:41.310> learn<00:01:41.640> about<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
interaction so students learn about the

interaction so students learn about the
actions<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.409> drugs<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.009> how<00:01:44.310> they

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
actions of drugs and how they

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.859 
actions of drugs and how they
metabolized<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.299> body<00:01:45.420> and

metabolized in the body and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.440 
metabolized in the body and
practitioners<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.979> refresh<00:01:47.610> their<00:01:47.909> memory

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
practitioners can refresh their memory

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
practitioners can refresh their memory
of<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:49.200> make<00:01:49.409> an<00:01:49.590> assessment<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.280> whether

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
of that to make an assessment of whether

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.130 
of that to make an assessment of whether
they're

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.390 
tential negative interaction the book
also<00:01:53.780> gives<00:01:54.200> one<00:01:54.470> a<00:01:54.500> lot<00:01:54.620> of<00:01:54.740> detail<00:01:55.130> about

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
also gives one a lot of detail about

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.210 
also gives one a lot of detail about

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
exactly how how'd it go about assessing

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.460 
exactly how how'd it go about assessing
