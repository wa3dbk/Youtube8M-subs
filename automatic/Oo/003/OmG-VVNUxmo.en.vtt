00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 hi friends my name is Ivan Nikitin and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.750
 in this video, I suggest you look 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.929
 excerpt from my paid workshops 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.330
 on the interiors in it, I told a lot 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.470
 different themes but one of the walls was just 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.430
 of use 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.080
 Script profile now new versions of it 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.230
 called a little different but the point is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.609
 that you can use standard 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.219
 the sweep modifier that creates you 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.570
 profiles from a specific set but 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.399
 use them not only with 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.170
 standard profiles but also with 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.450
 a huge number of blanks which 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.250
 you may be useful in the interior is 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.070
 and creating commentary words and creating 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.530
 all its windows 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.629
 profile and as such you can do 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 it's literally a few clicks and in 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.800
 this video which you now watch 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.460
 There is an instruction how to use it as 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.840
 install it and where to download it 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.210
 respectively see apply on how 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 I think it will help you very strong 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.650
 creating interiors will do it 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.900
 faster and maybe even quality 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.119
 what 's a nice view if the video 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.000
 I like to remind that you can put 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.439
 Like if you do not like dizlaik and write 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.270
 write necessarily comments to me 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.720
 it is interesting to know your opinion so that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.850
 continue the next video all the success 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.610
 bye nice view one more 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.830
 there is a special modifier 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.369
 there is a separate script 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:34.020
 called he is holy profile that is we 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:39.329
 Similarly, we create for example such 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:44.180
 room forms we have an example 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:48.210
 let's say yes and for example here we have 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.119
 a window or rather not a window but a door on the floor 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.120
 where the plinth should not be with sleep and 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.040
 draw this shape 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.870
 then go run sweet 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.720
 modifier on top 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.560
 sweet profile and choose here simply 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.040
 profile and we immediately create 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.420
 here you can set the settings 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.870
 specularity if we need to top 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.740
 kicked 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:21.410
 you can set the size for example 50 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:24.790
 millimeters by 20 we get this 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:29.060
 way the plinth is literally two clicks 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.970
 profiles a lot of them you can change them 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.180
 many different can you favorites 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.000
 add profiles to yourself here of the world 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.770
 liked it so often use it 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 immediately added and from the same 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.880
 profiles so you each time in his 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.530
 blood and not draw i will now show how 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 this whole thing is set first 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.790
 I will show you how to use it, that is, if 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.390
 profile you some example like 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.209
 it's hard not to draw every time 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.430
 you take it create here on some 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.209
 the object can then be removed 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.930
 press the extract write the name here 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.820
 file 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:15.590
 or rather the name of the form of this spline, he 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:20.450
 your origin is created like this 90 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.420
 start here is the origin here it is 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.980
 created and you can accordingly 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:32.590
 take and use as you need 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.590
 can break it back 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.800
 to make 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:53.850
 from this tabletop now show how 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:58.920
 example oval tabletop daughters 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:01.430
 assign a profile here a little 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.430
 the same 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.070
 unfold it as needed and here 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.720
 in general, you have finished countertops 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:27.650
 Only do not as desired 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:29.620
 square everything is ready you can also 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.700
 then edit this profile already 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.330
 results change accordingly 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.370
 that 's basically all I wanted 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.470
 show about profiles now show 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.229
 how to configure and install this one 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:54.580
 here is sv profile because prepare 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:54.580
 questions that is here we have the profile itself 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.000
 with its new version called track 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:06.550
 script for some reason but the file itself is new 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.390
 my version on 98 let's see 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.910
 on svyatoshino 98 you can download it on 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.880
 manufacturer's website 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.890
 now how to install it 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.870
 so throw this file track here 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:25.360
 script ntp in the window 3d max and just 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.800
 move this file here appears 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.030
 here is the menu click here he became 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.910
 I will not keep it because I already have 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.400
 installed everything click install and all 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.450
 this window disappears now you need 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.060
 To activate this script you need 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.900
 go to the tab Kostanay from the caste 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.420
 ointment server face and customize the menu then 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.310
 there we go in the menu vkladochku I 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.020
 here this mini is already configured that is 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.000
 the script itself it is not called as it is 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.330
 you will decide yourself to be called 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.040
 i called that way here there is a sweep then 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.930
 there is when i press my own 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.920
 the script opens and I can im 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.630
 take advantage of what we have now is 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.910
 I need to create a menu for example 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.220
 there is a menu list I click write here well 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.620
 eg 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:22.560
 sweet, I should have it now 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.420
 now we find him on this list 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.710
 created by our drag here in 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:31.750
 the end here it appears with the view here 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.210
 then we need to add 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.300
 well, the necessary command because often 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.710
 not empty she doesn't even click we need 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.850
 find here on this list 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:48.020
 Alphabetically, we are just looking for clicking 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:51.020
 sw and we find the sweet profile is just 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.620
 there is this script add his trial 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.660
 on the menu 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.480
 now when you click here it is with us 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.620
 appear here click and 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.620
 accordingly, we can already use
