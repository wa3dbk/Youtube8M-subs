 didn't drink just one more time try 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.940
 press nice coffee 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.940
 thereâ€™s nothing to open before 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.950
 Now let's open the menu 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.950
 a cup of this 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.030
 at least 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.100
 Well, as color 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.980
 our color is dark 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.070
 reminds 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:26.320
 as the bias in color we have a drink 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.320
 let's carbonated 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.920
 let's taste it 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.560
 but to taste 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.159
 something reminiscent to coffee 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.339
 Yes 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:52.320
 because probably all of these 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:55.010
 there are aromatic flavors 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.010
 supplements 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.020
 so i would say 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.620
 to taste reminds 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.919
 only to whom 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.919
 for 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:21.229
 here about what is written here 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:28.430
 orange here and squeeze is not visible here 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:32.229
 written orange a little bit connector no no 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.229
 there is no orange here 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.400
 more like the taste as I have 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.400
 said 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.880
 where such a doll so here it can Pepsi 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.880
 Well 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.920
 the most important thing that is not felt 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.420
 alcohol ie his 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.490
 but almost not felt 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.740
 also 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.849
 orange 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.849
 not only fox 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.530
 so here we are 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.530
 legal drink carbonated 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.660

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.350
 press 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.590
 and of saves no less early 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.590
 Well 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:32.259
 especially not zesty coffee there is no orange too 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.810
 to taste generally resemble some 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:38.370
 coca-cola 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:42.569
 such origin fake 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:47.430
 In principle , I do not advise anyone on this 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:50.470
 this lash here these energy drinks 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:54.490

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:57.159
 I do not drink these scissors drinks decided 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:02.490
 right here because of this inscription 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:02.490

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.850
 ice crust like
