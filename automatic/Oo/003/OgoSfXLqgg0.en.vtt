00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
controller but in a pinch you can get a

controller but in a pinch you can get a
Dual<00:00:25.949> Shock<00:00:25.980> 4<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.760> work<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.289> wanted

the controller that comes with that that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.549 
the controller that comes with that that

so I don't have it yet but uh you know
needless<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.420> say<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.220> use

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
needless to say you know you can use

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.170 
needless to say you know you can use
other<00:01:06.510> controllers<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.619> sure<00:01:07.799> USB<00:01:08.670> or

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
other controllers for sure USB or

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.070 
other controllers for sure USB or
bluetooth<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> wired<00:01:12.080> xbox360

bluetooth so if you have a wired xbox360
controller

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
controller

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.429 
controller
that'll<00:01:14.580> probably<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> job<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.630> could

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
that'll probably do the job I could

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
that'll probably do the job I could
probably<00:01:16.979> even<00:01:17.310> plug<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.909> xbox<00:01:18.299> one

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
