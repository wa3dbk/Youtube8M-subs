that gives you two Phillips you then

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.630 
that gives you two Phillips you then
would<00:03:04.170> fit<00:03:04.410> turn<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.920> fish<00:03:05.100> over<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.550> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
would fit turn the fish over to the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.180 
would fit turn the fish over to the
second<00:03:06.030> slide<00:03:06.209> or<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> white<00:03:06.690> side<00:03:07.190> exactly

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
that long sweeping action and that's how

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.360 
that long sweeping action and that's how
you<00:03:28.230> would<00:03:28.530> fill<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:29.180> your<00:03:30.180> fish<00:03:31.160> again<00:03:32.160> a

you would fill it your fish again a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.590 
you would fill it your fish again a
little<00:03:32.549> bit<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.760> row<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.330> I'm<00:03:33.390> going

little bit of row there that I'm going

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.500 
little bit of row there that I'm going
to<00:03:33.630> discard<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:35.010> second<00:03:35.400> side<00:03:35.640> as<00:03:35.940> before

with this is that you don't want to

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.990 
with this is that you don't want to
stack<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.210> fish<00:05:29.479> so<00:05:30.050> once<00:05:30.229> it's<00:05:30.470> actually

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.420 
stack the fish so once it's actually
floured<00:05:32.000> just<00:05:32.599> leave<00:05:32.900> it<00:05:33.080> as<00:05:33.289> it<00:05:33.919> is<00:05:34.009> but<00:05:34.280> don't

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
floured just leave it as it is but don't

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.920 
floured just leave it as it is but don't
stack<00:05:34.759> it<00:05:34.909> again<00:05:35.150> that's<00:05:35.330> more<00:05:35.479> likely<00:05:35.720> to

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
stack it again that's more likely to

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.649 
stack it again that's more likely to
make<00:05:36.289> the<00:05:36.440> fish<00:05:36.650> a<00:05:36.800> little<00:05:37.039> bit<00:05:37.130> soggy<00:05:37.449> now<00:05:38.449> for

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
make the fish a little bit soggy now for

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.689 
make the fish a little bit soggy now for
cooking<00:05:38.919> generally<00:05:39.919> speaking<00:05:40.220> with<00:05:40.580> this

cooking generally speaking with this
type<00:05:40.909> of<00:05:40.940> fish<00:05:41.300> it's<00:05:41.509> not<00:05:41.659> going<00:05:41.870> to<00:05:41.930> take<00:05:42.110> very

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
type of fish it's not going to take very

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.070 
type of fish it's not going to take very
long<00:05:42.530> in<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:43.009> frying<00:05:43.280> pan<00:05:43.479> so<00:05:44.479> what<00:05:44.659> I<00:05:44.690> want<00:05:44.960> to

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
long in the frying pan so what I want to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.379 
long in the frying pan so what I want to
do<00:05:45.229> with<00:05:45.380> that<00:05:45.409> is<00:05:45.740> get<00:05:45.949> that<00:05:46.099> butter<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.820> some

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
oil together so that the butters

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.430 
oil together so that the butters
actually<00:05:49.880> really<00:05:50.389> hot<00:05:50.599> and<00:05:50.810> foaming<00:05:51.080> and

and<00:06:36.180> that<00:06:36.840> flow'd<00:06:37.170> have<00:06:37.380> just<00:06:37.530> begun<00:06:37.770> to

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
seconds or so and then I'm going to just

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.980 
seconds or so and then I'm going to just
add<00:06:46.680> a<00:06:46.740> little<00:06:47.040> bit<00:06:47.310> of<00:06:47.490> lemon<00:06:47.670> juice<00:06:47.970> and<00:06:48.240> some

add a little bit of lemon juice and some
parsley<00:06:49.530> to<00:06:49.860> the<00:06:49.950> pan<00:06:50.220> we<00:06:50.970> have<00:06:51.000> seasoned

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
parsley to the pan we have seasoned

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.630 
parsley to the pan we have seasoned
flour<00:06:51.780> in<00:06:52.050> there<00:06:52.200> already<00:06:52.530> so<00:06:53.310> we<00:06:53.460> don't

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
flour in there already so we don't

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.620 
flour in there already so we don't
actually<00:06:53.760> need<00:06:54.240> to<00:06:54.780> season<00:06:55.500> it<00:06:55.650> any<00:06:55.800> further

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
actually need to season it any further

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.840 
actually need to season it any further
so<00:06:57.630> one<00:06:57.840> fish<00:06:58.170> fill<00:06:58.380> it<00:06:58.470> out<00:06:58.650> it's<00:06:59.430> lost<00:06:59.670> its

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
so one fish fill it out it's lost its

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.460 
so one fish fill it out it's lost its
translucency<00:07:00.750> and<00:07:00.990> feels<00:07:01.920> nice<00:07:02.160> and<00:07:02.190> firm<00:07:02.670> so

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
translucency and feels nice and firm so

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:13.820 
translucency and feels nice and firm so
one<00:07:04.520> two<00:07:07.430> three<00:07:10.250> four<00:07:11.250> and<00:07:12.230> then<00:07:13.230> finally

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.630 

and<00:07:20.460> then<00:07:20.730> just<00:07:21.270> pour<00:07:21.510> that<00:07:21.690> over<00:07:21.960> the<00:07:22.620> fish<00:07:22.950> to

and then just pour that over the fish to
serve<00:07:24.170> and<00:07:25.170> that's<00:07:25.530> how<00:07:25.860> you<00:07:25.920> fill<00:07:26.850> it<00:07:27.000> skin
