manager class I promise you guys we only
have<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.769> more<00:00:10.920> method<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.340> build<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.759> all

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
have one more method to build and all

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.450 
have one more method to build and all
this<00:00:12.630> method<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.769> going<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
this method is going to do is going to

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.680 
this method is going to do is going to
create<00:00:15.030> image<00:00:16.670> compatible<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:18.060> your

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
create image compatible with your

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.380 
create image compatible with your
monitor<00:00:19.350> pretty<00:00:19.650> much<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.150> we're<00:00:21.300> going

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
monitor pretty much so what we're going

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.670 
monitor pretty much so what we're going
to<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.689> doing<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.140> we're<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> be

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
to be doing is we're going to be

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.400 
to be doing is we're going to be
returning<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.310> buffered<00:00:23.939> image<00:00:24.390> or<00:00:24.630> an<00:00:25.109> image

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
returning a buffered image or an image

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.490 
returning a buffered image or an image
that<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:26.220> our<00:00:26.340> buffer<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> use<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
that that our buffer is going to use and

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.990 
that that our buffer is going to use and
it's<00:00:28.500> pretty<00:00:28.680> much<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> create<00:00:29.789> an

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it's pretty much just going to create an

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359 
it's pretty much just going to create an
image<00:00:30.179> based<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.140> what<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.500> need<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:32.099> our

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
image based on what we need for our

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.970 
image based on what we need for our
monitors<00:00:32.910> settings<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.110> let's<00:00:34.140> go<00:00:34.530> ahead<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
monitors settings so let's go ahead and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:45.880 
monitors settings so let's go ahead and
name<00:00:35.070> public<00:00:37.010> buffered<00:00:38.899> image<00:00:40.520> create<00:00:44.600> create

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
name public buffered image create create

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.220 
name public buffered image create create
compatible<00:00:46.890> image<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.840> it's<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.020> take

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
compatible image and it's going to take

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.750 
compatible image and it's going to take
three<00:00:49.590> parameters<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.430> W<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.930> width<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
three parameters in W for the width and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.470 
three parameters in W for the width and
H<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> height<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:56.100> T<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.820> T<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
H for the height and in T and T is

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.099 
H for the height and in T and T is
transparency<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:59.550> those<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.629> three<00:01:00.930> things

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
transparency and those are three things

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.290 
transparency and those are three things
you<00:01:01.379> pretty<00:01:01.559> much<00:01:01.739> need<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.730> buffered

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you pretty much need for your buffered

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.920 
you pretty much need for your buffered
image<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.830> width

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
image right now with a width

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.260 
image right now with a width
pickup's<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.110> height<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.830> your<00:01:08.070> image<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
pickup's a height of your image and the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.000 
pickup's a height of your image and the
transparency<00:01:09.930> settings<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.710> which<00:01:10.830> we'll

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
transparency settings for it which we'll

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.219 
transparency settings for it which we'll
talk<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.159> later<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> need<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
talk about later on so now you need to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.630 
talk about later on so now you need to
create<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> window<00:01:13.710> object<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> don't<00:01:14.460> name<00:01:14.610> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
create a window object and don't name it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.539 
create a window object and don't name it
W<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.330> W<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.110> width<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.040> so

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
W because W is actually width up here so

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
W because W is actually width up here so
name<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.970> win<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.630> something<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> set

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
name it like win or something and set

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.080 
name it like win or something and set
equal<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.310> VC<00:01:21.439> get<00:01:22.439> fullscreen<00:01:23.130> window<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
equal the VC get fullscreen window so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
equal the VC get fullscreen window so
now<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.869> equal<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.009> window<00:01:26.340> you're

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
now when is equal to the window you're

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.870 
now when is equal to the window you're
looking<00:01:26.850> at<00:01:27.000> pretty<00:01:27.210> much<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.259> put<00:01:28.770> R<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
looking at pretty much so put R if the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.390 
looking at pretty much so put R if the
win<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:31.110> equal<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.530> null<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.159> has

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
win is not equal to null if it has

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
win is not equal to null if it has
something<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.170> want<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
something in it then what do we want to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.609 
something in it then what do we want to
do<00:01:34.880> well<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> first<00:01:36.000> thing<00:01:36.570> when<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
do well the first thing when you do is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.640 
do well the first thing when you do is
get<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> characteristics<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.509> our<00:01:40.079> monitor

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
get the characteristics of our monitor

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
get the characteristics of our monitor
now<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.189> can't<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.909> ahead<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.240> our

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
now we can't just go ahead in our

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.580 
now we can't just go ahead in our
computer<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.899> look<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> settings

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
computer and look at the settings

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.319 
computer and look at the settings
because<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.070> want<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.369> computer<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.030> run<00:01:45.210> on

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
because we want this computer to run on

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.179 
because we want this computer to run on
every<00:01:45.570> game<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.829> different

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
every game so it's going to be different

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.160 
every game so it's going to be different
for<00:01:47.310> every<00:01:47.579> monitor<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.479> let's<00:01:48.750> go<00:01:48.869> ahead<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
for every monitor so let's go ahead and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.240 
for every monitor so let's go ahead and
put<00:01:49.970> graphics

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.000 

configuration<00:01:55.250> GC<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.290> set<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:57.410> equal<00:01:57.800> to

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
configuration GC and set this equal to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.820 
configuration GC and set this equal to
the<00:01:58.160> windows<00:01:58.610> dot<00:01:59.240> get<00:01:59.960> graphics

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
the windows dot get graphics

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.160 
the windows dot get graphics
configuration<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.000> what<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:02.780> pretty<00:02:03.020> much

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
configuration and what this pretty much

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.100 
configuration and what this pretty much
does<00:02:03.410> is<00:02:03.680> get<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.360> characteristics<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.540> your

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
does is get the characteristics of your

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.560 
does is get the characteristics of your
monitor<00:02:06.590> or<00:02:06.830> who<00:02:07.250> whatever<00:02:07.760> monitor<00:02:08.330> is

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
monitor or who whatever monitor is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.960 
monitor or who whatever monitor is
running<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.530> program<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.310> it's<00:02:10.759> going<00:02:10.910> to

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
running this program and it's going to

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.140 
running this program and it's going to
store<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.450> in<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:12.050> variable<00:02:12.080> called<00:02:12.910> GC<00:02:13.940> and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
store it in a variable called GC and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.300 
store it in a variable called GC and
let's<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:14.930> if<00:02:14.959> we<00:02:15.020> can<00:02:15.200> see<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.740> can't<00:02:16.160> read

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
let's see if we can see it I can't read

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.860 
let's see if we can see it I can't read
that<00:02:16.459> because<00:02:16.550> my<00:02:16.850> screen<00:02:17.270> recorder<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.780> in

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
that because my screen recorder is in

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.900 
that because my screen recorder is in
the<00:02:17.959> way<00:02:18.080> but<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.010> just<00:02:19.250> told<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.550> what<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.760> does

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
the way but I just told you what it does

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.600 
the way but I just told you what it does
and<00:02:20.120> now<00:02:20.690> what<00:02:20.959> we<00:02:21.110> wanted<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.830> what<00:02:22.520> we

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
and now what we wanted to do what we

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.160 
and now what we wanted to do what we
want<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:22.940> reduce<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:25.300> return<00:02:26.560> G<00:02:27.560> C<00:02:27.880> dot<00:02:29.170> creates

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
want to reduce is return G C dot creates

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.000 
want to reduce is return G C dot creates
compatible<00:02:31.130> image<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:32.260> we<00:02:33.260> want<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.590> create<00:02:33.800> a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
compatible image and we want to create a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.850 
compatible image and we want to create a
compatible<00:02:34.640> image<00:02:35.060> based<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.200> things<00:02:36.470> we

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
compatible image based on the things we

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.860 
compatible image based on the things we
passed<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.270> with<00:02:38.680> tight<00:02:40.209> transparency<00:02:41.209> so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
passed in so with tight transparency so

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.470 
passed in so with tight transparency so
now<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.650> knows<00:02:42.860> your<00:02:43.250> monitors<00:02:43.790> settings

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
now that it knows your monitors settings

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.440 
now that it knows your monitors settings
it<00:02:44.930> can<00:02:44.989> create<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> compatible<00:02:46.370> image<00:02:46.790> based

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
it can create a compatible image based

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.870 
it can create a compatible image based
on<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.840> settings<00:02:48.310> pretty<00:02:49.310> much<00:02:49.459> based<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.820> the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
on the settings pretty much based on the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.090 
on the settings pretty much based on the
settings<00:02:50.300> we<00:02:50.480> passed<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.350> the

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
settings we passed it in and the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.910 
settings we passed it in and the
settings<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.850> got<00:02:53.000> from<00:02:53.060> its<00:02:53.660> monitor<00:02:54.200> so

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
settings that it got from its monitor so

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.160 
settings that it got from its monitor so
that<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.120> pretty<00:02:56.300> much<00:02:56.480> what's<00:02:56.959> going<00:02:57.140> to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
that is pretty much what's going to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.289 
that is pretty much what's going to
happen<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:58.340> course<00:02:58.640> if<00:02:58.850> that<00:02:58.970> doesn't

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
happen but of course if that doesn't

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.920 
happen but of course if that doesn't
happen<00:02:59.860> then<00:03:00.860> let's<00:03:01.190> just<00:03:01.370> return<00:03:01.549> No<00:03:02.239> so

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
happen then let's just return No so

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.840 
happen then let's just return No so
things<00:03:03.200> go<00:03:03.410> bad<00:03:03.590> just<00:03:03.860> return<00:03:04.400> nothing

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
things go bad just return nothing

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.070 
things go bad just return nothing
because<00:03:05.239> if<00:03:05.360> we<00:03:05.450> don't<00:03:05.630> have<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.750> return

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
because if we don't have a return

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.650 
because if we don't have a return
statement<00:03:06.380> then<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.820> program<00:03:08.239> won't<00:03:08.480> work

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
statement then this program won't work

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.070 
statement then this program won't work
so<00:03:08.930> that's<00:03:09.739> pretty<00:03:10.730> much<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.330> only<00:03:11.360> thing

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
so that's pretty much the only thing

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.110 
so that's pretty much the only thing
that<00:03:12.440> we<00:03:12.560> had<00:03:12.709> left<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.070> right<00:03:13.280> for<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.790> screen

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
that we had left to right for the screen

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.570 
that we had left to right for the screen
manager<00:03:14.570> class<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.080> in<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.890> next<00:03:15.950> tutorial

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
manager class and in the next tutorial

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.250 
manager class and in the next tutorial
we're<00:03:16.730> going<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:16.910> be<00:03:17.000> going<00:03:17.209> over<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.989> class

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
we're going to be going over the class

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.110 
we're going to be going over the class
with<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.470> main<00:03:18.739> method<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.549> we're

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
with the main method in it and we're

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.030 
with the main method in it and we're
going<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.269> be<00:03:20.450> running<00:03:20.690> our<00:03:21.049> program<00:03:21.769> no

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
going to be running our program no

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.640 
going to be running our program no
probably<00:03:22.340> not<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.610> next<00:03:22.730> tutorial<00:03:23.150> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
probably not in the next tutorial and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.630 
probably not in the next tutorial and
eventually<00:03:24.650> we're<00:03:24.829> going<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.010> be<00:03:25.070> running<00:03:25.370> our

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
eventually we're going to be running our

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.050 
eventually we're going to be running our
program<00:03:26.030> without<00:03:26.510> flickers<00:03:27.170> or<00:03:27.790> tearing<00:03:28.790> or

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
program without flickers or tearing or

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.060 
program without flickers or tearing or
anything<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:30.049> that<00:03:30.110> it's<00:03:30.440> going<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.709> be<00:03:30.799> one

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
anything like that it's going to be one

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.850 
anything like that it's going to be one
smooth<00:03:31.850> animation<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:33.079> is<00:03:33.350> going<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.739> be

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
smooth animation it is going to be

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.729 
smooth animation it is going to be
amazingly<00:03:34.549> awesome<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:36.170> for<00:03:36.380> now<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.709> just
