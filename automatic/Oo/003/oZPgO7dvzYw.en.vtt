00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you don't have a 5/16 and then you reach

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
you don't have a 5/16 and then you reach
back<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.680> push<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> red<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.549> blue

back there you push the red in the blue

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
back there you push the red in the blue
tab<00:01:24.030> they<00:01:24.299> may<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.750> red<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.080> blue<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.350> your

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
situation but you put the push those

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.480 
situation but you put the push those
tabs<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.689> pull<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> hose<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.409> those<00:01:29.250> will

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
tabs in and pull the hose out those will

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.120 
tabs in and pull the hose out those will
pop<00:01:29.759> out<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.780> say<00:01:30.960> pop<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.920> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
pop out and I say pop right out but it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.399 
pop out and I say pop right out but it
ends<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.490> inevitably<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.290> lot

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
ends up inevitably that those are a lot

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.170 
ends up inevitably that those are a lot
more<00:01:34.560> difficult<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:36.000> they

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
pulling the rings out and when I pull

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.069 
pulling the rings out and when I pull
these<00:03:20.759> sets<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.269> o-rings<00:03:21.629> out<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.049> to

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
these sets of o-rings out I'm going to

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.360 
these sets of o-rings out I'm going to
inspect<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.530> o-rings<00:03:22.829> make<00:03:23.040> sure<00:03:23.220> they're

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
inspect the o-rings make sure they're

not cracked dried etc place those in
order<00:03:26.849> and<00:03:27.290> again<00:03:28.290> I'll<00:03:28.409> do<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:28.799> the

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
order and again I'll do that on the

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.800 
order and again I'll do that on the
small<00:03:29.280> side<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.909> large<00:03:30.120> side<00:03:30.449> is<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:30.780> top

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
small side the large side is the top

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.020 
small side the large side is the top
side<00:03:31.290> which<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.829> inlet<00:03:32.220> side<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.729> small

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
side which is the inlet side the small

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.909 
side which is the inlet side the small
side<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.449> the<00:03:33.599> bottom<00:03:33.989> side<00:03:34.259> which<00:03:34.530> normally

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
side is the bottom side which normally

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.319 
side is the bottom side which normally
this<00:03:35.040> would<00:03:35.189> be<00:03:35.220> placed<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.639> this<00:03:35.849> position

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
this would be placed in this position

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.210 
this would be placed in this position
here<00:03:36.659> so<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.229> top<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.739> large<00:03:37.949> one

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
here so this is the top the large one

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.249 
here so this is the top the large one
this<00:03:38.669> is<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:38.970> small<00:03:39.239> one<00:03:39.269> which<00:03:40.049> is<00:03:40.169> the

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:40.259 
this is the small one which is the

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:41.869 
this is the small one which is the
bottom<00:03:40.500> one<00:03:40.530> then<00:03:41.310> I'm<00:03:41.430> going<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.609> pull<00:03:41.759> this

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
bottom one then I'm going to pull this

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.490 
bottom one then I'm going to pull this
plastic<00:03:42.329> thing<00:03:42.540> out<00:03:42.689> now<00:03:42.720> these<00:03:42.989> nut<00:03:43.290> might

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
plastic thing out now these nut might

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.140 
plastic thing out now these nut might
not<00:03:43.680> come<00:03:43.889> out<00:03:43.979> so<00:03:44.220> easy<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.699> you<00:03:44.790> may<00:03:44.879> have<00:03:45.030> to

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
not come out so easy so you may have to

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.729 
not come out so easy so you may have to
tap<00:03:45.329> it<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:45.659> be<00:03:45.750> careful<00:03:46.109> there's<00:03:46.259> Springs<00:03:46.590> in

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
tap it but be careful there's Springs in

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.920 
tap it but be careful there's Springs in
there<00:03:46.919> that<00:03:47.099> will<00:03:47.159> let<00:03:47.370> loose<00:03:47.659> kind<00:03:48.659> of<00:03:48.720> tech

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
there that will let loose kind of tech

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.749 
there that will let loose kind of tech
tap<00:03:49.349> those<00:03:49.590> on<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.829> counter<00:03:50.159> and<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> rest<00:03:50.609> of

those should come out and what I've got

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.610 
those should come out and what I've got
here<00:03:53.220> are<00:03:53.430> two<00:03:53.669> little<00:03:53.879> plastic<00:03:54.689> retainer

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
here are two little plastic retainer

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.439 
here are two little plastic retainer
rings<00:03:55.979> one<00:03:56.310> has<00:03:56.489> an<00:03:56.609> open<00:03:56.879> side<00:03:57.060> one<00:03:57.269> has<00:03:57.419> a

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
rings one has an open side one has a

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.039 
rings one has an open side one has a
closed<00:03:57.810> side<00:03:58.370> one<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.489> small<00:03:59.790> one<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.180> large<00:04:00.479> of

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
closed side one is small one is large of

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.209 
closed side one is small one is large of
course<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.439> larger<00:04:01.680> one<00:04:01.799> goes<00:04:01.919> in<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.099> large

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:02.219 
course the larger one goes in the large

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.649 
course the larger one goes in the large
side<00:04:02.459> small<00:04:02.729> and<00:04:02.909> goes<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.180> small<00:04:03.419> side

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
side small and goes on the small side

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.499 
side small and goes on the small side
and<00:04:03.930> then<00:04:04.829> there's<00:04:05.009> two<00:04:05.219> Springs<00:04:05.639> same<00:04:06.239> thing

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:06.509 
and then there's two Springs same thing

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:07.879 
and then there's two Springs same thing
those<00:04:06.689> are<00:04:06.810> actually<00:04:07.049> identical<00:04:07.409> so<00:04:07.650> they<00:04:07.769> can

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
those are actually identical so they can

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.589 
those are actually identical so they can
go<00:04:08.009> whatever<00:04:08.280> then<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.209> have<00:04:09.389> these<00:04:09.539> two

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
go whatever then you have these two

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.170 
go whatever then you have these two
little<00:04:09.900> nipple<00:04:10.319> valve<00:04:10.590> things<00:04:11.219> here<00:04:11.879> one<00:04:12.150> a

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
little nipple valve things here one a

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.909 
little nipple valve things here one a
small<00:04:12.359> one<00:04:12.719> is<00:04:12.840> large<00:04:13.079> make<00:04:13.379> sure<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.650> inspect

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
small one is large make sure you inspect

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.409 
small one is large make sure you inspect
the<00:04:14.189> o-rings<00:04:14.609> make<00:04:14.819> sure<00:04:14.939> they're<00:04:15.060> not<00:04:15.150> dried

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
the o-rings make sure they're not dried

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.379 
the o-rings make sure they're not dried
correct<00:04:15.750> etc<00:04:16.519> rinse<00:04:17.519> those<00:04:17.729> all<00:04:17.940> out<00:04:17.969> because

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
correct etc rinse those all out because

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.089 
correct etc rinse those all out because
most<00:04:18.750> likely<00:04:19.109> they're<00:04:19.320> full<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:21.529> calcium<00:04:22.529> or

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
most likely they're full of calcium or

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.709 
most likely they're full of calcium or
rust<00:04:23.340> or<00:04:23.580> whatever<00:04:23.849> is<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.090> your<00:04:24.210> system<00:04:24.389> and

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
rust or whatever is in your system and

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.450 
rust or whatever is in your system and
then<00:04:25.050> put<00:04:25.199> it<00:04:25.260> back<00:04:25.289> together<00:04:25.529> this<00:04:25.979> is<00:04:26.159> just<00:04:26.370> a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
then put it back together this is just a

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.050 
then put it back together this is just a
simple

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
simple

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.970 
simple
as<00:04:27.120> when<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:27.570> took<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.810> apart<00:04:28.050> put<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.800> large

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
as when you took it apart put the large

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.730 
as when you took it apart put the large
one<00:04:29.160> in<00:04:29.310> put<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.330> small<00:04:30.570> one<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:30.930> put<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
one in put the small one in put the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.270 
one in put the small one in put the
springs<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:33.139> put<00:04:34.139> your<00:04:34.350> little<00:04:34.620> doodads<00:04:35.040> in

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
springs and put your little doodads in

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.930 
springs and put your little doodads in
make<00:04:35.490> sure<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.760> open<00:04:36.270> large<00:04:36.600> side<00:04:36.930> is<00:04:37.139> up<00:04:37.940> okay

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
make sure the open large side is up okay

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.730 
make sure the open large side is up okay
because<00:04:39.090> that's<00:04:39.330> what's<00:04:39.570> going<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.990> go<00:04:40.169> in<00:04:40.410> the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
because that's what's going to go in the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.390 
because that's what's going to go in the
pipe<00:04:40.950> itself<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:42.139> then<00:04:43.139> put<00:04:43.380> your<00:04:43.530> rings<00:04:44.070> in

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
pipe itself and then put your rings in

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.010 
pipe itself and then put your rings in
and<00:04:44.550> make<00:04:44.730> sure<00:04:44.760> they're<00:04:45.210> seated<00:04:45.660> properly

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
and make sure they're seated properly

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.050 
and make sure they're seated properly
probably<00:04:46.770> want<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:46.950> do<00:04:47.100> those<00:04:47.280> one<00:04:47.550> at<00:04:47.669> a<00:04:47.760> time
