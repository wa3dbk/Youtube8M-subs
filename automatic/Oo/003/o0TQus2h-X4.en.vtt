00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.730
 let's perform in this case a line 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.850
 and collected adapted 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.790
 the cut of the collected is going to be the line 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.940
 pretty romantic but a little bit more 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.550
 elaborated we have seen some more works 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.180
 informal this is also going to be but 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.220
 we are going to inscribe a bit of face 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.950
 for this we will raise all the hair well 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.420
 upwards 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.140
 then what had to happen 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.240
 neither 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.240
 we'll leave it too much link 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.610
 as natural as possible 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.719
 once we have all the hair 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.719
 up as high as possible 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.280
 we hold 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.370
 i 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.420
 an elastic that is quite tense 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.750
 and then we can loosen up there a little bit 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.750
 if you have the most natural style 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.940
 once we have the queue in the area 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 top we throw it a little bit 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.430
 below and we will place a base that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.430
 serve us a little filling 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.720
 the base that you can find 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.170
 in many stores and that is very easy to 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.170
 get 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.830
 I prepare the wick that we have removed from 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.830
 the bottom layer of the ponytail and this we 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.730
 will serve a little to cover all the 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.730
 ping area 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.439
 by the top of the athlete 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.439
 what we are going to do is a braid 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.930
 two expensive 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.310
 Y 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.900
 and when we get more or less half 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.900
 we release it and we open the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.670
 also the entire area of the tip the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.670
 true 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.370
 two 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.440
 two 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.640
 yes 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:53.930
 and to finish we're going to pick up a 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.930
 little all the front area 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.990
 ah 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.430
 the front area you can do very 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.530
 tight if you see that favors or give 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.860
 a little bit of volume leave a little 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.020
 loose 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.640
 so that the line within us 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.410
 be a little more combed yes less than 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.410
 a little bit of informality 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.420
 and the tips 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.160
 we are placing I will deliver there is no 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.160
 also naturally 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.240
 releasing light hairs from the area 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.530
 front so that the effect always 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.530
 I make you as more natural 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.739
 ah 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.550
 well, once you have left 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.590
 the loose hair to the front with 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.200
 that touch of informality because 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.690
 we would have the work ready is that it gives you 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.100
 a very informal air with an air more 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.100
 formal in all that is the part 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.810
 our hairstyle ready for these tracks 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.030
 that you can wear your hair 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.550
 let's give it the festive touch we're going to 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.430
 put an ornament in this case a headband 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.410
 of princess but very current very modern 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.480
 which will not develop a little more 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.920
 the volume and will highlight the volume that 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.460
 we wanted to do for the area 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.460
 later
