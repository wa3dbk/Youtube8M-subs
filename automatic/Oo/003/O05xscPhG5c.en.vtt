we're not going to be able to make this
one<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.650> didn't<00:04:38.890> come<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.220> complete<00:04:39.280> stop

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.030 
one we didn't come to a complete stop
and<00:04:40.510> now<00:04:40.600> we're<00:04:40.750> gonna<00:04:40.840> roll<00:04:41.110> as<00:04:41.350> gently<00:04:41.740> as<00:04:41.860> we

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
and now we're gonna roll as gently as we

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.280 
and now we're gonna roll as gently as we
can<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.640> even<00:04:43.480> though<00:04:43.600> we're<00:04:43.810> rolling<00:04:44.170> away

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
can and even though we're rolling away

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.970 
can and even though we're rolling away
gently<00:04:44.710> we're<00:04:44.920> still<00:04:45.220> in<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.430> red

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
gently we're still in the red

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.920 
gently we're still in the red
we're<00:04:47.980> accelerating<00:04:48.580> very<00:04:48.910> slowly<00:04:49.360> we're

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
we're accelerating very slowly we're

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.180 
we're accelerating very slowly we're
rolling<00:04:50.350> down<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.530> hill<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.860> bit

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.059 

and<00:04:54.580> we're<00:04:54.730> in<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.910> orange

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.469 

now<00:05:12.070> we're<00:05:12.310> just<00:05:12.460> gonna<00:05:12.550> use<00:05:12.789> inertia<00:05:13.090> for<00:05:13.389> as

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
now we're just gonna use inertia for as

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.680 
now we're just gonna use inertia for as
long<00:05:13.630> as<00:05:13.690> we<00:05:13.870> can<00:05:14.850> hold<00:05:15.850> our<00:05:16.090> speed<00:05:16.389> at<00:05:16.600> the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
long as we can hold our speed at the

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.020 
long as we can hold our speed at the
speed<00:05:16.930> limit<00:05:16.960> 45<00:05:17.470> miles<00:05:17.889> an<00:05:18.070> hour

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.300 

and<00:05:21.570> just<00:05:21.780> roll<00:05:22.110> on<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.410> little<00:05:22.950> bit<00:05:23.190> of

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
and just roll on a little bit of

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.460 
and just roll on a little bit of
throttle<00:05:23.550> as<00:05:23.850> we<00:05:24.000> start<00:05:24.390> to<00:05:24.510> climb<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.020> next

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
throttle as we start to climb the next

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.250 
throttle as we start to climb the next
incline

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.370 

so<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:30.830> see<00:05:31.070> I'm<00:05:31.430> being<00:05:32.090> really<00:05:32.900> light<00:05:33.110> on<00:05:33.140> the

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
so you see I'm being really light on the

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:40.150 
so you see I'm being really light on the
throttle<00:05:33.860> of<00:05:34.070> just<00:05:34.430> touching<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.000> orange<00:05:39.160> if

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
throttle of just touching the orange if

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.220 
throttle of just touching the orange if
I<00:05:40.310> let<00:05:40.520> off<00:05:40.700> a<00:05:40.730> little<00:05:40.850> bit<00:05:41.150> more<00:05:41.360> I<00:05:41.630> won't<00:05:42.140> be

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
I let off a little bit more I won't be

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.330 
I let off a little bit more I won't be
able<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.470> hold<00:05:42.590> my<00:05:42.770> speed

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.160 

speed<00:05:48.970> them<00:05:49.120> it's<00:05:49.240> 50<00:05:49.600> now<00:05:49.750> so<00:05:49.960> I'm<00:05:50.050> gonna

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
speed them it's 50 now so I'm gonna

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.920 
speed them it's 50 now so I'm gonna
climb<00:05:50.500> just<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:50.860> little<00:05:51.100> bit

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
climb just a little bit

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.459 
climb just a little bit
and<00:05:53.169> we're<00:05:53.470> at<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.680> crest<00:05:53.949> of<00:05:54.070> a<00:05:54.160> hill

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
and we're at the crest of a hill

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.929 
and we're at the crest of a hill
so<00:05:55.949> now<00:05:56.069> I'm<00:05:56.159> gonna<00:05:56.279> lift

00:05:59.929 --> 00:05:59.939 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.129 

take<00:06:00.939> a<00:06:00.969> look<00:06:01.209> at<00:06:01.269> where<00:06:01.389> that<00:06:01.479> eco<00:06:01.719> wiener<00:06:01.929> is

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
take a look at where that eco wiener is

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.540 
take a look at where that eco wiener is
right<00:06:02.319> now<00:06:02.999> -<00:06:03.999> little<00:06:04.330> green<00:06:04.449> bars<00:06:05.339> 74<00:06:06.339> miles
