okay<00:00:01.890> so<00:00:01.949> do<00:00:02.490> you<00:00:02.520> lost<00:00:02.790> layer<00:00:04.910> for<00:00:05.910> the

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
okay so do you lost layer for the

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.530 
okay so do you lost layer for the
megaminx<00:00:06.420> unlike<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.470> 3x3<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.160> 303<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:09.420> many

weird weird advanced methods that you

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.240 
weird weird advanced methods that you
know<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.320> last<00:00:31.470> layer<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.099> you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
know do your last layer for you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.030 
know do your last layer for you
basically<00:00:32.600> on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.870> megaminx<00:00:34.230> really<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
basically on the megaminx really we

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
basically on the megaminx really we
don't<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.309> any<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.420> stuck<00:00:36.809> with

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
don't have any of that we are stuck with

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.150 
don't have any of that we are stuck with
a<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.350> look<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:38.090> for<00:00:39.090> look<00:00:39.300> appeal<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:40.160> don't

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
a for look a for look appeal I don't

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520 
a for look a for look appeal I don't
know<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.670> anyone<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.450> knows<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.260> more

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
know that anyone really knows a more

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.510 
know that anyone really knows a more
advanced<00:00:43.770> PLL<00:00:44.280> than<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.899> I've<00:00:45.899> noticed<00:00:46.110> that

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
advanced PLL than that I've noticed that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.340 
advanced PLL than that I've noticed that
on<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> unofficial<00:00:48.270> world<00:00:48.570> records<00:00:48.930> page<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
on the unofficial world records page a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.260 
on the unofficial world records page a
lot<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.399> higher-ups<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.120> just

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
lot of the really higher-ups and just

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.529 
lot of the really higher-ups and just
say<00:00:51.390> yeah<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.260> look<00:00:52.440> who<00:00:52.530> willow<00:00:53.539> so

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
say yeah I use it for look who willow so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150 
say yeah I use it for look who willow so
I'll<00:00:54.809> explain<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.469> look<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> little<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
I'll explain this for look a little to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
I'll explain this for look a little to
you<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:57.270> good<00:00:57.420> thing<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.840> don't<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you the good thing is you don't have to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.110 
you the good thing is you don't have to
learn<00:00:58.230> any<00:00:58.440> algorithms<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.309> was

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
learn any algorithms for this I was

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.869 
learn any algorithms for this I was
toying<00:01:00.719> around<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> couple<00:01:01.350> methods<00:01:01.879> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
toying around with a couple methods that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
toying around with a couple methods that
I<00:01:02.910> found<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> internet<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.170> found

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
I found on the internet and I found

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.649 
I found on the internet and I found
between<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.189> few<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.880> found<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.330> way<00:01:06.510> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
between a few of them I found a way of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.490 
between a few of them I found a way of
doing<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.530> no<00:01:07.560> algorithms<00:01:08.220> whatsoever

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
doing it with no algorithms whatsoever

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.480 
doing it with no algorithms whatsoever
well<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> only<00:01:10.740> algorithms<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
well the only algorithms you have to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.660 
well the only algorithms you have to
know<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.880> suing<00:01:12.840> an<00:01:12.960> auntie<00:01:13.229> soon<00:01:13.380> really<00:01:13.799> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
know are suing an auntie soon really so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820 
know are suing an auntie soon really so
the<00:01:15.450> first<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> edges

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the first I'm going to do is the edges

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
the first I'm going to do is the edges
we're<00:01:17.009> gonna<00:01:17.100> orient<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.759> edges<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.240> then

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
we're gonna orient the edges and then

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.030 
we're gonna orient the edges and then
permute<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> edges<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.770> we're<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:19.979> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
permute the edges then we're going to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.410 
permute the edges then we're going to
orient<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> corners<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.880> permeate<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
orient the corners and permeate the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.340 
orient the corners and permeate the
corners<00:01:22.790> orienting<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> edges<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.140> same

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
corners orienting the edges is the same

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.070 
corners orienting the edges is the same
as<00:01:25.470> orienting<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> edges<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> three-three

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
as orienting the edges on a three-three

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
as orienting the edges on a three-three
see<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.170> these<00:01:28.290> two<00:01:28.470> are<00:01:28.500> unoriented<00:01:28.979> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
see that these two are unoriented this

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.510 
see that these two are unoriented this
is<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> same<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.630> L<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.979> 3x3

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
is the same as the L on the 3x3

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.510 
is the same as the L on the 3x3
so<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.390> F<00:01:34.400> oops

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
so the F oops

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.899 
so the F oops
you<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.869> prime<00:01:37.140> F<00:01:37.470> prime<00:01:37.710> F<00:01:37.979> Prime<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.790> get

you are you prime F prime F Prime to get

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
you are you prime F prime F Prime to get
the<00:01:39.000> star<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:44.009> little<00:01:44.340> Arrowhead<00:01:45.170> when

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the star this some little Arrowhead when

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.830 
the star this some little Arrowhead when
it's<00:01:46.320> pointing<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> right

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
it's pointing to the right

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.260 
it's pointing to the right
it's<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> same<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.740> bar<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.180> gonna

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it's the same as the bar so it's gonna

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.830 
it's the same as the bar so it's gonna
be<00:01:51.390> f<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:52.710> are<00:01:53.009> prime<00:01:53.369> D<00:01:53.880> prime<00:01:55.549> F<00:01:56.549> prime<00:01:56.880> to

be f you are prime D prime F prime to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.560 
be f you are prime D prime F prime to
get<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> star<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:59.189> orienting<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> edges<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
get the star so orienting the edges is

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.170 
get the star so orienting the edges is
very<00:02:00.780> easy<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.409> nothing<00:02:01.740> new<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:03.060> know

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
very easy it's nothing new and you know

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.469 
very easy it's nothing new and you know
she<00:02:03.450> had<00:02:03.570> no<00:02:03.600> problem<00:02:04.079> with<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.229> whatsoever

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
she had no problem with it whatsoever

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.190 
she had no problem with it whatsoever
permeating<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> edges<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.110> bit

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
permeating the edges is a little bit

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
permeating the edges is a little bit
different<00:02:07.759> we're<00:02:08.759> still<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.119> use<00:02:09.179> edge

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
different we're still going to use edge

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.449 
different we're still going to use edge
switchers<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> cycle<00:02:10.319> through<00:02:10.500> pieces<00:02:10.860> so

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
switchers that cycle through pieces so

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.890 
switchers that cycle through pieces so
what<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.610> want<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.239> two<00:02:12.480> adjacent

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
what we want to do is get two adjacent

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.760 
what we want to do is get two adjacent
pieces

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
pieces

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
pieces
match<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.150> two<00:02:15.300> adjacent<00:02:15.510> pieces<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
match so we have two adjacent pieces and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.780 
match so we have two adjacent pieces and
we<00:02:16.200> cycle<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> other<00:02:16.830> three<00:02:17.130> fully<00:02:17.640> other

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
we cycle on the other three fully other

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.520 
we cycle on the other three fully other
pie<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.150> need<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.080> what<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:19.260> doing<00:02:19.440> right

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
pie that we need so what I'm doing right

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.410 
pie that we need so what I'm doing right
now<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.710> just<00:02:19.880> rotating<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.970> top<00:02:21.180> layer

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
now is just rotating the top layer

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.910 
now is just rotating the top layer
around<00:02:21.570> seeing<00:02:21.990> if<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.290> get<00:02:22.380> two<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.800> are

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
around seeing if I can get two that are

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.970 
around seeing if I can get two that are
adjacent<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.490> match<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.870> can't<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.740> all<00:02:25.860> is

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
adjacent and match and I can't so all is

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.020 
adjacent and match and I can't so all is
settled<00:02:26.160> with<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.860> I'll<00:02:28.860> cycle<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.700> red

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
settled with one and I'll cycle this red

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.830 
settled with one and I'll cycle this red
piece<00:02:30.240> into<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.430> edge<00:02:33.150> cycles

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
piece into here so the edge cycles

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.170 
piece into here so the edge cycles
affect<00:02:34.410> these<00:02:34.590> three<00:02:34.800> pieces<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.370> two<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
affect these three pieces the two in the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.090 
affect these three pieces the two in the
back<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.690> two<00:02:36.840> edges<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.230> back<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
back the two edges in the back and the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.730 
back the two edges in the back and the
one<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.550> right<00:02:38.760> these<00:02:39.510> three<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.710> can

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
one on the right these three and I can

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.990 
one on the right these three and I can
tell<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.610> red<00:02:41.790> one<00:02:41.970> over

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
tell that to get this a red one over

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.540 
tell that to get this a red one over
here<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> need<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.750> clockwise<00:02:43.320> edge<00:02:44.040> cycle

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
here I need the clockwise edge cycle

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.510 
here I need the clockwise edge cycle
which<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.860> R<00:02:46.910> u2<00:02:47.910> R<00:02:48.300> prime<00:02:48.810> u<00:02:49.230> prime<00:02:49.260> our<00:02:49.860> new

which is R u2 R prime u prime our new

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.690 
which is R u2 R prime u prime our new
prime<00:02:50.820> R<00:02:51.150> prime<00:02:51.210> which<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:53.190> might<00:02:53.280> notice<00:02:53.580> is

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
prime R prime which you might notice is

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.200 
prime R prime which you might notice is
the<00:02:53.970> antiserum<00:02:55.250> exactly<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.490> anti<00:02:56.760> soon<00:02:56.940> and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
the antiserum exactly the anti soon and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.730 
the antiserum exactly the anti soon and
you<00:02:58.140> know<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.410> don't<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.680> learn

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
you know you don't have to learn

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.180 
you know you don't have to learn
anything<00:02:58.980> new

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
anything new

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.280 
anything new
hopefully<00:02:59.670> for<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:00.990> got<00:03:01.080> these<00:03:01.170> two

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
hopefully for that so we got these two

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.260 
hopefully for that so we got these two
adjacent<00:03:01.500> ones<00:03:01.830> we're<00:03:02.430> gonna<00:03:02.550> rotate<00:03:02.820> us<00:03:03.120> that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
adjacent ones we're gonna rotate us that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.970 
adjacent ones we're gonna rotate us that
they're<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.720> safe<00:03:04.230> zones<00:03:04.560> or<00:03:04.740> whatever

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
they're in the safe zones or whatever

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.050 
they're in the safe zones or whatever
you<00:03:05.040> want<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> call<00:03:05.340> them<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.640> then<00:03:05.970> we're

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
you want to call them and then we're

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.270 
you want to call them and then we're
going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.240> cycle<00:03:06.390> around<00:03:06.510> these<00:03:06.750> other<00:03:06.900> three

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
going to cycle around these other three

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.070 
going to cycle around these other three
so<00:03:08.280> agree<00:03:08.580> needs<00:03:08.670> go<00:03:08.880> up<00:03:08.970> here<00:03:09.210> this<00:03:09.900> needs

and<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> pretty<00:03:46.380> sure<00:03:46.530> no<00:03:46.650> one<00:03:46.709> else<00:03:46.950> wants<00:03:47.220> to

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
and a pretty sure no one else wants to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.250 
and a pretty sure no one else wants to
learn<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.459> bunch<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.790> algorithms<00:03:48.240> just<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.170> they

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
learn a bunch of algorithms just so they

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.680 
learn a bunch of algorithms just so they
can<00:03:49.350> solve<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.650> megaminx<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.450> mean<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.570> got

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
can solve a megaminx I mean you got

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.790 
can solve a megaminx I mean you got
enough<00:03:51.900> stuff<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.200> want<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.440> learn<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.770> want

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
enough stuff you want to learn you want

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.990 
enough stuff you want to learn you want
to<00:03:52.950> learn<00:03:53.010> all<00:03:53.220> your<00:03:53.310> all<00:03:53.459> those<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.790> want<00:03:53.940> to

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
to learn all your all those you want to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.130 
to learn all your all those you want to
learn<00:03:54.090> what<00:03:54.120> appeals<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.870> three<00:03:55.020> by

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
learn what appeals for the three by

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.620 
learn what appeals for the three by
three<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.830> I'm<00:03:56.550> just<00:03:56.880> gonna<00:03:57.030> try<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.270> teach<00:03:57.480> us

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
three and I'm just gonna try to teach us

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.960 
three and I'm just gonna try to teach us
with<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:57.900> commentators<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:59.400> commentators

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
with just commentators so commentators

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.970 
with just commentators so commentators
are<00:04:00.120> very<00:04:00.270> short<00:04:00.540> algorithms<00:04:00.990> that<00:04:01.290> in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
are very short algorithms that in

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.410 
are very short algorithms that in
certain<00:04:02.310> situations<00:04:02.580> can<00:04:03.060> be<00:04:03.150> very<00:04:03.360> useful

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
certain situations can be very useful

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.140 
certain situations can be very useful
and<00:04:03.870> for<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.500> megaminx<00:04:04.800> they<00:04:04.950> work<00:04:05.130> great<00:04:05.370> and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
and for the megaminx they work great and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.610 
and for the megaminx they work great and
these<00:04:06.600> men<00:04:06.780> these<00:04:06.930> commentators<00:04:07.380> can

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
these men these commentators can

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.870 
these men these commentators can
actually<00:04:07.830> be<00:04:07.890> applied<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> three<00:04:08.550> three

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
actually be applied to the three three

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.330 
actually be applied to the three three
although<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.870> actually<00:04:10.230> way<00:04:10.830> too<00:04:10.860> slow<00:04:11.220> and

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
although it is actually way too slow and

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.300 
although it is actually way too slow and
actually<00:04:11.670> want<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:11.880> use<00:04:11.940> them<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:13.220> for<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
actually want to use them so for the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.410 
actually want to use them so for the
corners<00:04:14.580> we're<00:04:14.670> gonna<00:04:14.790> orient<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.120> corners

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
corners we're gonna orient the corners

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.570 
corners we're gonna orient the corners
first<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:19.580> commutator

first and this is a this is a commutator
from<00:04:20.970> blindfold<00:04:21.570> solving<00:04:22.020> which<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.680> going<00:04:22.860> to

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
from blindfold solving which is going to

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.250 
from blindfold solving which is going to
just<00:04:23.190> twist<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.790> piece<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:24.570> whatever

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
just twist the piece on whatever

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.770 
just twist the piece on whatever
direction<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.710> want<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.790> I<00:04:26.880> see<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.419> piece

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
I like this nice little last thing we

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.830 
I like this nice little last thing we
got<00:05:23.700> here<00:05:25.610> so<00:05:26.610> now<00:05:26.760> for<00:05:26.850> permian<00:05:27.330> corns<00:05:27.690> we're

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
got here so now for permian corns we're

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.740 
got here so now for permian corns we're
also<00:05:27.960> gonna<00:05:28.110> use<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.370> commutator<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:30.570> very

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
also gonna use a commutator the very

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.440 
also gonna use a commutator the very
useful<00:05:30.930> commutator<00:05:31.530> by<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.800> way<00:05:32.450> basically

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
useful commutator by the way basically

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.780 
useful commutator by the way basically
all<00:05:33.810> we're<00:05:34.080> gonna<00:05:34.169> do<00:05:34.350> is<00:05:34.470> is<00:05:34.740> just<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.340> look<00:05:35.669> at

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
all we're gonna do is is just a look at

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.000 
all we're gonna do is is just a look at
the<00:05:35.910> piece<00:05:36.060> that's<00:05:36.210> in<00:05:36.390> this<00:05:36.479> spot<00:05:36.750> and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
the piece that's in this spot and

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.909 
the piece that's in this spot and
rememorize<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:38.220> it's<00:05:38.340> purple<00:05:38.729> and<00:05:38.820> pink<00:05:39.919> and

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
rememorize that it's purple and pink and

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.830 
rememorize that it's purple and pink and

with the last layer on and megaminx is a

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.520 
with the last layer on and megaminx is a
little<00:06:44.340> bit<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:44.550> get<00:06:44.640> your<00:06:44.760> head<00:06:44.940> around<00:06:45.530> at

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
little bit to get your head around at

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.130 
little bit to get your head around at
first<00:06:46.950> but<00:06:47.580> the<00:06:47.730> use<00:06:47.850> of<00:06:47.970> commentators<00:06:48.360> is<00:06:48.780> you

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
first but the use of commentators is you

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.600 
first but the use of commentators is you
know<00:06:49.230> actually<00:06:49.680> a<00:06:49.710> pretty<00:06:49.890> easy<00:06:50.070> thing<00:06:50.190> and

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
know actually a pretty easy thing and

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.300 
know actually a pretty easy thing and
it's<00:06:50.880> very<00:06:50.940> useful<00:06:51.620> if<00:06:52.620> you<00:06:52.680> know<00:06:52.980> how<00:06:53.070> to<00:06:53.160> use

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
it's very useful if you know how to use

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.490 
it's very useful if you know how to use
commentators<00:06:53.850> to<00:06:54.180> your<00:06:54.300> advantage<00:06:54.540> and<00:06:54.870> it'll

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
commentators to your advantage and it'll

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.060 
commentators to your advantage and it'll
help<00:06:55.770> you<00:06:55.890> in<00:06:56.010> blind<00:06:56.280> solves<00:06:56.610> as<00:06:56.700> well

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.010 

so<00:07:02.070> that<00:07:02.280> is<00:07:02.400> how<00:07:02.490> to<00:07:02.550> solve<00:07:02.790> a<00:07:02.820> megaminx<00:07:03.330> quite

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
so that is how to solve a megaminx quite

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.230 
so that is how to solve a megaminx quite
a<00:07:04.050> bit<00:07:04.320> easier<00:07:04.470> than<00:07:04.830> you<00:07:05.040> thought<00:07:05.430> I<00:07:05.820> expect

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
a bit easier than you thought I expect

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.670 
a bit easier than you thought I expect
and<00:07:06.710> you<00:07:07.710> know<00:07:08.550> hopefully<00:07:09.390> this<00:07:10.320> will<00:07:10.500> have

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
and you know hopefully this will have

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.870 
and you know hopefully this will have
helped<00:07:10.920> you<00:07:11.010> out<00:07:11.040> and<00:07:11.340> you<00:07:11.460> can<00:07:11.580> now<00:07:11.640> solve

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
helped you out and you can now solve

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.360 
helped you out and you can now solve
megaminx
