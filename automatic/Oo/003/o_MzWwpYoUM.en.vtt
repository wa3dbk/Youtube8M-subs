people not have to suffer like i have

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.920 
people not have to suffer like i have
and<00:02:38.340> my<00:02:38.430> family<00:02:38.760> has<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.239> think<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:39.720> where

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and my family has I think that's where

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.819 
and my family has I think that's where
I've<00:02:40.019> really<00:02:40.230> learned<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.470> value<00:02:40.620> of

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
I've really learned the value of

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.650 
I've really learned the value of
experiencing<00:02:41.609> so<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.910> learned<00:02:42.209> at<00:02:42.329> first<00:02:42.510> in

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
experiencing so I learned at first in

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.000 
experiencing so I learned at first in
martial<00:02:42.930> arts<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.230> was<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> student<00:02:43.650> before<00:02:43.859> I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
martial arts I was a student before I

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.949 
martial arts I was a student before I
was<00:02:44.160> an<00:02:44.220> instructor<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.540> was<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> patient

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
was an instructor and I was a patient

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.080 
was an instructor and I was a patient
before<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.470> was<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> doctor<00:02:46.829> in<00:02:47.190> medicine<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.030> I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
before I was a doctor in medicine so I

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.460 
before I was a doctor in medicine so I
think<00:02:48.150> that's<00:02:48.359> probably

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
think that's probably

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.560 
think that's probably
a<00:02:49.530> good<00:02:50.220> way<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.550> those<00:02:50.640> really<00:02:50.940> track<00:02:51.330> is

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
a good way that those really track is

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.360 
a good way that those really track is
because<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.140> if<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.350> if<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.770> come<00:02:53.160> from

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
because I think if you if you come from

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.680 
because I think if you if you come from
the<00:02:53.490> perspective<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.270> people<00:02:54.570> you're

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
the perspective of the people you're

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.900 
the perspective of the people you're
working<00:02:54.840> with<00:02:55.020> whatever<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:55.980> life<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
working with whatever that is in life it

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.820 
working with whatever that is in life it
ends<00:02:57.270> up<00:02:57.390> being<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.900> better<00:02:58.080> experience<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
ends up being a better experience and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.180 
ends up being a better experience and
you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.130> kind<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.400> get<00:02:59.640> more<00:02:59.880> done<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:01.190> don't

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
you can kind of get more done I don't

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.430 
you can kind of get more done I don't
like<00:03:02.760> like<00:03:03.330> actually<00:03:03.840> hurting<00:03:04.020> people

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
like like actually hurting people

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.730 
like like actually hurting people
seriously<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.270> also<00:03:06.570> want<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.290> help<00:03:07.530> them

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
and so in both careers that's what it's

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.840 
and so in both careers that's what it's
about<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.710> when<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:10.980> when<00:03:11.220> I'm<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:11.400> martial<00:03:11.760> arts

I will hit someone hard if they're

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.960 
I will hit someone hard if they're
training<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> fight<00:03:14.310> because<00:03:14.520> that's<00:03:14.820> what

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
training for a fight because that's what

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.160 
training for a fight because that's what
they<00:03:15.060> need<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.210> be<00:03:15.390> better<00:03:15.600> but<00:03:15.840> similarly

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
they need to be better but similarly

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.150 
they need to be better but similarly
with<00:03:16.260> patients<00:03:16.740> it's<00:03:16.860> really<00:03:17.070> about
