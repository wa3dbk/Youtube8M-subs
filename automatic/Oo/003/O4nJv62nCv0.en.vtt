00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello welcome and welcome to andrés 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:11.010
 just tv and tv one I know there are times 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.590
 you say soy yogurts are more expensive 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.619
 yogurts non soy not 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.930
 it is always true, many thanks are 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.960
 just as expensive many brands of yoghurts 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.820
 of cow's milk are more expensive and depends 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.410
 much of where you buy you can find 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.349
 cheaper or more expensive things and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 depending a lot on the brands too 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 so sometimes you do not live near a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.090
 site where you can find yogurts from 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 cheap soybeans and sometimes it's just you 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.329
 a mess go there or you get more 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 cheap to do it this way 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.260
 we have here some yogurts cost us 4 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.850
 by 119 recently they were at one euro the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.399
 four sure natural soy and here 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.399
 We have a soy milk that cost us 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.080
 85 cents so well then 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.580
 evidently 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.880
 this is more expensive 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.780
 because they are 400 grams 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.020
 but I want to have a milk price of 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.940
 soybeans and if you get this way capricious or 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.530
 that's logical because it's because I'm going to 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.190
 spend more money when you can spend 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.480
 less or soy yogurt what I'm going to 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.390
 do now because it's in a time of 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.210
 my life you know, I will tell you what 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.440
 I'm eating a lot then I do not want 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.350
 give everything to show you what it is 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.380
 very easy to understand in you get a 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.150
 spoonful of soy yogurt and you throw it in 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.560
 a boat for example here or if you go to 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.710
 do a lot this is a boat for example 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.510
 here and then you take soy milk but at 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.580
 lorito soy milk that has nothing 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.880
 plus 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.250
 that water and soybeans can have a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 little salt but you do not have calcium 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.870
 added that he has vitamin d that he does not 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.530
 have sweeteners of any kind that 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.690
 be 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.410
 apple juice whatever, because if not 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.720
 the yogurt remains as well as vacuum and what 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.080
 we do then we make a yogurt of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.080
 soy 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.960
 we take a spoonful of soy yogurt 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.460
 unsweetened 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.280
 natural 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.550
 and we throw it in a small boat or in a 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.490
 big boat if we want more or less a 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.170
 cup if we want style and stir with 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.870
 the soy milk that we want to take 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.390
 with soy milk and stir and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.550
 we cover 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:45.290
 and we leave it there for example and it depends 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.600
 of the temperature of your house 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.440
 it will take more or less to be done but in 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.030
 summer equal in about 18 17 18 19 hours 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.950
 It's done 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.080
 in winter equal 20 24 hours 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.580
 Y 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:08.150
 and the next day you go there and you open it 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.390
 and you say but if I have soy yogurt 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.750
 Soymilk price and without making 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.390
 nothing more and with a good texture if 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.870
 you want an excellent texture and you have 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.870
 a 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.099
 a fridge that always jumps a little 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.730
 of warmth if you put it on the back 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.769
 over 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.519
 and all the warmth that is almost not noticeable 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:37.360
 the density and consistency of yogurt is 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.690
 even more appetizing and the best of 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.400
 everything maybe is that this is endless 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.640
 the day you drink that yogurt do not be 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.310
 glutton and resistant ai said good I'll 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.500
 save a spoonful for tomorrow and as 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.940
 is that spoonful and you throw it again 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.910
 how to expect the same 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.890
 and it comes out the next day again 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.160

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.660

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.340
 things to keep in mind if you leave a lot 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.770
 the yogurt there is 7 acid feels to city 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.890
 do not use that again for next 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.200
 milks following yogurts because it's going to 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.660
 get a bit acidic and you can take it 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.060
 with strawberries you can have it with jam 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.840
 you can take it with sugar you can take it 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.640
