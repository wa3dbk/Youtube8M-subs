know he is a good player on the pitch he

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.450 
know he is a good player on the pitch he
does<00:01:30.479> he<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.079> winger<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.979> he's<00:01:32.220> very

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
does he is a winger but he's very

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.789 
does he is a winger but he's very
versatile<00:01:33.119> he<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.570> played<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.140> swing<00:01:34.470> he

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
versatile he can played in a swing he

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.130 
versatile he can played in a swing he
can<00:01:34.950> play<00:01:35.130> strike<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.759> he's<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.030> place<00:01:36.210> under<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
can play strike or he's in place under I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.620 
can play strike or he's in place under I
think<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.799> centre<00:01:38.159> forward<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.790> cam<00:01:39.060> also

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
think it's centre forward and cam also

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.679 
think it's centre forward and cam also
and<00:01:39.869> maybe<00:01:40.619> Center<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.520> think<00:01:41.970> that's<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.659> only

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and maybe Center I think that's the only

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
and maybe Center I think that's the only

the cops were in the Australian leg I
don't<00:03:26.019> think<00:03:26.290> there's<00:03:26.500> any<00:03:26.739> like<00:03:27.310> local<00:03:27.729> cops

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
don't think there's any like local cops

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.270 
don't think there's any like local cops
so<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.299> think<00:03:28.569> it's<00:03:28.689> just<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.019> league<00:03:29.229> and<00:03:29.739> well

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
so I think it's just the league and well

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.119 
so I think it's just the league and well
on<00:03:30.459> FIFA<00:03:30.909> anyway<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.739> that's<00:03:32.739> how<00:03:32.889> I<00:03:32.919> was<00:03:33.069> able

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
on FIFA anyway so that's how I was able

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.819 
on FIFA anyway so that's how I was able
to<00:03:33.400> get<00:03:33.549> him<00:03:33.729> up<00:03:33.939> really<00:03:34.419> so<00:03:34.720> fast<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.379> you

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829

go for a slightly faster striker or a

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.749 
go for a slightly faster striker or a
slightly<00:03:52.870> faster<00:03:53.379> winger<00:03:53.709> but<00:03:53.739> he<00:03:54.280> does<00:03:54.549> the

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:54.759 
slightly faster winger but he does the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.670
