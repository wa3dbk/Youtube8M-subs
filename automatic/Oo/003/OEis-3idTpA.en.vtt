00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.880 
with the original recording after that
I'll<00:00:51.390> stop<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> recording<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.260> break<00:00:52.710> it

down for you to show you how it's played

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.500

so<00:00:55.340> right<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.550> gonna<00:00:56.670> play<00:00:56.969> along<00:00:57.270> with

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so right now I'm gonna play along with

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:18.610 
so right now I'm gonna play along with
the<00:00:57.629> recording

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.370 

so<00:01:19.620> that<00:01:19.800> was<00:01:19.980> that<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.870> starts<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.350> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
so that was that so it starts like this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.190 
so that was that so it starts like this
on<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.070> fifth<00:01:23.340> fret<00:01:23.720> everything<00:01:24.720> pretty<00:01:24.990> much

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
on the fifth fret everything pretty much

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.710 
on the fifth fret everything pretty much
is<00:01:26.160> between<00:01:26.550> the<00:01:26.700> fifth<00:01:26.940> fret<00:01:29.180> as<00:01:30.180> high<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
is between the fifth fret as high as it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.360 
is between the fifth fret as high as it
goes<00:01:30.870> will<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> tenth<00:01:31.650> fret<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.190> B

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
goes will be the tenth fret on the B

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.880 
goes will be the tenth fret on the B
string<00:01:32.550> so<00:01:33.510> let's<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.560> kind<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.800> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
string so let's and it's kind of a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.750 
string so let's and it's kind of a
hammer<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:36.710> from<00:01:37.710> fifth<00:01:38.010> to<00:01:38.130> seventh<00:01:38.520> fret<00:01:38.700> on

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
hammer on from fifth to seventh fret on

00:01:38.760 --> 00:02:16.990 
hammer on from fifth to seventh fret on
a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:28.270 

so<00:02:18.000> sliced<00:02:18.450> up

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:50.930 

that's<00:02:29.280> actually<00:02:29.700> what<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:49.820> kind<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
that's actually what it is kind of a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.910 
that's actually what it is kind of a
tricky<00:02:51.240> slide<00:02:51.570> there<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.410> hard<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.680> me

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
tricky slide there and it's hard for me

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.060 
tricky slide there and it's hard for me
to<00:02:53.040> play<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.340> slow<00:02:53.730> motion<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.240> can<00:02:54.300> do<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:55.070> with

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
to play in slow motion I can do it with

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:13.930 
to play in slow motion I can do it with
no<00:02:56.190> problem<00:02:56.640> playing<00:02:56.820> at<00:02:57.000> normal<00:02:57.180> speed

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:22.240 

so<00:03:14.720> it's<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:18.440> that's<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:19.240> so
