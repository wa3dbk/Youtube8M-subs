you've got the smart key on you and so

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.990 
you've got the smart key on you and so
the<00:03:18.200> outside<00:03:18.350> mirrors<00:03:18.830> automatically<00:03:19.520> unfold

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
the outside mirrors automatically unfold

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.840 
the outside mirrors automatically unfold
and<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.810> interior<00:03:21.380> door<00:03:21.680> pocket<00:03:22.100> lights<00:03:22.310> will

and the interior door pocket lights will

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.850 
and the interior door pocket lights will
illuminate<00:03:23.090> making<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.959> easier<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.680> enter

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
illuminate making it easier to enter

illuminate making it easier to enter
your<00:03:25.340> vehicle<00:03:25.760> when<00:03:25.940> it's<00:03:26.060> nighttime

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.580 

so<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.600> sound<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.170> hands-free

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
so that is the sound of the hands-free

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.680 
so that is the sound of the hands-free
liftgate<00:03:33.890> which<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.460> super<00:03:35.060> useful<00:03:35.480> feature

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
liftgate which is a super useful feature

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.540
