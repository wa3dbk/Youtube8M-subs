00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.820
 Be honest, this psychology thing is only meant to take time, is not it? 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.160
 Unbelievably it's ... 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.060
 I sit there and talk to families ... 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.240
 and I think: 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.340
 I must be a disgrace to everyone. 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.920
 You can be a disgrace but you are the one you call when you can not count on anyone else. 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.480
 Do not tell me this is a disgrace. 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.160
 How many active cases do you have? 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.020
 38 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.320
 Child Protection Service 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.440
 My name is Emily. 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.740
 Lilith. 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.000
 You know I can help you ... 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.420
 They hate me. 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.340
 They go to the basement ... 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.700
 This little girl ... heard her parents say they were going to send her to hell. 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.240
 I'm afraid... 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.260
 Did you hear that !? 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.640
 Open the door! 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.600
 Police! 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.440
 Lilith! 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.800
 What she needs now is a safe environment that protects her ... 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.940
 I think I can give you that. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.920
 Do you live alone? 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.920
 Just me ... Just us. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660
 A new beginning... 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 I had a nightmare... 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.240
 You can not expect miracles. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.440
 I can not reduce 10 years of trauma to six weeks. 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.960
 An obscure warning ... 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.140
 I went to see the house ... 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.980
 Mother and father barricaded themselves in the bedroom at night. 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.360
 What does scare you? 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.820
 They follow me ... 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.640
 Who? 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.640
 A terrifying secret ... 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.640
 He is not safe with me. 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.640
 People die at her feet ... 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.280
 Not by your hands but simply ... 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.280
 die. 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.140
 Is afraid? 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.240
 because I do not 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.400
 This fall ... 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 Do not let them take me! 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.120
 I know how new she is ... 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 Do not leave me here! 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.280
 They will never stop. 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.340
