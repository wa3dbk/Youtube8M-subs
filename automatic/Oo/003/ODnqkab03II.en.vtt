then apply to Lopes but I didn't realize

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.740 
then apply to Lopes but I didn't realize
that<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.780> only<00:01:40.049> counts<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> few<00:01:41.220> games<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
that it only counts for a few games and

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.010 
that it only counts for a few games and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
then there was then a problem with the

then there was then a problem with the
recording<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.410> for<00:02:15.160> some<00:02:15.340> reason<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.820> didn't

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
recording and for some reason it didn't

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.670 
recording and for some reason it didn't
record<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.840> at<00:02:17.020> all<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:19.630> was<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.410> end

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
record it at all so this was the end

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.460 
record it at all so this was the end

for some reason just looks right at the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.280 
for some reason just looks right at the
