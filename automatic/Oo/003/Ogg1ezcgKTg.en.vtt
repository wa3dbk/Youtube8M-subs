00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
so how can we take something that is

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.930 
so how can we take something that is
already<00:00:02.760> extreme<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:04.080> make<00:00:04.830> it<00:00:05.009> extreme

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
already extreme and make it extreme

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.600 
already extreme and make it extreme

tonight's activity was a chance for the
students<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.890> both<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> computer<00:00:53.460> science

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
students in both the computer science

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
students in both the computer science
class<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> design<00:00:54.690> class<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:56.160> come

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
class and the design class to come

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.540 
class and the design class to come
together<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:57.090> teams<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.410> basically<00:00:59.219> pitch

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
together as teams and basically pitch

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.970 
together as teams and basically pitch
the<00:01:00.239> ideas<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.829> type

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the ideas that they have for what type

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.049 
the ideas that they have for what type
of<00:01:02.010> game<00:01:02.280> they're<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> build<00:01:02.820> over<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
of game they're going to build over the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
of game they're going to build over the
rest<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> semester<00:01:03.979> when<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> go<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
rest of the semester when you go out a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.830 
rest of the semester when you go out a
game<00:01:05.670> design<00:01:06.000> project<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.659> so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
game design project it's so

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.260 
game design project it's so
multidisciplinary<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.970> hard<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
multidisciplinary that it's hard to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
multidisciplinary that it's hard to
think<00:01:09.360> about<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.720> whole<00:01:09.869> thing<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:11.010> go<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
think about the whole thing so we go in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920 
think about the whole thing so we go in
with<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> very<00:01:11.760> technical<00:01:12.030> money<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.689> what

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
with a very technical money to do what

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
with a very technical money to do what
can<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.560> what's<00:01:13.890> possible<00:01:14.490> while<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
can we do what's possible while the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
can we do what's possible while the
design<00:01:15.330> kids<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.020> lot<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.830> freedom<00:01:17.520> in

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
design kids have a lot more freedom in

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.039 
design kids have a lot more freedom in
their<00:01:18.060> thought<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.570> they're<00:01:18.780> trying<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
their thought because they're trying to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
their thought because they're trying to
think<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.290> from<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.799> different<00:01:20.430> angle<00:01:20.520> than

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
think about from a different angle than

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609 
think about from a different angle than
us<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.720> come<00:01:21.900> together<00:01:22.110> we're

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
us and so when we come together we're

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
us and so when we come together we're
able<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.939> computer<00:01:24.330> science<00:01:24.630> kids<00:01:24.840> are

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
able to the computer science kids are

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.890 
able to the computer science kids are
able<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.560> free<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:27.330> restrictions<00:01:27.780> they've

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
able to free up the restrictions they've

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.300 
able to free up the restrictions they've
put<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.229> themselves<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:29.220> they're

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
put on themselves because they're

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
put on themselves because they're
thinking<00:01:29.369> technically<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.299> design<00:01:30.900> kids<00:01:31.110> are

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
thinking technically and design kids are

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.679 
thinking technically and design kids are
able<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.880> find<00:01:32.880> ways<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.240> their<00:01:33.450> ideas

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
able to find ways to make their ideas

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.940 
able to find ways to make their ideas
work<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> pitch<00:01:34.829> an

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
work you're going to have to pitch an

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.319 
work you're going to have to pitch an
idea<00:01:35.040> certainly<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> real<00:01:35.880> world<00:01:36.060> that's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
idea certainly in the real world that's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
idea certainly in the real world that's
going<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> come<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> areas<00:01:38.280> of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
going to come up in the in the areas of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.160 
going to come up in the in the areas of
design<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.180> certainly<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.630> always<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
design you certainly are always going to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.649 
design you certainly are always going to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
see and this is very similar in this
case<00:01:48.509> we're<00:01:49.140> working<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.560> computer<00:01:50.009> science

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
case we're working with computer science

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.440 
case we're working with computer science
guys<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.700> obviously<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> lot<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
guys so they obviously have a lot of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.569 
guys so they obviously have a lot of
scripting<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.500> computer<00:01:53.280> science

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
scripting and you know computer science

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.030 
scripting and you know computer science
stuff<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.149> very<00:01:54.240> little<00:01:54.479> about<00:01:55.040> that

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
stuff that I know very little about that

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.859 
stuff that I know very little about that
they're<00:01:56.159> working<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.700> well<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.180> we're<00:01:57.390> kind

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
they're working on as well so we're kind

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.340 
they're working on as well so we're kind
of<00:01:57.930> presenting<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.159> together
