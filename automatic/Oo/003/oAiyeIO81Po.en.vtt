00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:22.169
 first on the positive aspects that 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:24.989

 will be good to adopt and we pulled the 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.329

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.589
 tells you who invites you not to lose 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.480

 she also invites you to turn 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.780
 towards everything that is within the framework of 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:59.579
 the aesthetics of art in general do not 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.890
 lose hope in your talent by 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 example creators she invites you all 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.309
 just to trust you but 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 even more to trust destiny 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.020
 to give you a little bit of that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.470
 than there is above that is your 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.040
 good star who protects you and not 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.229
 to despair here in council the map 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.670
 tell you clearly to trust 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.860
 you this map he draws it in 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.850
 the whole seems to tell us that the month 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.159
 of May for you my dear verso is going to be 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.140
 a month when you go slowly you 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.640
 rebuild I feel like you 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.649
 come out of a period that was a little 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.850
 little difficult maybe and you are 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.469
 slowly putting you back 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.079
 because the obstacles and 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.939
 difficulties that we face so 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.189
 guarding the star of the future and of 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.070
 hope with the future we have 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.509
 the arcane map what is the arcane 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.609
 of death and who speaks to us she 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.310
 exactly when year in the obstacles 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.189
 from the past as if a painful past 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.829
 you stop blocking your evolution where 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.079
 was coming to a break a separation a 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.250
 termination 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.240
 something that ended in 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.890
 which 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.440
 which you still have trouble 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.410
 deliver from this cessation of this 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.790
 proud of this end purpose and you 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 can be a little bit still in the process of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.890
 ponder where you can have everything 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.630
 simply difficulties to you in 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.540
 reset 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.310
 emotionally from 7.2 this mourning you 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.730
 have a little difficulty doing this 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.140
 mourning 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.640
 that's why maybe tarot 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.440
 invites you with the star to keep 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.360
 hope for the future is that even 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.180
 thing is over even though this 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 situation is rotting 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.370
 we'll have to accept the end and go 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.830
 forward do not resist the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.470
 changes because there is something 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.540
 again that starts for the first 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.220
 map we drew the map of 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.380
 vibrations we pulled by the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.239
 first tarot cards and that's 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.760
 always very good sign to have in the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.739
 play the arcane nameless even when she 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.540
 is in negative it is simply said that 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.370
 this death may be badly lived and 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.739
 that it is followed by the map of 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.470
 bateleur the first card of the game is 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.080
 the end followed by the beginning of the renewal 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.790
 to start on a healthy foundation in his 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.750
 life in his relationship in the field 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.160
 professional 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.709
 it is in any case something 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.780
 again a new page that opens 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.780
 so is another another who's getting 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.640
 turns and so the pack keeps their 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.519
 as you can see wearing it 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.620
 number one is the first card of the 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.070
 tarot so it tells us about the 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.140
 beginning the departure and the birth of a 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.030
 project a relationship or just 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.970
 and that's what I feel with this 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.220
 draw a new harmony that will 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.980
 to be slowly but surely recover 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.790
 during the month of May because the trend 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.519
 of the month 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.950
 and still summarized by the last 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.160
 card that was pulled and it comes in 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.260
 the occurrence here of temperance the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.090
 temperance puts water in his wine to 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.150
 the call to calm nike to the harmony 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.980
 interior to patience and she invites 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.959
 also to small trips with this 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.690
 map to get stuck at t he must 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.730
 show love and compassion 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.760
 towards others but also towards oneself 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.690
 same and so with the paf card their 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.739
 which opened the way on a new 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.660
 cycle 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.479
 a new beginning and the map of 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.490
 temperance with the star card 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.169
 and the house and dark and nameless 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.900
 I can not help but understand 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.280
 this draw like telling me that you are 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.099
 may be shaken by the end of a 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.139
 relationship of a situation and you have 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.270
 may have lost hope but continue to 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.550
 believe in yourself because is starting at 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.870
 May a period of renewal 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.940
 in which you will come to 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.039
 harmonize a little bit by the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.930
 communication including exits and 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.750
 as I told you it's outings 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.449
 but as much cultural as very 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.150
 simple going on a weekend at the edge of the 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.030
 sea where to go for a walk on a Sunday in 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.710
 brief forest these are exits between 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.810
 friends go to the cinema braves get 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.039
 pampering take care of yourself but I 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.259
 see temperance especially as a 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.039
 rebalance card we get to 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.630
 rebalance 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.120
 it's the beginning of a new harmony 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.710
 which starts despite the fact that 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.810
 things from the past still seem a little 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.340
 not hold you back 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.000
 I think you can have good 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.759
 hope 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.949
 my dear back to restart 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.409
 especially by as I said the 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.840
 communication since it is the exchange the 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.509
 circulation of energies speaks to you because 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.680
 temperance so with oneself and with 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.270
 others 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.500
 managed to find a balance and 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.599
 inner harmony a form of 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.889
 serenity 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.539
 in synthesis ie once that 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.150
 we calculate the 80 who present 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:45.180

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.039
 card of the hermit who speaks to us with the 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.590
 temperance station kirdi a little bit 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.719
 the message of temperance on the 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.940
 question of patience and time that 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:57.930
 comes bring some success that 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:01.680
 comes to be patience is crowned

 time and effort but he will lead you
