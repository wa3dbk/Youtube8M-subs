00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 so big hello today do those 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.319
 hawaii video video will be regarding 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.880
 clothes and various purchases 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.750
 what are unprofitable 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 it's so so overseas so the list 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.000
 questions I leave under the video and if you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.750
 Interestingly, this video continues and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.580
 The first question is: 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.039
 the oldest thing in your wardrobe 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.099
 honestly I forgot about existence 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.669
 this jacket and I hung on me 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.219
 quietly in the closet in the hem 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.559
 remembered that I have all this and yes 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.840
 This here is such a denim jacket she 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 quilted on the inner lining is visible 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.110
 that this is right here my can because 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 the meopard of such a creature loved fur such 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 imperial ambitions of the chain of mountains. It was 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.680
 quite so cheap it is this 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.610
 brand gizia she 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 one kind only pockets 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.559
 stretched because I go there all sorts of things 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.619
 buzz 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.200
 but with the whole as a whole is well preserved 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.350
 she will be very tight so slightly 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.930
 goes right here is flashing a little bit and on 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.820
 sleeves were pampushki same fur 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.770
 this jacket 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.259
 I must have domes maybe seven seven seven 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.670
 years ago 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:32.130
 the next question is the newest part 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.950
 wardrobe I will say this shoes 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.960
 I bought them and honestly not even yet 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.170
 never even put it on 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.060
 half-naked semi some shoes 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.110
 they look like something a little huge 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.570
 but honestly I think winter will come 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.700
 once but so she didn't buy in general 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.270
 on the street now some kind of semi rain fell 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.759
 snow and this is not the best option on 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.070
 this weather here but they are insanely insane 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.719
 warm very dense I don't know what it is 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.409
 for the brand just the usual team 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.100
 store cheap store cheap 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.360
 boot find but relatively 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.789
 inexpensive 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.410
 on i'm very very warm but now neither 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.990
 I never wore I think that in case 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.630
 year they will be useful to me the next question 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.250
 this is the most expensive thing in your wardrobe 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.250
 and probably it will be my bag bottega 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.800
 veneta I keep it in a case because 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.990
 that at the moment I'm still wearing everything 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.320
 from the fact that I go to such a huge 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.360
 bag she had a very strong handle in such 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.670
 I start a lot of books red 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.350
 on this paper which is why I go with 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.040
 such a big bag it is kept by me 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.130
 finger here is such a handbag she has 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.090
 very very beautiful colors she wicker 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.370
 this leather bag here is such 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.840
 the key lies inside it is done more 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 smaller and inside it looks like this 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.810
 that's the way and even the mirror is such 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.730
 here's the stuff inside the suede 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:10.110
 to be honest 2 but it got dirty on it 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.690
 on the outside there are such scuffs 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.570
 was a birthday present 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.709
 mad and wanted me to like her 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.440
 of course maybe not for every day 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.270
 go somewhere when few things can 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.170
 take along 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.090
 But this and even lock on glitches she 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.160
 closes that is here it rises 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.060
 and goes down to this is the sweetest thing 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.070
 so expensive it is the cheapest thing in 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.290
 your wardrobe is under this category 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.230
 different socks can fit there and 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.900
 underwear he beacons some basic 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.430
 but probably I'll show this one sooner 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.230
 sweater and would have seen it in the previous 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.140
 video is a flower 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.870
 from cap he has a great city I really 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.269
 like how it highlights my skin and 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.769
 I like how he looks at me he 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.799
 It costs 650 rubles with big big 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.760
 discounts and in general, this thing 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.790
 fits under 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.820
 discharge the best buy and so also 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.870
 most recent because I acquired 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.840
 two days ago 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.330
 the best buy and probably this 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.239
 category fit these two colors here. 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.239
 these are my most beloved 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.340
 two things are turtlenecks repeatedly too 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.610
 maybe you've seen my video of it 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.759
 pure cashmere 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:37.590
 I bought them from one girl she 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:40.560
 sold her stuff yes it's the most tender 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.030
 the sweetest warmest sweetest 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:51.840
 and the most favorite things in my wardrobe but 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:54.330
 I'm terribly upset because 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.979
 account of the fact that it is the purest cashmere 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:02.220
 I know how come I have them covered my 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:05.069
 yes and for 20 . I gave 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.500
 somewhere around 1000 rubles I think that 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.860
 this is a very something else question is the most 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.720
 big waste of money and in this category 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.039
 we come here so big 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.009
 had a handkerchief 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.620
 from louis vuitton is the most unprofitable 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.400
 purchase disadvantageous because I was rude but 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.620
 saying licked 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.880
 i don't have a car i'm on the subway 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.820
 weather conditions do not fit this 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.289
 handkerchief I think that these things are only 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.449
 handkerchief out very crumpled it 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:39.420
 also in the composition of silk I do not know what is there 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.570
 golden threads i don't know 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.920
 you most likely can cost so much 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:49.110
 either the bitch is worth it yes I can't in it 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.730
 walk because the weather conditions in 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.130
 Moscow they are a little closer 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.620
 Petersburg because all the time something 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.140
 pours from the sky either rain or snow or 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.230
 something else and I can not bear to walk and 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.170
 You think that now here will get wet and 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.490
 yes how not to erase second moment i 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.410
 I can not wash because it can not 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.300
 in the usual way, fears can only 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.970
 give the dry cleaning of already so do not 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.810
 will we have nothing to do with it 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.810
 and and 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.260
 yes i'm coming institute i'm crashing 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.780
 rented it throws somewhere and every 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.350
 the hook on this shawl is my one 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.920
 gray hair one my wrinkle here 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.620
 here here somewhere so he is with me 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.810
 lies waiting in the wings to maybe me 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.230
 it was not worth buying it 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.590
 the moment when I bought I really wanted 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:48.030
 it turned out I just look with him on 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.980
 billion dollars or even euros he 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.860
 shimmered in a stunning way 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.250
 very very beautiful and i had 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:59.970
 as many ideas as you can combine but 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:02.790
 for now yes it lies with me and just 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:07.080
 warms my soul that I just have it 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:10.160
 there is but wear it does not get but 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.260
 such were questions and answers 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.470

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.290
