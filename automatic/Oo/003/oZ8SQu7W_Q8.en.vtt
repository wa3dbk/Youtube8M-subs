00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.680
 we made her more through this time 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.199
 scientists managed to bring a new species of lizards 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.089
 more smarter bloodthirsty than all those 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.350

 learning to look beyond the dinosaur 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.739
 already possible in cinemas and we decided 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.739

 symbol park and one of the most famous in 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.090
 dinosaur world though before that he already 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.190
 appeared on the screen in king kong 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.190
 screen versions of the lost world but 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.930
 the scene of the attack brought him real fame 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.930
 in the first park of the Jurassic period 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.610
 Velociraptor is a small predatory 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.920
 bipedal dinosaur that reached 70 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:57.210
 centimeters tall and weighed about 20 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.850
 kilogram of the film these same dinosaurs times in 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.380
 two more and more like nails on them 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.689
 of velociraptor and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.289
 or raptors most often appear on 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.580
 screen most often attack people 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.130
 fictional world they usually hunt 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.819
 groups but scientific evidence of their 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:21.709
 cost 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:21.709
 no sender could pretty 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.000
 can i of course my favorite triceratops 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.100
 this is one of the most recognizable dinosaurs 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.470
 they had a big bone collar 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.470
 trikey on the face and thick limbs 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.840
 despite their recognizable appearance 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.390
 similarity to rhinos they never 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.090
 played prominent roles in the franchise first 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.579
 parts we meet triceratops patient 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.430
 in the second film of his catch hunters and 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.209
 the third triceratops and completely got 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.209
 role in the crowd 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.850
 brachiosaurus is a herbivore dinosaur 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.830
 which was considered the highest so far 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.830
 Scientists have not found the remains of a very tall 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.940
 brachiosaurus and these are the very dinosaurs with 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.250
 which begins the Jurassic Park 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.580
 except for the appearance of the raptor itself 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:35.130
 beginning who does not remember the beautiful scene 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.470
 which these graceful lizards eat leaves 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.290
 from treetops and bathe in the river 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:58.440
 I can certainly swallow it 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:04:00.209
 just a great deal carp phase it 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.459
 predatory dinosaur who lived in the very 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.620
 the beginning of the Jurassic period he achieved 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.870
 meter length and weighed about half a ton 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.360
 film and deed phase the enemy is reduced and 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.190
 they came up with skin folds our books 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.350
 such departures from reality was not 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.940
 remember that nasty dinosaur 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.200
 who killed Denis trying 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.810
 subordinate machine this case phase BP 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.360
 it's time for the catch and lived in the end of the Cretaceous 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.760
 period in North America and 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.570
 could move both on 2 and on 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.670
 four legs 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.980
 although did not appear in all parts 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.990
 franchises but no difference anything 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.360
 could they graze peacefully 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.000
 together with the brachiosaurus me to fell into 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.640
 captivity to the hunters were seen near 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 with measles then your home to the place of everything 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.660
 kilometer and a half from where is familiar and we bring 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.880
 and they came gallimim or imitating a rooster 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:57.570
 this is an omnivorous dinosaur inhabiting 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:59.790
 the territory of Asia, gallimim appears in 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.160
 first two parts as well as in the new world 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.800
 jurassic period you can remember how 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.560
 Hammond's grandchildren and Alan Grant run out on 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.480
 plain and see herd gallimim of one 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.790
 of which then kills terex 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.270
 let's u do it look like it and 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.250
 There is to know you Zavra can be on 17 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.350
 bone plates that are located 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.930
 he has some scientists on his back 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:28.620
 that these plates were movable and could 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:31.110
 change the angle of the most cute 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.840
 stegosaurs in the franchise was of course 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.240
 Baby Stegosaurus whose picture is a tree 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.020
 Sara but adults decided that she 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.020
 wants to harm him 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:49.210
 and it carries 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.400
 apatosaurus and or brontosaurus and lived on 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.620
 North America and length 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.580
 reached twenty-three meters from Odessa 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.460
 they are up to 32 tons the most unlucky dinosaurs 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.680
 in the book apatosaurus and were the first lizards 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.930
 who saw on the island but in the first 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.720
 they were replaced by film of a brachiosaurus in 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.120
 the second at the moment taking in 3 pictures 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.550
 Roles got only their Kostya but the world 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.250
 the jurassic period will finally restore 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.610
 justice and show us apatosaurus 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.610
 of 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:33.050
 we have problems the end is just 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.300
 the animals 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.340
 now my little lovers of pangolin 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.460
 ahead explore dinosaurs in the fourth 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.460
 parts
