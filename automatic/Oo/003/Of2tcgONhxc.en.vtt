00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
it's really cool really good at slow

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.010 
it's really cool really good at slow
speeds<00:02:57.050> up<00:02:57.140> your<00:02:57.170> g<00:02:57.410> zg<00:02:57.710> zone<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.960> finish<00:02:59.960> it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
see if I lost age can get these mixed up

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.500 
see if I lost age can get these mixed up
way<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.530> him<00:03:06.760> eventually<00:03:07.760> when<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.090> get<00:03:08.270> more

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510

way to of him eventually when I get more
writing<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.840> clock<00:03:09.050> so<00:03:09.290> i<00:03:09.320> will<00:03:09.530> probably

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
writing the clock so i will probably

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.470 
writing the clock so i will probably
ditch<00:03:10.040> out<00:03:10.190> two<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.550> these<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:10.670> make<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.210> four

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
ditch out two of these and make it four

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.410 
ditch out two of these and make it four
but<00:03:11.750> we'll<00:03:11.870> see<00:03:12.050> we<00:03:12.830> will<00:03:13.070> see<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:14.120> that's<00:03:14.270> at

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
but we'll see we will see so that's at

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.190 
but we'll see we will see so that's at
Jesus<00:03:15.230> own<00:03:15.320> cards<00:03:16.450> alright<00:03:17.450> moving<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.050> to

basically generation break two of the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.040 
basically generation break two of the
glory<00:03:24.800> so<00:03:25.550> he<00:03:25.640> can<00:03:25.760> guard<00:03:25.910> with<00:03:26.060> one's<00:03:26.240> also

here<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.180> generation<00:03:29.180> break<00:03:29.510> stride<00:03:29.930> for

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
here the generation break stride for

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.530 
here the generation break stride for
stride<00:03:30.260> ability<00:03:31.130> so<00:03:31.820> when<00:03:32.000> Anthony<00:03:32.330> strides

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
stride ability so when Anthony strides

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.140 
stride ability so when Anthony strides
over<00:03:32.630> him<00:03:33.010> he<00:03:34.010> will<00:03:34.190> give<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.790> ability<00:03:35.120> of

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.410 
guess plus 5 that's really good that's
like<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.350> push<00:04:12.530> card<00:04:12.800> then<00:04:13.430> we<00:04:13.550> have<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:14.030> leggy

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
like a push card then we have the leggy

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.099 
like a push card then we have the leggy
on<00:04:14.630> our<00:04:14.900> lazy<00:04:15.350> leading<00:04:15.620> card<00:04:15.830> room<00:04:16.040> dispersal

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
on our lazy leading card room dispersal

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.210 
on our lazy leading card room dispersal
basically<00:04:18.109> when<00:04:18.260> he's<00:04:18.410> Legion<00:04:18.980> that<00:04:19.100> could

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
basically when he's Legion that could

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.380 
basically when he's Legion that could
bounce<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.459> car<00:04:19.640> from<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.910> field<00:04:20.150> basketball

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
bounce a car from the field basketball

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.810 
bounce a car from the field basketball

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
boost generation breaking one count of

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.600 
boost generation breaking one count of
last<00:04:49.450> one<00:04:49.660> when<00:04:50.380> he<00:04:50.500> hits<00:04:50.740> he<00:04:51.130> brings<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.400> card

from the field to the bottom of deck gun

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.060 
from the field to the bottom of deck gun
so<00:04:53.440> everything<00:04:54.370> gets<00:04:54.610> swapped<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.780> bottom

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
so everything gets swapped to the bottom

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.150 
so everything gets swapped to the bottom
then<00:04:57.070> we<00:04:57.220> have<00:04:57.400> our<00:04:57.640> next<00:04:58.000> one<00:04:58.150> or<00:04:58.920> twin<00:04:59.920> master

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
then we have our next one or twin master
