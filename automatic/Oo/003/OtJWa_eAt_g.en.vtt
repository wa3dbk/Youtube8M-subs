00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.610
 or not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.450
 how do you live this moment of a selection 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.970
 Uruguayan a celeste with tabares with 14 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.060
 undefeated matches is not something very nice 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.600
 I think that the selection is not there 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.039
 they think about continuing in the undefeated what 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.630
 think keep doing things right 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.110
 follow 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.250
 keeping the group following 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.440
 consolidating us as one of the best 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 selections of the world try to achieve 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.160
 objectives and especially try to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.570
 enjoy these moments that are 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.060
 few the good times that they have 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.190
 full around there a long time ago that I 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.420
 well I was not playing well not 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.630
 things are not coming out 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.800
 as as it was wanted and the truth that 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:04.420
 today look at the knockout table and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.180
 see us first I think that that does not have us 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.430
 that continue to give strength to continue 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.570
 growing keep doing things right 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 and good that it serves us as a 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.090
 motivation missing a lot of road they're just going 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.860
 three games and well we have to continue 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.080
 down that road that well for now 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.030
 we go in nothing has always touched me 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.280
 share rooms with many 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.670
 players in the world cup touched me with the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.830
 russian in the america cup with mauri torino 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.080
 Russian you learn a lot you do not have 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.360
 a lot of experience are we are very good friends 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.850
 I always believe that the first moment 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.700
 I came to the selection in 2009 I think 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.830
 that supported me a lot and I want it 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.420
 I love a lot and I always try to do 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.009
 changes often talking on 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.270
 for example phone occasionally 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.039
 face and before receiving communion 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.570
 example the bologna or the like guy with 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.149
 the jets that are always pending 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.860
 always the good thing is also that the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.420
 friendship that is beyond being 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.250
 soccer player I think he made a 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.560
 great friendship with many players 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.060
 good always when one plays or not 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.740
 always play one is worrying 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.960
 on the other sending a message always 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.640
 you always know how you are doing 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.080
 the companions for the rest of the world 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.429
 many of south africa work things 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.440
 bad for example the erection the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.840
 expulsion before France work for 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.280
 example having reached quarters which 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.860
 is the most important memory that this one 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 yes suffice to say world championship is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.160
 lengthen that world for me in what 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.020
 staff all so many good things 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.600
 as bad but one can not be 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.130
 selfish and stay with the bad things 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.130
 I think the biggest memory is 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.590
 when when we go to the semifinals in 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.890
 that famous party at the hand of louis 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.780
 and I think one that partake of 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.220
 that match and being on the court I think 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.110
 that is something a very nice memory but 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.750
 I will not forget you have to remember 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.610
 as the most important of the medical cup the 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.760
 victory against argentina 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.070
 or the title not the title itself the title 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.510
 it was a bit the strawberry of the cake for 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.040
 many things 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.140
 uruguay to certify that the group 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.060
 It was very solid that they had been doing 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.390
 things well I had a lot of time and I think 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.040
 that what he needed was to raise a 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.050
 cup because although the world cup was 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.390
 it was something very nice we enjoyed everything 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.370
 but we left 4 uruguay has a lot 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.380
 history has won many things at 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.890
 throughout his career and I think for 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.030
 feel good and feel comfortable with a 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.650
 work I think the main thing was 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.020
 raise the cup and then we could 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.220
 do you realize that because of your age 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.920
 you are directly in the games 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.489
 Olympics is something to look at with 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.910
 out of the corner of the eye that's something that by 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.900
 We do not lose sleep throughout all 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.150
 the days 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.300
 I count the days that are missing treatment 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.370
 prepare for that date although one 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.080
 they have to live in the present the day to 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 day they will have everything to think that 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.160
 before and other things with the selection 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.920
 like eliminatory or something but it's something 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.550
 that I know I have the possibility now and 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.100
 does it move 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.620
 I once in their life fighting for 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.300
 a place then I think it's something that 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.310
 I have to be very I have to have it 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.440
 very present and that's how I am 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.570
