this we changed our cleaning regimen to
a<00:01:16.490> different<00:01:16.970> formulation<00:01:17.390> using<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.020> elta

a different formulation using the elta

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.010 
a different formulation using the elta
product<00:01:19.009> celta<00:01:19.460> we<00:01:20.180> found<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:20.509> this<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.990> a

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
product celta we found that this is a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.200 
product celta we found that this is a
product<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.040> should<00:01:22.610> be<00:01:22.729> a<00:01:22.759> little<00:01:22.970> less

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
product that should be a little less

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.469 
product that should be a little less
irritating<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.579> it's<00:01:25.579> something<00:01:25.729> that's<00:01:25.939> new

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
irritating and it's something that's new

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.440 
irritating and it's something that's new
and<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:28.460> very<00:01:28.670> similar<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.090> what<00:01:29.210> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
and so it's very similar to what the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.899 
and so it's very similar to what the
ointments<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:29.869> were<00:01:29.990> using<00:01:30.140> before<00:01:30.729> but<00:01:31.729> just

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
out from the procedure and will continue

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.840 
out from the procedure and will continue
to<00:03:29.739> follow<00:03:29.920> her<00:03:30.160> she<00:03:30.340> lives<00:03:30.489> a<00:03:30.519> little<00:03:30.609> bit<00:03:30.760> of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
to follow her she lives a little bit of

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.949 
to follow her she lives a little bit of
a<00:03:30.910> hike<00:03:31.060> from<00:03:31.239> here<00:03:31.329> that's<00:03:31.569> where<00:03:31.690> we<00:03:31.780> haven't

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
a hike from here that's where we haven't

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.660 
a hike from here that's where we haven't
seen<00:03:32.079> her<00:03:32.170> in<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.350> interim<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.829> hope<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.400> can<00:03:33.549> see

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
seen her in the interim I hope I can see

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.710 
seen her in the interim I hope I can see
her<00:03:33.730> back<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.209> could<00:03:34.329> be<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.540> end<00:03:34.630> of

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
her back so this could be the end of

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.879 
her back so this could be the end of
this<00:03:34.780> journey<00:03:35.049> but<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.380> think<00:03:35.590> we're<00:03:35.680> going<00:03:35.769> to

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
this journey but I think we're going to

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.140 
this journey but I think we're going to
probably<00:03:36.069> see<00:03:36.250> her<00:03:36.340> next<00:03:36.459> week<00:03:36.579> if<00:03:36.850> she<00:03:37.000> can

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
probably see her next week if she can

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.660 
probably see her next week if she can

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
is not quite there yet at a year it just

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.810 
is not quite there yet at a year it just
looks<00:05:20.050> like<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:20.229> baby's<00:05:20.530> bottom<00:05:20.770> it's<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.639> really

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
looks like a baby's bottom it's a really

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
smooth smooth result that occurs and it

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.770 
smooth smooth result that occurs and it
takes<00:05:24.220> at<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.880> time<00:05:25.240> over<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.510> year<00:05:25.660> I've

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
takes at that time over a year I've

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.969 
takes at that time over a year I've
tried<00:05:26.229> all<00:05:26.350> different<00:05:26.440> types<00:05:26.710> of<00:05:26.830> lasers

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
tried all different types of lasers

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.469 
tried all different types of lasers
there's<00:05:27.280> nothing<00:05:27.610> as<00:05:27.700> smooth<00:05:28.030> as<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.210> right

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
there's nothing as smooth as a right

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.150 
there's nothing as smooth as a right

textured skin and just making it look

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.330 
textured skin and just making it look
really<00:05:32.350> really<00:05:32.470> soft<00:05:32.770> but<00:05:32.979> it<00:05:33.070> takes<00:05:33.220> about

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
really really soft but it takes about

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.560 
really really soft but it takes about
eight<00:05:33.580> months<00:05:33.700> to<00:05:33.820> a<00:05:33.940> year<00:05:34.000> to<00:05:34.210> see<00:05:34.450> that

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
eight months to a year to see that

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.840 
eight months to a year to see that
transformation<00:05:35.260> so<00:05:35.740> whatever<00:05:36.039> she's<00:05:36.280> she<00:05:36.760> is

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
transformation so whatever she's she is

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.670 
transformation so whatever she's she is
impressed<00:05:37.150> with<00:05:37.300> today<00:05:37.720> is<00:05:37.750> only<00:05:38.110> a<00:05:38.229> beginning

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
impressed with today is only a beginning

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.810 
impressed with today is only a beginning
of<00:05:38.860> where<00:05:38.979> we<00:05:39.070> were<00:05:39.190> they<00:05:39.340> want<00:05:39.520> to<00:05:39.610> be<00:05:39.700> and

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
of where we were they want to be and

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.040 
of where we were they want to be and
again<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.120> cheeks<00:05:40.330> are<00:05:40.450> too<00:05:40.539> big<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.900> eyes

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
again the cheeks are too big the eyes

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.629 
again the cheeks are too big the eyes
are<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.260> little<00:05:41.289> bit<00:05:41.500> too<00:05:41.650> swollen<00:05:42.280> but<00:05:42.520> it

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
are a little bit too swollen but it

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.890 
are a little bit too swollen but it
really<00:05:42.970> doesn't<00:05:43.180> matter<00:05:43.360> because<00:05:43.570> she<00:05:43.660> just

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
really doesn't matter because she just

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.440 
really doesn't matter because she just
looks<00:05:44.050> so<00:05:44.200> amazing<00:05:44.289> so<00:05:45.180> anyways<00:05:46.180> it's<00:05:46.330> going

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
looks so amazing so anyways it's going

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.060 
looks so amazing so anyways it's going
to<00:05:46.510> end<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.690> video<00:05:46.870> journey<00:05:47.200> and<00:05:47.380> maybe<00:05:47.530> a<00:05:47.620> few

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
to end the video journey and maybe a few

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.140 
to end the video journey and maybe a few
months<00:05:48.280> from<00:05:48.400> now<00:05:48.430> we'll<00:05:48.639> just<00:05:48.669> take<00:05:48.910> another

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150 
months from now we'll just take another
shot<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.600> continue<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.050> follow<00:05:50.200> her<00:05:50.500> if<00:05:50.710> she

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
shot and continue to follow her if she

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.379 
shot and continue to follow her if she
doesn't<00:05:51.370> mind<00:05:51.430> driving<00:05:51.820> this<00:05:51.910> distance<00:05:52.300> to

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
doesn't mind driving this distance to

00:05:52.389 --> 00:06:00.580 
doesn't mind driving this distance to
come<00:05:52.539> and<00:05:52.660> see<00:05:52.780> me<00:05:53.160> so<00:05:54.160> thank<00:05:54.340> you
