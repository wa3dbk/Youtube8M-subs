the<00:02:41.459> interesting<00:02:41.790> thing<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.360> now<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:42.959> have

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the interesting thing is now we have

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.650 
the interesting thing is now we have
Google<00:02:43.620> Earth<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.970> everybody<00:02:45.450> can

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
Google Earth and so everybody can

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.110 
Google Earth and so everybody can
actually<00:02:46.050> look<00:02:46.200> at<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.620> earth<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:47.250> pure

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
actually look at the earth in pure

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
actually look at the earth in pure
verticality<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.319> it's<00:02:49.860> very<00:02:50.099> boring

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
verticality and it's very boring

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.550 
verticality and it's very boring
sometimes<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.709> element<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.690> not<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.989> bleak

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
sometimes so the element of not a bleak

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.410
