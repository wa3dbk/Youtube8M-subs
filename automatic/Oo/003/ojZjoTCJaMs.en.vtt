bad<00:01:21.930> tie<00:01:22.460> that<00:01:23.460> seam<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:23.939> tell<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> where<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
bad tie that seam will tell you where to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.370

cross<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:25.200> over<00:01:25.259> left<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> good<00:01:26.460> tie

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
cross right over left if it's a good tie

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.690 
cross right over left if it's a good tie
it's<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> right<00:01:28.619> place<00:01:28.770> often<00:01:29.430> they're

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
it's in the right place often they're

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.910 
it's in the right place often they're
wrong<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> purposes<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.380> let's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
wrong so for the purposes of this let's

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.980 
wrong so for the purposes of this let's
cross<00:01:32.159> them<00:01:32.369> at<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> scene<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.840> see

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
cross them at the scene so you can see

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.020 
cross them at the scene so you can see
that<00:01:34.140> there's<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.770> there's<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> stitch<00:01:35.729> mark
