00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.680 
that's pretty long straight of a
watercraft<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.900> being<00:02:14.140> awake<00:02:15.360> I've<00:02:16.360> been

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.290 
watercraft and being awake I've been
carried<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:16.990> bed<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.440> think<00:02:17.500> was<00:02:17.800> like<00:02:18.100> 4<00:02:18.550> a.m.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.720 
carried to bed I think was like 4 a.m.
in<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.569> morning<00:02:19.990> every<00:02:20.290> day<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.740> getting<00:02:21.580> out

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
of it again at 7:30 so that's about

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.240 
of it again at 7:30 so that's about
three<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.720> half<00:02:25.750> hours<00:02:26.319> sleep<00:02:26.620> every<00:02:27.220> night
