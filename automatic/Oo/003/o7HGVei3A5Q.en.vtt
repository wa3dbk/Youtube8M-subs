opposition<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:14.200> hit<00:02:14.380> app<00:02:14.620> okay<00:02:15.270> go<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.330> your

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
opposition can hit app okay go to your

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.850 
opposition can hit app okay go to your
width<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.780> height<00:02:16.960> check<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:17.470> right<00:02:17.650> there

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
width and height check that right there

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.280 
width and height check that right there
and<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.250> could<00:02:18.850> turn<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.330> 1920<00:02:20.020> at<00:02:20.140> this

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
and you could turn it to 1920 at this

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.800 
and you could turn it to 1920 at this
not<00:02:20.620> what<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:20.980> want<00:02:21.220> just<00:02:21.460> make<00:02:22.210> it<00:02:22.420> see<00:02:22.690> if<00:02:22.750> i

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
not what you want just make it see if i

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.620 
not what you want just make it see if i
type<00:02:22.990> of<00:02:23.140> 1920<00:02:25.620> changes<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.710> that<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
type of 1920 changes to that the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.020 
type of 1920 changes to that the
composition<00:02:29.110> shrunk<00:02:29.650> down<00:02:29.860> but<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.370> earth<00:02:30.580> is

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
composition shrunk down but the earth is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.730 
composition shrunk down but the earth is
still<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.440> same<00:02:32.470> socks<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.230> now<00:02:35.350> what<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.620> want

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
still the same socks so now what we want

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:44.880 
still the same socks so now what we want
to<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:37.890> ok<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:43.030> now<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.210> animate<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.900> it's

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
to do is ok so now to animate this it's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.310 
to do is ok so now to animate this it's
really<00:02:45.070> using<00:02:45.370> keyframes<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.000> if<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.170> don't

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
really using keyframes and if you don't

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.510 
really using keyframes and if you don't
know<00:02:47.410> how<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.590> use<00:02:47.650> keyframes<00:02:48.130> i'll<00:02:48.280> show<00:02:48.460> you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
know how to use keyframes i'll show you

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.240 
know how to use keyframes i'll show you
so<00:02:49.420> your<00:02:49.630> air<00:02:49.780> go<00:02:49.990> over<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.800> effects

well can animate a few things you got
the<00:03:22.510> rotation<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.380> got<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.650> radius<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.880> get

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
the rotation you got the radius you get

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.930 
the rotation you got the radius you get
the<00:03:25.180> light<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:26.440> get<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.740> shading<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.730> give

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
the light you get the shading so to give

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.360 
the light you get the shading so to give
you<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.060> few<00:03:28.240> different<00:03:28.360> things<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.780> render<00:03:29.370> to

seconds and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.860 
seconds and
a<00:03:39.060> little<00:03:39.540> slow<00:03:40.020> low<00:03:40.290> spin<00:03:40.770> right<00:03:40.950> there<00:03:41.870> let's

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
a little slow low spin right there let's

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.990 
a little slow low spin right there let's
connect<00:03:43.110> together<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:44.370> see<00:03:44.580> as<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.850> rotates

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
connect together you see as it rotates

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.730 
connect together you see as it rotates
the<00:03:46.880> light<00:03:47.880> slowly<00:03:48.540> goes<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.560> other

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
the light slowly goes to the other

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.080 
the light slowly goes to the other
hemisphere<00:03:50.480> it's<00:03:51.480> pretty<00:03:51.630> cool<00:03:51.870> right<00:03:52.190> now<00:03:53.190> if

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
hemisphere it's pretty cool right now if

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.180 
hemisphere it's pretty cool right now if
you<00:03:54.240> want<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.450> move<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.740> you<00:03:55.800> want<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.040> move

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
you want to move it so you want to move

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.760 
you want to move it so you want to move
it<00:03:56.340> through<00:03:56.370> time<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.910> space<00:03:57.530> go<00:03:58.530> down<00:03:58.740> to

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
it through time and space go down to

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.390 
it through time and space go down to
earth<00:03:59.450> down<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.630> transform<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:02.040> see<00:04:02.280> your

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
earth down to transform you see your

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.780 
earth down to transform you see your
