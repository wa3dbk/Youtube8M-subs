00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 because size does matter and a lot 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.790
 dangers of fashion size takes 236 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 action welcome everyone to a new 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.580
 video of fashion dangers I think that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.320
 It's been time for me to make a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.750
 new video within this section as well 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.949
 that today we talk about sizes the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.949
 size is very important 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.010
 26 ill-conceived to succeed with our 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.570
 type of body and with the occasion to which 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.490
 we want to go so I'm going to give you 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.080
 tips to always get the right 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.630
 topic first of all I'm going to talk about 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.730
 The width of the garments is very 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.440
 important to take into account the width of 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.930
 the clothes and whenever we want 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.970
 wear a tight dress or skirt 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.620
 and combine it with something wider to the 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.239
 time to use these types of dresses and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.940
 skirts you have to take into account the 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.680
 occasion with this I mean that if 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.690
 I would use a dress or a skirt 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.360
 this guy to party one night 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.200
 but I would not put it to go in a 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.270
 community or a wedding because appearing with 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.370
 this kind of styles or skirts in a 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.680
 church 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.210
 I do not see it very appropriate this kind of 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.640
 dresses and skirts 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.520
 will sit well with girls who are 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.470
 skinny because it makes a lot of body 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.600
 then if you are a little bit more 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.280
 I would not recommend it to you 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.840
 I have enough hips for us 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.520
 let's cheat I have hips but 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.710
 we also have to be comfortable with 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.780
 our body not because it has hips and 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.909
 this type of dresses mark it I'm not going 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.740
 to stop wearing it always inside 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.240
 some limits when we use a 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.030
 This type of dress is going to be best 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.860
 put on a jacket a blazer on top 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.020
 this is going to make it not so much marked 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.899
 our body I personally like 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.820
 plus there are also the tube skirts that 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.160
 They are very tight I recommend that you 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.280
 put on a shirt or a shirt that 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.700
 be wide if it is adjusted we will mark 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.619
 much more also and if you do not have hips 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.690
 for example you are some girls very 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.429
 thin perhaps if I would put it with 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.780
 something tight on top because it's going to 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.789
 mark and I will give you a little more 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.950
 way on the other hand we have the garments 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.110
 It will be better to combine them with 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.870
 tightest shirts one more skirt 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.600
 wide same shirt a little bit more 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.940
 or at least there is a cut that 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.280
 Mark a little on the hip because yes 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.720
 we carry something below that is very wide and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.970
 We also put something that is very 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 wide is going to see a very straight line 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.630
 great that will fit us well 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.700
 it is always better to give a point to 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.380
 stylize a little you see that what you 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.330
 I'm saying is always playing with the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.670
 sizes as we use one thing below 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.380
 that is narrower up has to 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.790
 be wider and the reverse when down 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.100
 be wider up there has to be more 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.620
 Narrow leggings are a very 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.640
 complicated and I think you have to have 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.620
 be very careful with them 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.650
 It is best to put them on with a T-shirt 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.330
 wide and at least cover half 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.250
 culete I will recommend a video 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.750
 probably already you have seen it but if 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.760
 you have not seen it happen to you right now 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.800
 Neus is among other things 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.840
 explains that it's the camel's leg and 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.610
 many other things that you should know in 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.740
 the size issue another very point 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.450
 important is the length whenever 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.920
 let's use a skirt a dress 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.630
 for a formal occasion that is going to be 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.460
 better than it is by the knee or a 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.650
 little bit above but not much in 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.450
 change let's go out partying we want 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.700
 get something a little tighter 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.069
 shorter there are girls who like 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.650
 wear 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.550
 in these skirts and dresses right by the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.470
 line that ends the culete 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.330
 I do not like absolutely anything 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.270
 mainly because I feel uncomfortable 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.830
 be there pending the dress and what 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.650
 my dress is up that I see a 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.970
 no, so I prefer that you 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.490
 skirts and these dresses that are 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.950
 adjusted and more cortitos that remain for 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.770
 at least a span of the culete for 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.050
 down because more a span to me than to 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.640
 likes the colors and the sizes with what 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.770
 that I also think that now it has 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.350
 so fashionable this season let's see 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.960
 I told him in this video are the ones he opted 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.210
 and also I'm going to tell you 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.160
 anecdote by which I tell you this the 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.870
 another day and go so quiet in the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.030
 subway up the stairs to go to 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.120
 the university and spend a girl that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.160
 I was wearing super tight jeans 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.900
 shot pretty short and wore a 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.940
 white shirt a crop top that the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.670
 it was really nice but that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.790
 would take over here or imagine you from 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.610
 here until where the pants began 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.830
 there was at least one piece of meat like that 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.690
 to go to university I this like 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.820
 I do not see it if I want to put a crop 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.290
 top so short I put on my pants 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.490
 a little bit higher or I put it to 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.470
 leaving an afternoon begin 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.699
 at night to take something I want to leave 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.130
 our idea that we are always going to 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.750
 hit when we get a harmony in 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.400
 our the best option is going to be 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.380
 combine tight garments with 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.569
 Wide clothes if we like to wear 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.580
 Narrow garments great but 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.710
 taking care especially when 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.009
 let's use that and how we do it 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.830
 I think you do not give anything beautiful marks 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.289
 with this I mean lerÃ­n faldas 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.840
 pants anything that they mark 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.759
 too much everywhere and that 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.909
 make cuts than anything 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:59.360
 flattering as can be the clothes 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.220
 inside that's too dangerous too 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.470
 dangerous I will say that it is the most dangerous 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.720
 to wear a tight dress or a 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.849
 skirt or a living underwear 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.949
 I hope this third has helped you 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.300
 Danger edition of fashion this theme 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.620
