because I just replaced that's the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
because I just replaced that's the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
switch that I just got in another video

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.530 
switch that I just got in another video
and<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> backup<00:00:35.460> me<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.360> just

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and it's got a backup me for that I just

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.590 
and it's got a backup me for that I just
put<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.460> when<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.969> touch<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.420> wires

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
put on it and when you touch the wires

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
put on it and when you touch the wires
together<00:00:40.579> they<00:00:41.579> work<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> beeper<00:00:42.540> works

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
together they work and the beeper works

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.160 
together they work and the beeper works
but<00:00:44.270> when<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.390> hook<00:00:45.539> up<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.809> switch

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
but when you hook up on the switch

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.979 
but when you hook up on the switch
nothing<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> second<00:00:48.899> switch

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
nothing so this is the second switch

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.619 
nothing so this is the second switch
eyeball<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.039> something's<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> don't

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
almost switches are off that's how you

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.620 
almost switches are off that's how you
save<00:05:07.310> your<00:05:07.520> battery<00:05:07.910> life<00:05:08.120> as<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.450> make<00:05:08.600> sure

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
so alright so here we go I think this

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.930 
so alright so here we go I think this
would<00:05:15.980> be<00:05:16.010> probably<00:05:16.340> better<00:05:16.460> angle<00:05:16.880> right

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
would be probably better angle right

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.000 
would be probably better angle right
here

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
both work light blue brake pressure

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.400 
both work light blue brake pressure
might<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.750> temperature<00:05:25.750> light<00:05:25.930> comes<00:05:26.230> on
