other's high scores it gets

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.549 
other's high scores it gets
progressively<00:00:48.820> more<00:00:49.359> difficult<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
progressively more difficult the

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.900 
progressively more difficult the
standard<00:00:50.920> control<00:00:51.219> scheme<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:51.579> what<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:51.760> see

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
standard control scheme is what you see

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.729 
standard control scheme is what you see
here<00:00:52.149> using<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.449> d-pad<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.260> move<00:00:53.469> and<00:00:53.680> the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
here using the d-pad to move and the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.040 
here using the d-pad to move and the
stylus<00:00:54.160> to<00:00:54.340> shoot<00:00:54.579> it<00:00:55.329> works<00:00:55.600> pretty<00:00:55.780> well<00:00:55.870> in

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
stylus to shoot it works pretty well in

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.840 
stylus to shoot it works pretty well in
my<00:00:56.140> opinion<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:56.710> didn't<00:00:57.460> have<00:00:57.550> any<00:00:57.699> problems

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
my opinion I didn't have any problems

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.319 
my opinion I didn't have any problems
with<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.620> unlike<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.769> 360<00:01:00.280> arcade<00:01:00.429> title<00:01:01.000> this

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
with it unlike the 360 arcade title this

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.720 
with it unlike the 360 arcade title this
game<00:01:01.539> has<00:01:01.570> multiple<00:01:02.170> stages<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.800> lot<00:01:03.640> of

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
game has multiple stages a lot of

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.820 
game has multiple stages a lot of
different<00:01:04.000> obstacles<00:01:04.210> in<00:01:04.540> those<00:01:04.659> stages<00:01:04.900> this

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
different obstacles in those stages this

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.920 
different obstacles in those stages this
demo<00:01:06.189> that<00:01:06.220> I've<00:01:06.430> got<00:01:06.640> on<00:01:06.670> here<00:01:07.000> only<00:01:07.210> has<00:01:07.479> one

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
demo that I've got on here only has one

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.690 
demo that I've got on here only has one
stage<00:01:08.200> but<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.500> one<00:01:08.619> I<00:01:08.680> got<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:08.890> try<00:01:09.070> at<00:01:09.130> e3<00:01:09.250> had

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
stage but the one I got to try at e3 had

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.109 
stage but the one I got to try at e3 had
quite<00:01:09.939> a<00:01:09.970> few<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.520> there's<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.759> whole<00:01:15.880> lot<00:01:16.030> of

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
quite a few now there's a whole lot of

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.609 
quite a few now there's a whole lot of
different<00:01:16.360> control<00:01:16.689> scheme<00:01:17.049> options<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:17.590> if

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
different control scheme options so if

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.960 
different control scheme options so if
you<00:01:17.770> don't<00:01:17.860> like<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.159> touch<00:01:18.340> screen<00:01:18.460> controls

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
you don't like the touch screen controls

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.819 
you don't like the touch screen controls
you<00:01:19.390> can<00:01:19.540> just<00:01:19.720> switch<00:01:19.900> to<00:01:19.930> using<00:01:20.229> all<00:01:20.470> buttons

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
you can just switch to using all buttons

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.469 
you can just switch to using all buttons
or<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.460> could<00:01:21.610> use<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.880> touchscreen<00:01:22.090> for

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
or you could use the touchscreen for

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.520 
or you could use the touchscreen for
movement<00:01:22.659> and<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.290> buttons<00:01:23.650> for<00:01:24.040> shooting

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
movement and the buttons for shooting

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.569 
movement and the buttons for shooting
having<00:01:26.530> tried<00:01:26.710> all<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.979> different<00:01:27.250> control

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
having tried all the different control

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.550 
having tried all the different control
schemes<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:28.090> much<00:01:28.540> prefer<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:28.960> touchscreen<00:01:29.470> to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
schemes I much prefer the touchscreen to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.260 
schemes I much prefer the touchscreen to
anything<00:01:29.740> else<00:01:29.979> but<00:01:30.579> I'm<00:01:30.759> sure<00:01:30.909> someone

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
anything else but I'm sure someone

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.149 
anything else but I'm sure someone
somewhere<00:01:31.630> is<00:01:31.810> going<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:32.049> prefer<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.920> button

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
somewhere is going to prefer the button

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.889 
somewhere is going to prefer the button
control<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:33.790> I'll<00:01:34.000> give<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.329> quick<00:01:34.570> demo<00:01:34.780> of

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
control so I'll give you a quick demo of

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:42.490 
control so I'll give you a quick demo of
that

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.020 

okay<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:44.430> each<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
okay so you can see here that each of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.999 
okay so you can see here that each of
the<00:01:45.150> buttons<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> different<00:01:46.439> direction<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the buttons is a different direction to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
the buttons is a different direction to
shoot<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.360> pressing<00:01:48.360> two<00:01:48.479> buttons<00:01:48.780> down

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
