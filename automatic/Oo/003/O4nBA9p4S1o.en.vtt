00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.270
 and me that's why we're here Kim Jong 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:07.809
 craig and we're going to bring a like in that 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:12.370
 it calls prime time driver and it's basically 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:14.169
 a king what prime-time driver 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.690
 driving commentator possibly what 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:19.289
 translated in this way 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.490
 and this is time has now left makes 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.320
 nothing in the pp is like that because if not 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.539
 they have sounds because they have not 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 implemented yet promises sounds 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.600
 originals different from those of the skin 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.879
 basic and as you see by the subject is that it is 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 a commentator is saying look at the weapons 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:43.200
 with micro and the helmets do not give jacket and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.300
 everything and such and such we are going to see of all 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.050
 ways to see if the animations change to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.050
 see control one 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.500
 the animations s I think not to have 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.500
 control 2 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.310
 control 3 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.290
 well no and control 4 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.220
 let's see the passive 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.840
 to ivÃ¡n 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.740
 It does not have sound either but 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 surely he also had a comment 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.320
 special go to an effect are of sounds 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.130
 specials let's see the basic hits 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.130
 there 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.590
 do not know the q1 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.310
 and now how do we throw it 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.970
 a micro appears as you see 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.970
 but hit 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.409
 malaga well here we have the second what 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.679
 is 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.810
 pretty nice we go with the w that 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.619
 it is simply a premium and improved 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.619
 attack speed 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.860
 there does not have the sound of 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.430
 skills because I already said that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.040
 we lack in the sound mostly has 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.040
 done here and the ultimate 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.260
 and they go 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.390
 of the other 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.670
 Oh 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.160
 very well 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.160
 now how the prime time driving dies 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.819
 for something special I think not 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.120
 I do not know if that's your normal animation but 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.120
 good 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.459
 does not do anything to resurrect by the way 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.180
 I do not know why it 's staying when the 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.180
 counter of the w 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.840
 flames and let's look to see how it varies 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.660
 namely 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.800
 this time 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:24.620
 then I would comment some pain and such 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.730
 back except pretty handsome and that more 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.730
 we were going to look 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.440
 and those of the wolf boots tajonar to see if 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.130
 improve your way of running 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.130
 we buy it 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.500
 but good 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.500
 hi w nothing 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.920
 well the best to your way of not changing 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.830
 run animation I mean no 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.680
 little gentlemen that is here more than 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.750
 975 rivers points for nothing, lady, I hope 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.250

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.900
 revoke mission grail and see you 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.900
