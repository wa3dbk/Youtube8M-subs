 good we release February with a video 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.920
 very special a collaboration of recipes 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.540

 You can also go to the chocolate channel 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.420

 rose form and also to the channel of what 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.009
 cooked me to delight with some rich 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.660
 Strawberry and rum cupcakes I hope you 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.880
 like the recipe I like a lot 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.200
 because the dough is moist and the cream 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.120
 it does not carry butter so it does not 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.890
 it's heavy here you have all the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.899
 ingredients that we will need to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.879
 the bag of our cupcakes other than 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.379
 raspberries if we want to remember to have 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.030
 the ingredients at room temperature 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.680
 so that when it comes to beating them, 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 separate 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.210
 the procedure is very simple 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.780
 we'll start beating the butter with 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:57.270
 sugar at fast speed 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.270
 we will beat for about 23 minutes 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.140
 next we add the eggs one 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.589
 to one and we're going to beat at speed 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.589
 maximum 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.330
 once integrated we are going to add the 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.220
 chocolate that we will have melted 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.670
 previously and let temper 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.670
 minutes 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.530
 now it's the turn of the ingredients 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.979
 solids we will start adding the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.420
 ground almonds at low speed 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.789
 then add the flour 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.890
 sifting is important that the time of 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.679
 beat let's use the minimum speed of 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.229
 our blender or even a spatula 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.020
 in this way we do not add more air 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.920
 that plays and so the mass will then be left 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.229
 more fluffy 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.640
 if you do it with a machine at the end 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.350
 a little the spatula to remove the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.680
 possible air bubbles that have 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.680
 formed 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.420
 we add the mass in our capacitas 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.430
 there are a total of 12 cupcakes and the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.580
 half of them I have put a 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.830
 raspberry and now it's the turn to bake 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.110
 with the heat up and down until 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.520
 be totally done and then what 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.650
 we will let cool on a grid 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.689
 before decorating 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.430
 and nothing like that left those who had the 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.739
 raspberry inside and the rest what they 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.230
 I put is a little bit of jam 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.150
 strawberry I used two decorations for a 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.370
 side a desire that you can see how it is 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.220
 He is tightening ago there or in the box of 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.319
 information and if not whipped cream or cream 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.079
 whipped for decoration because I put 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.860
 a little bit of desire and I finished it off with 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.560
 a raspberry 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.410
 Another idea is to make a cream ring 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.660
 Whipped or whipped cream 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.190
 sprinkle with a little chocolate on 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.260
 powder 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.630
 and finish the center with a little 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.640
 raspberry jam and if you can not 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.440
 do something kind the aprismo of seems 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.720
 although I'm a bit of note a little bit 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.880
 of chocolate and above a rich 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.640
 raspberry and it would be ready these are 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.310
 the three decorating ideas that I'm 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.410
 and they are already we can eat them really 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.480
 they are delicious I think they are from the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.819
 that have lasted less time at home 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.010
 because they did not love you and if the 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.410
 do not forget to send a photo for 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.090
 divine snacks to instagram or twitter 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.950
 that I'm shooting you with a lot 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.930
 I love and now I ask you to please you 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.420
