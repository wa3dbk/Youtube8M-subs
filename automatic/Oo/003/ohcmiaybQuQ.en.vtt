00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.220
 and loading and loading 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.550
 but like this one is from nobody 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.150
 yes 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 2-2 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.780
 where it says 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.780
 yes 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.000
 Well, this is the buffalo we throw 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.739
 yesterday afternoon from a hill there 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.349
 we could do with him then the 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.590
 we've been chasing this morning and 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.870
 there were three and then he throws him out 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.230
 with such good luck that has been 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.560
 dry so that by what you see does not throw 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.319
 or bad 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.420
 and the other one ran away, another one that 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.670
 had with this that apparently 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.330
 was guarding and then the other 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.790
 I also killed him in 20 minutes we did the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.790
 load so everything is perfect 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.940
 do not 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.529
 Yes Yes 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.480
 plus 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.530
 the pigeon 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.919
 do you think you're working with a 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.919
 tiny 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.250
 Thank you 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.130
 s 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.389
 i 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.389
 never 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.020
 and retire to kill him well 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.210
 wait our second buffalo we have 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.419
 killed the two in less than half an hour 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.699
 more or less we did one we made them a 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.759
 entrance that was there was three the other 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:52.250
 it was smaller we killed one and we've 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.350
 returned by this and with such good luck 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.199
 that we have done with him this is a lot 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.870
 older than the other has more voice to 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.750
 my taste I like more the other has been a 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.990
 right we have left a group of which 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.979
 yesterday we walked behind him because he is 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.389
 preferable always the buffalos catch them 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.840
 alone that are not in the pack because 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:17.060
 they will always see more 120 eyes and 120 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.000
 ears that not two like 14 like in this 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.490
 case but come on I think we've had 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.410
 we have killed them fast and good 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.810
 Well, now comes the worst that is going to be the 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.320
 to break this up you have to leave here all 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:33.289
 the guts and put us is not the half that 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.710
 we're going to leave the center in the car 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.630
 to take us to the slaughterhouse like this 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.620
 that this is already with this is over 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.940
 the 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.940
 elsa pairs of the buffalo
