00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.440 
where the filters are stored there are
four<00:02:10.560> different<00:02:11.160> prongs<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.360> go

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
four different prongs that we have to go

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.020 
four different prongs that we have to go
ahead<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.660> release<00:02:13.400> these<00:02:14.400> are<00:02:14.459> easy<00:02:14.760> they're

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
ahead and release these are easy they're

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.790 
ahead and release these are easy they're
just<00:02:15.239> rubber<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.140> then<00:02:16.260> kind<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
just rubber and then kind of see the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.619 
just rubber and then kind of see the
rubber<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> side<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.849> they<00:02:18.390> just

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
rubber here on the side and they just

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.410 
rubber here on the side and they just
push<00:02:19.440> down<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.980> rubber<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.760> we've<00:02:20.940> got<00:02:21.150> one

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
push down on the rubber so we've got one

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.190 
push down on the rubber so we've got one
located<00:02:21.900> here<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:24.240> other<00:02:24.390> one<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:25.020> and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
located here the other one is here and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.570 
located here the other one is here and
then<00:02:25.650> we've<00:02:25.770> got<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
then we've got one in the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.370 
then we've got one in the
on<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:26.970> side<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.570> one<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> back<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.230> this

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
on this side and one of the back on this

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.320 
on this side and one of the back on this
side<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.370> an<00:02:29.490> easy<00:02:29.640> one<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.030> remove

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
side this is an easy one to remove

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.030 
side this is an easy one to remove
because<00:02:30.480> again<00:02:30.870> these<00:02:31.050> are<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.440> clamps<00:02:31.890> or<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
because again these are just clamps or a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 
because again these are just clamps or a
face<00:02:32.220> like<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.660> push<00:02:33.870> down

face like this and they just push down

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.380 
face like this and they just push down
on<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.620> rubber<00:02:34.920> mounts<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.060> I'll<00:02:36.210> go<00:02:36.360> ahead

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
on the rubber mounts so I'll go ahead

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.820 
on the rubber mounts so I'll go ahead
and<00:02:36.630> get<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.870> removed<00:02:37.260> again<00:02:37.440> we<00:02:37.680> already

got the intake removed sometimes it's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.350 
got the intake removed sometimes it's
easy<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.220> go<00:02:41.460> ahead<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.670> slip<00:02:41.820> your<00:02:42.000> hand<00:02:42.210> in

second<00:02:44.910> casing<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.450> lot<00:02:45.600> easier<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.050> go

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
second casing is a lot easier to go

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.080 
second casing is a lot easier to go
ahead<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.380> remove<00:02:46.500> once<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.790> removed

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.710 
we'll go ahead and resume the video all
right<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.150> looks<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.480> once

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
right so this is what it looks like once

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.570 
right so this is what it looks like once

a<00:03:39.260> t25<00:03:40.260> star<00:03:41.160> key<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:42.780> purchased<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.709> set<00:03:44.239> here

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
a t25 star key I purchased this set here

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.640 
a t25 star key I purchased this set here
at<00:03:46.200> my<00:03:46.380> local<00:03:46.650> Home<00:03:46.980> Depot<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.660> believe<00:03:49.470> it

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
at my local Home Depot and I believe it

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.030 
at my local Home Depot and I believe it
was<00:03:50.030> seven<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.209> nine<00:03:51.390> dollars<00:03:51.890> again<00:03:52.890> if<00:03:52.980> you

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
was seven to nine dollars again if you

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.430 
was seven to nine dollars again if you
do<00:03:53.160> anything<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.760> car<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.810> will<00:03:54.959> need<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
do anything on the car you will need the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.160 
do anything on the car you will need the
star<00:03:56.010> key<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:57.540> obviously<00:03:57.870> it's<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.050> good

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
star key so obviously it's a good

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.470 
star key so obviously it's a good
investment

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
investment

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.009 
investment
alright<00:04:00.709> once<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.890> get<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.600> housing<00:04:03.600> removed

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019
