I'm having everyone back from last

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
I'm having everyone back from last
year's<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> privilege<00:00:59.940> that<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.270> every<00:01:00.660> team

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
year's a privilege that not every team

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.429 
year's a privilege that not every team
has<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.420> also<00:01:03.570> adding<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.110> new<00:01:04.229> guy

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
has and and we are also adding a new guy

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
has and and we are also adding a new guy
which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.100> quality<00:01:05.519> player<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.030> I'm<00:01:06.119> sure

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
which is a quality player and I'm sure

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
which is a quality player and I'm sure
he's<00:01:06.479> gonna<00:01:06.659> make<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.470> make<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> team<00:01:08.280> even

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
he's gonna make the make the team even

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
he's gonna make the make the team even
better<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.049> take

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
better so I think we have to take

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.230 
better so I think we have to take
advantage<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.850> pretty<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
advantage of that it was pretty much a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.580 
advantage of that it was pretty much a
wholesome<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.689> said<00:01:12.840> we've<00:01:12.990> been<00:01:13.020> working

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
wholesome I said we've been working

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.090 
wholesome I said we've been working
really<00:01:13.799> hard<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.720> conditioning<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.100> giving

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
really hard on conditioning and giving

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.160 
really hard on conditioning and giving
tennis<00:01:18.060> second<00:01:19.280> priority<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.790> now<00:01:20.990> it's<00:01:21.990> much

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
tennis second priority so now it's much

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.410 
tennis second priority so now it's much
more<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.650> hitting<00:01:23.430> all<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> balls<00:01:23.909> making

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
more about hitting all the balls making

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.310 
more about hitting all the balls making
a<00:01:24.630> wall<00:01:25.080> making<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> lot<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.070> adjustments<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
a wall making a lot of adjustments and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.050 
a wall making a lot of adjustments and
just<00:01:28.320> try<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.710> more<00:01:28.890> consistent<00:01:29.220> we're

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
just try to be more consistent we're

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.060 
just try to be more consistent we're
really<00:01:30.210> trying<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> make<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> sweet<00:01:31.380> 16<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
really trying to make to the sweet 16 I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
really trying to make to the sweet 16 I
think<00:01:32.700> that's<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> main<00:01:33.299> goal<00:01:33.329> you're<00:01:33.930> all

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
think that's the main goal you're all

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
think that's the main goal you're all
working<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:34.950> hard<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.579> together<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.939> yeah

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
working really hard to together and yeah

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
working really hard to together and yeah
as<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> team<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.110> main<00:01:40.320> thing<00:01:40.369> it's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
as a team I think the main thing it's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.830 
as a team I think the main thing it's
going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> straight-6<00:01:42.299> making<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
going to the straight-6 making to the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.670 
going to the straight-6 making to the
sweet<00:01:43.079> 16<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.479> just<00:01:45.479> continue<00:01:46.259> playing

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
sweet 16 and then just continue playing

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.370 
sweet 16 and then just continue playing
good<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.189> maybe<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.380> Final

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
good there and maybe I don't know Final

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.999 
good there and maybe I don't know Final
Four<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:50.520> year<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.649> sweet<00:01:52.649> 16<00:01:52.770> is

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
Four this year I think the sweet 16 is

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.580 
Four this year I think the sweet 16 is
not<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> goal<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.850> already<00:01:54.439> see<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
not a goal you know I already see is

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.050 
not a goal you know I already see is
there<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.009> don't<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:56.729> want<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
there I don't I don't I don't want that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.700 
there I don't I don't I don't want that
you<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.960> want<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.380> than<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
you know as I go I want more than that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.679 
you know as I go I want more than that
and<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.399> anything<00:02:00.119> less<00:02:00.420> than<00:02:00.570> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and I think that anything less than a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
and I think that anything less than a
top<00:02:01.049> 10<00:02:01.259> ranking<00:02:01.710> would<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.640> little

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
top 10 ranking would be a little

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.340 
top 10 ranking would be a little
disappointing<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.570> me<00:02:03.600> because<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.960> think

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
disappointing for me because I think

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.380 
disappointing for me because I think
these<00:02:04.439> guys<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.340> good<00:02:05.549> players<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.149> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
these guys are really good players and I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.850 
these guys are really good players and I
think<00:02:06.659> our<00:02:06.780> team<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.020> really<00:02:07.110> ready<00:02:07.409> to
