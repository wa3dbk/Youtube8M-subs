00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
to do what does it do this whole idea

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.740 
to do what does it do this whole idea
was<00:00:38.460> pretty<00:00:38.700> much<00:00:38.879> left<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> darkness

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
was pretty much left in the darkness

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.209 
was pretty much left in the darkness
when<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.140> figured<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> second<00:00:41.010> song

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
when we figured out the second song

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
when we figured out the second song
everyone<00:00:41.579> left<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> behind<00:00:42.149> didn't<00:00:42.660> really

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
everyone left it behind didn't really

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.690 
everyone left it behind didn't really
care<00:00:43.050> about<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> thought<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.489> silly

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
care about it thought it was just silly

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060 
care about it thought it was just silly
and<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.420> game<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.530> honestly

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and just in the game but I honestly

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.860 
and just in the game but I honestly
think<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.879> could<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> start<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
think that this could be the start of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
think that this could be the start of
maybe<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.410> new<00:00:49.770> easter<00:00:50.129> egg<00:00:50.280> or<00:00:50.460> something

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
maybe a new easter egg or something

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.729 
maybe a new easter egg or something
hidden<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> game<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
hidden in the game because this is the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.170 
hidden in the game because this is the
way<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> look<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> game<00:00:53.760> has<00:00:53.910> been<00:00:54.030> out

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
way I look at it the game has been out

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.080 
way I look at it the game has been out
for<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> week<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.460> we<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.850> we

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
for what a week now and we think that we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
for what a week now and we think that we
found<00:00:57.329> every<00:00:57.719> easter<00:00:58.140> egg<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.469> because

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
found every easter egg right because

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
found every easter egg right because
we've<00:00:59.129> pretty<00:00:59.370> much<00:00:59.460> found<00:00:59.879> everything<00:01:00.300> that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
we've pretty much found everything that

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.750 
we've pretty much found everything that
you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.379> i<00:01:01.620> honestly<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.520> there's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you can do but i honestly think there's

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
you can do but i honestly think there's
still<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.210> i<00:01:03.420> mean<00:01:03.690> i'm<00:01:03.870> sure<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
still more i mean i'm sure a lot of you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
still more i mean i'm sure a lot of you
guys<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.799> too<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.220> there's<00:01:05.670> got<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> be<00:01:06.060> more

there's<00:01:06.570> no<00:01:06.750> way<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> treyarch<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.740> let

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there's no way that treyarch would let

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.530 
there's no way that treyarch would let

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
there is a clock on the wall and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.800 
there is a clock on the wall and
everyone's<00:02:08.099> seen<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.429> clock<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.209> don't

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
everyone's seen this clock but I don't

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.540 
everyone's seen this clock but I don't
know<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:09.989> you've<00:02:10.110> noticed<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
know if you've noticed but this is the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.309 
know if you've noticed but this is the
only<00:02:11.580> clock<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> whole<00:02:12.660> map<00:02:12.900> where<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
only clock in the whole map where the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.979 
only clock in the whole map where the
ticker<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.680> moving<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:15.269> clock<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.540> set

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
ticker is moving and the clock is set

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.129 
ticker is moving and the clock is set
for<00:02:16.319> 115<00:02:17.219> and<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:18.060> ticker<00:02:18.299> keeps<00:02:18.659> moving

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
for 115 and the ticker keeps moving

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.349 
for 115 and the ticker keeps moving
about<00:02:19.469> 12<00:02:19.799> seconds<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.430> resets<00:02:20.909> moves

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
about 12 seconds and in a resets moves

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.319 
about 12 seconds and in a resets moves
12<00:02:21.629> seconds<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.079> reset<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.739> it's<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.129> much

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
12 seconds to reset so it's pretty much

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.089 
12 seconds to reset so it's pretty much
showing<00:02:24.329> that<00:02:24.719> the<00:02:24.840> clock<00:02:25.079> will<00:02:25.319> always<00:02:25.709> be<00:02:25.950> on

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
showing that the clock will always be on

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.369 
showing that the clock will always be on
115<00:02:26.790> which<00:02:27.569> i<00:02:27.719> think<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.989> kind<00:02:28.109> of<00:02:28.260> cool

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
115 which i think is kind of cool

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.349 
115 which i think is kind of cool
because<00:02:28.620> we<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:29.579> know<00:02:29.700> what's<00:02:29.969> up<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
because we don't know what's up with the

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.330 
because we don't know what's up with the
element<00:02:30.659> 115<00:02:30.959> we<00:02:31.709> don't<00:02:31.829> know<00:02:31.980> where<00:02:32.129> it's<00:02:32.219> at

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
element 115 we don't know where it's at

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.849 
element 115 we don't know where it's at
we<00:02:32.519> haven't<00:02:32.760> seen<00:02:32.939> it<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.239> this<00:02:33.359> game<00:02:33.599> yet<00:02:33.859> and

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
we haven't seen it in this game yet and

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.420 
we haven't seen it in this game yet and
it's<00:02:35.430> been<00:02:35.700> used<00:02:36.109> on<00:02:37.109> the<00:02:37.739> number<00:02:37.950> dial<00:02:38.099> things

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
it's been used on the number dial things

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.089 
it's been used on the number dial things
in<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> cave<00:02:39.079> to<00:02:40.079> get<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.379> devil's<00:02:40.650> attention

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
in the cave to get the devil's attention

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.089 
in the cave to get the devil's attention
so<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.969> could<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.419> mean<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.799> there<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:43.950> an

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
so so could this mean that there is an

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.250 
so so could this mean that there is an
element<00:02:44.219> 115<00:02:44.790> easter<00:02:45.450> egg<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.750> don't<00:02:45.930> know<00:02:46.049> I
