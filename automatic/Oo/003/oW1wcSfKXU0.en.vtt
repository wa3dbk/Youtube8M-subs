00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
ways so we'll kind of line them in here

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.160 
ways so we'll kind of line them in here
on<00:00:46.020> angles<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.550> angles<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.329> they're<00:00:49.020> run

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
on angles on angles so that they're run

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.510 
on angles on angles so that they're run
in<00:00:49.289> different<00:00:49.379> directions<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.340> how<00:00:50.460> we

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
in different directions but how we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
in different directions but how we
secure<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.050> want<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> fix<00:00:52.469> our

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
secure that so that we want to fix our

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.439 
secure that so that we want to fix our
angles<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.280> by<00:00:53.460> using<00:00:53.690> Oasis<00:00:54.690> floral<00:00:55.649> foam<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
angles is by using Oasis floral foam a

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.229 
angles is by using Oasis floral foam a
foam<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.629> waits<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.170> which<00:00:58.559> holds<00:00:59.039> water

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
foam that waits in which holds water

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.720 
foam that waits in which holds water
which<00:01:00.239> keeps<00:01:00.480> flowers<00:01:00.840> alive<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.590> we'll<00:01:02.370> go<00:01:02.489> in

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
which keeps flowers alive so we'll go in

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.299 
which keeps flowers alive so we'll go in
with<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.439> you<00:01:04.439> kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.799> slide<00:01:05.070> your

vase down below well do that one on an

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.789 
vase down below well do that one on an
angle<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.810> I'm<00:01:09.810> gonna<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.170> slide<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
angle there I'm gonna then slide that

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.109 
angle there I'm gonna then slide that
over<00:01:11.540> to<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.689> another<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.110> down<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:14.119> then

over to get another one down here then

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.219 
over to get another one down here then
let's<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.659> go<00:01:16.580> another<00:01:17.580> angle<00:01:18.119> down<00:01:19.049> from

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
let's see we go another angle down from

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.490 
let's see we go another angle down from
there<00:01:20.270> then<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.600> want<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> one
