00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.630

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.520

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.410
 of a friend of my sister who knows everything 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.730
 on this series and that was it 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.710
 kind to provide me all 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.600
 information on it and help me 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.670
 write the review so thank you 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.649
 a thousand for your help 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.850
 let's start now with today's term 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.739
 term I will talk about today is 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.960
 closely related to the nime I say that 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.379
 I will speak shortly about the term 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.449
 but game but it was out of joe that 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.760
 literally it means magic girl 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.859
 also called but game which means 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.539
 little witch is a term that in the 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.059
 otaku culture indicates a specific one 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.999
 kind of anime and manga in which 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.440
 animation lines are merged 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:06.350
 mainly sentimental with aspects 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.000
 fantasy in particular with magic 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.560
 the anime I want to talk about is part of it 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 under this genus only for the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.890
 fact that the protagonists are 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.750
 brands but does not inherit anything else from 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.640
 this kind indeed the soul in 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.189
 issue has been classified as but 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.350
 school drama and horror game 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.229
 although my opinion of horror to very little 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.430
 if nothing, I'm talking about a mouse 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.280
 giorgio madoka magic 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.229
 or the magic magoka where magic 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.649
 that magi means nothing but 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.899
 magic girl in latin magic moka is 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.409
 unanimous 12 episodes of 2011 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.539
 produced by sharp and aniplex from the series 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.969
 the first three films were also taken 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.619
 two summaries with technical changes e 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.570
 the third completely new that 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.649
 will land in Japanese theaters on the 26th 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.899
 October 2013 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.060
 the series was licensed by the 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.159
 by nyt so you will not find the links to 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.499
 download on animeclick point it as to 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.329
 episodes are usually words for i 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.229
 vile looking online or in Japanese 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.240
 that in Italian 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.890
 if you want to watch them in streaming 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.039
 you can find them subtitled in 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.470
 Italian on the popcorn tv site of which 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.759
 find the link in the description of the anime 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.770
 has had no small success 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.200
 in fact the first film was screened 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.530
 even at the cinema in Italy 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.300
 June 26, 2013 unfortunately I do not 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.860
 I still saw the anime so it's not 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.720
 I got interested and didn't go to 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.459
 see the big mistake movie since 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.709
 none of the three films can be found on 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.750
 Internet 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.580
 there is also the manga published madoka 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.920
 from panini comics that summarizes the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.950
 story and two spin offs or magic rich and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.620
 magic kazumi also 16 from sandwiches comics 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.930
 there is also a third manga called the 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.120
 different story in which the story is told 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.080
 history in the event that a claim is not 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.080
 had occurred 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.290
 there is an extraterrestrial operator 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.330
 equipped with the power to fulfill a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.880
 wish expressed by a teenager for 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.290
 chosen in case the young person decides to 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.330
 accept the proposal the price from 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.500
 to pay is to become a sorceress who had to 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.990
 fight for the rest of your life 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.850
 against the witches responsible for 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.730
 violent deaths and suicides that 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.100
 affecting the world manduca canam ee 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.080
 sayaka mickey friends and companions of 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.390
 middle school class meet one 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.790
 of these creatures of cube names that with 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.870
 the help of the sorceress but myth but offers them 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.300
 the possibility of creating a 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.850
 desire and become mag and another 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.470
 maga homura akemi tries however in all 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.200
 ways to dissuade but will have to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.030
 enter into the contract with kewei madoka 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.500
 you will soon discover that you are one 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.070
 mother is much more complex than that 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.959
 you look 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.950
 and who becomes and condemned by one 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.950
 life without hope 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.300
 graphically this soul is very well 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.980
 made especially for how much 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.600
 it's about fighting 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.040
 the anime uses two graphic Syrians 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.300
 completely different 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.910
 the first is what we can define 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.860
 standard with good quality 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.050
 general Berium characters 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.430
 good quality food only 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.990
 precisely what I can do concerns the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.230
 eyes of the characters they are 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.490
 deliberately rendered as hostile but quoted 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.190
 personally I prefer the style of 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.660
 shining eyes to the ain gelmuzzi the second 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.130
 graphic style is the one used for 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.750
 represent within the world 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.579
 these places of witches 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.769
 they look like pieces of objects 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.260
 real that move and form the walls 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.400
 the floors and enemies 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.110
 this is in stark contrast to the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.780
 character design forming one 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.430
 strange fusion of these two styles 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.050
 this style includes insertion 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.000
 of rai objects within the soul is 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.640
 typical of the chart and it can be observed 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.380
 in many of his shaft works he is also 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.970
 famous for its stuffed direction of 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.490
 seemingly useless shots e 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.370
 fast as in bakemonogatari that though 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.169
 they are not very present in this im 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.030
 these particular settings are 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.229
 also enclosed secret messages that 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.710
 the authors have left for the 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.750
 public 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.729
 some users have deciphered these 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.290
 messages and found that yes 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.080
 provide additional information on 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.330
 plot and characters over references 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.919
 to numerous other years and to works 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.770
 artistic and literary as well as 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.790
 historical references of real life 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.680
 as for the audio I have 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.570
 enjoyed the soundtrack that yes 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.040
 adapts perfectly to the instructions e 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.080
 the opening that I added mine 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.710
 personal playlist regarding 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.390
 dubbing 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.130
 personally i tender it will be anime in 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.229
 Japanese and as usual the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.550
 high quality and quality dubbing 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.470
 then I went to look at some 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.020
 Italian clips and I must say that later 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.090
 Italian is really well done among other things 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.710
 to the doublets c of the protagonists are 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.600
 have been chosen by some 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.620
 Site animeclick point fans 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.620
 through a survey 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.020
 many people stop at the appearance o 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.850
 better at the poster of the soul and it 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.160
 discard regardless of thinking yes 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.230
 it's the usual but not childish game 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.060
 knowing that instead madoka does magic 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.320
 exception also contributed to 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.030
 raise a genre but play 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.950
 he had continually run aground 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.140
 really very childish productions like 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.820
 miu miu and the like 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.620
 on the contrary I go between a lot of plot 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.120
 more mature than any other but 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.280
 game in circulation 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.320
 unfortunately this defect if they rome 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.520
 plays can be called a defect causes 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.810
 this manga anime watched 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.030
 mainly by women 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.650
 while in reality it may be in my opinion 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.300
 I look very well on anyone 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.910
 indeed perhaps it would be better to avoid 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.230
 show it too small children 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.330
 in conclusion the myths all look on 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.010
 this year and not to judge him after 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.110
 first two bets that are slightly 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.180
 the subdued sure that there is none 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.190
 you will regret and you will be pleasantly 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.640
 surprised also this video reaches the 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.260
 term 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.090
 invitation to know long and I like is a 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.870
 comment you live and we have to do with the 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.870
 next hello 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.309
 no 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.910
 Yup
