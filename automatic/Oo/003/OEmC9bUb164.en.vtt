00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
the eight-foot jib-boom you can see the

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.559 
the eight-foot jib-boom you can see the
independent<00:00:04.560> pan<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.520> tilt<00:00:05.569> actuate

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
independent pan and the tilt actuate

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.180 
independent pan and the tilt actuate
aright<00:00:06.839> there<00:00:07.580> it's<00:00:08.580> full<00:00:08.849> swivel<00:00:10.040> it's<00:00:11.040> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
aright there it's full swivel it's a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.400 
aright there it's full swivel it's a
pretty<00:00:11.460> long<00:00:11.820> boom<00:00:12.240> as<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.660> home<00:00:12.840> built<00:00:13.139> boom

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
pretty long boom as at home built boom

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.709 
pretty long boom as at home built boom
goes<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.190> she<00:00:14.519> goes<00:00:14.549> all<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> way<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
goes and she goes all the way up to the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.170 
goes and she goes all the way up to the
top<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.310> an<00:00:17.310> 8<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:18.150> from<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> pivot<00:00:19.880> yeah

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
top it's an 8 but from the pivot yeah

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.230 
top it's an 8 but from the pivot yeah
8<00:00:22.080> foot<00:00:22.350> from<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> pivot<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> head

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
8 foot from the pivot to the to the head

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.290 
8 foot from the pivot to the to the head
the<00:00:24.600> hot<00:00:24.840> head<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.289> there<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.949> then<00:00:26.789> that's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the hot head out there and then that's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.779 
the hot head out there and then that's
probably<00:00:27.510> an<00:00:27.750> additional<00:00:28.289> 3<00:00:29.160> feet<00:00:29.400> from<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
probably an additional 3 feet from the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.170 
probably an additional 3 feet from the
pedestal<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> pivot<00:00:31.380> point<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.090> until<00:00:33.090> you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
pedestal to the pivot point so until you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.389 
pedestal to the pivot point so until you
get<00:00:33.950> about<00:00:34.950> 10<00:00:35.070> feet<00:00:35.610> let's<00:00:35.910> say<00:00:36.059> practically

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
get about 10 feet let's say practically

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.660 
get about 10 feet let's say practically
anyways<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.850> try<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> pan<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.079> tilt<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.670> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
anyways so try the pan and tilt there to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.060 
anyways so try the pan and tilt there to
demonstrate<00:00:41.790> how<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.510> works

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
demonstrate how that works

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
demonstrate how that works
there's<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.370> camera<00:00:45.210> down<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.489> pan<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
there's no camera down and then pan a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.279 
there's no camera down and then pan a
lot<00:00:48.450> right<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:50.489> fully<00:00:50.910> independent<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
lot right and I'm fully independent so

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.350 
lot right and I'm fully independent so
this<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.699> should<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.030> pretty

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
this you get they should get pretty

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
this you get they should get pretty
interesting<00:00:54.600> shots<00:00:55.079> I'll<00:00:55.320> show<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.590> how<00:00:55.739> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
interesting shots I'll show you how it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.420 
interesting shots I'll show you how it
works<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.379> down<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.590> there's<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
works so you can see down here there's a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
works so you can see down here there's a
pulley<00:00:59.699> for<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> pan<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.140> tilt<00:01:01.770> morash

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
