00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello with you 2d this video i do for 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.299
 the fact that you worry about the current generation 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.820
 gamers begin to get to know the world in 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.920
 der all mass effect elias those three 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.590
 you will agree that we were luckier 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.929
 after all, we played dandy in Seoul as a child 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.210
 and those games made us sweat and 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.300
 many we have not gone and now 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.529
 gamers have everything so easy for 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.990
 friday evening oh chick take and go 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.390
 the game so I will begin my narration 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.220
 with a rather difficult game of street of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.260
 range 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.630
 so what does this game meet us 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:40.920
 fucking music at the time and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:44.280
 good screen saver go to the choice of players 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.980
 we have here 3 cop and adam boxer who 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.969
 I remember in 10 as a dude who 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.260
 screaming two cans laughed at them 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.469
 they said he was screaming 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.469
 here 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.589
 and also we have karate aksel and 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.320
 chick you have a kabule 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.650
 I will choose the axis I will be racist myself on 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.650
 the street 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.710
 until i pass the first level i 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.070
 I'll tell you that all three hero is different from 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.530
 Arsha not all but slower all 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.710
 place is the fastest but weaker 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.110
 those actin is the most average character 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.539
 run through the plot as it is 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.640
 classic beatmap we need to win 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.009
 all small thugs along the way and 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.390
 drink the boss at the end after win 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.060
 the most important villain 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.789
 as you see our opponents usual 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.810
 punks some cans in childhood i think 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.500
 what are these turtles 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.470
 do with whips and a bunch of other dudes 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.219
 which changes how much the color of clothes in 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.659
 the game has a weapon . 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:02.359
 shirt and that for life decree 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.700
 need or score points bestowing to the right and 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.909
 left fists or find life they 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.800
 quite rare 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.340
 to set the scale of life you need 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.340
 Are there apples or something like that? 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.740
 they usually lie near the boss or planted 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.620
 and not very lines 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.480
 Well, we got to the boss and there is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.750
 own feature if you play one 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.880
 the boss 1st safe two or even bosses 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.890
 answer 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.190
 by the way there is something like super reception 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.380
 press a button and jumps like a shoot 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.330
 out of anything while your enemies 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.880
 paralyzed and starts a little 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.180
 dance style i really need to 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.140
 toilet and of course they get 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.510
 from this lesson 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.480
 And now a little about the passage on Kate 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.920
 courtyard 1 through 4 you are less easy 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.580
 go through the game 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.550
 We then a little weaker and that's not all 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.069
 horseradish and similar to the fifth level 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.860
 proof of length and all previous 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.530
 we were called a bunch of enemies are attacking you 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.319
 simple bosses appears squealing women 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.880
 who are just not pedari 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.790
 superior you play one boss all 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.190
 equal to level 2 but 6 is more 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.590
 strong enemies and freaking platforms 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.290
 which pull the last to reflect either to 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.500
 bother him to keep your distance naturally 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.410
 you get on scham seventh level is 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.890
 beaten wanting though simple you him 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.920
 hardly minutes 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.530
 after all, and the eighth level and he 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.319
 the final will just burst your brain 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.930
 and ass there are few ordinary enemies but 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.959
 here are all previous bosses like 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.100
 original but as they say on the body 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.070
 shopping and 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.980
 and that's not all the main enemies here 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:55.220
 there will be many very many r2 d2 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.080
 this is a turn and I will not reach my apogee 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.060
 show you the level with the boss sheet 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.220
 show the picture to warm your 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.440
 appetite and I will say that you are waiting for a small 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.200
 dialogue with the boss where you can choose 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.200
 answer option and and you can see 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.120
 cool ending summing up I will say 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.860
 that the passage of the game takes an hour 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.560
 time well of course if you play 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.600
 together but from the first time you and FIG 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.720
 go through and for that I really love the old 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.520
 games, that's all I want to pass you this game 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.520
 and hope you enjoyed my little 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.960
 leap past with you was 2d his old 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.960
