hello everybody today I'm going to show
you<00:00:08.900> how<00:00:09.050> to<00:00:09.230> fix<00:00:09.590> problems<00:00:10.160> that<00:00:10.580> are

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
you how to fix problems that are

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.940 
you how to fix problems that are
associated<00:00:11.030> with<00:00:11.510> your<00:00:11.660> cd-rom<00:00:12.139> drive

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
associated with your cd-rom drive

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.460 
associated with your cd-rom drive
whether<00:00:13.820> it's<00:00:14.110> not<00:00:15.110> playing<00:00:15.440> cds<00:00:16.070> or<00:00:16.640> it's

whether it's not playing cds or it's

whether it's not playing cds or it's
just<00:00:18.470> not<00:00:18.619> functioning<00:00:19.160> properly<00:00:19.190> or<00:00:20.060> as<00:00:20.390> it

just not functioning properly or as it

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.220 
just not functioning properly or as it
functioning<00:00:21.230> like<00:00:21.349> it<00:00:21.529> used<00:00:21.740> to<00:00:23.050> more<00:00:24.050> often

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
functioning like it used to more often

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.099 
functioning like it used to more often
than<00:00:24.500> not<00:00:24.789> the<00:00:25.789> problem<00:00:26.240> is<00:00:26.630> likely

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
than not the problem is likely

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.779 
than not the problem is likely
associated<00:00:27.529> with<00:00:28.160> your<00:00:28.849> cd-rom<00:00:29.800> drivers<00:00:30.800> now

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
associated with your cd-rom drivers now

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.910 
associated with your cd-rom drivers now
the<00:00:31.849> driver<00:00:32.240> essentially<00:00:32.960> acts<00:00:33.170> as<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.440> conduit

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
the driver essentially acts as a conduit

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.460 
the driver essentially acts as a conduit
between<00:00:34.750> your<00:00:35.750> system<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:38.140> CD<00:00:39.140> device

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
between your system and the CD device

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.010 
between your system and the CD device
itself<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.420> when<00:00:41.420> there's<00:00:41.630> something<00:00:41.810> wrong

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
itself and when there's something wrong

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.570 
itself and when there's something wrong
with<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:42.290> driver<00:00:42.530> whether<00:00:42.830> it's<00:00:43.010> out<00:00:43.190> of<00:00:43.220> date

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
with the driver whether it's out of date

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.450 
with the driver whether it's out of date
it's<00:00:43.820> missing<00:00:44.270> corrupt<00:00:44.920> this<00:00:45.920> will<00:00:46.190> cause

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
it's missing corrupt this will cause

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.580 
it's missing corrupt this will cause
your<00:00:46.940> cd-rom<00:00:47.360> drive<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:48.080> not<00:00:48.230> function

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
your cd-rom drive to not function

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.400 
your cd-rom drive to not function
properly<00:00:49.450> so<00:00:50.450> essentially<00:00:50.810> what<00:00:50.990> you<00:00:51.110> have<00:00:51.260> to

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
properly so essentially what you have to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.720 
properly so essentially what you have to
do<00:00:51.560> is<00:00:51.920> install<00:00:53.050> updated<00:00:54.050> drivers<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:55.610> this

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
do is install updated drivers that this

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.460 
do is install updated drivers that this
is<00:00:55.820> actually<00:00:55.940> more<00:00:56.270> difficult<00:00:56.780> than<00:00:57.410> it

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
is actually more difficult than it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.580 
is actually more difficult than it
sounds<00:00:57.740> to<00:00:58.460> do<00:00:58.640> manually<00:00:59.420> because<00:00:59.690> it<00:01:00.440> can

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
sounds to do manually because it can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.590 
sounds to do manually because it can
often<00:01:00.710> be<00:01:00.890> very<00:01:00.950> hard<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.670> not<00:01:02.000> only<00:01:02.090> find<00:01:02.390> the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
often be very hard to not only find the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.160 
often be very hard to not only find the
correct<00:01:02.840> driver<00:01:03.170> but<00:01:03.980> also<00:01:04.159> find<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.540> driver

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
correct driver but also find a driver

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.960 
correct driver but also find a driver
that<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.710> going<00:01:06.860> to<00:01:06.920> match<00:01:07.130> your<00:01:07.730> specific

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
that is going to match your specific

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.470 
that is going to match your specific
system<00:01:09.040> specifications<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.370> you<00:01:11.180> really

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
system specifications and you really

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.030 
system specifications and you really
don't<00:01:11.660> want<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.900> install<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.350> wrong<00:01:12.500> drivers

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
don't want to install the wrong drivers

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.740 
don't want to install the wrong drivers
because<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:13.760> will<00:01:13.940> just<00:01:14.060> cause<00:01:14.300> more

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
because this will just cause more

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.910 
because this will just cause more
problems<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.530> you're<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.370> have<00:01:16.520> right<00:01:16.760> now

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
problems and you're you have right now

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.680 
problems and you're you have right now
the<00:01:18.920> best<00:01:19.130> thing<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.370> do<00:01:19.610> is<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:19.940> get<00:01:20.420> what's

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
the best thing to do is to get what's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.840 
the best thing to do is to get what's
called<00:01:20.900> driver<00:01:21.320> update<00:01:21.860> software<00:01:22.190> what<00:01:22.670> this

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
called driver update software what this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.200 
called driver update software what this
does<00:01:23.120> is<00:01:23.480> it<00:01:23.540> scans<00:01:24.200> your<00:01:24.350> system<00:01:25.210> it'll

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
does is it scans your system it'll

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.330 
does is it scans your system it'll
update<00:01:26.390> your<00:01:26.720> CD<00:01:27.050> drivers<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:27.890> it's<00:01:28.130> going<00:01:28.280> to

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
update your CD drivers and it's going to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.180 
update your CD drivers and it's going to
match<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:29.690> drivers<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.500> your<00:01:30.620> specific

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
match the drivers to your specific

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.390 
match the drivers to your specific
system<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.790> ensure<00:01:32.229> complete<00:01:33.229> compatibility

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.690 

so<00:01:37.400> what<00:01:37.640> we'll<00:01:37.760> do<00:01:37.880> here<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.360> go<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.870> the

drivers<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.520> red<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:10.500> essentially<00:03:11.070> going

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
drivers in the red so essentially going

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.760 
drivers in the red so essentially going

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
and the ones and the yellow so if we're

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.870 
and the ones and the yellow so if we're
looking<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.210> update<00:03:18.420> our<00:03:18.890> cd-rom<00:03:19.890> drivers<00:03:20.700> I

looking to update our cd-rom drivers I

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.660 
looking to update our cd-rom drivers I
would<00:03:21.030> just<00:03:21.210> simply<00:03:21.390> go<00:03:21.720> down<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.500> CD<00:03:23.430> ROMs

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
would just simply go down to the CD ROMs

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.490 
would just simply go down to the CD ROMs
section<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:26.480> mine<00:03:27.480> are<00:03:27.510> actually<00:03:28.020> up<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.290> date
