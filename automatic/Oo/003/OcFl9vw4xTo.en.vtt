00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
Coleman exponent Libra x1 and x2 10th

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.000 
Coleman exponent Libra x1 and x2 10th
they're<00:00:14.420> fast<00:00:14.660> pitching<00:00:15.109> tents<00:00:15.379> both<00:00:15.709> share

they're fast pitching tents both share
exactly<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.460> same<00:00:16.640> features<00:00:16.910> but<00:00:17.150> obviously

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
exactly the same features but obviously

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.210 
exactly the same features but obviously
this<00:00:17.600> is<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:17.810> single<00:00:18.170> birth<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:19.100> one

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
this is a single birth and the one

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.820 
this is a single birth and the one
behind<00:00:19.460> me<00:00:19.609> there<00:00:19.820> is<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.119> a<00:00:20.330> twin<00:00:20.779> birth<00:00:20.990> let's

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
of the external features we've got on

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.689 
of the external features we've got on
the<00:00:26.030> tent<00:00:26.270> then<00:00:26.470> it's<00:00:27.470> a<00:00:27.619> quick<00:00:28.039> picture<00:00:28.340> tent

or<00:00:28.789> a<00:00:28.850> pitch<00:00:29.029> in<00:00:29.180> one<00:00:29.420> design<00:00:29.750> they<00:00:29.930> use<00:00:30.170> using

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
or a pitch in one design they use using

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.740 
or a pitch in one design they use using
these<00:00:31.250> numbered<00:00:31.640> points<00:00:31.970> around<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.480> tent

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
these numbered points around the tent

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.020 
these numbered points around the tent
makes<00:00:32.960> it<00:00:33.109> really<00:00:33.320> easy<00:00:33.559> to<00:00:33.680> put<00:00:33.949> up<00:00:34.190> following

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
makes it really easy to put up following

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.610 
makes it really easy to put up following
the<00:00:35.149> numbers<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:35.690> pop<00:00:35.870> in<00:00:36.020> your<00:00:36.050> tent<00:00:36.350> pegs

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:40.069 
then by using this t6 aluminium pole

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:41.439 
then by using this t6 aluminium pole
which<00:00:40.249> is<00:00:40.399> permanently<00:00:40.819> attached<00:00:41.149> to<00:00:41.359> the

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
which is permanently attached to the

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.689

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.910 
tent itself you can put on the red tag
making<00:00:44.269> it<00:00:44.449> quick<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:44.809> easy<00:00:44.929> to<00:00:45.170> erect<00:00:45.440> which

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
making it quick and easy to erect which

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.319 
making it quick and easy to erect which

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
setup here this is actually suspended

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.450 
setup here this is actually suspended
separately<00:01:27.050> from<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.290> external<00:01:27.620> fly<00:01:28.100> sheet

separately from the external fly sheet
this<00:01:28.910> is<00:01:28.970> great<00:01:29.240> for<00:01:29.390> ventilation<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.560> also

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
this is great for ventilation and also

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.280 
this is great for ventilation and also
keeps<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.220> condensation<00:01:31.520> away<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.290> nice

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
keeps that condensation away a nice

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
zipped up we then have a a mosquito net

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.160 
zipped up we then have a a mosquito net
there<00:01:40.970> as<00:01:41.120> well<00:01:41.300> it's<00:01:41.510> just<00:01:41.540> keeps<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.020> bugs
