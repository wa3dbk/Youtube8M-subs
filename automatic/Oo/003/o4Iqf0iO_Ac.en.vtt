this<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.209> more<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.630> guideline<00:03:30.930> because<00:03:31.590> if<00:03:31.890> I

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
this is more of a guideline because if I

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.140 
this is more of a guideline because if I
show<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.220> whole<00:03:32.340> thing<00:03:32.490> would<00:03:32.580> be<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:32.730> 15

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
show the whole thing would be like 15

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.520 
show the whole thing would be like 15
minutes<00:03:33.420> long<00:03:33.540> which<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:33.990> completely

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
minutes long which is completely

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.570 
minutes long which is completely
unnecessary<00:03:35.480> considering<00:03:36.950> how<00:03:37.950> easy<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.459> is

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
unnecessary considering how easy it is

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.550 
unnecessary considering how easy it is
