seven servings in this container and
I'll<00:00:39.730> tell<00:00:39.940> you<00:00:40.030> how<00:00:40.180> I<00:00:40.210> do<00:00:40.450> it<00:00:40.810> I<00:00:44.010> figure<00:00:45.010> this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
I'll tell you how I do it I figure this

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.270 
I'll tell you how I do it I figure this
if<00:00:45.730> you<00:00:45.970> split<00:00:46.330> this<00:00:46.630> way<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.590> you<00:00:47.680> split<00:00:47.950> this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
if you split this way and you split this

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.170 
if you split this way and you split this
way<00:00:48.550> you've<00:00:49.180> got<00:00:50.130> one<00:00:51.130> two<00:00:51.310> three<00:00:51.340> four<00:00:51.730> five

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
way you've got one two three four five

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.690 
way you've got one two three four five
six<00:00:52.390> seven<00:00:52.630> eight<00:00:52.870> servings<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:54.310> if<00:00:54.430> you<00:00:54.550> were

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
six seven eight servings so if you were

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.340 
six seven eight servings so if you were
to<00:00:54.850> eat<00:00:55.000> like<00:00:55.300> this<00:00:55.600> little<00:00:55.840> section<00:00:56.320> right

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
to eat like this little section right

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.140 
to eat like this little section right
here<00:00:56.440> you'd<00:00:57.310> have<00:00:57.340> two<00:00:57.910> times<00:00:58.180> 160<00:00:59.140> which<00:00:59.470> is

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
here you'd have two times 160 which is

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.070 
here you'd have two times 160 which is
320<00:01:01.150> but<00:01:01.330> it's<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.450> little<00:01:01.660> less<00:01:01.780> than<00:01:01.930> that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
320 but it's a little less than that

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.300 
320 but it's a little less than that
because<00:01:02.200> it's<00:01:02.500> really<00:01:02.530> you're<00:01:02.860> dividing<00:01:03.040> up

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
because it's really you're dividing up

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.210 
because it's really you're dividing up
in<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.610> till<00:01:04.000> seven<00:01:04.330> so<00:01:04.659> you're<00:01:05.290> probably<00:01:05.409> 250

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
in a till seven so you're probably 250

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.340 
in a till seven so you're probably 250
240<00:01:06.850> calories<00:01:07.030> which<00:01:07.390> is<00:01:07.539> not<00:01:07.719> bad<00:01:07.960> for<00:01:08.320> a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
240 calories which is not bad for a

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.749 
240 calories which is not bad for a
knock<00:01:08.530> time<00:01:08.740> snack<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.340> don't<00:01:09.520> think<00:01:09.609> that's

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
knock time snack so I don't think that's

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.940 
knock time snack so I don't think that's
too<00:01:09.939> bad<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:12.899> gelato<00:01:13.899> has<00:01:14.109> really<00:01:14.560> got<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.740> good

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
too bad and gelato has really got a good

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.690 
too bad and gelato has really got a good
creamy<00:01:15.780> texture<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:17.079> it<00:01:17.109> I<00:01:17.549> wonder<00:01:18.549> if<00:01:18.670> that

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
creamy texture to it I wonder if that

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.029 
creamy texture to it I wonder if that
crumbles<00:01:19.240> just<00:01:19.659> on<00:01:19.840> top<00:01:20.049> it<00:01:20.289> looks<00:01:20.499> like<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.799> is

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
crumbles just on top it looks like it is

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:29.980 
crumbles just on top it looks like it is
be<00:01:21.670> nice<00:01:21.850> if<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.060> was<00:01:22.210> all<00:01:22.450> through<00:01:22.719> there

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.380 

that<00:01:30.650> raspberry<00:01:30.890> is<00:01:31.340> really<00:01:31.880> really<00:01:32.119> good

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
think that'll take away from it I would

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.910 
think that'll take away from it I would
definitely<00:02:30.950> get<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.549> one<00:02:31.700> again<00:02:32.830> like<00:02:33.830> I

by no means healthy food I'm not saying
that<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:48.749> not<00:03:48.870> diet<00:03:49.139> food<00:03:49.439> but<00:03:50.129> if<00:03:50.310> you're

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
that it's not diet food but if you're

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.899 
that it's not diet food but if you're
only<00:03:50.609> watching<00:03:50.939> your<00:03:51.239> calories<00:03:51.629> like<00:03:51.810> we<00:03:51.989> do

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
only watching your calories like we do

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.729 
only watching your calories like we do
it's<00:03:53.909> a<00:03:54.030> lower<00:03:54.269> calorie<00:03:54.599> count<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:55.349> instead<00:03:55.680> of

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
it's a lower calorie count so instead of

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.440 
it's a lower calorie count so instead of
me<00:03:55.829> sitting<00:03:56.040> there<00:03:56.219> eating<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.730> bag<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.150> chips

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.089 
me sitting there eating a bag of chips
or<00:03:57.750> something<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.079> that<00:03:58.349> I'm<00:03:58.530> getting<00:03:59.069> a

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
or something like that I'm getting a

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.879 
or something like that I'm getting a
little<00:03:59.280> lower<00:03:59.549> calorie<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.409> it's<00:04:01.409> good<00:04:01.590> for<00:04:01.620> me

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889
