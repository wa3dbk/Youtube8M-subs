00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
MacBook Pro 2010 model 13-inch this is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
MacBook Pro 2010 model 13-inch this is
the<00:00:21.000> same<00:00:21.330> voice<00:00:21.779> recording<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.470> not<00:00:22.590> me

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the same voice recording is not me

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.960 
the same voice recording is not me
saying<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.220> twice

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
saying it twice

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.420 
saying it twice
I<00:00:24.180> used<00:00:24.359> audacity<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.470> record<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:26.160> and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
I used audacity to record one and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
I used audacity to record one and
ScreenFlow<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.029> record<00:00:27.330> once<00:00:27.510> they're<00:00:27.720> both

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
ScreenFlow to record once they're both

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.470 
ScreenFlow to record once they're both
pretty<00:00:28.650> capable<00:00:28.890> recording<00:00:29.519> softwares<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
pretty capable recording softwares that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.650 
pretty capable recording softwares that
should<00:00:30.840> capture<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.800> full<00:00:32.390> quality<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.480> this

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
should capture the full quality of this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.709 
should capture the full quality of this
so<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> same<00:00:35.610> sentence<00:00:36.210> me<00:00:36.420> saying

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
so this is the same sentence me saying

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.260 
so this is the same sentence me saying
it<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.559> don't<00:00:37.800> don't<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.850> me<00:00:38.969> saying<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it so don't don't think it's me saying a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.430 
it so don't don't think it's me saying a
different<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.660> could<00:00:39.780> change<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
different that could change it this is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.110 
different that could change it this is
the<00:00:40.530> same<00:00:40.770> sentence<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.219> said<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> recorded<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the same sentence I said it recorded it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.979 
the same sentence I said it recorded it
with<00:00:42.149> two<00:00:42.329> applications<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.860> should<00:00:44.190> sound

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
with two applications so it should sound

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
with two applications so it should sound
exactly<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> same<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.190> me<00:00:47.399> talking<00:00:47.730> but

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
exactly the same as in me talking but

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.860 
exactly the same as in me talking but
the<00:00:48.180> quality<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:48.809> different<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> yeah

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the quality is very different so yeah

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.310 
the quality is very different so yeah

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
microphones grids and stuff so I hope

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.240 
microphones grids and stuff so I hope
that<00:01:39.150> sound<00:01:39.509> determined<00:01:40.350> whether<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.189> should

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that sound determined whether you should

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
that sound determined whether you should
get<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.540> personally<00:01:43.350> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
get one of these or not personally I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.539 
get one of these or not personally I
like<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
like it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.340 
like it
if<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.329> enough<00:01:45.600> money<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.869> would<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.200> for

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
if you have enough money I would go for

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.109 
if you have enough money I would go for
the<00:01:46.439> blue<00:01:46.590> Yeti<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.850> will<00:01:48.390> record

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
the blue Yeti because it will record

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.600 
the blue Yeti because it will record
just<00:01:51.350> like<00:01:52.350> it'll<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.950> better<00:01:53.189> detection

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
just like it'll it's better detection

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
just like it'll it's better detection
it's<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> quality<00:01:54.479> it'll<00:01:55.140> look<00:01:55.649> if

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
it's not the quality it'll look if

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
it's not the quality it'll look if
you're<00:01:55.890> further<00:01:56.130> away<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.030> you're<00:01:57.180> close

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you're further away but if you're close

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.050 
you're further away but if you're close
like<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.780> am<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.320> fine<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> think<00:01:59.790> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
like I am it's fine so I think the
