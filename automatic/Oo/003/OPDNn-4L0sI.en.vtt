 then already 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 we must 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.400
 we in the hollow here quite so 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.080
 so that continent

 too bad by not so with the ranger 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.939
 Peugeot has but we are honest my person 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.769
 it's not that same now troops Mehmedi he has, too 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.769
 still enthusiastic apartment block and peace 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.169
 Herten 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.169
 and Okaka certainly will not allow for a way 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 no man Arnold may only be known 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.359
 decided 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.359
 because to look for some 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.579
 if I had my hands in my lap it did not help him so much No we have those 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.649
 Coal when she comes and as with the blue-white also seems more often and 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.649

 the child benefit is then you can somehow apply for 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:06.360
 No 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.389
 then that's it 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.059
 the Russians won sovereignly 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.599
 we can theoretically quite greedy 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.599

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.179
 Louis Vuitton or Thonet greedy 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:31.179
 that is broken 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.379
 it was a bit easy to pick up 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.479
 so serious 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.089
 that would be something to do 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.089
 were had before 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.379
 and 14 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.259

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.610
 rank 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.710
 I feel good for him at the time, not so often only Sprinz 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.150
 listen to music 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.449
 No, the manufacturer is monotone 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.020
 JÃ¼rgen Steinacker plays at a totally failed and on top of that titles 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.020
 wins among other things 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.020
 mother and daughter 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.689
 then to counter 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 Marko pulse of our banks or nonsense Oak Brook

 not so bad now 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.499
 and that's what I think 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.009
 Mappus he wants to make sex with the charming boy 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:20.680
 some do 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.680
 the promise 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:29.669
 could not care so i almost did not have it 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.539
 I knew that I am always and always give priority to us 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.250
 Of course I have RadioShack honors and nationalist 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.630
 I think I wanted the spilled I wanted to give up 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.539
 the reason lies in us 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.919
 and 5 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.089
 So the project is also called his client so strong 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.879
 in front of absolutely Oberlahn 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.680
 Therefore it should believe he himself knows the pace simply Rustenburg 

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:59.879
 Resolution but high MacDonald and 2 2 and Maria Weiling 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.569
 a bit the states 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.010
 We can do that twice as well 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.300
 to focus on renewed pain 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.350
 presses from below 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.740
 so they offer 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.740
 bookings 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:20.180

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.249
 I would not say that either 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:41.080
 that are suggested 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.080
 although knowledge is still the same 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:47.909
 It is a 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:50.909
 there are six wheels two attacks Frankfurt 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:55.219
