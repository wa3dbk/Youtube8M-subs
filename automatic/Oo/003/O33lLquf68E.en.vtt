building exercise out there that gets
more<00:00:24.680> blatant<00:00:25.680> hate<00:00:25.980> than<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.939> leg<00:00:27.180> extension

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
more blatant hate than the leg extension

more blatant hate than the leg extension
machine<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:28.560> typically<00:00:28.920> said<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.820> they

but what is the real truth here well
let's<00:00:44.969> tackle<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.989> main<00:00:46.500> questions<00:00:47.070> first

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
let's tackle the main questions first

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.630 
let's tackle the main questions first
off<00:00:48.059> our<00:00:48.270> leg<00:00:48.870> extensions<00:00:49.500> useful<00:00:50.219> when<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
off our leg extensions useful when it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.029 
off our leg extensions useful when it
comes<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> building<00:00:51.180> muscle<00:00:51.480> well<00:00:52.199> when<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
comes to building muscle well when it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
comes to building muscle well when it
all<00:00:53.190> comes<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.969> any<00:00:54.210> exercise<00:00:54.930> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
all comes down to it any exercise that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
all comes down to it any exercise that
you<00:00:55.350> perform<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:56.070> allows<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> place

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you perform that allows you to place

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
you perform that allows you to place
consistent<00:00:57.840> tension<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> targeted

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
consistent tension on the targeted

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.790 
consistent tension on the targeted
muscle<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.270> allows<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.870> progressive

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
muscle and it allows for progressive

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.009 
muscle and it allows for progressive
increases<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.609> resistance<00:01:03.030> overtime<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
increases in resistance overtime is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.710 
increases in resistance overtime is
going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> result<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.100> muscular<00:01:05.549> hypertrophy

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
going to result in muscular hypertrophy

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
going to result in muscular hypertrophy
the<00:01:06.720> leg<00:01:07.140> extension<00:01:07.290> allows<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the leg extension allows you to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.580 
the leg extension allows you to
accomplish<00:01:08.549> both<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.240> these<00:01:09.360> things<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.930> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
accomplish both of these things and so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.530 
accomplish both of these things and so
yes<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.950> certainly<00:01:11.310> will<00:01:11.640> add<00:01:11.909> size<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.479> your

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
yes it certainly will add size to your

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.899 
yes it certainly will add size to your
quads<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:13.260> time<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.369> include<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> in

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
quads over time if you include it in

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
quads over time if you include it in
your<00:01:14.939> routine<00:01:15.390> sure<00:01:15.869> leg<00:01:16.110> extensions<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.770> an

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
your routine sure leg extensions are an

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
your routine sure leg extensions are an
isolation<00:01:17.549> exercise<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.630> bicep

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
isolation exercise but so are bicep

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.380 
isolation exercise but so are bicep
curls<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> tricep<00:01:19.850> extensions<00:01:20.850> light<00:01:21.030> curls

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
curls and tricep extensions light curls

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.300 
curls and tricep extensions light curls
and<00:01:21.509> calf<00:01:21.780> raises<00:01:22.049> nobody<00:01:22.770> seems<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and calf raises nobody seems to have a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
and calf raises nobody seems to have a
problem<00:01:23.640> with<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> idea<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.990> those

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
problem with the idea that those

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.170 
problem with the idea that those
exercises<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:26.070> effective<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.790> building

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
exercises are effective for building

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630 
exercises are effective for building
muscle<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.049> I'm<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.560> sure<00:01:28.950> why<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> leg

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
muscle so I'm not sure why the leg

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
muscle so I'm not sure why the leg
extension<00:01:29.790> tends<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.750> viewed<00:01:30.960> differently

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
extension tends to be viewed differently

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.710 
extension tends to be viewed differently
now<00:01:32.220> let<00:01:32.369> me<00:01:32.460> make<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.610> few<00:01:32.880> things<00:01:33.030> clear<00:01:33.180> here

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
now let me make a few things clear here

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
now let me make a few things clear here
before<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.200> any<00:01:34.350> further<00:01:34.380> first<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.130> all

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
before I go any further first of all

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
before I go any further first of all
there's<00:01:35.759> absolutely<00:01:36.329> no<00:01:36.600> question<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
there's absolutely no question that the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100 
there's absolutely no question that the

training efforts all I'm really trying

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.990 
training efforts all I'm really trying
to<00:02:25.590> point<00:02:25.860> out<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.550> simple<00:02:26.970> fact

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
to point out here is the simple fact

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.380 
to point out here is the simple fact
that<00:02:27.960> they<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.890> included<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.580> part<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
that they can be included as part of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.570 
that they can be included as part of
your<00:02:30.570> overall<00:02:30.780> quad<00:02:31.350> workout<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.890> specific

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
your overall quad workout in specific

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.880 
your overall quad workout in specific
cases<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.840> they're<00:02:33.990> definitely<00:02:34.200> not<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
cases and that they're definitely not a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.670 
cases and that they're definitely not a
useless<00:02:35.850> exercise<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:36.990> many<00:02:37.110> people<00:02:37.380> try

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
useless exercise like so many people try

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.590 
useless exercise like so many people try
to<00:02:37.709> say<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.700> here<00:02:38.910> are<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> few<00:02:39.420> situations

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
to say so here are a few situations

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.320 
to say so here are a few situations
where<00:02:40.140> including<00:02:40.860> leg<00:02:41.070> extensions<00:02:41.700> at<00:02:41.880> the

where including leg extensions at the

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
end of your quad workout could make

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.640 
end of your quad workout could make

sense first off maybe you want to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.320 
sense first off maybe you want to
include<00:02:46.920> some<00:02:47.280> additional<00:02:47.310> volume<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.300> your

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
compound quad exercises in the 12 or 15

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.580 
compound quad exercises in the 12 or 15
rep<00:03:36.120> range<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.080> these<00:03:37.200> are<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.560> few

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
rep range so these are just a few

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.729 
rep range so these are just a few
situations<00:03:38.100> where<00:03:38.670> leg<00:03:39.000> extensions<00:03:39.660> could<00:03:40.470> be

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
situations where leg extensions could be

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.380 
situations where leg extensions could be
a<00:03:40.769> useful<00:03:41.310> addition<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.790> your<00:03:41.880> training<00:03:42.269> plan

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
a useful addition to your training plan

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.840 
a useful addition to your training plan
so<00:03:43.350> now<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.829> second<00:03:44.190> major<00:03:44.280> question

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
so now on to the second major question

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.050 
so now on to the second major question

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
our leg extensions bad for your knees

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.850 
our leg extensions bad for your knees
well<00:03:48.060> although<00:03:48.299> most<00:03:48.720> people<00:03:49.140> will<00:03:49.380> give<00:03:49.650> a

to this question the real answer is that

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.020 
to this question the real answer is that
it<00:03:55.170> depends<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.799> your<00:03:56.190> individual<00:03:56.850> body

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
it depends on your individual body

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.660 
it depends on your individual body
structure<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.140> depends<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:58.769> how<00:03:59.610> you

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
structure and it depends on how you

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.410 
structure and it depends on how you
perform<00:04:00.000> them<00:04:00.420> for<00:04:00.680> some<00:04:01.680> people<00:04:02.420> regardless

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
perform them for some people regardless

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.930 
perform them for some people regardless
of<00:04:03.630> how<00:04:03.810> they<00:04:04.170> approach<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:05.310> leg<00:04:05.790> extension

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
of how they approach the leg extension

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.490 
of how they approach the leg extension
machine<00:04:06.360> they're<00:04:06.720> always<00:04:06.959> going<00:04:07.410> to

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
machine they're always going to

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.740 
machine they're always going to
experience<00:04:08.040> knee<00:04:08.880> discomfort<00:04:09.090> no<00:04:09.600> matter

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
experience knee discomfort no matter

experience knee discomfort no matter
what<00:04:10.110> I<00:04:10.320> think<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.010> pretty<00:04:11.250> obvious<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.760> in

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
what I think it's pretty obvious that in

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.620 
what I think it's pretty obvious that in
this<00:04:13.170> particular<00:04:13.739> case<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:15.150> exercise

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
this particular case this exercise

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.380 
this particular case this exercise
should<00:04:15.900> be<00:04:16.079> completely<00:04:16.440> avoided<00:04:17.090> however<00:04:18.090> if

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
should be completely avoided however if

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.469 
should be completely avoided however if
you<00:04:18.660> are<00:04:18.690> able<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.560> perform<00:04:20.310> leg<00:04:20.820> extensions

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
you are able to perform leg extensions

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.900 
you are able to perform leg extensions
without<00:04:21.780> any<00:04:22.169> pain<00:04:22.560> then<00:04:23.430> they'll<00:04:23.580> probably

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
without any pain then they'll probably

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.490 
without any pain then they'll probably
be<00:04:24.300> fine<00:04:24.660> as<00:04:24.930> long

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
be fine as long

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.490 
be fine as long
as<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.920> perform<00:04:26.130> every<00:04:26.940> rep<00:04:27.120> using<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.810> slow

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
as you perform every rep using a slow

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.260 
as you perform every rep using a slow
and<00:04:28.650> controlled<00:04:28.710> cadence<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.120> should

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
and controlled cadence so you should

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.030 
and controlled cadence so you should
never<00:04:30.450> be<00:04:30.720> exploding<00:04:31.410> out<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.680> bottom

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
position and you want to make sure that

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.440 
position and you want to make sure that
you<00:04:34.650> perform<00:04:35.010> every<00:04:35.370> rep<00:04:35.610> under<00:04:36.000> complete

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
you perform every rep under complete

want to make sure that you're using

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.590 
want to make sure that you're using
moderate<00:04:41.340> weights<00:04:41.670> for<00:04:41.910> higher<00:04:42.090> reps<00:04:42.420> so

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
moderate weights for higher reps so

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600 
moderate weights for higher reps so
stick<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.990> bare<00:04:43.470> minimum<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:44.160> eight<00:04:44.400> reps

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
sure that you progress very slowly so

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.280 
sure that you progress very slowly so
don't<00:04:53.610> make<00:04:53.700> any<00:04:53.880> major<00:04:54.090> leaps<00:04:54.570> in<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:55.020> amount

of weight that you use from week to week
and<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.660> want<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.900> focus<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.410> very<00:04:59.100> gradually

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
and you want to focus on very gradually

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.670 
and you want to focus on very gradually
increasing<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.330> resistance<00:05:00.480> over<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.230> longer

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
period of time and finally you want to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.650 
period of time and finally you want to
adjust<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.440> settings<00:05:04.980> on<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.130> machine<00:05:05.660> to

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
adjust the settings on the machine to

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.150 
adjust the settings on the machine to
what<00:05:06.870> feels<00:05:07.140> most<00:05:07.380> comfortable<00:05:07.650> for<00:05:08.100> you

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
what feels most comfortable for you

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.800 
what feels most comfortable for you
everybody's<00:05:08.700> body<00:05:08.970> structure<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.570> different

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
everybody's body structure is different

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.830 
everybody's body structure is different
so<00:05:10.590> make<00:05:11.100> sure<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.520> adjust<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.880> back<00:05:12.180> pad<00:05:12.570> and

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
so make sure to adjust the back pad and

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.950 
so make sure to adjust the back pad and
the<00:05:12.990> seat<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.890> an<00:05:13.980> angle<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.870> minimizes<00:05:15.870> the

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
the seat to an angle that minimizes the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.650 
the seat to an angle that minimizes the
pressure<00:05:16.260> on<00:05:16.530> your<00:05:16.710> knees<00:05:16.950> if<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.760> follow<00:05:18.360> all

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
pressure on your knees if you follow all

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.720 
pressure on your knees if you follow all
of<00:05:18.720> these<00:05:19.050> steps<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:19.950> use<00:05:20.100> some<00:05:20.340> basic

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
of these steps and you use some basic

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.270 
of these steps and you use some basic
common<00:05:20.970> sense<00:05:21.260> then<00:05:22.260> you<00:05:22.650> shouldn't<00:05:23.070> run<00:05:23.250> into

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
common sense then you shouldn't run into

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.580 
common sense then you shouldn't run into
any<00:05:23.610> problems<00:05:23.850> when<00:05:24.419> performing<00:05:25.380> leg

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
any problems when performing leg

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.250 
any problems when performing leg
extensions<00:05:26.190> in<00:05:26.340> your<00:05:26.400> quad<00:05:27.000> workout<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:28.140> can

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
extensions in your quad workout you can

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.320 
extensions in your quad workout you can
also<00:05:28.440> optionally<00:05:28.830> cycle<00:05:29.550> on<00:05:29.729> and<00:05:29.850> off<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.060> them

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
also optionally cycle on and off of them

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.760 
also optionally cycle on and off of them
just<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.630> be<00:05:30.660> even<00:05:31.020> more<00:05:31.200> on<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.500> safe<00:05:31.740> side

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
just to be even more on the safe side

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.219 
just to be even more on the safe side
for<00:05:32.160> example<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:33.090> could<00:05:33.240> do<00:05:33.479> six<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:33.900> twelve

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
for example you could do six to twelve

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:34.490 
for example you could do six to twelve
weeks

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
weeks

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.400 
weeks
on<00:05:34.560> followed<00:05:35.130> by<00:05:35.310> six<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.790> twelve<00:05:36.060> weeks<00:05:36.120> off

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
on followed by six to twelve weeks off

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.890 
on followed by six to twelve weeks off
so<00:05:37.410> the<00:05:37.620> purpose<00:05:37.919> of<00:05:38.010> this<00:05:38.130> video<00:05:38.490> is<00:05:38.690> not<00:05:39.690> to

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
so the purpose of this video is not to

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.960 
so the purpose of this video is not to
encourage<00:05:40.470> you<00:05:40.740> to<00:05:40.860> perform<00:05:41.160> leg<00:05:41.400> extensions

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
encourage you to perform leg extensions

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.420 
encourage you to perform leg extensions
in<00:05:42.210> your<00:05:42.870> workout<00:05:43.260> or<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:43.650> claim<00:05:43.950> that<00:05:44.160> they

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430
