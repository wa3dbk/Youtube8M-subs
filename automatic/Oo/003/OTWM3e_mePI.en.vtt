tank should have only gravel in it
by<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.670> way<00:02:27.849> your<00:02:28.000> filter<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.629> could<00:02:28.810> if<00:02:29.110> you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
by the way your filter you could if you

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.899 
by the way your filter you could if you
can<00:02:29.409> fit<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.980> bucket<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.430> can<00:02:30.580> do<00:02:30.760> it

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
can fit that on the bucket you can do it

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.550 
can fit that on the bucket you can do it
but<00:02:31.090> if<00:02:31.209> not<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.720> don't<00:02:31.840> need<00:02:32.049> it<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.409> just

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
but if not you don't need it it's just

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.770 
but if not you don't need it it's just
going<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.739> be<00:02:32.890> an<00:02:33.220> hour<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.180> it's<00:02:34.420> not<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.599> big

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
going to be an hour to so it's not a big

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.160 
going to be an hour to so it's not a big
deal

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
deal

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.030 
deal
and<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.959> now<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.140> just<00:02:38.319> have<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.500> gravel<00:02:38.980> in

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
and so now you just have the gravel in

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.449 
and so now you just have the gravel in
your<00:02:39.159> tank<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.640> you're<00:02:40.480> going<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.690> take<00:02:40.930> a

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
scoop out all of the gravel and put that

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.720 
scoop out all of the gravel and put that
into<00:02:48.790> your<00:02:48.910> second<00:02:49.360> bucket<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:51.430> won't<00:02:51.610> be

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
you're going to do with that is you

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.039 
you're going to do with that is you
should<00:03:00.700> still<00:03:01.030> have<00:03:01.060> half<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.569> water<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:01.959> the

should still have half the water in the
tank<00:03:02.230> at<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.560> point<00:03:02.829> and<00:03:03.209> you're<00:03:04.209> going<00:03:04.360> to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
tank at this point and you're going to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.119 
tank at this point and you're going to
grab<00:03:04.720> your<00:03:04.840> siphon<00:03:05.410> again<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.040> you'll

grab your siphon again and you'll

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.650

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
actually be able to pick up those little

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.259 
actually be able to pick up those little
pieces<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.170> gravel<00:03:08.709> from<00:03:09.609> the<00:03:09.760> bottom<00:03:10.120> that

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
pieces of gravel from the bottom that

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.940 
pieces of gravel from the bottom that
you<00:03:10.390> couldn't<00:03:10.690> get<00:03:10.870> with<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.829> your

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
you couldn't get with the with your

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.190 
you couldn't get with the with your
hands<00:03:12.310> or<00:03:12.400> with<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.579> scooper<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.420> that's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
hands or with the scooper and that's

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.690 
hands or with the scooper and that's
pretty<00:03:14.410> important<00:03:14.920> because<00:03:15.069> if<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.430> put<00:03:15.609> the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
pretty important because if you put the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.160 
pretty important because if you put the
sand<00:03:16.000> down<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.359> you<00:03:16.420> don't<00:03:16.569> get<00:03:16.690> those<00:03:16.870> up

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
sand down and you don't get those up

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.869 
sand down and you don't get those up
they<00:03:17.890> start<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.340> rise<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.849> surface

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
they start to rise to the surface

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.509 
they start to rise to the surface
because<00:03:19.629> they're<00:03:19.810> larger<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:21.340> don't

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
because they're larger and you don't

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.599 
because they're larger and you don't
want<00:03:22.440> pieces<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.680> gravel<00:03:24.099> coming<00:03:24.370> up<00:03:24.430> out<00:03:24.579> of

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
want pieces of gravel coming up out of

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.099 
want pieces of gravel coming up out of
your<00:03:24.760> sand<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.180> had<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.480> problem<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.840> little<00:03:25.959> in

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
your sand I had that problem a little in

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.199 
your sand I had that problem a little in
the<00:03:26.170> beginning<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:27.040> think<00:03:27.790> it's<00:03:27.879> okay<00:03:28.180> now

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
the beginning but I think it's okay now

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.789 
the beginning but I think it's okay now
so<00:03:28.690> just<00:03:28.930> make<00:03:29.170> sure<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.530> siphon<00:03:30.010> out<00:03:30.129> all<00:03:30.340> the

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
so just make sure you siphon out all the

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.050 
so just make sure you siphon out all the
little<00:03:32.799> pieces<00:03:33.099> of<00:03:33.250> gravel<00:03:33.700> they're<00:03:33.819> left

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
little pieces of gravel they're left

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.720 
little pieces of gravel they're left
over<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:35.709> right<00:03:36.040> now<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.310> have<00:03:36.430> your<00:03:36.669> two

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
over so right now you have your two

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.990 
over so right now you have your two
buckets<00:03:37.500> one<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:38.680> your<00:03:38.859> fish<00:03:39.130> decorations

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
buckets one with your fish decorations

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.120 
buckets one with your fish decorations
and<00:03:40.180> heater<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.750> your<00:03:41.650> other<00:03:41.709> one<00:03:41.950> should

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
and heater and your other one should

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.710 
and heater and your other one should
have<00:03:42.310> all<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.880> gravel<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.389> was<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.630> your

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
have all the gravel that was in your

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.819 
have all the gravel that was in your
tank<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.319> by<00:03:45.250> now<00:03:45.430> your<00:03:45.780> your<00:03:46.780> tank<00:03:47.620> should

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
tank and by now your your tank should
