00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:11.639
 As you pull the strat , the volume drops by itself and the volume becomes zero 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.639
 Say that 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.150
 I will ask you questions 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:24.930
 It resolves method and referred to as 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.620
 It's a strange story I'm not aware of the volume here 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.350
 I'd know Well 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:35.960
 Well what do you want to say 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:41.140
 It may not be how you do not mess with the volume when pulling 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.140
 So well for example 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.220
 car 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
 ni 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.550
 Is people who do not the volume in principle have the Toka that broth 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.739
 What 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.580
 It is not easy to go a high school go and touch the volume while playing 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.050
 To be 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:15.470
 It is a hand to say that it is here a 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:21.080
 I think that soon you can touch the volume and can control 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:24.409
 There is a volume that is here to say that gradually sound hit the selfishness is reduced 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.479
 May not be evidence that I 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:35.500
 Let's practice by violin playing first to solve it 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 The violin playing method is picking and picking with volume zero 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.110
 I will increase the volume hey 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.420
 re 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.890
 The point is that a picking how to disappear 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.900
 a yes 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.200
 Hm 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:05.299
 Hm sounds like a violin like this 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.470
 View and a Well girls sofa Is this the Do-Re-Mi file Sorashido and 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.220
 air 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.720
 hey 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.069
 a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.090
 yeah 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.989
 Iiii N 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.989
 re re 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.240
 hey hey 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.240
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:35.410
 The little finger remembers that there is really a volume here when doing this practice 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.140
 Because 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.230
 If you do not want to go down there 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:48.890
 You will be able to avoid picking 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:51.200
 I think people not interesting this kind of violin playing Yeah Well, for example, 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.670
 The delay is appropriate 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.670
 Make a loud sound back 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:13.530
 There is no strain high in such military 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.790
 Please try to practice because I think that messed fun Once these do is play 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.790
 Delay time is ah 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.510
 Well this fits on 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:36.250
 It may be a feeling that taught me the position 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:43.680
 Then say 57 out of 19 of 19 decrease 14 slowly 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.680
 Let's go to 5714 out of 19 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:56.150
 It's too short, so it's like a day with 5714 1 of 19 24 of 15 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:01.299
 10 out of 8 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.299
 But let's go here 7 frets back 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:20.120
 At that time, please switch to the front pickup 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:22.269
 If you do so, it is sweet tone and more like violin or such volume rendition is effective 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.269
 is 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.230
 There 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.690
 If you can do this , I think that the city ​​with a large volume can be completely learned
