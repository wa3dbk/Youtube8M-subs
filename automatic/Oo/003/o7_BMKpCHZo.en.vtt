00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.839 
operated by the current you up top if
we're<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.559> one<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.860> our<00:00:13.950> action<00:00:14.370> sequences

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
where you see a lot of gameplay from

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.580 
where you see a lot of gameplay from
many<00:00:16.440> different<00:00:16.619> angles<00:00:18.230> really<00:00:19.230> shows<00:00:19.439> off

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
many different angles really shows off

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:32.499 
many different angles really shows off
our<00:00:19.830> levels<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.369> your<00:00:20.640> shoes

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.389 

so<00:00:33.109> this<00:00:33.260> is<00:00:33.410> actually<00:00:33.559> I'm<00:00:33.980> showing<00:00:34.309> you<00:00:34.339> here

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
so this is actually I'm showing you here

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.650 
so this is actually I'm showing you here
is<00:00:34.550> only<00:00:34.760> about<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:35.030> third<00:00:35.359> of<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.629> entire

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
is only about a third of the entire

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.950 
is only about a third of the entire
level<00:00:36.170> is<00:00:36.379> giving<00:00:36.829> past<00:00:37.070> very<00:00:38.059> large<00:00:38.329> sections

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
level is giving past very large sections

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.680 
level is giving past very large sections
and<00:00:39.920> it's<00:00:40.309> twice<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.609> size<00:00:40.909> of<00:00:41.210> any<00:00:41.420> of<00:00:41.570> our

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
and it's twice the size of any of our

00:00:41.690 --> 00:01:04.090 
and it's twice the size of any of our
previous<00:00:42.140> levels<00:00:42.850> passkeys

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.950 

so<00:01:04.519> this<00:01:04.670> gameplay<00:01:04.909> mode<00:01:05.299> will<00:01:05.420> go<00:01:05.540> into<00:01:05.750> a
