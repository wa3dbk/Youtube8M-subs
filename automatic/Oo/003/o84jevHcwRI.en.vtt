00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
innovation when I first saw it was the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.340 
innovation when I first saw it was the
visual<00:04:51.410> design<00:04:51.890> this<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:52.880> not<00:04:53.360> only<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> really

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
the iconography that they use for the

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.810 
the iconography that they use for the
resources<00:05:03.350> is<00:05:03.650> great<00:05:03.890> you<00:05:04.160> can<00:05:04.340> really<00:05:04.670> easily

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
resources is great you can really easily

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.790 
resources is great you can really easily
read<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:05.390> even<00:05:05.720> from<00:05:05.870> across<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.350> table<00:05:06.530> if

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800

so<00:06:29.839> high<00:06:30.169> that<00:06:30.949> if<00:06:31.069> you're<00:06:31.219> a<00:06:31.249> long-term

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:31.519 
so high that if you're a long-term

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:33.699 
so high that if you're a long-term
strategist<00:06:32.330> who<00:06:32.539> doesn't<00:06:32.869> like<00:06:33.049> randomness

amount<00:07:42.439> of<00:07:42.619> interactivity<00:07:43.249> so<00:07:43.579> very<00:07:44.539> little

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:44.779 
amount of interactivity so very little

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:47.079 
amount of interactivity so very little
downtime<00:07:45.079> you're<00:07:45.829> going<00:07:46.039> to<00:07:46.159> be<00:07:46.249> working<00:07:46.849> on
