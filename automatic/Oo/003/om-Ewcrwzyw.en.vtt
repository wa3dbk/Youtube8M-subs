00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi guys so this video will be about moon

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.960 
hi guys so this video will be about moon
water<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.990> what<00:00:04.529> it<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.009> how<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.339> make<00:00:05.640> it

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
water and what it is and how to make it

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.770 
water and what it is and how to make it
so<00:00:06.480> basically<00:00:07.109> moon<00:00:07.470> water<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:08.330> water<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.480> is

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
so basically moon water is water that is

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.470 
so basically moon water is water that is
charged<00:00:10.170> or<00:00:10.380> blessed<00:00:10.679> by<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.070> moon<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.820> you

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
charged or blessed by the moon and you

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.749 
charged or blessed by the moon and you
can<00:00:12.599> use<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.019> your<00:00:13.049> spell's<00:00:13.469> rituals<00:00:14.099> baths

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
can use it in your spell's rituals baths

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.550 
can use it in your spell's rituals baths
and<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.210> even<00:00:15.480> sometimes<00:00:15.660> consume<00:00:16.410> it

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and you can even sometimes consume it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.390 
and you can even sometimes consume it
but<00:00:17.520> I'll<00:00:17.789> tell<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> make<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.369> now<00:00:20.369> I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
but I'll tell you how to make it now I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.050 
but I'll tell you how to make it now I
guess<00:00:20.670> um<00:00:21.560> so<00:00:22.560> all<00:00:22.800> you'll<00:00:22.980> need<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.640> make<00:00:23.760> moon

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
guess um so all you'll need to make moon

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.950 
guess um so all you'll need to make moon
water<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:25.070> a<00:00:26.070> glass<00:00:26.609> jar<00:00:26.939> don't<00:00:27.359> use<00:00:27.480> plastic

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
water is a glass jar don't use plastic

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.730 
water is a glass jar don't use plastic
because<00:00:28.109> plastic<00:00:28.760> releases<00:00:29.760> chemicals<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
because plastic releases chemicals and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.160 
because plastic releases chemicals and
parabens<00:00:31.740> into<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> water<00:00:32.669> which<00:00:33.170> basically

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
parabens into the water which basically

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.370 
parabens into the water which basically
pollute<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.059> best<00:00:36.210> bet<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> use<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
pollute it so the best bet is to use a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.430 
pollute it so the best bet is to use a
glass<00:00:37.829> jar<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.640> doesn't<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
glass jar it doesn't have to be like a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.940 
glass jar it doesn't have to be like a
mason<00:00:40.860> jar<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.660> or<00:00:42.660> container<00:00:43.050> whatever<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
mason jar but or container whatever and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.459 
mason jar but or container whatever and
depending<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.579> how<00:00:44.700> much<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.969> want<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> make

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
depending on how much you want to make

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
depending on how much you want to make
you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.649> make<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:47.910> whatever

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you can make it you can use whatever

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
you can make it you can use whatever
size<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.660> want<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.649> make<00:00:49.829> sure<00:00:49.860> has<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> lid<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
size you want but make sure has a lid to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.420 
size you want but make sure has a lid to
so<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> bugs<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.629> whatever<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.430> but

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
so that bugs or whatever don't go in but

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
so that bugs or whatever don't go in but

quartz or whatever crystal you're using
to<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.570> bottom<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.920> leave<00:02:05.159> that

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
to the bottom and then you leave that

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.460 
to the bottom and then you leave that
outside<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:07.429> this<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.000> stone<00:02:09.270> will<00:02:09.660> soak

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
outside so that this the stone will soak

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.420 
outside so that this the stone will soak
up<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.860> there

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
up in there

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.420 
up in there
and<00:02:11.549> then<00:02:12.209> you'll<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.989> moon<00:02:13.500> elixir<00:02:13.920> but

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and then you'll have a moon elixir but

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.250 
and then you'll have a moon elixir but
you<00:02:14.640> shouldn't<00:02:15.030> drink<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.450> unless<00:02:16.049> it's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
you shouldn't drink that unless it's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.720 
you shouldn't drink that unless it's
clear<00:02:16.560> quartz<00:02:16.829> then<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.099> can<00:02:17.220> drink<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.489> little

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
clear quartz then you can drink a little

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.949 
clear quartz then you can drink a little
bit<00:02:17.849> of<00:02:17.939> it<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.239> still<00:02:18.299> don't<00:02:18.569> recommend

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
bit of it but I still don't recommend

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.479 
bit of it but I still don't recommend
drinking<00:02:19.079> it<00:02:19.349> because<00:02:19.470> don't<00:02:20.040> let<00:02:20.340> off

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
drinking it because don't let off

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.449 
drinking it because don't let off
minerals<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.540> such<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.290> some<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.159> them<00:02:23.280> can

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
minerals and such and some of them can

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.780 
minerals and such and some of them can
be<00:02:23.640> toxic<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.659> if<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.769> are<00:02:25.890> using<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.400> if

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
be toxic so if you are using that if

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.369 
be toxic so if you are using that if
you're<00:02:27.060> making<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.480> moon<00:02:27.629> elixir<00:02:27.989> make<00:02:28.260> sure

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
thought if you're new to making moon

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.099 
thought if you're new to making moon
water<00:03:28.409> if<00:03:28.769> you're<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.549> new<00:03:30.030> witch<00:03:30.750> or

water if you're like a new witch or

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.289 
water if you're like a new witch or
Wiccan<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.430> might<00:03:32.609> not<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
Wiccan then you might not have the

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.809 
Wiccan then you might not have the
greatest<00:03:33.510> idea<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.079> what<00:03:34.290> kind<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.620> spells<00:03:35.609> are

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
greatest idea of what kind of spells are

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.789 
greatest idea of what kind of spells are
chance<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.239> might<00:03:36.359> want<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.599> use<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.409> from

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
chance you might want to use so from
