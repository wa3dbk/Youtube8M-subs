00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.770
 I lost weight com.br point and today I'll 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.080
 pass three super tips for you to eat 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.940
 less in a totally natural way 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.610
 Good to start, I wanted you. 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.520
 I understood wellington and goias as a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.470
 balloon then when it fills he sent it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.390
 messages to your brain saying looks 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.010
 I'm satisfied, you do not have to eat it . 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.150
 also works when 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.769
 it decreases 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.529
 He sent me another message. I'm not with 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.619
 hunger need you to purchase an ok 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.920
 good a first tip let's go 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.829
 the young man it's interesting that you drink water 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.809
 to fill up if they are then I usually 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.170
 takes around two cups not 500 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.820
 ml that is it fills the stomach and this me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.289
 your brain receives the message that you 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.690
 is a little more satisfied than not 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.610
 need to commit so much damage from you 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.910
 for food will realize that when 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.920
 You go and try to eat more and you already 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.469
 will you strive in the then you will end 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.879
 eating little less good 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.090
 The second tip is how foods rich in 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.220
 fibers because fiber increases the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.080
 retention of water in the body and there you 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.200
 remained satisfied longer and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.880
 consequently it will end with less ne 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.880
 in addition there is another characteristic 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.590
 of the fiber is that it slows down 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
 food in the eyes in the body 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.210
 so you end up being satisfied with 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.290
 more excellent time, right? 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.420
 the third tip as foods that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.549
 contain more water than 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 first tip so you'll get more at 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.420
 your body and will feel satisfied 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.939
 with more great time 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.280
 The other thing is that these fibers again 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.380
 will help you keep this water in the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.810
 body but sucking this water as a 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.930
 sponge she will keep if the option is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 even more time and you finish 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.979
 continuing to be more satisfied with 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.060

 fibers and others that contain more water to
