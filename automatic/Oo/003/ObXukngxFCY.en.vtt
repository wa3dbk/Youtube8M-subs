and rich and kinetic is you know as a
car<00:00:14.139> in<00:00:14.320> a<00:00:14.410> drone

car in a drone
you<00:00:15.519> know<00:00:15.639> racing<00:00:16.240> around<00:00:16.510> on<00:00:16.690> a<00:00:16.720> track

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100

you know racing around on a track
capturing<00:00:18.100> that<00:00:18.220> from<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.520> drones<00:00:18.820> POV<00:00:19.330> I<00:00:19.360> think

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
capturing that from a drones POV I think

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:28.050 
capturing that from a drones POV I think
is<00:00:19.780> gonna<00:00:19.930> be<00:00:20.050> really<00:00:20.170> inspiring<00:00:26.940> it<00:00:27.940> was

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
is gonna be really inspiring it was

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.520 
is gonna be really inspiring it was
evident<00:00:28.450> from<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.750> brief<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.020> we're<00:00:29.380> gonna

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
evident from the brief that we're gonna

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.990 
evident from the brief that we're gonna
have<00:00:29.710> a<00:00:29.770> car<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.400> we're<00:00:30.550> gonna<00:00:30.700> have<00:00:30.910> the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
have a car and we're gonna have the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.510 
have a car and we're gonna have the
drones<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:32.349> how<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.860> take<00:00:33.160> that<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.489> another

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
drones but how to take that to another

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.500 
drones but how to take that to another
level<00:00:33.789> was<00:00:34.300> where<00:00:35.170> Bradley<00:00:35.410> stepped<00:00:35.829> in<00:00:36.070> a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
level was where Bradley stepped in a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960 
level was where Bradley stepped in a
very<00:00:37.510> agile<00:00:38.020> car<00:00:38.350> rigged<00:00:38.890> with<00:00:38.980> LEDs<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:39.850> then

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
very agile car rigged with LEDs and then

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.569 
very agile car rigged with LEDs and then
we<00:00:40.090> have<00:00:40.300> eight<00:00:40.750> drones<00:00:41.230> rigged<00:00:41.950> with<00:00:42.070> LEDs<00:00:42.430> as

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
we have eight drones rigged with LEDs as

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.460 
we have eight drones rigged with LEDs as
well<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.570> it's<00:00:43.750> kind<00:00:43.989> of<00:00:44.020> a<00:00:44.110> battle<00:00:44.440> between

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
well and it's kind of a battle between

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.520 
well and it's kind of a battle between
these<00:00:44.890> two<00:00:45.100> machines<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.940> so<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.540> drones<00:00:46.810> fly

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
these two machines and so the drones fly

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.170 
these two machines and so the drones fly
out<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:47.829> form<00:00:48.100> these<00:00:48.190> obstacles<00:00:48.520> for<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:48.970> car

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
out and form these obstacles for the car

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.670 
out and form these obstacles for the car
to<00:00:49.420> kind<00:00:49.630> of<00:00:49.690> conquer<00:00:50.170> I<00:00:52.020> wanted<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.140> appear

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
to kind of conquer I wanted to appear

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.220 
to kind of conquer I wanted to appear
and<00:00:54.190> feel<00:00:54.670> like<00:00:54.910> you're<00:00:55.120> there<00:00:55.329> this<00:00:55.840> is<00:00:56.050> where

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
and feel like you're there this is where

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.510 
and feel like you're there this is where
we<00:00:56.350> were<00:00:56.530> this<00:00:56.829> is<00:00:56.890> what<00:00:57.130> it<00:00:57.220> looked<00:00:57.399> like

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
we were this is what it looked like

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.430 
we were this is what it looked like
these<00:00:58.090> are<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.329> people<00:00:58.660> on<00:00:58.780> set<00:00:59.110> these<00:00:59.320> are

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
these are the people on set these are

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.540 
these are the people on set these are
the<00:00:59.500> drone<00:00:59.710> pilots<00:01:00.160> these<00:01:00.309> are<00:01:00.489> the

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
the drone pilots these are the

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.340 
the drone pilots these are the
technicians<00:01:00.880> through<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.480> computer<00:01:01.930> sunset

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
technicians through the computer sunset

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.350 
technicians through the computer sunset
I<00:01:02.620> think<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.460> little<00:01:03.550> bit<00:01:03.700> honesty<00:01:04.269> in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
I think a little bit honesty in

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.620 
I think a little bit honesty in
filmmaking<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:04.899> really<00:01:05.110> refreshing

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.440 

we're<00:01:09.170> actually<00:01:09.380> building<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.790> drones<00:01:11.060> that

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
we're actually building the drones that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.120 
we're actually building the drones that
was<00:01:12.110> being<00:01:12.290> part<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.650> project<00:01:12.830> that

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
was being part of the project that

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.800 
was being part of the project that
wasn't<00:01:13.430> about<00:01:13.610> going<00:01:14.210> into<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.479> shop<00:01:14.750> and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
wasn't about going into a shop and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.800 
wasn't about going into a shop and
buying<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.799> drone<00:01:16.220> off<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.490> shelf<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:17.000> big<00:01:17.600> part

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
buying a drone off the shelf a big part

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.960 
buying a drone off the shelf a big part
of<00:01:17.869> why<00:01:18.110> we<00:01:18.619> can<00:01:18.799> build<00:01:18.979> quad<00:01:19.340> copters<00:01:19.759> and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
of why we can build quad copters and

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.940 
of why we can build quad copters and
drones<00:01:20.240> cheaply<00:01:20.659> now<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.530> because<00:01:21.860> of

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
drones cheaply now is because of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.590 
drones cheaply now is because of
advancements<00:01:22.549> in<00:01:22.790> mobile<00:01:23.240> phone<00:01:23.420> technology

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
advancements in mobile phone technology

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.380 
advancements in mobile phone technology
so<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.040> gyroscopes<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:25.909> see<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.240> him

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
so the gyroscopes that you see on him

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.109 
so the gyroscopes that you see on him
iPhones<00:01:26.930> for<00:01:27.170> example<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:28.130> was<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.970> ability

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
iPhones for example it was the ability

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.480 
iPhones for example it was the ability
to<00:01:29.360> bring<00:01:29.570> down<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.899> costs<00:01:30.289> of<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.860> gyros<00:01:31.280> for

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
to bring down the costs of the gyros for

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.130 
to bring down the costs of the gyros for
the<00:01:31.580> mobile<00:01:31.759> phone<00:01:32.119> we're<00:01:32.810> able<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:33.049> actually

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
the mobile phone we're able to actually

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.230 
the mobile phone we're able to actually
take<00:01:33.470> those<00:01:33.680> chips<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.610> put<00:01:34.759> them<00:01:34.880> into<00:01:35.000> quad

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
take those chips and put them into quad

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.240 
take those chips and put them into quad
copters<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.930> actually<00:01:36.320> control<00:01:36.710> those<00:01:36.979> four

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
copters to actually control those four

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.590 
copters to actually control those four
motors

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.870 

drones<00:01:44.320> have<00:01:44.800> never<00:01:45.070> really<00:01:45.370> traditionally

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
drones have never really traditionally

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.240 
drones have never really traditionally
been<00:01:46.090> super<00:01:46.510> sexy<00:01:46.870> they<00:01:47.440> show<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.740> lot<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
been super sexy they show a lot of the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.070 
been super sexy they show a lot of the
electronics<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.390> propellers<00:01:49.870> and<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
electronics and the propellers and the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.390 
electronics and the propellers and the
batteries<00:01:50.440> in<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.650> motors<00:01:50.950> they<00:01:51.070> look<00:01:51.220> pretty

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
batteries in the motors they look pretty

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.800 
batteries in the motors they look pretty
cool<00:01:51.580> themselves<00:01:51.760> but<00:01:52.210> no<00:01:52.330> one's<00:01:52.510> ever<00:01:52.660> really

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
cool themselves but no one's ever really

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.870 
cool themselves but no one's ever really
pimped<00:01:53.470> them<00:01:53.560> out<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.370> thought<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.760> was

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
pimped them out so I thought it was

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.760 
pimped them out so I thought it was
really<00:01:55.030> exciting<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.690> be<00:01:55.720> able<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.990> take<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
really exciting to be able to take the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.680 
really exciting to be able to take the
frame<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.400> really<00:01:57.700> see<00:01:58.030> how<00:01:58.210> we<00:01:58.270> can<00:01:58.510> add

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
frame and really see how we can add

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:09.229 
frame and really see how we can add
decals<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.350> different<00:01:59.860> elements

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.600 

we<00:02:10.239> set<00:02:10.750> up<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.929> car<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.530> studio<00:02:11.830> in<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.250> 3d

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
we set up a car in a studio in a 3d

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.240 
we set up a car in a studio in a 3d
studio<00:02:12.790> with<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> drones<00:02:14.020> flying<00:02:14.349> around<00:02:14.650> map

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
studio with the drones flying around map

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.430 
studio with the drones flying around map
out<00:02:15.430> where<00:02:15.640> they're<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.970> fly<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:17.110> it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
out where they're going to fly it it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.860 
out where they're going to fly it it
allowed<00:02:17.680> Bradley<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.310> choose<00:02:19.000> his<00:02:19.209> shots<00:02:19.450> even

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
allowed Bradley to choose his shots even

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.350 
allowed Bradley to choose his shots even
before<00:02:20.020> getting<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.130> set

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.330 

it's<00:02:24.840> tricky<00:02:25.080> because<00:02:25.260> there's<00:02:25.650> there's<00:02:26.070> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
it's tricky because there's there's you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.310 
it's tricky because there's there's you
know<00:02:26.430> drones<00:02:26.910> drift<00:02:27.240> they<00:02:27.810> don't<00:02:27.990> just<00:02:28.170> lock

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
know drones drift they don't just lock

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.500 
know drones drift they don't just lock
in<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:29.190> know<00:02:29.280> perfectly<00:02:29.730> -<00:02:29.970> especially<00:02:30.450> with

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
in you know perfectly - especially with

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.510 
in you know perfectly - especially with
a<00:02:30.570> hand<00:02:30.750> operator<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.530> kind<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.830> use

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
a hand operator you have to kind of use

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.770 
a hand operator you have to kind of use
a<00:02:32.550> bunch<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.910> different<00:02:32.970> levers<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.600> kind<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
a bunch of different levers to kind of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.350 
a bunch of different levers to kind of
keep<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.080> stabilized<00:02:34.620> I'm<00:02:35.490> anticipating<00:02:35.820> a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
keep it stabilized I'm anticipating a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.870 
keep it stabilized I'm anticipating a
lot<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.990> lot<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> takes<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.550> kind<00:02:38.790> of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
lot of a lot of takes just kind of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.490 
lot of a lot of takes just kind of
getting<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.240> drones<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.660> hit<00:02:39.900> their<00:02:40.080> mark<00:02:40.320> and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
getting the drones to hit their mark and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.300 
getting the drones to hit their mark and
to<00:02:40.620> stay<00:02:40.890> there

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
to stay there

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.140 
to stay there
the<00:02:41.520> drones<00:02:41.820> they've<00:02:42.210> actually<00:02:42.420> built

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the drones they've actually built

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.180 
the drones they've actually built
designed<00:02:45.150> for<00:02:45.570> fpv<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.290> designed<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.740> racing

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
designed for fpv and designed for racing

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.860 
designed for fpv and designed for racing
so<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.610> actually<00:02:47.910> quite<00:02:48.150> hard<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> control

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
so it's actually quite hard to control

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.570 
so it's actually quite hard to control
because<00:02:49.530> they're<00:02:49.740> over<00:02:50.010> powered<00:02:50.280> they're

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
because they're over powered they're

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.050 
because they're over powered they're
like<00:02:50.700> supercharged<00:02:51.360> drones<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:56.070> pilots<00:02:56.850> that

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
like supercharged drones the pilots that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.840 
like supercharged drones the pilots that
are<00:02:57.300> flying<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.930> shoot<00:02:58.200> fpv<00:02:59.130> pilots<00:02:59.580> so

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
are flying on this shoot fpv pilots so

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.880 
are flying on this shoot fpv pilots so
first-person<00:03:00.540> view<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:01.410> that's<00:03:01.500> where<00:03:01.770> you're

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
first-person view so that's where you're

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.220 
first-person view so that's where you're
putting<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> goggles<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.000> you're<00:03:03.840> flying

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
putting on the goggles and you're flying

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.530 
putting on the goggles and you're flying
from<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.620> point<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.920> view<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.550> drone

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540

that<00:04:01.270> process<00:04:01.540> there's<00:04:02.080> just<00:04:02.320> all<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:02.680> room

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
that process there's just all this room

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.940 
that process there's just all this room
for<00:04:03.370> error<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.330> it's<00:04:04.690> terrifying<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.740> it's

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
for error and it's terrifying and it's

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.080 
for error and it's terrifying and it's
it's<00:04:06.370> stressful<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:11.620> it's<00:04:11.920> amazing<00:04:12.850> when<00:04:13.000> it

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
it's stressful but it's amazing when it

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.909 
it's stressful but it's amazing when it
works

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.290 

the<00:04:21.919> biggest<00:04:22.220> challenge<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.669> saw<00:04:22.940> was

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
the biggest challenge that I saw was

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.180 
the biggest challenge that I saw was
combining<00:04:23.660> their<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.200> light<00:04:24.410> trail<00:04:24.740> from

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
combining their the light trail from

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.670 
combining their the light trail from
photography<00:04:26.150> style<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.570> exposure<00:04:26.930> into<00:04:27.320> film

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
photography style and exposure into film

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.560 
photography style and exposure into film
and<00:04:27.919> allowed<00:04:28.400> us<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.610> have<00:04:28.850> these<00:04:29.000> trails<00:04:29.360> that

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
and allowed us to have these trails that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.500 
and allowed us to have these trails that
really<00:04:29.930> sort<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.139> turn<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.830> into<00:04:30.980> an<00:04:31.130> art<00:04:31.280> piece

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
really sort of turn it into an art piece

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.000 
really sort of turn it into an art piece
getting<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.600> car<00:04:32.840> right<00:04:33.169> up<00:04:33.320> into<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.650> camera

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
getting the car right up into the camera

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.650 
getting the car right up into the camera
and<00:04:34.070> just<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.430> know<00:04:34.490> swerving<00:04:35.180> through<00:04:35.480> it

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
and just you know swerving through it

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.240 
and just you know swerving through it
and<00:04:35.870> just<00:04:36.050> creating<00:04:36.740> these<00:04:36.980> beautiful

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
and just creating these beautiful

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.970 
and just creating these beautiful
streaks<00:04:38.090> of<00:04:38.210> light<00:04:38.480> that<00:04:38.690> have<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.139> really<00:04:39.320> you

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
streaks of light that have it really you

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.460 
streaks of light that have it really you
know<00:04:40.100> it's<00:04:40.370> not<00:04:40.550> see<00:04:40.820> it's<00:04:41.000> not<00:04:41.180> CG<00:04:41.600> it's<00:04:41.990> it's

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
know it's not see it's not CG it's it's

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.810 
know it's not see it's not CG it's it's
just<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.740> we're<00:04:42.919> repeating<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.460> frame<00:04:43.700> of

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
just that we're repeating the frame of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.610 
just that we're repeating the frame of
the<00:04:43.880> light<00:04:44.030> every<00:04:44.330> frame<00:04:44.600> but<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.200> is<00:04:45.320> real

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
the light every frame but it is real

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.250 
the light every frame but it is real
footage<00:04:45.860> every<00:04:46.760> time<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.270> light<00:04:47.600> leaves<00:04:48.139> a

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
footage every time a light leaves a

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.230 
footage every time a light leaves a
trial<00:04:48.530> over<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:49.010> one<00:04:49.160> frame<00:04:49.460> we<00:04:49.639> hold<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:50.030> and

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
trial over that one frame we hold it and

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.680 
trial over that one frame we hold it and
say<00:04:50.960> keep<00:04:51.229> it<00:04:51.470> and<00:04:51.650> let<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.280> echo<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.510> make

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
say keep it and let it echo and and make

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.180 
say keep it and let it echo and and make
sure<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:53.930> stays<00:04:54.139> on<00:04:54.320> every<00:04:54.530> single<00:04:54.800> point<00:04:54.950> but

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
sure it stays on every single point but

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.310 
sure it stays on every single point but
we<00:04:55.280> just<00:04:55.550> grab<00:04:55.790> the<00:04:55.910> highlights<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.600> so

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
we just grab the highlights and so

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.350 
we just grab the highlights and so
they'll<00:04:57.860> be<00:04:57.979> kind<00:04:58.160> of<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.400> nice<00:04:58.580> halo<00:04:58.940> around

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
they'll be kind of a nice halo around

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.700 
they'll be kind of a nice halo around
all<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.750> streak<00:04:59.960> effects<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.410> give<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.680> a

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
all the streak effects to give it a

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:12.130 
all the streak effects to give it a
little<00:05:00.830> bit<00:05:01.040> more<00:05:01.190> of<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.370> luminous<00:05:01.700> value

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.260 

ten<00:05:13.140> years<00:05:13.320> ago<00:05:13.380> this<00:05:13.740> would<00:05:13.950> be<00:05:14.270> crazy

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
ten years ago this would be crazy

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.200 
ten years ago this would be crazy
fanciful<00:05:16.080> idea<00:05:16.440> but<00:05:16.680> now<00:05:16.940> someone<00:05:17.940> can

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
fanciful idea but now someone can

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.270 
fanciful idea but now someone can
actually<00:05:18.990> come<00:05:19.200> up<00:05:19.230> with<00:05:19.350> an<00:05:19.590> idea<00:05:19.920> and<00:05:20.250> just

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
actually come up with an idea and just

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.240 
actually come up with an idea and just
stretch<00:05:21.000> their<00:05:21.240> imagination<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.140> you<00:05:23.130> know

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
stretch their imagination and you know

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.340 
stretch their imagination and you know
we<00:05:23.640> can<00:05:23.820> with<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:24.690> little<00:05:24.960> bit<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.170> thought

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
we can with a little bit of thought

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.440 
we can with a little bit of thought
process<00:05:25.890> we<00:05:26.070> can<00:05:26.220> actually<00:05:26.370> execute<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:27.120> I've

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
process we can actually execute it I've

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.490 
process we can actually execute it I've
said<00:05:27.720> from<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.900> beginning<00:05:28.050> we<00:05:28.320> should

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
said from the beginning we should

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.900 
said from the beginning we should
approach<00:05:28.740> this<00:05:28.890> as<00:05:29.040> a<00:05:29.070> dance<00:05:29.370> number

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
approach this as a dance number

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.790 
approach this as a dance number
this<00:05:30.330> is<00:05:30.450> choreography<00:05:31.200> that<00:05:31.320> we're<00:05:31.440> filming

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
this is choreography that we're filming

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.620 
this is choreography that we're filming
and<00:05:31.920> so<00:05:32.070> we<00:05:32.190> just<00:05:32.310> let<00:05:32.790> the<00:05:32.880> choreography<00:05:33.450> run

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
and so we just let the choreography run

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.550 
and so we just let the choreography run
and<00:05:33.810> capture<00:05:34.080> from<00:05:34.200> as<00:05:34.350> many<00:05:34.440> different

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
and capture from as many different

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.460 
and capture from as many different
angles<00:05:34.860> as<00:05:35.130> we<00:05:35.220> can
