 then it will be a bit special this is 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.660
 not be a fully gaming video 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.150
 it's more like a geek video I think 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.099
 you are aware that that 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.400
 regularly there are boks coming out 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.470
 in fact these were packages that you 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.739
 buy on the internet on different 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.380
 sites and in there you have several 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.170
 objects of different licenses and me 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.240
 I chose to buy the high-tech box 2 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.570
 May and I 'll show you that all of 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.440
 after 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.300
 so level presentation it's just 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.220
 a cardboard box on that side 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.140
 because there is my address I agree 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.010
 that you find yourself that you 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.500
 send me not wish So here 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.890
 This is a simple box all 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.210
 simple like that nothing good 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.729
 extraordinary you could have done a 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 little bit because many are a little more 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.110
 in addition to specialized 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.560
 the important thing is what is waiting for 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.560
 Let's go 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:29.530
 first object in there every month this 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.259
 be careful it's a good it's not new 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.450
 this is a figurine just a figurine 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.479
 in view of the facts the big club that 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.850
 I had I opened I had ico mg 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.020
 so this is a slick figurine and 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.679
 apparently she has several to 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.649
 collect 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.179
 you 're fed up and hot fuzz link diddy 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.490

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.420
 ice luigi calendar and so is 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.789
 glad here it is to score behind 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.549
 so first object a nintendo figurine 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.289
 frankly me I am redone in 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.270
 big fan of zelda I could not 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:07.959
 fall on us hyper to the second 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.970
 license attentions are under 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.950
 glass there coasters but yes 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.600
 but anything like coasters well 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.480
 these are marvel glass networks so 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.950
 on one side I had some facts if 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.650
 the ranks it goes well it's more 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.319
 a good quality is quite thick 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.450
 pass well that goes nickel for this 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.489
 that she is for what she is in front of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.480
 the good shot is pretty good and 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.730
 I had ironman here it is really 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.859
 nice me I'm not great fan of 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.120
 marvel to tell you everything but I 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.300
 think it's really good 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.450
 quality is 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.860
 that's probably what awaits you a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.640
 very good quality and it can always 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.350
 to be super tool 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.750
 and in addition these classes and its 8 points 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.530
 third object that goes perfectly well 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.930
 with the two previous attention 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.200
 talent at the skate captain bottle opener 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.060
 america a counter-power that would pose 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.900
 pregnancy even if I'm not ready 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.650
 not too pale but here you go 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.750
 decapsulate ring you well with with the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.750
 Bouquet is 4th to note what is there 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:25.030
 nothing wrong it's perfect 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:29.599
 so fourth license there a little more 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.579
 that marvel it's minecraft so I got 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.629
 stickers of 4 stickers so 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.909
 it's true that it's not either 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.590
 extraordinary that the script teacher 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.980
 hours that I think put on my 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.359
 car 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.670
 here I have a sticker life joined by 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:52.790
 a player what with the head of guys well 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:54.079
 a dirt stickers and stickers n 5 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.650
 it's a bit sounds a bit like cheap 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.060
 that but but hey it's minecraft to 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.810
 members of your stickers I could the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.680
 stick everywhere 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.780
 good it's nice enough even if 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.519
 good is not the world anymore 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.919
 extraordinary fifth license nothing 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.130
 harvests look at me that I you 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:19.849
 spoke saw born the most swag of the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.509
 earth attention glasses bob the 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:25.039
 poor damage 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:29.230
 wait I think it's rather the 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:31.870
 international class here 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.410
 it bites me more sun because 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.880
 that it comes from the cut well via 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.460
 light really you have these probes 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.860
 and in addition even if a drawing plan 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.840
 on it we can see perfectly when 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.520
 even very very well not through his 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.950
 peaceful 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:53.010
 it goes on it goes cream a lot for this 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.010
 country 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.970
 how to bar closer to life what 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.060
 no they are really euphoric 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.200
 golos well this is not the kind of 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.930
 things with which I think you 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.630
 can go out every day but that 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.740
 can be funny for an evening where 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.850
 when you are alone and pay yourself 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.160
 that you have that his commune is of 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.300
 sun and we do not see you that can 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.120
 be still not too bad 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.410
 so finally last license of this 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:28.070
 boxing attack attention it's a tee 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.050
 shirt this is a south park t-shirt 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:38.020
 I did not open I 'll open it with 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:39.830
 we hop hop hop hop 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.700
 so what's good is that actually 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.500
 when you order they ask you 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.800
 your size of t-shirts the blow you 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:50.770
 can easily at six months 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.550
 so in fact it's a t-shirt with kenny 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.810
 for those who do not know the series 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.230
 it was a character who died at 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.460
 every time and frankly he is pretty 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.840
 and therefore as a size movement 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.230
 you're sure that's your size of the pure 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.760
 happiness 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:07.670
 so it's pretty good 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.730
 so here's who with you so puts a 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:16.100
 little recap of what you have 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:18.890
 had in fact you have in the silver of 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.210
 things it costs you 30 euros if you 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.360
 take it is 50 euros 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:28.040
 you have other things and more 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.660
 random wild animals that's so deep 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.100
 for a first experience with 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.840
 canoe interbox 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.660
 although I would have liked a little more 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.180
 zelda but not that's all I have but 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.290
 think I'm going to pull that off that 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.450
 depends if you like it tell your 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.030
 comment in any case I have 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.600
 found it funny to open to open this 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.900
 box 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.030
 it was funny then more 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.470
 really that to be geek and the 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.650
