00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
we have the existing working fob which

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.029 
we have the existing working fob which
we<00:00:15.089> will<00:00:15.240> use<00:00:15.269> for<00:00:15.420> Pro<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.170> enter<00:00:16.440> programming

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
we will use for Pro to enter programming

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.550 
we will use for Pro to enter programming
and<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.779> our<00:00:19.619> new<00:00:20.359> pod<00:00:21.359> keyboard<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and we have our new pod keyboard and the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.250 
and we have our new pod keyboard and the
pod<00:00:22.769> key<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.150> small<00:00:24.630> section<00:00:24.990> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
pod key is just this small section of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.910 
pod key is just this small section of
the<00:00:25.410> board

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the board

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.029 
the board
the<00:00:26.550> typical<00:00:27.090> fob<00:00:27.449> board<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.529> right<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:29.010> so

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the typical fob board is right here so

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.609 
the typical fob board is right here so
you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.310> see<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.510> our<00:00:30.660> pod<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.500> be

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
you can see that our pod is going to be

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.770 
you can see that our pod is going to be
considerably<00:00:32.250> smaller<00:00:32.700> once<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
considerably smaller once we have the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.130 
considerably smaller once we have the
housings<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.649> them<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.910> we've<00:00:36.570> also<00:00:36.780> made

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
housings for them but we we've also made

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
housings for them but we we've also made
it<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.530> pods<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.790> inserted<00:00:39.210> into<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
it so the pods can be inserted into a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.360 
it so the pods can be inserted into a
