map<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:06.150> doesn't<00:00:06.480> have<00:00:06.720> temples<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.649> but

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
map it doesn't have temples in it but

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.360 
map it doesn't have temples in it but
what<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:09.000> generated<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.929> unbelievable<00:00:10.830> this

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
what it generated is unbelievable this

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.900 
what it generated is unbelievable this
has<00:00:11.519> actually<00:00:11.639> been<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.300> map<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:13.910> custom

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
has actually been a map that was custom

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.189 
has actually been a map that was custom
general<00:00:15.719> by<00:00:15.960> my<00:00:16.170> friend<00:00:16.500> who<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:18.080> promise<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
general by my friend who I promise to

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.220 
general by my friend who I promise to
remain<00:00:19.410> anonymous<00:00:20.210> he<00:00:21.210> basically<00:00:21.390> managed<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
remain anonymous he basically managed to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.769 
remain anonymous he basically managed to
figure<00:00:22.410> out<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.619> coding<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.550> seeds<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.480> he

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
figure out the coding for seeds so he

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.080 
figure out the coding for seeds so he
was<00:00:24.840> able<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.350> spawn<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.920> world<00:00:26.189> they're

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
was able to spawn this world they're

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.290 
was able to spawn this world they're
just<00:00:27.119> careful<00:00:28.340> finding<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> IDS<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
just careful finding of the IDS in the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.260 
just careful finding of the IDS in the
seed<00:00:30.510> system<00:00:31.219> basically<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.880> reason<00:00:33.000> why<00:00:33.239> i

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
seed system basically the reason why i

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.270 
seed system basically the reason why i
made<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.870> i'm<00:00:34.050> making<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> video<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
made a bit i'm making a video this is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
made a bit i'm making a video this is
not<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.820> because<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.390> extreme<00:00:37.020> Hills

have a desert village so I guess there's
wild<00:01:37.650> girl<00:01:37.860> come<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:39.060> doesn't<00:01:39.299> village

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
wild girl come this doesn't village

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.889 
wild girl come this doesn't village
actually<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> chunker<00:01:41.479> right<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.689> um

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
actually have a chunker right here um

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.590 
actually have a chunker right here um
basically<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.290> comes<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.740> carrots<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.600> took

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
basically it comes with carrots and took

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.200 
basically it comes with carrots and took
the<00:01:48.750> tables<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:50.310> yeah<00:01:50.850> um<00:01:51.829> I<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.060> was

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the tables so yeah um I think if I was

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.880 
the tables so yeah um I think if I was
cool<00:01:54.479> I'm<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.020> sneaking<00:01:55.380> there's<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> giant

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
come on the where there's a giant chasm

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.010 
come on the where there's a giant chasm
that<00:02:07.530> beats<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.130> five<00:02:08.640> other<00:02:08.850> castles<00:02:09.210> which

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
that beats like five other castles which

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.220 
that beats like five other castles which
is<00:02:10.259> some<00:02:10.649> eight<00:02:11.360> she<00:02:12.360> managed<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:14.660> Josh<00:02:15.660> didn't

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
is some eight she managed to Josh didn't

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.750 
is some eight she managed to Josh didn't
respond<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.830> when<00:02:17.370> he<00:02:19.310> get<00:02:20.310> matches

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
respond this when he get matches

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640 
respond this when he get matches
wellness<00:02:21.180> through<00:02:21.630> careful<00:02:22.080> planning<00:02:22.470> with

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
wellness through careful planning with

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.030 
wellness through careful planning with
the<00:02:22.770> seeds<00:02:23.040> um<00:02:23.850> she<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.959> basically<00:02:25.110> spawn<00:02:25.680> any
