we'll<00:00:52.509> mask<00:00:53.080> tape<00:00:53.739> up<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.040> guitar<00:00:54.159> to<00:00:54.909> what's

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
we'll mask tape up the guitar to what's

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:56.609 
we'll mask tape up the guitar to what's
appropriate<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.900> color<00:00:56.110> it's<00:00:56.320> going<00:00:56.470> to

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:56.619 
appropriate to the color it's going to

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.520 
appropriate to the color it's going to
become<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:57.250> become<00:00:57.839> on<00:00:58.839> a<00:00:58.869> dragon<00:00:59.320> they<00:00:59.379> get<00:00:59.500> a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
become to become on a dragon they get a

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.229 
become to become on a dragon they get a
rosewood<00:01:00.009> neck<00:01:00.040> no<00:01:00.549> finish

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
rosewood neck no finish

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.649

so<00:01:01.839> we<00:01:01.960> mask<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.379> neck<00:01:02.559> off<00:01:02.739> with<00:01:03.009> paper<00:01:03.659> to

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
so we mask the neck off with paper to

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.080 
so we mask the neck off with paper to
protect<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:05.199> from<00:01:05.379> stain<00:01:08.790> anything<00:01:09.790> that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
protect it from stain anything that

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.870 
protect it from stain anything that
could<00:01:10.240> hurt<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.540> also<00:01:11.430> we're<00:01:12.430> standing<00:01:12.759> only

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
could hurt it also we're standing only

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.249 
could hurt it also we're standing only
the<00:01:13.090> maple<00:01:13.420> top<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:16.270> put<00:01:16.479> tape<00:01:16.689> lines<00:01:16.990> on

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
the maple top so we put tape lines on

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.380 
the maple top so we put tape lines on
there<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:18.189> protect<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.640> mahogany<00:01:19.119> from<00:01:19.299> the

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
stain and get a nice crisp line some

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.910 
stain and get a nice crisp line some
guitars<00:01:22.479> get<00:01:22.720> natural<00:01:23.140> back<00:01:23.290> so<00:01:23.590> these<00:01:23.740> have

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
guitars get natural back so these have

we<00:03:10.879> also<00:03:11.030> most<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.659> our<00:03:11.720> guitars<00:03:12.019> have<00:03:12.230> natural

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
we also most of our guitars have natural

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.149 
we also most of our guitars have natural
bindings<00:03:13.189> and<00:03:14.319> as<00:03:15.319> you<00:03:15.470> can<00:03:15.590> see<00:03:15.799> we<00:03:15.950> don't

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
bindings and as you can see we don't

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.690 
bindings and as you can see we don't
take<00:03:16.310> those<00:03:16.549> off<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:16.819> it's<00:03:17.239> all<00:03:18.700> practice

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
more beautiful you look closely you can

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.490 
more beautiful you look closely you can
actually<00:03:58.430> see<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.970> separation<00:03:59.420> colors

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
actually see the separation colors

it<00:04:01.310> almost<00:04:01.460> looks<00:04:01.820> 3d<00:04:02.590> you've<00:04:03.590> got<00:04:03.770> almost

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
it almost looks 3d you've got almost

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.800 
it almost looks 3d you've got almost
three<00:04:04.670> different<00:04:05.030> shades<00:04:05.210> of<00:04:05.390> yellow<00:04:05.600> there

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
three different shades of yellow there

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.690 
three different shades of yellow there
ranging<00:04:06.230> from<00:04:06.410> like<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.620> caramel<00:04:06.980> butterscotch

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
ranging from like a caramel butterscotch

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.450 
ranging from like a caramel butterscotch
all<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.060> way<00:04:08.150> up<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> neon<00:04:08.840> yellow<00:04:12.460> which

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
all the way up to a neon yellow which

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.420 
all the way up to a neon yellow which
obviously<00:04:14.000> as<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:14.960> see<00:04:15.080> yourself

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
obviously as you can see yourself

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:27.290 
obviously as you can see yourself
enhances<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.640> natural<00:04:16.790> beauty<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.420> wood

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.839 

all<00:04:27.750> right

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
all right

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.459 
all right
I<00:04:29.499> said<00:04:30.499> that's<00:04:30.679> one<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:30.979> our

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
I said that's one of our

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.999 
I said that's one of our
quicker<00:04:33.779> simpler<00:04:34.779> staying<00:04:35.080> jobs<00:04:35.409> but<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.889> can

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
quicker simpler staying jobs but you can

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.799 
quicker simpler staying jobs but you can
see<00:04:36.159> actually<00:04:36.489> how<00:04:36.849> beautiful<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.419> is<00:04:37.539> now

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:37.809 
see actually how beautiful it is now

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:41.790 
see actually how beautiful it is now
from<00:04:38.559> this<00:04:38.800> point<00:04:40.080> we<00:04:41.080> would<00:04:41.229> pull<00:04:41.439> the<00:04:41.559> tape

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
from this point we would pull the tape

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.100 
from this point we would pull the tape
cut<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.849> binding<00:04:43.029> which<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.569> essentially

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
cut the binding which is essentially

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.019 
cut the binding which is essentially
rounding<00:04:44.529> over<00:04:44.769> the<00:04:44.889> edge<00:04:45.039> with<00:04:45.279> sandpaper<00:04:45.610> by

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:46.029 
rounding over the edge with sandpaper by

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:48.809 
rounding over the edge with sandpaper by
hand<00:04:46.360> so<00:04:46.989> you<00:04:47.050> get<00:04:47.199> this<00:04:47.319> nice<00:04:47.580> uniform<00:04:48.580> line

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
hand so you get this nice uniform line

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.979 
hand so you get this nice uniform line
it<00:04:49.389> traces<00:04:49.869> the<00:04:49.989> top<00:04:50.819> from<00:04:51.819> that<00:04:51.969> point<00:04:52.209> we

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:52.989 
it traces the top from that point we

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:55.469 
it traces the top from that point we
spray<00:04:53.229> a<00:04:53.259> sealer<00:04:53.619> on<00:04:53.739> the<00:04:53.949> guitar<00:04:54.279> grain<00:04:55.149> fill

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
spray a sealer on the guitar grain fill

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.339 
spray a sealer on the guitar grain fill
it<00:04:56.729> let<00:04:57.729> all<00:04:57.879> that<00:04:58.029> dry<00:04:58.300> then<00:04:58.719> it<00:04:58.839> goes<00:04:58.989> on<00:04:59.139> to

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
it let all that dry then it goes on to

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.290 
it let all that dry then it goes on to
the<00:04:59.439> next<00:04:59.619> stage<00:04:59.860> which<00:05:00.519> would<00:05:00.729> be<00:05:00.819> base<00:05:01.059> coat

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
the next stage which would be base coat

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.119 
the next stage which would be base coat
spray

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.129 

yes
