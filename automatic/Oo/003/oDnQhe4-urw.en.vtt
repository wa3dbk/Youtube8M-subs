 Hello, your friend from the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.840
 tutorials in this video I'm going to 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.840
 teach how to activate aero in windows 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.450
 7 is for all windows versions 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.730
 7 remember that in windows basic and 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.500
 starter does not reach this function and that in 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.080
 some machines that have other 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.090
 versions of windows 7 is not active 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.700
 well this is about this tutorial 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.340
 activate the aero and all its effects in 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.350
 windows with this simple program that 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.750
 I'll leave you in the description of 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.790
 video we can activate our hero to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.280
 have all the effects as are the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.800
 windows start menu and the bar 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.720
 transparent tasks and how can you 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.000
 notice I do not have the aero activated in me 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.670
 computer deactivates it to show them 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.619
 that works to continue with the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.380
 activation the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.600
 is to download the file once 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.210
 downloaded the program we are going to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.400
 run it as an administrator for it 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.500
 we right click and execute it as 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.650
 administrator once opened is very 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.230
 easy to handle 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.690
 it is very important for it to be disabled 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.420
 the aero that the box is not checked and 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.670
 if we have it marked, we can highlight it and 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.950
 we click on the button that they say able 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.500
 to hero and we wait for the end of 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.780
 activate the aero on our pc once 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.940
 that it finishes activating we will leave the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.820
 next window which tells us that 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.760
 the aero is already activated and how could 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.530
 notice we already have the start menu 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.560
 transparent the windows and the bar 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.560
 chores 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.150
 and if for some reason we want 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.020
 deactivate aero only we will have to 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.330
 reopen the program 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.140
 we give you a right click and execute it 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.200
 as administrator 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.780
 here we mark the box and click on 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.380
 the button that says of saber aero and we see 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.330
 how the effects of the aero are deactivated 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.150
 and to activate it again we do the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.220
 same steps good friends this has been 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.830
