cut<00:03:01.950> express<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.150> wanted<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> go<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.690> pro

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
cut express and I wanted to go to pro

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.660 
cut express and I wanted to go to pro
and<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> just<00:03:04.470> kind<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.740> kept<00:03:04.950> moving<00:03:05.100> up<00:03:05.490> the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and I just kind of kept moving up the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.910 
and I just kind of kept moving up the
ladder<00:03:05.820> until<00:03:06.270> announced<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.170> professional

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
ladder until announced a professional

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.950 
ladder until announced a professional
suite<00:03:08.280> level<00:03:08.550> which<00:03:08.910> i<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.540> use<00:03:09.600> and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
suite level which i like to use and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.870 
suite level which i like to use and
honestly<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.950> mostly<00:03:11.340> because<00:03:11.490> i<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:11.760> to

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
honestly it's mostly because i like to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.430 
honestly it's mostly because i like to
keep<00:03:12.000> pushing<00:03:12.390> myself<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.900> learning<00:03:13.260> even

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
keep pushing myself to learning even

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.260 
keep pushing myself to learning even
though<00:03:13.590> each<00:03:13.770> jump<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.460> each<00:03:14.640> new<00:03:14.880> editing

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
though each jump to each new editing

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.720 
though each jump to each new editing
software<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.960> really<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> huge<00:03:16.950> step<00:03:17.310> for<00:03:17.610> me

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
software is really a huge step for me

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.220 
software is really a huge step for me
because<00:03:18.330> i<00:03:18.450> feel<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.780> i've<00:03:18.900> got<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.140> learn

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
because i feel like i've got to learn

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.990 
because i feel like i've got to learn
everything<00:03:19.470> all<00:03:19.860> over<00:03:19.920> again<00:03:20.250> but<00:03:20.700> i<00:03:20.760> just

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
everything all over again but i just

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.240 
everything all over again but i just
forced<00:03:21.510> myself<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.260> even<00:03:22.590> though<00:03:23.010> it

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
forced myself to do it even though it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.460 
forced myself to do it even though it
takes<00:03:23.670> me<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.000> six<00:03:24.390> times<00:03:24.630> longer<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.200> make<00:03:25.410> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
takes me like six times longer to make a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.930 
takes me like six times longer to make a
video<00:03:25.680> at<00:03:25.980> first<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.490> didn't<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
video at first and it didn't like the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.120 
video at first and it didn't like the
old<00:03:27.120> software<00:03:27.450> was<00:03:27.660> using<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.320> just<00:03:28.530> forcing

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
old software was using but just forcing

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.250 
old software was using but just forcing
myself<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.580> take<00:03:29.820> that<00:03:29.970> step<00:03:30.030> actually<00:03:30.870> it's

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
myself to take that step actually it's

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.830 
myself to take that step actually it's
done<00:03:31.500> really<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> lot<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.790> help<00:03:32.940> me<00:03:33.209> move<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.750> to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
done really a lot to help me move and to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.690 
done really a lot to help me move and to
grow<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.350> not<00:03:34.560> only<00:03:34.770> these<00:03:35.130> videos<00:03:35.520> with

speed<00:04:33.990> set<00:04:34.350> at<00:04:34.380> 100<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.550> have<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.940> depth<00:04:36.270> of

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
speed set at 100 and I have the depth of

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.820 
speed set at 100 and I have the depth of
field<00:04:36.750> or<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.230> f-stop<00:04:37.800> set<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.730> 2.8<00:04:39.690> so<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:40.410> back

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
field or the f-stop set to 2.8 so I back

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.460 
field or the f-stop set to 2.8 so I back
up<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.280> i<00:04:41.340> zoom<00:04:41.580> all<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.910> way<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.169> I<00:04:43.200> get<00:04:43.440> a

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
up and i zoom all the way in so I get a

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.020 
up and i zoom all the way in so I get a
shallow<00:04:43.800> depth<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.250> field<00:04:44.310> on<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.820> white

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
shallow depth of field on the white

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.360 
shallow depth of field on the white
background<00:04:45.210> behind<00:04:45.630> me<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.710> way<00:04:46.950> like

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
background behind me and that way like

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.800 
background behind me and that way like
there's<00:04:47.790> actually<00:04:48.120> a<00:04:48.150> lot<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.360> wrinkles<00:04:48.570> in

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
there's actually a lot of wrinkles in

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.840 
there's actually a lot of wrinkles in
there<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.110> stuff<00:04:49.290> as<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.500> can<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:49.889> but<00:04:50.250> using

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
there and stuff as you can see but using

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.210 
there and stuff as you can see but using
a<00:04:50.910> shallow<00:04:51.180> depth<00:04:51.540> of<00:04:51.750> field<00:04:51.810> on<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.380> lens

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
a shallow depth of field on the lens

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.220 
a shallow depth of field on the lens
actually<00:04:53.820> blurs<00:04:54.090> most<00:04:54.419> of<00:04:54.540> that<00:04:54.630> out<00:04:54.840> making

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
actually blurs most of that out making

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.020 
actually blurs most of that out making
it<00:04:55.350> look<00:04:55.560> pretty<00:04:55.590> white<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.370> actually<00:04:56.730> looks

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
it look pretty white and actually looks

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.110 
it look pretty white and actually looks
pretty<00:04:57.660> well<00:04:58.100> pretty<00:04:59.100> good<00:04:59.310> for<00:04:59.910> the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
pretty well pretty good for the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.300 
pretty well pretty good for the
microphone<00:05:00.630> i'm<00:05:00.930> using<00:05:01.200> just<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.530> standard

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
microphone i'm using just a standard

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.520 
microphone i'm using just a standard
lapel<00:05:02.730> mic<00:05:03.000> as<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> sense<00:05:03.570> Heiser<00:05:03.780> right<00:05:04.200> there

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
lapel mic as a sense Heiser right there

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.220 
lapel mic as a sense Heiser right there
and<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:06.270> know<00:05:06.390> if<00:05:06.510> maybe<00:05:06.690> you<00:05:06.870> see<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.050> better

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
and you know if maybe you see a better

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.520 
and you know if maybe you see a better
right<00:05:07.410> there<00:05:07.650> theres<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.190> mic<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:09.530> I'm

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
right there theres the mic and I'm

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.680 
right there theres the mic and I'm
actually<00:05:10.800> recording<00:05:11.669> directly<00:05:12.000> into<00:05:12.600> the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
actually recording directly into the

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.240 
actually recording directly into the
camera<00:05:12.900> now<00:05:13.320> I<00:05:13.350> just<00:05:13.560> started<00:05:13.919> doing<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.130> for

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
camera now I just started doing this for

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.430 
camera now I just started doing this for
like<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.430> past<00:05:14.460> two<00:05:14.910> or<00:05:14.940> three<00:05:15.090> videos

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
like the past two or three videos

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.880 
like the past two or three videos
because<00:05:16.490> sitting<00:05:17.490> right<00:05:17.640> here<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:18.060> used<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.890> as

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
because sitting right here I used to as

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.130 
because sitting right here I used to as
you<00:05:20.400> can<00:05:20.460> see<00:05:20.580> I'm<00:05:20.790> using<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.330> custom<00:05:21.540> firmware

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
you can see I'm using a custom firmware

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.400 
you can see I'm using a custom firmware
called<00:05:22.350> magic<00:05:22.740> lantern<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.580> actually<00:05:24.060> has

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
called magic lantern that actually has

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.290 
called magic lantern that actually has
you<00:05:25.410> know<00:05:25.500> audio<00:05:25.889> meters<00:05:26.280> on<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.790> and<00:05:27.000> it

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
you know audio meters on it and it

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.450 
you know audio meters on it and it
disables<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.050> automatic<00:05:28.590> gain<00:05:28.800> control<00:05:28.830> that

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
disables the automatic gain control that

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.600 
disables the automatic gain control that
is<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:29.700> problem<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.419> most<00:05:30.660> DSLRs<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:32.250> boost

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
is a problem on most DSLRs that boost

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.460 
is a problem on most DSLRs that boost
the<00:05:32.820> audio<00:05:32.850> when<00:05:33.330> it's<00:05:33.479> too<00:05:33.660> quiet<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.260> makes

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
the audio when it's too quiet and makes

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.100 
the audio when it's too quiet and makes
it<00:05:34.620> like<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> terrible<00:05:35.550> hissing<00:05:36.000> buzzing<00:05:36.240> like

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
it like a terrible hissing buzzing like

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.490 
it like a terrible hissing buzzing like
noise<00:05:37.500> in<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.919> background<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:40.080> using

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
noise in the background and so the using

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.279 
noise in the background and so the using
magic<00:05:40.890> lantern<00:05:41.370> firmware<00:05:41.930> disables<00:05:42.930> that<00:05:43.110> and

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
magic lantern firmware disables that and

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.560 
magic lantern firmware disables that and
gives<00:05:43.440> you<00:05:43.560> tons<00:05:44.010> of<00:05:44.460> other<00:05:44.640> cool<00:05:45.510> features

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
gives you tons of other cool features

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.380 
gives you tons of other cool features
that<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.260> can<00:05:46.410> use<00:05:46.560> for<00:05:46.729> DSLR<00:05:47.729> video<00:05:47.850> cameras

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
that you can use for DSLR video cameras

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.969 
that you can use for DSLR video cameras
that<00:05:48.630> will<00:05:48.870> come<00:05:49.110> standard<00:05:49.470> or<00:05:49.590> like<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.740> high

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
that will come standard or like a high

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.219 
that will come standard or like a high
quality<00:05:50.490> professional<00:05:50.640> video<00:05:51.240> camera<00:05:51.630> but

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
quality professional video camera but

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.140 
quality professional video camera but
that<00:05:52.470> doesn't<00:05:52.950> on<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.100> DSLR<00:05:53.310> because<00:05:54.030> we're

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
that doesn't on a DSLR because we're

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.909 
that doesn't on a DSLR because we're
maybe<00:05:54.270> boasted<00:05:54.570> for<00:05:54.720> pictures<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:55.229> so<00:05:55.890> I

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
maybe boasted for pictures and so I

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.529 
maybe boasted for pictures and so I
loaded<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:56.520> firmware<00:05:56.789> on<00:05:57.090> here<00:05:57.240> now<00:05:57.390> I'm

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
loaded that firmware on here now I'm

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.140 
loaded that firmware on here now I'm
recording<00:05:57.930> directly<00:05:58.500> into<00:05:59.160> the<00:05:59.220> camera<00:05:59.400> this

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
recording directly into the camera this

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.980 
recording directly into the camera this
cord<00:06:00.720> right<00:06:00.930> here<00:06:00.990> goes<00:06:01.650> down<00:06:02.039> to<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:03.090> switch

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
cord right here goes down to a switch

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.020 
cord right here goes down to a switch
and<00:06:04.320> because<00:06:04.740> I<00:06:04.919> got<00:06:05.070> a<00:06:05.100> backup<00:06:05.430> far<00:06:05.820> away<00:06:05.940> from

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
and because I got a backup far away from

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.340 
and because I got a backup far away from
the<00:06:06.240> from<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:06.960> camera<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:08.910> can't<00:06:09.690> adjust<00:06:10.080> the

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
the from the camera I can't adjust the

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.370 
the from the camera I can't adjust the
focus<00:06:10.530> on<00:06:11.039> it<00:06:11.630> because<00:06:12.630> I<00:06:12.840> can't<00:06:13.140> obviously

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
focus on it because I can't obviously

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.400 
focus on it because I can't obviously
reach<00:06:14.039> it<00:06:14.310> to<00:06:14.580> just<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:14.970> focus<00:06:15.390> so<00:06:15.870> i<00:06:15.900> have<00:06:16.229> it

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
reach it to just the focus so i have it

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.350 
reach it to just the focus so i have it
set<00:06:16.440> up<00:06:16.650> they<00:06:16.860> had<00:06:16.979> the<00:06:17.160> lens<00:06:17.370> set<00:06:17.640> up<00:06:17.820> on<00:06:18.030> auto

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
set up they had the lens set up on auto

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.020 
set up they had the lens set up on auto
focus<00:06:18.960> and<00:06:19.250> basically<00:06:20.250> good<00:06:20.430> i<00:06:20.550> do<00:06:20.610> is<00:06:20.910> I'll

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
focus and basically good i do is I'll

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.130 
focus and basically good i do is I'll
just<00:06:21.180> stay<00:06:21.330> in<00:06:21.390> the<00:06:21.510> front<00:06:21.720> here<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.050> I'll

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
just stay in the front here and I'll

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.380 
just stay in the front here and I'll
hold<00:06:22.440> this<00:06:22.650> is<00:06:22.830> my<00:06:23.310> shutter<00:06:23.550> button<00:06:24.000> actually

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
hold this is my shutter button actually

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.890 
hold this is my shutter button actually
it's<00:06:24.479> just<00:06:24.630> a<00:06:24.690> remote<00:06:24.990> for<00:06:25.200> the<00:06:25.229> camera<00:06:25.650> and<00:06:25.860> it

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
it's just a remote for the camera and it

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.640 
it's just a remote for the camera and it
operates<00:06:27.900> just<00:06:27.990> like<00:06:28.169> the<00:06:28.380> shutter<00:06:28.590> button

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
operates just like the shutter button

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.460 
operates just like the shutter button
does<00:06:29.100> so<00:06:29.460> I<00:06:29.520> hold<00:06:29.700> it<00:06:29.789> halfway<00:06:30.030> and<00:06:30.600> it<00:06:31.020> focuses

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
does so I hold it halfway and it focuses

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.370 
does so I hold it halfway and it focuses
on<00:06:31.650> me<00:06:31.800> and<00:06:32.010> then<00:06:32.220> I<00:06:32.580> just<00:06:32.970> drop<00:06:33.630> it<00:06:33.840> because

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
on me and then I just drop it because

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.990 
on me and then I just drop it because
then<00:06:34.740> I'm<00:06:34.860> in<00:06:35.010> focus<00:06:35.340> from<00:06:35.460> this<00:06:35.610> far<00:06:35.789> away<00:06:35.820> so
