on<00:01:26.939> stirring<00:01:27.240> about<00:01:28.250> 30<00:01:29.250> seconds<00:01:30.170> when<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
on stirring about 30 seconds when you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.060 
on stirring about 30 seconds when you
stir<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.950> mix<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.549> cools<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.290> add<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
stir the mix it cools down so add the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.590 
stir the mix it cools down so add the
eggs<00:01:37.220> one<00:01:38.220> by<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.380> then<00:01:40.820> slowly<00:01:41.820> mix<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
eggs one by one and then slowly mix it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.780 
eggs one by one and then slowly mix it
until<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.649> combines<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.530> after<00:01:47.159> adding<00:01:47.549> both

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
until it combines so after adding both

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.050 
until it combines so after adding both
eggs<00:01:48.259> keep<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.619> stirring<00:01:49.950> using<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.759> spatula

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
eggs keep on stirring using a spatula

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.030 
eggs keep on stirring using a spatula
and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.290> becomes<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.040> smooth<00:01:53.880> paste<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.689> this

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
and it becomes a smooth paste like this

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
and it becomes a smooth paste like this
so<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.490> am<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.270> put<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.689> into<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.200> piping

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
so I am going to put that into a piping

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.760 
so I am going to put that into a piping
bag<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.430> star<00:01:59.579> nozzle<00:02:00.530> after<00:02:01.530> putting

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
bag with a star nozzle after putting

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.490 
bag with a star nozzle after putting
that<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> piping<00:02:02.939> bag<00:02:02.969> use<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> tray<00:02:04.229> like

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that into the piping bag use a tray like

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.200 
that into the piping bag use a tray like
this<00:02:04.530> Oh<00:02:05.189> even

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this Oh even

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.200 
this Oh even
increase<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.920> mark<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.399> circle<00:02:08.940> or

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
increase that you can mark the circle or

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.590 
increase that you can mark the circle or
you<00:02:09.570> can<00:02:09.810> use<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.020> metal<00:02:10.350> mesh<00:02:10.979> tool

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
you can use a metal mesh tool

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.410 
you can use a metal mesh tool
so<00:02:12.600> take<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.170> piping<00:02:13.620> bag<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.540> slowly<00:02:15.540> pipe

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
so take the piping bag and slowly pipe

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.560 
so take the piping bag and slowly pipe
one<00:02:18.420> star<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.320> into<00:02:20.160> each<00:02:20.640> hole<00:02:21.150> or

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
one star like this into each hole or

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.360 
one star like this into each hole or
onto<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.410> baking<00:02:22.709> sheet<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:24.800> piped<00:02:25.800> several

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
onto the baking sheet I piped several

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.840 
onto the baking sheet I piped several
different<00:02:27.140> patterns<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.890> comes<00:02:29.220> back<00:02:29.400> to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
different patterns but it comes back to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.890 
different patterns but it comes back to
a<00:02:30.060> certain<00:02:30.620> shape<00:02:31.790> if<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.090> don't<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
a certain shape if you don't have a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.350 
a certain shape if you don't have a
piping<00:02:34.320> bag<00:02:34.740> or<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.160> nozzle<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:35.760> always

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
piping bag or the nozzle you can always

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.330 
piping bag or the nozzle you can always
your<00:02:36.600> store<00:02:36.959> spoons<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.680> put<00:02:38.040> one<00:02:38.340> scoop<00:02:38.940> full

mix<00:02:41.340> into<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.940> baking<00:02:42.870> sheet<00:02:43.170> or<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.709> can<00:02:43.980> use

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
mix into the baking sheet or you can use

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.840 
mix into the baking sheet or you can use
an<00:02:44.489> ice<00:02:44.880> cream<00:02:44.910> scoop<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.310> goes<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
an ice cream scoop to so this goes to

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.949 
an ice cream scoop to so this goes to
