00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.750

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.219
 Ricardo Cohen and today I am going to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.609
 teach to play the cover of the song 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.760
 a lucky day of rome clock that the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.350
 sing alejandra guzmÃ¡n with moderatto ok 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.420
 this song is the acoustic cover 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 then I'm going to leave what are the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.890
 Chords of thickness in the description 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.750
 so that if they do not use them 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.780
 They can also play a small 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 intro if you want to touch the intern if 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.290
 not now we will only have what is the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.290
 accompaniment of the song 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.260
 we start the chords that we're going to 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.260
 use are going to be the following 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.730
 re 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.360
 this network variant that is receptive 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.360
 3 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.360
 Sun 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.119
 Y 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.869
 this variant of sun that I do not remember 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.869
 well the name 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.770
 all right 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.770
 two 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.540
 yes 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.540
 the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.810
 A) Yes 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.810
 sustained 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.500
 you 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.750
 3 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.030
 b flat if I'm not wrong 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.730
 the rhythm that we are going to use is going to be 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.540
 the next we position our fingers 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.540
 in network 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.299
 i 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.740
 I'm going to slow it down so they can 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.740
 to appreciate 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.050
 Y 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.209
 because but for beginners it can 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.209
 touch only four hours god down 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.260
 Well, once you've caught your rhythm 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.680
 you can already play the song 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.300
 ok we'll start with what is the stanza 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.220
 electro hall to play in slow and in the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.819
 four radios so they can appreciate 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.819
 time 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.200
 ok in this last part what I did was 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.540
 when he says an angel will come from 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.670
 let's start making a few more radios 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:31.880
 strong to punch the letter and 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:34.250
 to the choir once I could catch that we go 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.480
 with what is the chorus I'm going to put 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.580
 part of what is 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.260
 the last part of the stanza and 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.260
 we will start with the choir 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.190
 ok at the end of the chorus I also gave him the 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:35.390
 strum to enter what would be a 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.760
 an acoustic bridge will let us repeat the 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.150
 stroma and we will get what the bridge 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.240
 acoustic rasgueos rasgueos what 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.630
 I did when we got to we must if I did not 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.630
 mistaken 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.430
 ok then only in the last tips that 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.229
 would be that the beginners would try 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.030
 practice your cheeks that are 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.060
 important in this song 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.550
 servant and beginner you can put it in 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.740
 the four traits now if you want to give 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.850
 more intensity to the chorus what you can 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:24.460
 do is change it down and give it 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.780
 a light walk an example would be like this 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.200
 we position distributed between and 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.200
 we play 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:43.689
 or you can also do both 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:47.830
 the four can not only be the stanza 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:50.019
 to accept the singing of the song and in 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.819
 the choir is coming with the rhythm that 

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:53.819
 teaches the principle that is the circle 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.069
 What is it 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.680
 quick that teaches them and can be the 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.250
 pal choir and the 4 years down to 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.250
 the stanza 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.120
 and if nothing more than being what ice is 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:16.920
 acoustic I recommend you do the 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.830
 circle that at the beginning the first 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.480
 ok you can follow everything from lehman and here
