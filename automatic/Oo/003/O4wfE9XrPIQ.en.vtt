comes<00:02:31.769> with<00:02:31.980> six<00:02:32.280> different<00:02:32.699> arrows<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.329> have

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
comes with six different arrows you have

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.110 
comes with six different arrows you have
this<00:02:33.600> regular

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
this regular

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.869 
this regular
Eero<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.629> bola<00:02:34.930> arrow<00:02:35.290> these<00:02:35.950> both<00:02:36.489> look<00:02:36.730> like

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
Eero the bola arrow these both look like

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.399 
Eero the bola arrow these both look like
boomerang<00:02:37.480> arrows<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.080> thought<00:02:38.290> they're

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
boomerang arrows I thought they're

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.539 
boomerang arrows I thought they're
supposed<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.799> different<00:02:39.099> but<00:02:39.220> they<00:02:39.310> look

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
supposed to be different but they look

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.860 
supposed to be different but they look
very<00:02:39.580> very<00:02:40.060> similar<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.569> think<00:02:40.659> these<00:02:40.810> are

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
very very similar so I think these are

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.180 
very very similar so I think these are
both<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> boomerang<00:02:41.560> arrows<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.099> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
both the boomerang arrows this is the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.800 
both the boomerang arrows this is the
sonic<00:02:42.370> arrow<00:02:42.730> then<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.269> acid<00:02:43.420> tip

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
sonic arrow then this is the acid tip

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.570 
sonic arrow then this is the acid tip
arrow<00:02:43.989> like<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.590> gunmetal<00:02:44.980> color<00:02:45.129> that<00:02:45.489> they

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
arrow like that gunmetal color that they

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.039 
arrow like that gunmetal color that they
have<00:02:45.760> for<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.060> end<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.420> them<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.810> have

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
have for the end of them then you have

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.570 
have for the end of them then you have
some<00:02:47.230> nice<00:02:47.409> purple<00:02:47.739> paint<00:02:48.040> right<00:02:48.190> there<00:02:48.459> at

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.970 
the back of the head on this head sculpt
though<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.690> think<00:03:41.019> it's<00:03:41.200> about<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.530> same<00:03:41.739> kind

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
though I think it's about the same kind

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.500 
though I think it's about the same kind
of<00:03:42.010> hair<00:03:42.190> scope<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.639> we<00:03:42.700> got<00:03:42.849> before<00:03:43.239> but<00:03:43.450> I

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
of hair scope that we got before but I

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.640 
of hair scope that we got before but I
think<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:43.810> just<00:03:44.019> looks<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.380> little<00:03:44.410> bit

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
right side of their hip so that they

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.240 
right side of their hip so that they

could just grab them and shoot really

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.589 
could just grab them and shoot really
quickly<00:04:15.730> so<00:04:15.819> if<00:04:15.879> you<00:04:15.970> have<00:04:16.090> them<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.269> your<00:04:16.329> back

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
quickly so if you have them on your back

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:17.849 
quickly so if you have them on your back
and<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.900> jump<00:04:17.169> off<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.440> something<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.739> are

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
swivel side to side and they both hinge

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.150 
swivel side to side and they both hinge
up-and-down<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.110> wish<00:05:11.350> this<00:05:11.530> left<00:05:11.830> side<00:05:12.010> over

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
up-and-down I wish this left side over

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.800 
up-and-down I wish this left side over
here<00:05:12.280> had<00:05:12.670> a<00:05:12.700> hinge<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.090> moved<00:05:13.390> side-to-side

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
here had a hinge that moved side-to-side

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.420 
here had a hinge that moved side-to-side
like<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.230> rolling<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.620> dice<00:05:14.800> motion<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.400> you

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
like a rolling the dice motion so you

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.650 
like a rolling the dice motion so you
didn't<00:05:15.640> have<00:05:15.760> this<00:05:15.850> weird<00:05:16.090> angle<00:05:16.510> when<00:05:16.600> you

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
didn't have this weird angle when you

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.240 
didn't have this weird angle when you
straighten<00:05:16.930> out<00:05:17.110> his<00:05:17.260> elbow<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.740> have<00:05:18.160> him

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
straighten out his elbow and have him

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.380 
straighten out his elbow and have him
holding<00:05:18.490> it<00:05:18.640> like<00:05:18.760> that<00:05:18.880> I<00:05:18.940> think<00:05:19.030> that<00:05:19.240> looks

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
holding it like that I think that looks

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.480 
holding it like that I think that looks
a<00:05:19.480> bit<00:05:19.510> weird<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:20.350> diaphragm<00:05:20.830> joint<00:05:21.100> rotate

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
a bit weird the diaphragm joint rotate

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.520 
a bit weird the diaphragm joint rotate
side<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:21.880> side<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.120> bit<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.750> crunches<00:05:23.230> forward

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
side to side a bit it crunches forward

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.900 
side to side a bit it crunches forward
and<00:05:23.620> back<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:23.770> do<00:05:24.010> get<00:05:24.160> a<00:05:24.190> waist<00:05:24.490> joint<00:05:24.790> that

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
and back you do get a waist joint that

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.580 
and back you do get a waist joint that
works<00:05:25.090> out<00:05:25.240> very<00:05:25.510> well<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:26.200> belt<00:05:26.410> is<00:05:26.560> a

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
works out very well the belt is a

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
works out very well the belt is a
separate<00:05:26.920> piece<00:05:27.070> so<00:05:27.220> you<00:05:27.310> don't<00:05:27.430> have<00:05:27.490> to

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
separate piece so you don't have to

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.800 
separate piece so you don't have to
worry<00:05:27.730> about<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:28.060> hindering<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.630> waist

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
worry about that hindering the waist
