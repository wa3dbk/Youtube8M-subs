00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:11.639
 Hello, I guess many of you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:18.000
 heard what a puddle of years and with what their 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:21.769
 eat and generally how they play but there are people 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.359
 who don't know what it is 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:30.990
 I found some tutorial here 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.899
 online and here's a teacher here so 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.790
 flageolet is expressed is the sound made 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:44.910
 details when playing any string on 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.700
 the twelfth year while being published 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:54.469
 the sound is similar to the sound of a flute and it is just 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:01.469
 and the main difference from the simple 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:04.860
 play 12 frets shorter read a 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:10.290
 I want this definition 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.850
 To the author to answer directly in his own manner that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.070
 not every individual will be able to adequately 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.090
 integrate abstract situations 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.460
 both hemispheres of the brain are not 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.540
 falling into scientific despotism 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 It looks like this is the definition of a 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:35.810
 what is it really now we are to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:40.229
 let's do it easier 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.930
 explained here is 12 watts if the string is not 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.600
 press down 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.500
 but only to touch her she will 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.500
 sound on the attack 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.250
 but 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:04.600
 this is a flageolet and it's not easy 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.599
 Flageolet is natural flageolets 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.110
 well, why is the author of this tutorial 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.150
 write that only on the 12th fret 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.900
 natural flageoles sound the same on 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.900
 fifth and seventh 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.240
 in 11 and on each string 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.890
 Here it is natural flageolet on fifth 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.110
 seventh and 12th fret 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.390
 not only on the twelfth but still there 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.240
 artificial artificial harmonics 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.720
 flagpoles 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:55.340
 can be extracted absolutely on any 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:03:00.320
 fret how are they removed after 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:04.080
 pick picks strings right away 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.290
 the strings slightly touches here finger 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.160
 This place turns out so Chick Chick 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.580
 chick chick 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.580
 in practice 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.920
 sweaty fingers 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.540
 but 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.560
 this is the phase and the summer is used 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.310
 they for 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.310
 most cases for embellishment 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.519
 music in heavy styles in classical 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.510
 the guitar they practically do not apply a 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:17.819
 if applied to the same 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.819
 embellishment somehow u so here it is 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:21.140
 Well, about you understand what it is 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:23.770
 Flagolet natural when artificial 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.770
 when 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.170
 on any fret artificial again 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.870
 I repeat when you see here on camera 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:44.480
 like this journalist baths immediately 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.460
 finger touched her a little 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:52.290
 practice when not long played 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:55.430
 Zion and I do pretty well 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.590
 it's a matter of training so train 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.430
 subscribe to my channel i will 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.760
 explain 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:10.610
 Here are such a tricky expression in itself 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:10.610
 teachers in plain language to all bye
