00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.030
 if you like cats but for some 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.550
 reason you can not have one in your house you 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.890
 we have great news just opened 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.990
 in the colony roma a cat coffee a place 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.480
 where you can live and play with these 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.810
 adorable felines will see what 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.810
 about 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.329
 cat cafes are very popular in japan 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.149
 because it is not so easy to have a 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.699
 mascot the idea seemed great to 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.489
 esther already marks owners of the battery and 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.079
 they decided to adapt it to mexico nothing more 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.600
 that the concept is not exactly the same 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 how did you think about putting a coffee here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.159
 in the city â€‹â€‹of mexico we sell them 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.850
 thinking for a long time because from 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.880
 the 90s in japan and taiwan are the wave 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.770
 then just this place was vacated in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 December of last year and we said is the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.780
 just time to put to put 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.539
 our coffee as was the adaptation of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.729
 Japanese concept to the city of Mexico 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.679
 in fact they work differently because 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.330
 Asians are rather for people who 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.820
 lives in very small spaces that do not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280
 have the option of adopting a cat that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.740
 loves but can not have them living with 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 they then basic you live with the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.750
 data that are not up for adoption in this 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.390
 case we adopt the model of europe and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.580
 USA where the data come from shelters 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.429
 authorized are sterilized healthy 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.560
 vaccinated everything then you can also 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.569
 you come to know an adult cat that are 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.920
 those who have fewer opportunities 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.920
 after being adopted 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.230
 We met pepper a tricolor cat 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.570
 of extremely friendly long hair and 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.200
 Chatter was also with us 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.160

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.740
 gallant and friendly nene is a rayadito 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.720
 with white that is always hidden is 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.510
 the most timid but also the most 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.670
 good-natured what are the rules for 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.920

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.990
 disinfect your hands before central not 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.170
 you have to take pictures with flash you do not have to 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.060
 bother sleeping cats you have to leave them 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.040

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.310
 tail is going to annoy you in any 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.740

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.010
 food that the place offers we have coffees

 American express Americans we have 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.880
 infusions mutis and the star that is the 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.410
 infusion of meat this herb is a 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.330
 grass that cats adore in 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.300
 They are crazy 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.660
 plant of the mint family 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.000
 so 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.110
 the taste is rich in itself but we 're going 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.110
 to emphasize with green tea 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.040

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.160
 just look at them which is very 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.320
 therapeutic and relaxing the cat coffee is 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.060
 the battery extension the store 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.550

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.210
 adopt 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.310

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.310
 advantage of catch coffee is that you can 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.860
