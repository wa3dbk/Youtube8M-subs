00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:13.360
 Pinto speaks my dear my dear 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.190
 Welcome to another class of the 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.380
 project in action 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.820
 Ah, I am Professor Arthur than in 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.780
 vestibular psi responsible for 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.730
 biology 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.029
 in this partnership that we are doing 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.240
 then with the chemical channels in action 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.250
 total physics and all math is you 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.739
 You can then visit our 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.210
 facebook and no action and there you go 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.370
 find all the channels that are 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.300
 being part of this project all the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.460
 video-lessons that we are putting 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.969
 for you so you can bust in 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.889
 and either 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.289
 I work with biology so we 

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:46.329
 will see a small issue of enem people 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.100
 solve together you can understand what it is 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.799
 which is the mother that we are going to use 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.780
 let's take a look at the good question like 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.579
 It's customary on enem if you're already 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.209
 watching our videos and knows 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.979
 of this 

00:00:55.209 --> 00:01:00.269
 we have a little testicle here in 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.799
 and a question about this text 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.330
 how are you if you are already 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.590
 accompanying I like to read always 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.240
 first question 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.560
 then the text for us to know what the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.470
 people have to look at that text then 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.250
 the question said to people without 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.320
 control 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.330
 these animals can invade rivers and lakes 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.820
 to reproduce 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.030
 so we have animals, look who it is 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.710
 talking to people who do not 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.260
 are part of this river environment 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.940
 and natural lakes that they will 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.410
 play there they can generate some 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.300
 Let's have a look at the text. 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.780
 Just so we do not get confused. 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.210
 look there is not today that man creates 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.370
 artificially variety of fish by 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.590
 through hybridization this is a technique 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.510
 widely used by scientists and 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.880
 fish farmers because the hybrids 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.100
 resulting in general has the highest 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.480
 commercial value than the average of both 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.090
 the parental species 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.980
 in addition to reducing overfishing in the environment 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.240
 It's natural that this matter of 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.850
 Guys, it's a question, is this a 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.710
 ecology and we can use 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.680
 some knowledge there of arising 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.120
 because this technique 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.209
 so it's up to you to pick up 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.100
 variations within the same species 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.730
 cross these variations between 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 generating variations that you care about 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.830
 so for example if we start 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.600
 make a selective cross between beings 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.670
 Let's give this example to you. 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.890
 try to understand a little better I want 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.220
 generate higher and higher humans 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.980
 so what I do is I only allow 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.330
 the big boys have children with each other 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.790
 So, you 're going to get a guy, not a rule. 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.310
 will not cross won the big river you 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.080
 from this generation, daughter, two 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.060
 I said he has a son 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.140
 as the generations go by the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.160
 descendants are becoming increasingly 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.800
 larger 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.090
 so it's something similar that people 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.600
 ends up doing these creations then, right? 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.790
 for commercial purposes in order to have a 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.410
 generation, for example after some 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.820
 crosses that it has a value 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.380
 market and that it is more 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.240
 legal uniform from the point of view 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.270
 commercial this is so cool what goes 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.670
 as the ecological problem and 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.860
 possibly in this situation 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.200
 reminds us of the synthetic theory of return 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.370
 Remember if you're not just watching the time. 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200
 that we have on our channel than 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.330
 us and vestibular 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200
 You will understand bacaninha what the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.970
 people are talking 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.640
 if you remember if everything is right in the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.200
 your head you will know that inside 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.490
 one species we have different 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.920
 variations and on these variations 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.510
 environmental factors act 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.870
 selecting the best variations 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.080
 adapted and these variations better 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.300
 adapted they thrive while the 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.210
 less adapted end up dying is over 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.490
 not having success in this ability what 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.910
 can happen then when people generate 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.260
 these hybrids then selected the 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.530
 people make these selected crosses 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.070
 we were generating selected hybrids 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.140
 such hybrids may be included in the 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.640
 natural environment and then we will have 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.780
 a competition recalls the competition that 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.040
 can happen 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.109
 among these individuals who are 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.720
 occupying the same environment there 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.360
 ecology then these same individuals 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.710
 environment they can compete with 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.389
 natural species with the 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.580
 that were already 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:34.159
 li and possibly will have more advantage 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.129
 in this environment, ie the factors 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:40.009
 can select hybrids 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.050
 that we created and extinguished 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.659
 original species 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.879
 all right then displayed can be inserted 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.400
 in the natural environment and generate 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:52.550
 competition with the natural and 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.759
 extinguished aim to replace genetically 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.860
 speaking they will replace the species 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.479
 the natural variations that were there 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.729
 in that right environment so let's give 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.590
 a glimpse into the alternatives to it 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.949
 alternative says that a new 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.939
 polycord poly blog type means 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.770
 that he will have a karyotype 3 n 4 m 5 n 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.870
 It's going to mix cell, there's nothing to it. 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.360
 see what we 're talking about looks 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.580
 alternative to genetically replace 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.529
 the natural species is perfect 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.689
 alternative alternative b 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.370
 If you understood if you liked this 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.439
 video if you want to keep up with our 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.180
 I work only if you sign it. 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.439
 it is not possible to stipulate es watch 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.409
 the videos leave our partners 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:37.939
 in this project and no action to follow 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.889
 this whole process that we are 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.139
 doing exercise resolution and the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.899
 video lessons from each of the channels right 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.779
 will have a very strong preparation for 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:47.990
 your baby to your college entrance exam and 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.120
 blast off 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.490
 I hope to see you celebrating the approval 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.500
 at the end of the year we see each other in the next 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.289
 A video, bye and bye. 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.909
 just one more little message if you've come to 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.560
 here is why you probably liked it 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.180
 my soul so I wanted to ask 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.949
 You give a little strength to 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.139
 People, if you come here, I'll be right there. 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.500
 I left you the link to our page 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.169
 on facebook and our twitter account 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.060
 then like it our page follows the 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.860
 people on twitter and if you enter 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.479
 our site has a lot of content 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.889
 Nice, we have text, we have people. 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.120
 more videos 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.919
 If you have any questions, we have 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.270
 a very cool forum here gives you 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.740
 take your doubts 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.629
 So this force we share 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.039
 with your friends, our work and 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:30.819
 Let's make this project grow every 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:30.819
 once more a grace
