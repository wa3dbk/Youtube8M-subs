00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
tangent here so I'm gonna end this video

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.509 
tangent here so I'm gonna end this video
here<00:02:31.989> but<00:02:32.530> hopefully<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.310> good

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519

example for you guys and and you didn't

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.740 
example for you guys and and you didn't
blueprint<00:02:35.920> with<00:02:36.099> it<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.459> see<00:02:37.000> what<00:02:37.209> you<00:02:37.599> can

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
blueprint with it and see what you can

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.559 
blueprint with it and see what you can
add<00:02:37.959> or<00:02:38.260> take<00:02:38.680> from<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:42.239> terrible<00:02:43.239> speech
