for<00:02:02.530> everyday<00:02:02.830> use<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.429> so<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.240> what<00:02:04.450> I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
for everyday use and so that is what I

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.450 
for everyday use and so that is what I
wear<00:02:04.720> every<00:02:05.140> single<00:02:05.410> day<00:02:05.710> it's<00:02:06.100> like<00:02:06.250> ten

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
wear every single day it's like ten

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.830 
wear every single day it's like ten
dollars<00:02:06.819> and<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:07.149> that<00:02:07.330> would<00:02:07.420> be<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.539> cheap

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
dollars and so that would be a cheap

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.809 
dollars and so that would be a cheap
fight<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.500> repurchase<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.340> being<00:02:09.580> said

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
fight to repurchase and that being said

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.080 
fight to repurchase and that being said

studio finish concealer and the reason i
picked<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.150> because<00:02:16.600> yes<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.080> like<00:02:17.170> one

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
picked this is because yes it's like one

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.080 
picked this is because yes it's like one
of<00:02:17.380> my<00:02:17.500> favorite<00:02:17.830> concealers<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:18.520> i<00:02:18.730> usually

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
of my favorite concealers but i usually

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.590 
of my favorite concealers but i usually
use<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.900> like<00:02:20.800> liquid<00:02:21.310> concealer<00:02:22.120> underneath

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
use a like liquid concealer underneath

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.510 
use a like liquid concealer underneath
my<00:02:22.840> eyes<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.470> I'm<00:02:23.770> only<00:02:23.980> picking<00:02:24.160> one

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
my eyes but I'm only picking one

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.890 
my eyes but I'm only picking one
concealer<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.240> I'd<00:02:25.360> rather<00:02:25.510> use<00:02:25.750> this

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
concealer so I'd rather use this

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.420 
concealer so I'd rather use this
underneath<00:02:26.230> my<00:02:26.470> eyes<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.100> my<00:02:27.190> blemishes

underneath my eyes and on my blemishes

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.360 
underneath my eyes and on my blemishes
because<00:02:27.880> liquid<00:02:28.090> concealer<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.930> usually<00:02:29.740> too

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
because liquid concealer is usually too

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.340 
because liquid concealer is usually too
light<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.940> use<00:02:31.300> on<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:32.319> any<00:02:33.870> spot<00:02:34.870> treatments

light to use on like any spot treatments
or<00:02:35.440> anything<00:02:35.740> like<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:36.970> why<00:02:37.120> I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
or anything like that so that is why I

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.000 
or anything like that so that is why I
picked<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:38.230> it's<00:02:38.350> just<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.560> concealer
