00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.920
 to make cannelloni we will need 18 squares of fresh pasta intended for 4 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.789
 people 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:16.049

 just an onion of milk enough to distal enough basil 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.130
 let's wait 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.700
 a non-stick high pot in this way where I'll go for a sauté of 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 simply smell 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.450
 a bit in the classic recipe 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 just fry the onion open it. 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.350
 I allow myself to make a small variation, I don't want the author 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.410
 the recipe that surely 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.389
 teacher 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.850
 very prepared as it is an indecent specialized book 

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:03.340
 emilianet 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.340
 but I will also add 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 celery and carrot because when I want to make a good ragù 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.320
 I do it with all the smells of the case 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.850
 well now that there is a nice TV ceiling 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.210
 you can't give me just one onion 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.840
 it seemed a little 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.690
 wasted 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.130
 the pulp 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.180
 sky pork beef tested to the already bought so 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 the part but also to you 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 that we do color the late peaks 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 I add a pinch of salt 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.920
 faded with 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.100
 the milk white wine the temperature has reached quite high 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.540
 solar strike school 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.360
 I would say that meanwhile daewoo 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.460
 is cooking I can put 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.460
 the tomato puree that the last pass 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.809
 a pinch of sugar 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.669
 that is, avoid 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.249
 let there be acidity down the flame 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.249
 I really let that fire 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.630
 face text 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.320
 every now and then i give jelly to check enpa no it did cool me down 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.070
 I recommend therefore I have now already prepared wherever I am this morning and I have it 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.760
 made to cool because then we will make the filling of fresh cannelloni pasta 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:45.809
 for reasons long ago or preferred avantage weapons in doing it 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.920
 detail the part that shoes me 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.629
 just to show you 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.629
 recipe 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 I go to 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.559
 to pass it 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.559
 in research history 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.069
 sun lighter then surface remains 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.229
 then the pasta they sink is in contact with it 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.529
 so as not to attach more traditionalists, however 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:35.789
 continue to put it and I do so 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.959
 to please everyone 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.569
 cooking pasta

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.790
 urago sell and that cold because if we didn't use it hot 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.749
 the next ingredients if we go 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.169
 to add 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.279

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.979

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.259
 optional 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.680
 then mix 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.680
 all 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:54.090
