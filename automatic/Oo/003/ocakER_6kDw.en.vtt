does not also has a shorter screen but I
want<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.609> go<00:00:59.730> through<00:01:00.120> mainly<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.199> processing

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
want to go through mainly the processing

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.759

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
differences I have run all the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.080 
differences I have run all the
applications<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.070> i<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> new

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090

real<00:01:15.390> racing<00:01:15.930> 3<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> seems<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> work

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
real racing 3 and it seems to work

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.840 
real racing 3 and it seems to work
although<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.220> slow<00:01:20.640> i've

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
although it is a little bit slow i've

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.870 
although it is a little bit slow i've
run<00:01:21.090> asphalt<00:01:21.780> 7<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.380> graphics<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.280> processor

unfortunately it did take up it did jump

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.130 
unfortunately it did take up it did jump
around<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.119> wasn't<00:01:33.450> not<00:01:33.930> a

around a little bit and it wasn't not a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.190 
around a little bit and it wasn't not a
good<00:01:34.409> plane<00:01:34.799> experience<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.299> unlike<00:01:36.930> other

good plane experience but unlike other

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.260 
good plane experience but unlike other
things<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.799> may<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.040> heard<00:01:38.340> from<00:01:39.030> around

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270

get a lot of things here the camera you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.749 
get a lot of things here the camera you
know<00:01:53.790> its<00:01:53.909> lesser<00:01:54.270> quality<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:56.430> do<00:01:56.610> not

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
know its lesser quality but you do not

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.459 
know its lesser quality but you do not
have<00:01:56.969> panorama<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> even<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> new

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
intensive but

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.600 
intensive but
it's<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.860> little<00:02:12.130> bit<00:02:12.280> slow<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> open<00:02:13.630> up<00:02:14.610> I'm

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
it's a little bit slow to open up I'm

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's a little bit slow to open up I'm
going<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.790> be<00:02:15.910> doing<00:02:16.030> more<00:02:16.500> coverage<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.710> this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
going to be doing more coverage on this

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.130 
going to be doing more coverage on this
phone<00:02:18.460> because<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.880> know<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.780> available

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
online you can probably get this from

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.390 
online you can probably get this from
anywhere<00:02:22.510> from<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.960> hundred<00:02:23.470> dollars<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.100> fifty

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.700 
is black it is the eight gigabyte
version<00:02:30.310> as<00:02:30.940> well<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.390> for<00:02:32.260> most<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.620> these

comparisons<00:02:33.220> I'm<00:02:33.670> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.150> running<00:02:34.390> this

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
comparisons I'm going to be running this

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.810 
comparisons I'm going to be running this
on<00:02:34.780> Wi-Fi<00:02:35.320> just<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.310> show<00:02:36.490> you<00:02:36.520> what<00:02:36.760> the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
on Wi-Fi just to show you what the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.750 
on Wi-Fi just to show you what the
capabilities<00:02:37.000> are<00:02:37.630> just<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.650> begin<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.280> seems

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
capabilities are just to begin it seems

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.390 
capabilities are just to begin it seems
it<00:02:40.210> seems<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.320> has<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.830> greater

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
it seems that it has a greater

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.980 
it seems that it has a greater
capability<00:02:43.180> at<00:02:43.300> capturing<00:02:43.960> Wi-Fi<00:02:44.820> which

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
capability at capturing Wi-Fi which

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.380 
capability at capturing Wi-Fi which
means<00:02:46.990> for<00:02:47.200> example<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.710> was<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.100> mall<00:02:48.390> using

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
means for example I was in a mall using

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.620 
means for example I was in a mall using
both<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.930> these<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:51.460> allowed<00:02:52.270> me<00:02:52.300> to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
both of these and it allowed me to

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.130 
both of these and it allowed me to
connect<00:02:52.930> on<00:02:53.080> Wi-Fi<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.980> lot<00:02:54.520> quicker<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.420> here

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
connect on Wi-Fi a lot quicker on here

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.740 
connect on Wi-Fi a lot quicker on here
and<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.800> gave<00:02:57.040> me<00:02:57.280> much<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.850> much<00:02:58.240> more<00:02:58.420> reliable

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and it gave me much a much more reliable

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.280 
and it gave me much a much more reliable
signal<00:03:00.060> then<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.210> iphone<00:03:01.510> 5<00:03:01.720> which<00:03:01.960> shocked

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
signal then the iphone 5 which shocked

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.640 
signal then the iphone 5 which shocked
me<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.560> little<00:03:02.800> bit<00:03:03.040> i<00:03:03.340> was<00:03:04.120> able<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.660> go<00:03:05.170> move

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
me a little bit i was able to go move

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.160 
me a little bit i was able to go move
around<00:03:05.950> with<00:03:06.160> both<00:03:06.400> devices<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:07.360> i<00:03:07.870> could

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
around with both devices and i could

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.380 
around with both devices and i could
keep<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.650> signal<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.070> life<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.430> on<00:03:09.640> here<00:03:09.850> longer

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
keep the signal of life I on here longer

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.930 
keep the signal of life I on here longer
