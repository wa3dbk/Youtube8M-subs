breathing<00:01:41.149> cool<00:01:41.330> air<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.660> just<00:01:41.780> pour<00:01:41.990> it

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
breathing cool air and just pour it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.300 
breathing cool air and just pour it
right<00:01:42.080> in<00:01:42.229> your<00:01:42.259> events<00:01:42.619> inside<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.979> vehicle

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
right in your events inside the vehicle

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.130 
right in your events inside the vehicle
that's<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.610> great<00:01:43.729> chip<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.209> now<00:01:44.390> if<00:01:44.600> this<00:01:44.810> says

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
that's a great chip so now if this says

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.109 
that's a great chip so now if this says
it's<00:01:45.740> not<00:01:45.920> getting<00:01:46.250> as<00:01:46.340> cool<00:01:46.520> as<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.700> want<00:01:46.940> or

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
it's not getting as cool as you want or

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.180 
it's not getting as cool as you want or
worse<00:01:47.330> no<00:01:47.690> it's<00:01:48.110> not<00:01:48.319> getting<00:01:48.619> as<00:01:48.709> you<00:01:49.009> want

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
worse no it's not getting as you want

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.620 
worse no it's not getting as you want
then<00:01:49.399> what<00:01:49.580> do<00:01:49.640> we<00:01:49.670> do<00:01:49.850> next<00:01:50.179> up<00:01:50.300> is<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.479> check

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
then what do we do next up is to check

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.749 
then what do we do next up is to check
the<00:01:50.720> compressor<00:01:50.929> in<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.229> vehicle<00:01:51.429> you<00:01:52.429> do<00:01:52.610> this

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
the compressor in a vehicle you do this

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.070 
the compressor in a vehicle you do this
is<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.030> have<00:01:53.209> a<00:01:53.270> person<00:01:53.600> staying<00:01:53.810> near<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
is you have a person staying near the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.540 
is you have a person staying near the
front<00:01:54.289> of<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.410> vehicle<00:01:54.530> yeah<00:01:55.039> somebody<00:01:55.459> else

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
front of the vehicle yeah somebody else

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.430 
front of the vehicle yeah somebody else
in<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.789> vehicle<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.179> AC<00:01:56.300> system<00:01:56.600> off<00:01:56.899> turn

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
in the vehicle the AC system off turn

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.590 
in the vehicle the AC system off turn
the<00:01:57.590> car<00:01:57.740> off<00:01:57.800> okay<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:59.090> turn<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.390> car<00:01:59.569> on

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
the car off okay you turn the car on

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.630 
the car off okay you turn the car on
then<00:02:00.140> have<00:02:00.319> them<00:02:00.410> engage<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.920> AC<00:02:01.069> system<00:02:01.429> on

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
then have them engage the AC system on

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.639 
then have them engage the AC system on
full<00:02:01.850> blast<00:02:01.880> have<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:02.780> ever<00:02:02.959> hear<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.319> click

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
full blast have you ever hear a click

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.070 
full blast have you ever hear a click
that's<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.490> compressor<00:02:04.970> engaging<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.929> you're

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
that's the compressor engaging so you're

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.900 
that's the compressor engaging so you're
good<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.319> go<00:02:06.349> compressor<00:02:06.979> is<00:02:07.069> working<00:02:07.459> so

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
good to go compressor is working so

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.130 
good to go compressor is working so
there's<00:02:08.060> some<00:02:08.179> other<00:02:08.330> issues<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.810> can<00:02:08.899> do<00:02:09.050> to

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
there's some other issues you can do to

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.110 
there's some other issues you can do to
help<00:02:09.170> fix<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.800> issue<00:02:09.950> if<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.759> don't<00:02:10.970> hear

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
help fix that issue if you don't hear

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.670 
help fix that issue if you don't hear
the<00:02:11.209> compressor<00:02:11.660> come<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:11.990> stop<00:02:12.410> right<00:02:12.650> there

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the compressor come on stop right there

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.199 
the compressor come on stop right there
the<00:02:13.280> other<00:02:13.459> tips<00:02:13.700> we're<00:02:13.849> going<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> show<00:02:14.150> you

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the other tips we're going to show you

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.850 
the other tips we're going to show you
they<00:02:14.390> would<00:02:14.540> not<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:14.810> sufficient<00:02:14.959> via<00:02:15.530> take<00:02:15.740> it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
they would not be sufficient via take it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.910 
they would not be sufficient via take it
to<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> mechanic

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
to a mechanic

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.900 
to a mechanic
we<00:02:16.980> don't<00:02:17.069> hear<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.280> clicking<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.790> that

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
we don't hear that clicking of that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.610 
we don't hear that clicking of that
compressor<00:02:18.330> coming<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:19.170> could<00:02:19.349> recommend

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
compressor coming on we could recommend

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.170 
compressor coming on we could recommend
mechanics<00:02:20.010> quite<00:02:20.130> advanced<00:02:20.370> all<00:02:20.520> sure<00:02:20.730> sure

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
mechanics quite advanced all sure sure

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.240 
mechanics quite advanced all sure sure
so<00:02:21.209> if<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.230> compressor<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.950> got<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.190> go

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so if it's the compressor you got to go

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.190 
so if it's the compressor you got to go
to<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> game<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.330> hear<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.780> and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
to the game but if you hear it and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.170 
to the game but if you hear it and
you're<00:02:25.319> like<00:02:25.349> but<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.770> different<00:02:26.150> then<00:02:27.150> what

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you're like but it's different then what

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.990 
you're like but it's different then what
am<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.569> sure<00:02:27.780> come<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.230> over<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:28.440> okay<00:02:28.940> now<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
am I sure come on over here okay now the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.780 
am I sure come on over here okay now the
next<00:02:30.270> thing<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.599> you<00:02:30.840> need<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.349> is<00:02:32.190> check

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
next thing that you need to do is check

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.280 
next thing that you need to do is check
the<00:02:32.910> low<00:02:33.030> pressure<00:02:33.270> one<00:02:33.630> your<00:02:33.930> AC<00:02:34.080> system

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
the low pressure one your AC system

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.229 
the low pressure one your AC system
right<00:02:35.040> there's<00:02:35.430> two<00:02:35.610> lines<00:02:35.850> there's<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> high

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
right there's two lines there's a high

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.580 
right there's two lines there's a high
pressure<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.780> low<00:02:36.930> pressure<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
pressure and a low pressure so the

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.630 
pressure and a low pressure so the
question<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:37.950> how<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.400> tell<00:02:38.520> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
question is how can you tell the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.070 
question is how can you tell the
difference<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.480> nice<00:02:39.630> thing<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.959> these

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
difference the nice thing on these

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.320 
difference the nice thing on these
gauges<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.680> they<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> clip<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.209> can

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
gauges is they have a clip as you can

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.870 
gauges is they have a clip as you can
see<00:02:42.769> that's<00:02:43.769> only<00:02:44.069> gonna<00:02:44.250> fit<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.730> world

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
see that's only gonna fit on the world

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.430 
see that's only gonna fit on the world
pressure<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.840> drop<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.290> high

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
pressure if you drop it on the high

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.990 
pressure if you drop it on the high
pressure<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.830> not<00:02:46.920> gonna<00:02:47.069> work<00:02:47.280> now<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.880> this

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
pressure is not gonna work now in this

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.850 
pressure is not gonna work now in this
case<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.390> our<00:02:48.510> gauge<00:02:48.720> we<00:02:49.319> actually<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.680> too

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
case in our gauge we actually have too

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.670 
case in our gauge we actually have too
much<00:02:50.150> r134a<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:51.360> our<00:02:51.480> system<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.530> can

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
much r134a in our system that can

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.500 
much r134a in our system that can
actually<00:02:52.950> also<00:02:53.160> impact<00:02:53.670> us<00:02:53.850> having<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.330> cool

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
actually also impact us having a cool

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.180 
actually also impact us having a cool
air<00:02:54.660> come<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:54.959> our<00:02:55.049> system<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.920> won't<00:02:56.069> take

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
air come in our system you won't take

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.100 
air come in our system you won't take
that<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.459> mechanic<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.480> typically<00:02:57.870> wanted

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that to mechanic you typically wanted

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.960 
that to mechanic you typically wanted
right<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.410> green<00:02:58.620> okay<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.489> if<00:02:59.610> you're<00:02:59.790> low

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
right in the green okay so if you're low
