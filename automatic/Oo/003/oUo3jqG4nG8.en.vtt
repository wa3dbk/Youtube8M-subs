00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
between the GPU and the fence what that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
between the GPU and the fence what that
allows<00:00:47.039> us<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.760> run<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> fan<00:00:48.510> really

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
allows us to do is run this fan really

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.690 
allows us to do is run this fan really
low<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.320> still<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.070> good<00:00:50.309> air<00:00:50.489> flow<00:00:50.520> across

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
low and still get good air flow across

low and still get good air flow across
both<00:00:51.210> sets<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> fins<00:00:51.780> that's<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.680> miracle

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
both sets of fins that's the miracle

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
both sets of fins that's the miracle
that<00:00:53.129> makes<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.520> thing<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.789> quiet<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:54.809> if

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that makes this thing so quiet now if

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
that makes this thing so quiet now if
you<00:00:54.989> take<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.350> vapor<00:00:55.530> chambers<00:00:55.920> off<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
you take the vapor chambers off and you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
you take the vapor chambers off and you
dig<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:56.879> you'll<00:00:57.000> see<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> card<00:00:57.539> like

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
dig in what you'll see is a card like

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.349 
dig in what you'll see is a card like
this<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:58.680> are<00:00:58.770> two<00:00:58.949> gf1<00:00:59.370> tens<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> big

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this there are two gf1 tens and the big

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.939 
this there are two gf1 tens and the big
switch<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> middle<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.140> our<00:01:01.260> own<00:01:01.469> pci

another for regulators for the memory
those<00:01:13.200> GPU<00:01:13.740> regulators<00:01:14.280> allow<00:01:14.520> us<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> get

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
those GPU regulators allow us to get

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
those GPU regulators allow us to get
really<00:01:15.180> clean<00:01:15.659> power<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> GPUs<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.979> use

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
really clean power that the GPUs can use

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
really clean power that the GPUs can use
to<00:01:17.250> run<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.700> really<00:01:17.729> fast<00:01:17.970> their

you<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.520> it's<00:03:05.640> showing<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.090> your

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
you can see it's showing you your

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.150 
you can see it's showing you your
current<00:03:06.600> frame<00:03:06.900> rate<00:03:07.110> it's<00:03:07.350> also<00:03:07.530> showing<00:03:07.680> you

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
current frame rate it's also showing you

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.130 
current frame rate it's also showing you
the<00:03:08.310> temperature<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.940> GPUs<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.750> GPU

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
the temperature the GPUs the GPU

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.230 
the temperature the GPUs the GPU
utilization<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.520> core<00:03:11.730> clock<00:03:11.970> on<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
utilization and the core clock on the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.020 
utilization and the core clock on the
GPU<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.350> see<00:03:13.500> already<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.950> gtx<00:03:14.490> 590

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
GPU so you can see already that gtx 590

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.630 
GPU so you can see already that gtx 590
has<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> 608<00:03:16.260> core<00:03:16.800> clock<00:03:17.070> when<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.459> running

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
has a 608 core clock when it's running

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.610 
has a 608 core clock when it's running
so<00:03:17.940> let's<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.239> going<00:03:18.510> but<00:03:19.050> getting<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.440> there

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
so let's get going but getting in there

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.850 
so let's get going but getting in there
and<00:03:19.800> I'm<00:03:20.070> going<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.370> do<00:03:20.550> my<00:03:20.850> favorite<00:03:21.860> stealth

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
and I'm going to do my favorite stealth

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.340 
and I'm going to do my favorite stealth
kill<00:03:23.100> ya<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.150> nice<00:03:24.360> little<00:03:24.570> next<00:03:24.900> spin<00:03:25.080> there

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
kill ya a nice little next spin there

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
kill ya a nice little next spin there
and<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:26.130> was<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:26.540> in<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:28.320> head<00:03:28.590> okay<00:03:29.100> now<00:03:29.250> this

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
and I was just in the head okay now this

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.490 
and I was just in the head okay now this
is<00:03:29.430> fun<00:03:29.820> do<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.420> little<00:03:30.570> slide<00:03:30.930> under<00:03:31.260> here

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
is fun do the little slide under here

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.750 
is fun do the little slide under here
and<00:03:32.060> zap<00:03:33.060> them<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.450> head<00:03:34.190> all<00:03:35.190> right<00:03:35.459> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and zap them in the head all right and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.310 
and zap them in the head all right and
again<00:03:36.540> let's<00:03:36.690> take<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> look<00:03:37.080> we're<00:03:37.260> at

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
again let's take a look we're at

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.259 
again let's take a look we're at
ninety-nine<00:03:37.769> percent<00:03:37.950> utilization<00:03:38.760> fifty

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
ninety-nine percent utilization fifty

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.509 
ninety-nine percent utilization fifty
percent<00:03:39.600> on<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.050> on<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.530> fan<00:03:40.890> which<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.220> again

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
percent on the on the fan which is again

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.090 
percent on the on the fan which is again
nearly<00:03:42.330> silent<00:03:42.750> pretty<00:03:43.410> much<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> delightful

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
nearly silent pretty much a delightful

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.070 
nearly silent pretty much a delightful
experience<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.300> is<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.480> new<00:03:45.600> game<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:45.900> well

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
experience so this is a new game is well

I've<00:04:01.170> been<00:04:01.350> playing<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.769> for<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.040> while<00:04:02.220> just

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
I've been playing this for a while just

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.729 
I've been playing this for a while just
as<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.850> came<00:04:02.880> out<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:04.290> I'm<00:04:04.410> really<00:04:04.620> enjoying

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
as it came out and I'm really enjoying

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.320 
as it came out and I'm really enjoying
it<00:04:05.070> let<00:04:05.550> me<00:04:05.610> show<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.880> little<00:04:06.030> bit<00:04:06.120> about

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
it let me show you a little bit about

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.490 
it let me show you a little bit about
what's<00:04:06.480> going<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.750> with<00:04:06.900> temperatures<00:04:07.290> right

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
what's going on with temperatures right

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500 
what's going on with temperatures right
now<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.860> again<00:04:08.519> we're<00:04:08.700> running<00:04:08.940> with<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> single

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
now so again we're running with a single

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.190 
now so again we're running with a single
gtx<00:04:10.200> 590<00:04:10.709> you're<00:04:11.370> seeing<00:04:11.820> 84<00:04:12.360> degrees<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:13.019> the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
gtx 590 you're seeing 84 degrees on the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.020 
gtx 590 you're seeing 84 degrees on the
GPUs<00:04:13.680> you're<00:04:13.920> running<00:04:14.130> at<00:04:14.220> about<00:04:14.250> 50<00:04:14.700> 60

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
GPUs you're running at about 50 60

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.630 
GPUs you're running at about 50 60
frames<00:04:15.239> per<00:04:15.299> second<00:04:15.750> at<00:04:15.810> 25<00:04:16.200> x<00:04:16.380> 16<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.340> can<00:04:17.400> see

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
frames per second at 25 x 16 you can see

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.670 
frames per second at 25 x 16 you can see
GD<00:04:18.000> GPU<00:04:18.510> utilization<00:04:19.200> right<00:04:19.350> now<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.590> at

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
GD GPU utilization right now is at

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.260 
GD GPU utilization right now is at
one-hundred<00:04:19.830> percent<00:04:20.040> pretty<00:04:20.519> much<00:04:20.669> but<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
one-hundred percent pretty much but the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.390 
one-hundred percent pretty much but the
fan<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.690> still<00:04:21.900> at<00:04:22.049> 50<00:04:22.530> now<00:04:22.890> that's<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.190> key

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
fan is still at 50 now that's a key

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.280 
fan is still at 50 now that's a key
thing<00:04:23.430> about<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.000> gtx<00:04:24.419> 590<00:04:24.900> s

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
thing about the gtx 590 s

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.470 
thing about the gtx 590 s
actually<00:04:25.650> really<00:04:26.010> really<00:04:26.160> quiet<00:04:26.550> even<00:04:27.180> while

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
actually really really quiet even while

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.640 
actually really really quiet even while
you're<00:04:27.600> gaming<00:04:27.870> at<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.200> highest<00:04:28.440> resolution

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
you're gaming at the highest resolution

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.370 
you're gaming at the highest resolution
so<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.190> got<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.520> little<00:04:29.700> DBA<00:04:30.150> hand<00:04:30.900> meter<00:04:31.170> here

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
so I got this little DBA hand meter here

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.770 
so I got this little DBA hand meter here
we're<00:04:31.470> going<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.650> see<00:04:31.800> what<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.010> says<00:04:38.780> alright

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
we're going to see what it says alright

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.500 
we're going to see what it says alright
so<00:04:39.960> we're<00:04:40.110> running<00:04:40.380> right<00:04:40.620> around<00:04:40.860> 48.9<00:04:41.850> DB

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
so we're running right around 48.9 DB

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.030 
so we're running right around 48.9 DB
and<00:04:42.720> again<00:04:43.200> there's<00:04:43.380> lots<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.650> background

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
and again there's lots of background

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.680 
and again there's lots of background
noise<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.370> here<00:04:44.520> it's<00:04:44.670> really<00:04:44.970> pretty<00:04:45.420> quiet

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
noise in here it's really pretty quiet

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.420 
noise in here it's really pretty quiet
let<00:04:45.780> me<00:04:45.840> show<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.080> little<00:04:46.170> chart<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:47.190> this

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
let me show you a little chart so this

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.970 
let me show you a little chart so this
is<00:04:47.460> showing<00:04:48.390> our<00:04:48.570> acoustics<00:04:49.320> versus<00:04:49.770> other

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
is showing our acoustics versus other

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.400 
is showing our acoustics versus other
Nvidia<00:04:50.430> products<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.300> 295<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:51.990> showed<00:04:52.290> you

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
Nvidia products the 295 I showed you

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.530 
Nvidia products the 295 I showed you
this<00:04:52.470> right<00:04:52.650> over<00:04:52.770> here<00:04:52.890> this<00:04:53.310> was<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.210> great

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
this right over here this was a great

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.330 
this right over here this was a great
design<00:04:54.900> at<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.080> time<00:04:55.410> but<00:04:55.950> it<00:04:56.070> was<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.220> little

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
design at the time but it was a little

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.650 
design at the time but it was a little
bit<00:04:56.550> louder<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.060> was<00:04:57.180> actually<00:04:57.540> running

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
bit louder it was actually running

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.830 
bit louder it was actually running
between<00:04:57.900> 52<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:58.920> 54<00:04:59.370> so<00:04:59.730> it's<00:04:59.850> around<00:05:00.060> 53<00:05:00.540> DB

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
between 52 and 54 so it's around 53 DB

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.630 
between 52 and 54 so it's around 53 DB
and<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:01.380> primarily<00:05:01.800> came<00:05:02.100> from<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.400> fact

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
and that primarily came from the fact

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.730 
and that primarily came from the fact
that<00:05:02.730> they<00:05:02.910> were<00:05:02.970> there<00:05:03.390> were<00:05:03.480> these<00:05:03.740> pipes

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
that they were there were these pipes

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.530 
that they were there were these pipes
for<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.250> heat<00:05:05.460> pipe<00:05:05.670> that<00:05:05.880> cut<00:05:06.090> down<00:05:06.300> on<00:05:06.450> the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
for a heat pipe that cut down on the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.030 
for a heat pipe that cut down on the
airflow<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.080> it's<00:05:07.200> very<00:05:07.440> similar<00:05:07.710> in

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
airflow so it's very similar in

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.980 
airflow so it's very similar in
structure<00:05:08.610> but<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.120> result<00:05:09.510> is<00:05:09.690> very

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
structure but the result is very

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.260 
structure but the result is very
different<00:05:10.470> now<00:05:10.590> another<00:05:11.460> one<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:11.730> look<00:05:11.850> at<00:05:12.090> is

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
different now another one to look at is

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.660 
different now another one to look at is
the<00:05:12.600> 9800<00:05:12.990> gx2<00:05:13.380> that's<00:05:13.890> this<00:05:14.070> one<00:05:14.220> again<00:05:14.310> and

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
the 9800 gx2 that's this one again and

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.830 
the 9800 gx2 that's this one again and
you<00:05:14.970> can<00:05:15.060> see<00:05:15.180> what's<00:05:15.330> going<00:05:15.390> on<00:05:15.630> here<00:05:15.810> a

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
you can see what's going on here a

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.350 
you can see what's going on here a
bigger<00:05:16.260> fan<00:05:16.650> sucking<00:05:17.640> air<00:05:17.850> in<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.150> kind<00:05:18.240> of

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
bigger fan sucking air in and kind of

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.360 
bigger fan sucking air in and kind of
forcing<00:05:18.840> out<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.080> front<00:05:19.350> at<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.040> end<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.310> the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
forcing out the front at the end of the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.190 
forcing out the front at the end of the
day<00:05:20.550> while<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:20.970> was<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.090> cool<00:05:21.330> design<00:05:21.480> it<00:05:21.930> still

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
day while it was a cool design it still

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.010 
day while it was a cool design it still
had<00:05:22.380> fairly<00:05:22.740> loud<00:05:23.100> acoustics<00:05:23.670> so<00:05:24.660> what<00:05:24.870> we've

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
had fairly loud acoustics so what we've

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.770 
had fairly loud acoustics so what we've

louder so what we've managed to do is

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.360 
louder so what we've managed to do is
create<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.600> gtx<00:05:46.200> 590<00:05:46.680> that<00:05:46.950> has<00:05:47.100> both

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
create a gtx 590 that has both

580 but yet almost as quiet as the gtx
580<00:05:54.120> it's<00:05:54.570> actually<00:05:54.930> really<00:05:55.200> amazing<00:05:55.890> alright

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
580 it's actually really amazing alright

so now one more thing I want to show you

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.600 
so now one more thing I want to show you
is<00:05:58.020> over<00:05:58.200> in<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:58.650> tech<00:05:58.950> lab<00:05:58.980> with<00:05:59.310> a<00:05:59.340> friend<00:05:59.550> of

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
is over in the tech lab with a friend of

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.400 
is over in the tech lab with a friend of
mine<00:05:59.670> and<00:05:59.850> routine<00:06:00.180> right<00:06:00.300> he's<00:06:00.510> got<00:06:00.720> a<00:06:00.930> single

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
mine and routine right he's got a single

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.610 
mine and routine right he's got a single
gtx<00:06:01.980> 590<00:06:02.520> driving<00:06:03.090> three<00:06:03.360> panels<00:06:03.750> and<00:06:03.930> so<00:06:04.470> it's

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
gtx 590 driving three panels and so it's

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.930 
gtx 590 driving three panels and so it's
pretty<00:06:04.770> exciting<00:06:05.040> stuff<00:06:05.280> let's<00:06:05.610> go<00:06:05.730> take<00:06:05.880> a

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
pretty exciting stuff let's go take a

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.870 
pretty exciting stuff let's go take a
look<00:06:06.530> all<00:06:07.530> right<00:06:07.680> so<00:06:07.890> Andrew<00:06:08.100> were<00:06:08.370> here<00:06:08.640> to

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
look all right so Andrew were here to

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.730 
look all right so Andrew were here to
talk<00:06:09.060> about<00:06:09.090> 3d<00:06:09.720> vision<00:06:09.900> surround<00:06:10.320> I<00:06:10.440> can<00:06:10.620> see

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
talk about 3d vision surround I can see

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.960 
talk about 3d vision surround I can see
you've<00:06:10.890> already<00:06:11.010> got<00:06:11.220> it<00:06:11.340> up<00:06:11.430> and<00:06:11.520> running<00:06:11.610> and

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
you've already got it up and running and

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.550 
you've already got it up and running and
you're<00:06:12.120> playing<00:06:12.210> crysis<00:06:12.720> 2<00:06:12.870> correct<00:06:13.170> that<00:06:13.380> is

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
you're playing crysis 2 correct that is

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.380 
you're playing crysis 2 correct that is
correct<00:06:13.590> excellent<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:14.460> then<00:06:14.610> down<00:06:14.880> here<00:06:14.910> you

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
correct excellent and then down here you

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.500 
correct excellent and then down here you
can<00:06:15.540> see<00:06:15.720> is<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:15.990> single<00:06:16.620> gtx<00:06:17.100> 590<00:06:17.700> and<00:06:18.000> we're

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
can see is a single gtx 590 and we're
