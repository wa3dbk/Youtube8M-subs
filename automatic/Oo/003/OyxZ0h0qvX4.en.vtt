minutes<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.600> when<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:42.960> realize<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
minutes in when I realize that I put the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
minutes in when I realize that I put the
sandwich<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.879> way<00:00:45.239> too<00:00:45.300> soon<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.079> going

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.750 
to be ready at the same time as the eggs
and<00:00:48.149> that's<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.390> real<00:00:48.570> concern<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> decide<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and that's a real concern so I decide to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
and that's a real concern so I decide to
take<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> toastie<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.110> leave<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.860 
take the toastie out and leave it on the
side<00:00:52.860> while<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.610> water<00:00:53.820> comes<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> boil

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
side while the water comes up to a boil

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.020 
side while the water comes up to a boil
the<00:00:55.469> water<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.949> seems<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.309> taking<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.820> age

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the water just seems to be taking an age

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.970 
the water just seems to be taking an age
to<00:00:57.059> boil<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.930> I'm<00:00:58.020> really<00:00:58.379> sorry<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.829> get

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
to boil and I'm really sorry to get

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.080 
to boil and I'm really sorry to get
worried<00:00:59.250> there's<00:00:59.430> not<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.820> anything

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
worried there's not going to be anything

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.690 
worried there's not going to be anything
on<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> plate

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.310 

to<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.030> point<00:01:07.329> I'm<00:01:07.509> really<00:01:07.960> starting<00:01:08.289> to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
to this point I'm really starting to

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.029 
to this point I'm really starting to
regret<00:01:08.409> plating<00:01:09.159> up<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.430> deeper<00:01:09.700> dishes<00:01:11.039> the

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
regret plating up to deeper dishes the

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.679 
regret plating up to deeper dishes the
water<00:01:12.250> hasn't<00:01:12.490> even<00:01:12.640> come<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:12.939> a<00:01:13.060> boil<00:01:13.240> yet<00:01:13.509> but

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
water hasn't even come to a boil yet but

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.300 
water hasn't even come to a boil yet but
I've<00:01:13.780> got<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.140> get<00:01:14.200> those<00:01:14.380> 18<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:14.890> this<00:01:15.159> is<00:01:15.280> a

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
I've got to get those 18 and this is a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.130 
I've got to get those 18 and this is a
real<00:01:15.579> pressure<00:01:15.909> point<00:01:16.210> for<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.450> eggs<00:01:16.600> if<00:01:16.929> they

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
real pressure point for the eggs if they

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.169 
real pressure point for the eggs if they
crack<00:01:17.500> when<00:01:17.770> they<00:01:17.890> go<00:01:18.039> in<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.610> dishes<00:01:18.789> as<00:01:19.030> good

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
crack when they go in the dishes as good

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.309 
crack when they go in the dishes as good
as<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.390> thought<00:01:20.969> but<00:01:21.969> those<00:01:22.149> eggs<00:01:22.420> going<00:01:22.750> fine<00:01:22.990> I

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
as I thought but those eggs going fine I

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.050 
as I thought but those eggs going fine I
couldn't<00:01:23.710> be<00:01:23.799> happier<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.369> it's<00:01:24.579> time<00:01:24.789> for<00:01:24.970> me

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
couldn't be happier and it's time for me

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
couldn't be happier and it's time for me
to<00:01:25.090> focus<00:01:25.360> on<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.929> toasty<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.920> soldiers

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
to focus on the toasty and the soldiers

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.260 
to focus on the toasty and the soldiers
it's<00:01:29.860> after<00:01:30.189> a<00:01:30.219> while<00:01:30.399> that<00:01:30.549> I<00:01:30.640> realized<00:01:31.090> that

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
it's after a while that I realized that

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.819 
it's after a while that I realized that
I've<00:01:31.420> unplugged<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.110> toaster<00:01:32.619> for<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
I've unplugged the toaster for the

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.980 
I've unplugged the toaster for the
sandwich<00:01:33.250> press<00:01:33.549> I'm<00:01:33.909> starting<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.390> worry<00:01:34.750> if

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
sandwich press I'm starting to worry if

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.690 
sandwich press I'm starting to worry if
I<00:01:35.170> don't<00:01:35.380> get<00:01:35.469> those<00:01:35.649> soldiers<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.310> that's

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
I don't get those soldiers in that's

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.160 
I don't get those soldiers in that's
