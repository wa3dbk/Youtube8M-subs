chocolate<00:01:27.259> mmm<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.920> taste<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220

little bit of sesame seed sesame seed

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
little bit of sesame seed sesame seed
flavor<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> white

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
flavor I think that's what that white

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.830 
flavor I think that's what that white
paste<00:01:36.360> might<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.770> sesame<00:01:37.770> flavor<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
paste might be sesame flavor and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.969 
paste might be sesame flavor and
chocolate<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.290> similar<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.770> something

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
chocolate so it's similar to something

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.580 
chocolate so it's similar to something
like<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.220> Nutella<00:01:41.610> where<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.420> nuts<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
like a Nutella where you have nuts and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.780 
like a Nutella where you have nuts and
chocolate<00:01:43.740> together<00:01:47.180> it's<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> nice<00:01:48.420> toasted
