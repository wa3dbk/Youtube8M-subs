pretty new to myself I probably only did

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.700 
pretty new to myself I probably only did
it<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> first<00:00:12.929> time<00:00:13.139> about<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.410> year<00:00:13.469> ago

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
but I really like it because it enables

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.040 
but I really like it because it enables
me<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.529> wear<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.369> dress<00:00:17.670> I've<00:00:18.660> had<00:00:18.900> this

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
for me it's way too tight for my comfort

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.769 
for me it's way too tight for my comfort
level<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.670> bought<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.269> because<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.599> just

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
level and I bought it because I just

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.470 
level and I bought it because I just
love<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.289> pattern<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.830> love<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.310> cut<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:30.269> was

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
love the pattern I love the cut it was

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.359 
love the pattern I love the cut it was
too<00:00:30.720> cute<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.230> pass<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.279> was

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
too cute to pass up and I think it was

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.030 
too cute to pass up and I think it was
about<00:00:32.460> 12<00:00:32.759> bucks<00:00:33.140> but<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> said<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.590> my<00:00:34.680> closet

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
about 12 bucks but it said in my closet

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.770 
about 12 bucks but it said in my closet
unworn<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.540> comfortable

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
unworn because I'm not comfortable

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.350 
unworn because I'm not comfortable
wearing<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.460> addition<00:00:39.149> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
wearing it just like this in addition to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.700 
wearing it just like this in addition to
being<00:00:39.629> too<00:00:40.140> tight

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
being too tight

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.889 
being too tight
it's<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.250> too<00:00:41.399> bright<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.360> pattern<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's a little too bright the pattern is

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.600 
it's a little too bright the pattern is
what<00:00:43.079> drew<00:00:43.320> me<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> pattern<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
what drew me to it but the pattern is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.090 
what drew me to it but the pattern is
very<00:00:44.730> loud<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.440> too<00:00:46.590> much<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:47.010> me

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
very loud and it's just too much for me

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740 
very loud and it's just too much for me
to<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.309> comfortable<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.570> by

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
to be comfortable with when it's by

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
to be comfortable with when it's by
itself<00:00:49.079> however<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> layer<00:00:50.820> another
