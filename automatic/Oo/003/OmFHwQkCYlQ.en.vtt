hey<00:00:09.929> everybody<00:00:10.410> it's<00:00:10.740> me

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
hey everybody it's me

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.910 
hey everybody it's me
fen<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.849> today's<00:00:12.420> question<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.320> how<00:00:13.679> to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
fen so today's question is how to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.189 
fen so today's question is how to
satellites<00:00:14.639> orbit<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> Earth<00:00:15.660> you'll<00:00:15.990> see

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
satellites orbit the Earth you'll see

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.070 
satellites orbit the Earth you'll see
we're<00:00:16.379> using<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.949> prop<00:00:17.310> globe<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.330> use

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
we're using this prop globe that we use

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.290 
we're using this prop globe that we use
for<00:00:19.350> everything<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.369> let's<00:00:20.820> pretend<00:00:20.939> there's

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
for everything but let's pretend there's

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
for everything but let's pretend there's
a<00:00:21.390> satellite<00:00:21.840> around<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.289> satellites<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
a satellite around it satellites are to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
a satellite around it satellites are to
some<00:00:23.670> degree<00:00:23.699> mysterious<00:00:24.660> objects<00:00:25.109> right

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
some degree mysterious objects right

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.589 
some degree mysterious objects right
orbital<00:00:25.920> mechanics<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.640> also<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:27.090> mysterious

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
orbital mechanics can also be mysterious

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.810 
orbital mechanics can also be mysterious
because<00:00:27.930> there's<00:00:28.170> no<00:00:28.349> easy<00:00:28.710> way<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.220> us<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
because there's no easy way for us to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
because there's no easy way for us to
experience<00:00:30.349> orbital<00:00:31.349> mechanics<00:00:31.669> personally

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
experience orbital mechanics personally

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.370 
experience orbital mechanics personally
however<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> little<00:00:33.930> bit<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> imagination

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
however with a little bit of imagination

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.620 
however with a little bit of imagination
we<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.399> understand<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> idea<00:00:36.390> behind

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
we can understand the idea behind

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.680 
we can understand the idea behind
orbital<00:00:37.530> mechanics<00:00:37.680> very<00:00:38.309> easily<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.239> imagine

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
orbital mechanics very easily so imagine

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.389 
orbital mechanics very easily so imagine
what<00:00:39.870> happens<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.920> throw<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> ball<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
what happens if you throw a ball and it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
what happens if you throw a ball and it
goes<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> hundred<00:00:45.149> feet<00:00:45.360> or<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.719> then<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
goes a hundred feet or so and then it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.600 
goes a hundred feet or so and then it
hits<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.559> ground<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.100> ball<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.430> actually

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
hits the ground that ball is actually

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
hits the ground that ball is actually
orbiting<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> balls<00:00:49.110> orbit

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
orbiting it's just that the balls orbit

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.950 
orbiting it's just that the balls orbit
is<00:00:49.829> very<00:00:50.190> very<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:50.760> short<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.570> let's<00:00:51.600> say<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is very very very short so let's say the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.389 
is very very very short so let's say the
ball<00:00:52.140> doesn't<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.949> you're<00:00:53.039> like<00:00:53.129> Ben<00:00:53.370> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
ball doesn't do it and you're like Ben I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.279 
ball doesn't do it and you're like Ben I
got<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.850> rifle<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:54.329> gonna<00:00:54.510> shoot<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
got this rifle I'm gonna shoot that so

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
got this rifle I'm gonna shoot that so
you<00:00:55.350> grab<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> rifle<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.070> shoot<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you grab a rifle you shoot it and you

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.240 
you grab a rifle you shoot it and you
fire<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.690> straight<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.350> level<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.890> bullet

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
fire it straight and level a bullet

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
fire it straight and level a bullet
might<00:00:59.460> travel<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.969> mile<00:01:00.300> before<00:01:00.809> succumbing<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
might travel a mile before succumbing to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
might travel a mile before succumbing to
gravity<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.070> hitting<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> ground<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.149> let's

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
gravity and hitting the ground so let's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
gravity and hitting the ground so let's
imagine<00:01:03.420> another<00:01:04.019> thing<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.559> right<00:01:04.680> we're

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
imagine another thing all right we're

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
imagine another thing all right we're
just<00:01:04.890> imagining<00:01:05.580> stuff<00:01:05.729> let's<00:01:06.330> say<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.540> had<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
just imagining stuff let's say you had a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.870 
just imagining stuff let's say you had a
very<00:01:06.990> large<00:01:07.320> powerful<00:01:07.890> Cannon<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.670> able

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
very large powerful Cannon and it's able

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
very large powerful Cannon and it's able
to<00:01:08.970> give<00:01:09.150> its<00:01:09.330> shell<00:01:09.600> an<00:01:09.960> extremely<00:01:10.650> high

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
to give its shell an extremely high

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.130 
to give its shell an extremely high
initial<00:01:11.520> velocity<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.299> you're<00:01:12.630> shooting<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
initial velocity so you're shooting this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.770 
initial velocity so you're shooting this
cannon<00:01:13.590> straight<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> shells<00:01:15.210> gonna<00:01:15.540> go

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
cannon straight and the shells gonna go

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.620 
cannon straight and the shells gonna go
many<00:01:16.380> miles<00:01:16.770> far<00:01:17.549> enough<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> actually<00:01:18.360> follow

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
many miles far enough to actually follow

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
many miles far enough to actually follow
the<00:01:18.960> curve<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> earth<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> period<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the curve of the earth for a period of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.539 
the curve of the earth for a period of
time<00:01:21.150> before<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> hits<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> ground<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.369> one

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
time before it hits the ground so one

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.730 
time before it hits the ground so one
thing<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.820> gums<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.479> these<00:01:24.720> examples<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.560> air

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
thing that gums up these examples is air

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.130 
thing that gums up these examples is air
resistance<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.909> imagine<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.720> took<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
resistance like imagine if we took this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
resistance like imagine if we took this
powerful<00:01:28.409> cannon<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.130> moon<00:01:29.430> right

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
powerful cannon to the moon right

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.850 
powerful cannon to the moon right
because<00:01:30.270> where<00:01:30.960> else<00:01:31.110> would<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.439> take<00:01:31.650> our

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
because where else would we take our

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.160 
because where else would we take our
imaginary<00:01:32.310> cannon<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.420> mounted<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.960> on

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
imaginary cannon and we mounted it on

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.859 
imaginary cannon and we mounted it on
top<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.829> biggest<00:01:35.490> moon<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> moon

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
top of biggest moon now well the moon

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.050 
top of biggest moon now well the moon
has<00:01:37.170> no<00:01:37.409> real<00:01:37.740> atmosphere<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.610> completely

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
has no real atmosphere it's completely

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
has no real atmosphere it's completely
surrounded<00:01:39.720> by<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> vacuum<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.409> space<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:41.040> we

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
surrounded by the vacuum of space if we

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
surrounded by the vacuum of space if we
adjust<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.000> speed<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.899> cannon<00:01:43.409> shell

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
adjust the speed of this cannon shell

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.880 
adjust the speed of this cannon shell
just<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> shoot<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.350> perfectly<00:01:46.350> then

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
just right and shoot it perfectly then

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.800 
just right and shoot it perfectly then
the<00:01:47.009> shell<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.399> follow<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.060> curve<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the shell would follow the curve of the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.800 
the shell would follow the curve of the
moon<00:01:49.049> exactly<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.369> would<00:01:50.490> fall<00:01:50.790> at<00:01:51.060> exactly

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
moon exactly it would fall at exactly

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.109 
moon exactly it would fall at exactly
the<00:01:52.049> same<00:01:52.320> rate<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.220> curve<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> moon

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the same rate that the curve of the moon

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.929 
the same rate that the curve of the moon
falls<00:01:54.750> away<00:01:55.140> from<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.369> would<00:01:56.670> keep

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
falls away from it so it would keep

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.880 
falls away from it so it would keep
falling<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> would<00:01:57.719> never<00:01:58.020> actually<00:01:58.409> hit

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
falling but it would never actually hit

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
falling but it would never actually hit
the<00:01:59.040> ground<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.610> fact<00:01:59.820> eventually<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.780> would

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the ground in fact eventually it would

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.819 
the ground in fact eventually it would
curve<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.640> around<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.540> boom<00:02:04.200> them

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
curve all the way around and boom them

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.170 
curve all the way around and boom them
right<00:02:05.219> back<00:02:05.430> into<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> back

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
right back into the back

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.330 
right back into the back
the<00:02:06.240> cannon<00:02:06.660> now<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.470> moon<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.100> can

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the cannon now on the moon you can

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.490 
the cannon now on the moon you can
actually<00:02:08.520> have<00:02:09.060> satellites<00:02:09.720> an<00:02:09.899> extremely

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
actually have satellites an extremely

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
actually have satellites an extremely
low<00:02:10.770> orbit<00:02:11.130> like<00:02:11.460> that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
low orbit like that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.120 
low orbit like that
just<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.360> few<00:02:12.600> miles<00:02:12.840> off<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.200> ground<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.890> avoid

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
just a few miles off the ground to avoid

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.860 
just a few miles off the ground to avoid
the<00:02:14.310> mountains<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.850> earth<00:02:15.240> though<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.750> not

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the mountains on earth though it's not

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.810 
the mountains on earth though it's not
so<00:02:16.110> easy<00:02:16.380> because<00:02:16.770> satellites<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.670> get

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
so easy because satellites have to get

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.060 
so easy because satellites have to get
above<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.510> atmosphere<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:19.350> into<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.890> vacuum

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
above the atmosphere and into the vacuum

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.640 
above the atmosphere and into the vacuum
of<00:02:20.340> space<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.940> orbit<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.540> any<00:02:21.870> length<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.590> time

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
of space to orbit for any length of time

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.210 
of space to orbit for any length of time
so<00:02:23.520> 200<00:02:24.330> miles<00:02:24.600> up<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.290> about<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.680> minimum

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
so 200 miles up is about the minimum

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.310 
so 200 miles up is about the minimum
that<00:02:26.640> we'll<00:02:26.880> need<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> avoid<00:02:27.570> atmosphere

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
that we'll need to avoid atmosphere

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.040 
that we'll need to avoid atmosphere
