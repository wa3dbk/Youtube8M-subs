00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.430
 the same day will not last 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.819
 he needs a little more 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.269
 too much because they wanted to play the match 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.159
 important cuts of europe 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:18.730
 second thing 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.179
 b 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.759
 we are going to play at least three men in the form of a door 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:24.999
 but at the hotel 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.359
 the leap of the title 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.050
 we have a team playing 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.330
 it is yet over a year 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.710
 under the aegis all met 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.260
 which for many 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.800
 of things in defense 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
 we were a little 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.580
 especially for meetings 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.460
 by the strength of the operation I find 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.790
 cordelle 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.790
 rare yet in front of their fans 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.970
 no positive reaction his name from time to time that there are reactions 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.230
 positive 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.990
 these posts 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.320
 in addition to the role of the man are a little more ambitious in their programs 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.440
 this change 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.440
 the hardest I continue my teammates 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.190
 both companies 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 we're not full but now we're going to play the match 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 covage championship match 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.080
 rabah saadane is a sector 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.320
 sober but a little redundant 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.960
 heavy or even post on own account 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 their point of view in the ports 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.620
 the great south 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.090
 what is expected of her? 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.010
 many amendments adopted 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.980
 to find 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.750
 thankfully all levels almost 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.180
 as I understand you this is a public apology from 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.759
 kick market me i can now it's to take things like this 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.600
 however the lack 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.120
 their attitude 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.870
 all year in the last 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.600
 ask no question we did not always know 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.720
 as for the game actor without saying that colombo is not ready 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.550
 we are not paid it's normal that 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.229
 I take a few sous 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.229
 we see here from your blog but you have to be honest 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.759
 when I had him go around the world you have to be a little bit more 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.930
 we see everywhere and all the time the doubt that the senate 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.209
 these men and women 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.709
 as for aviation so that we adam and eve there will be no problem because 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.849
 that I think that 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.849
 the fight team we consulted 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.309
 you are not more I want the sea team 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:40.709
 On paper 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.799
 alone alone there is something 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.449
 good there is still no positive side is a team that does not loose 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:48.259
 not 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:52.349
 three countries but they always trust thank you varan48 30 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.029
 and as for them a city like 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.829
 of the match the 40th minute gold during the healthy extension that according to 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.159
 anfani radio 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.909
 the playful Acadian 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.089
 when there were few players and parents of students like that again 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.129
 it 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.369
 play with another young player 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.369
 his second run 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.919
 she proposes to break up 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.019
 side I told the players to win a match 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.159
 the two match like that for a few years
