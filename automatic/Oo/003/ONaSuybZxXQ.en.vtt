00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the whole idea to show it to do what you

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.470 
the whole idea to show it to do what you
do<00:02:13.920> um<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.830> show<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.640> not

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.060 
do um this is to show you what I do not
another<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:19.020> whether<00:02:19.620> or<00:02:19.740> not<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:19.980> actually

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
another not whether or not it's actually

another not whether or not it's actually
a<00:02:20.250> good<00:02:20.370> idea<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:23.300> okay<00:02:26.510> put<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.660> on

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.800

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
here you can probably replace it with

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.559 
here you can probably replace it with
the<00:02:45.700> crush<00:02:46.150> up<00:02:46.330> potato<00:02:46.810> chips<00:02:47.110> if<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.319> want<00:02:47.530> it
