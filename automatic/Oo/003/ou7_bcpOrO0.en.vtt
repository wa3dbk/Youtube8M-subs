00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.420
 tantawi for all the boys are the a 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.490
 who to give in this video I will show you 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.609
 how to grow fast on clash of 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.890
 game clans which is very very famous 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.350
 let's say one of the most downloaded in 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.590
 italy and around the world on phones 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.300
 cell phones android ios and I recommend if 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.830
 you didn't download it because it is 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.760
 really a great game so it's worth 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.770
 really worth it 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.870
 in this video I will therefore give you my own 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.060
 personal tips to grow and for 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.160
 become these precisely 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.380
 some tips may seem trivial 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.329
 but others in my opinion are very useful 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.489
 so I recommend you follow up the 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.530
 video and if something is not clear 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.970
 why I express myself badly write here 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.370
 below in the comments we leave immediately 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.840
 then with advice 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.489
 the first advice boys is a lot 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.870
 simple indeed that the schalke lance is 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.250
 a war game for those who did n't 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.809
 still got it 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.910
 so the attack is the thing 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.290
 important of all you will make resources with 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.329
 the ant bow and would make trophies with 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.729
 the attack without attacking will not go 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.659
 the area on the side so I recommend it 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.630
 attach it attached applied e 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.359
 attack very trivial advice but not 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.950
 I wanted to say it anyway 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.409
 then let's move on to the second piece of advice 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.420
 or to have patience and be constant 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.609
 in fact guys who leave the plus is a 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.469
 really long game except for the 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.359
 first week of course and vi 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.130
 advice to be constant precisely 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.049
 so play better twice a 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.090
 even just ten minutes a day 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.500
 that two hours in a row every week 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.420
 why 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.390
 guys this just with your room 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.670
 will help success very important thing 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.680
 guys never get discouraged if you don't 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.920
 manage to attack or if not 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.510
 something comes out of it 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.330
 be patient and you will see that 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.160
 you can do it now let's go guys 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.630
 to deliver a bit more concrete before 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.000
 all I encourage you to have the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.710
 precise attack strategies then in 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.140
 few words boys not attached to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.369
 case because doing so you will lose only 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.050
 resources and trophies 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.300
 if instead you have a precise strategy 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.250
 so you will always stick with them 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.470
 troops and with me the thesis mi 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.170
 you will then have a very action plan 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.300
 detailed that you will always use in this 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.280
 so you will know what you need to do 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.600
 when you attack and you have already done half 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.160
 attack 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.380
 obviously when you attack use the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.970
 head for the not-wasted troops because 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.220
 every troop can be important to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.770
 win a battle was working 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.330
 a few more resources the fourth 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.790
 advice I give you and alternate periods 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.160
 of farming and the lead of cups that 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.530
 what is farming when one is at the town hall 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.269
 out wants to protect resources in 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.070
 this way the enemies indeed 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.170
 they will attack only the town hall and the 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.630
 resources will remain protected with twelve 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.220
 hours of shielding this is very useful therefore 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.080
 I advise you to apply this 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.420
 technique in our city ​​and therefore of 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.160
 better keep the town hall out when 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.959
 you don't have trophies for it 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.030
 way to keep the only two out then 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.440
 put the town halls inside and go up 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.570
 precisely of cups 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.790
 to point to the crystal alloy at 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.610
 league master or even the gold line if 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.860
 you are at a low level another thing 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.290
 it is very important to use them at best 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.150
 read gems in fact they are few 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.860
 the fundamental resource of flash air 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.540
 france are in fact those that are 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.370
 they buy because with the gems you can 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.570
 do practically everything 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.730
 would therefore be tempted to do 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.860
 a lot of things for example improve 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.620
 the barbarian king when you have no elixir 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.260
 black, however, I think the boys jam 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.360
 you don't have to use them to buy money 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.910
 to buy gold you are diesel 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.010
 and black but you will definitely need to use them for 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.350
 buy the masons the third mason 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.110
 facts is fundamental is the fourth is a lot 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.850
 useful the fifth is a bit superfluous but if 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.710
 manage to save the gems and vi 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.810
 I recommend buying it because the boys 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.670
 when you have to learn a lot of things 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.890
 it will be really tough with just two 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.810
 masons therefore a sign that concerns 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.240
 more directly to growth on grace 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.340
 of glass is maximizing everyone 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.780
 buildings and all defenses before 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.790
 move to the next level of 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.590
 city ​​hall therefore in practice not 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.450
 get better town hall until you have it 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.910
 all the defenses the deposits i 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.950
 extract the barracks at most this 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.690
 because the boys plus the town hall 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.420
 low level plus you can steal in 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.180
 attacks and therefore would not come 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.950
 to immediately go up to levels of city hall mi 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.349
 I also recommend strengthening the walls 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.290
 because they are fundamental indeed not 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.910
 they only stop the troops but they also have 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.280
 a function of intimidating opponents 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.350
 think for example how many times you will be 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.930
 happened to find and while attacking 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.120
 a player that maybe your own 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.770
 level but much higher walls e 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.230
 you did n't attack it maybe because 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.150
 you are afraid to fail I recommend it 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.710
 also strengthened the troops because if 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.290
 You have troops at higher levels and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.540
 you will be able to attack even better 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.240
 another very important thing ever 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.040
 never let the builders stop in fact 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.200
 must seem to go don't get in 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.060
 enhance anything but the masons 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.650
 they must never be still 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.030
 I recommend 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.520
 let's move on now, I recommend a little more 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.040
 cheap so always be careful of the 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.930
 value for money ratio very much 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.850
 important indeed it will be trained 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.919
 troops to attack spend for 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.620
 example 60,000 of the zeroes but ne 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.120
 you earn by attacking only 40,000 not 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.080
 it's a good attack because we don't 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.030
 Earn 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.620
 instead yes for example anyway me 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.129
 repay the troops then turn off the i 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.080
 60,000 and you get 60,000 is an attack 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.819
 Decent but not so good 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.400
 I always advise you to have ample 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.139
 Engineers profit margins and usage 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.300
 this criterion or search for 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.699
 always earn at least double of 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.340
 what goes out so try to 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.129
 earning more and more can be wasted 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.840
 the least possible 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.659
 the eighth so that I live is copy and 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.159
 watch all the villages you see 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.810
 in fact to go on in fashion 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.090
 france it is important to have a good one 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.319
 village and it is very difficult 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.199
 build one so if you are not 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.639
 capable copied from those you find a 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.800
 foulard you are looking for on the internet 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.979
 because they are actually found 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.659
 a lot of penultimate advice is never 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.460
 underestimate the traps i 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.240
 spells heroes and gods troops 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.949
 clan 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.719
 in fact they can really do the 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.029
 difference and change the outcomes of the 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:07.830
 battle let's think for example of 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.659
 traps placed at strategic points 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.400
 of the city can be engraved 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.469
 really a large number of tweets 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.960
 troops as this clip demonstrates in which 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.759
 really a lot of tamers die and 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.740
 at the same time the traps can 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.529
 really give very low attack turns 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.960
 so watch out for spells 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.669
 instead they are fundamental and if used well 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.339
 can transform an attack that 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.440
 would have ended my 50 percent in a 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:33.839
 100 percent abundant so guys 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.240
 and use with care and I recommend not 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.800
 attack without spells for how long 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.139
 concerns the heroes and elsewhere of the clan 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.469
 they are fundamental 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.479
 I recommend the defense and in attack 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:46.729
 proceed immediately with eliminating heroes 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.289
 then the barbarian king and troops rule 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.759
 of the clans attracting him to a corner 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.909
 soft of the city ​​and killing the 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.710
 lectures in kobe ​​armani last jails 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:56.360
 advice but is no less important indeed 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.360
 I think it's one of the most important 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.279
 own and have a war clan indeed 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.439
 you will receive lots of beautiful troops 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:06.199
 and above all you will have capiclan 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.699
 however the elders were experienced leaders who 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.930
 they will give me advice they will answer 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.699
 all your questions 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.800
 if you are the inexperienced players vi 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.360
 advice to enter an academy in 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.279
 which there are expert players 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.210
 who will give you advice and answer 

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:21.379
