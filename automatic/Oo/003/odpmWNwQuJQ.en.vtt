and<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> screen<00:01:25.950> using<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.700> it's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and down the screen using these but it's

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
and down the screen using these but it's
very<00:01:27.180> slow<00:01:27.960> responsibly<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.009> I'll<00:01:29.100> hit

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
very slow responsibly so here I'll hit

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730 
very slow responsibly so here I'll hit
it<00:01:29.600> tried<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> go<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.990> eight<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.380> I'll<00:01:31.590> hit

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it tried to go down to eight so I'll hit

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.660 
it tried to go down to eight so I'll hit
it<00:01:31.770> four<00:01:31.979> times<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.970> two<00:01:33.150> three<00:01:33.390> four<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.579> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it four times one two three four so it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.480 
it four times one two three four so it
takes<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> few<00:01:36.210> seconds<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:37.369> register<00:01:38.369> each

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
takes it a few seconds to register each

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.980 
takes it a few seconds to register each
one<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.909> typically<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.509> use<00:01:39.659> these<00:01:39.810> ones

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
one so typically you just use these ones

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950 
one so typically you just use these ones
over<00:01:40.079> here<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.180> there's<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:42.630> much<00:01:42.689> for

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
over here so there's not much for

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.710 
over here so there's not much for
