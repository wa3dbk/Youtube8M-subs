to<00:00:28.100> roll<00:00:28.369> out<00:00:28.610> so<00:00:29.480> here<00:00:29.690> I'm<00:00:29.750> just<00:00:29.810> kneading<00:00:30.260> it

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
to roll out so here I'm just kneading it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.439 
to roll out so here I'm just kneading it
to<00:00:30.560> warm<00:00:30.770> it<00:00:30.890> up<00:00:33.790> so<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.879> make<00:00:35.030> sure<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:35.300> doesn't

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.360 
stick you just are a little bit of icing
sugar<00:00:39.250> so<00:00:40.250> that'll<00:00:40.519> be<00:00:40.580> underneath<00:00:41.059> our<00:00:41.239> icing

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
sugar so that'll be underneath our icing

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.450

then using your rolling pin just roll

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.759 
then using your rolling pin just roll
out<00:00:46.489> try<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.390> keep<00:00:47.659> an<00:00:47.780> even<00:00:47.900> pressure<00:00:48.260> as<00:00:48.589> you

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
out try to keep an even pressure as you

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.060 
out try to keep an even pressure as you
roll<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.839> in<00:00:50.839> between<00:00:51.019> Rowling's<00:00:51.680> just<00:00:51.949> need

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
roll and in between Rowling's just need

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.240 
roll and in between Rowling's just need
to<00:00:52.159> turn<00:00:52.400> as<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:52.640> go<00:00:53.080> to<00:00:54.080> make<00:00:54.260> sure<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:55.010> size

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
to turn as you go to make sure the size

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.789 
to turn as you go to make sure the size
is<00:00:55.519> even<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.120> also<00:00:57.080> to<00:00:57.140> make<00:00:57.350> sure<00:00:57.379> it's<00:00:57.710> not

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
is even and also to make sure it's not

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.240 
is even and also to make sure it's not
sticking<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.280> your<00:00:58.400> work<00:00:58.519> surface<00:00:59.769> so<00:01:00.769> turn

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
sticking to your work surface so turn

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:10.140 
sticking to your work surface so turn
and<00:01:01.549> roll

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.750 

when<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.840> get<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.200> stage<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:12.490> need<00:01:12.670> to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
when you get to this stage just need to

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.790 
when you get to this stage just need to
roll<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.030> out<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.720> make<00:01:14.230> sure<00:01:14.350> it's<00:01:14.500> about<00:01:14.650> the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
roll it out to make sure it's about the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.790 
roll it out to make sure it's about the
correct<00:01:15.100> size<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.780> I'll<00:01:17.020> use<00:01:17.230> my<00:01:17.380> rolling<00:01:17.770> pin

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
correct size so I'll use my rolling pin

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.650 
correct size so I'll use my rolling pin
to<00:01:18.460> estimate<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.210> size<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.710> need<00:01:21.010> and

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
to estimate the size that I need and

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.450 
to estimate the size that I need and
check<00:01:22.660> against<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.620> sugar<00:01:23.800> paste<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:24.400> this

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
check against the sugar paste and this

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.970 
check against the sugar paste and this
one<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.730> about<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.060> right<00:01:25.210> size<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.650> you<00:01:26.740> fold

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
one is about the right size so you fold

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.530 
one is about the right size so you fold
the<00:01:27.160> pace<00:01:27.340> back<00:01:27.750> over<00:01:28.750> your<00:01:28.870> rolling<00:01:29.170> pin

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the pace back over your rolling pin

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.770 
the pace back over your rolling pin
place<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.690> cake<00:01:31.900> in<00:01:31.930> front<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.650> and
