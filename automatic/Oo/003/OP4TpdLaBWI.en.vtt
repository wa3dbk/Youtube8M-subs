talk<00:00:18.640> about<00:00:18.730> bream<00:00:19.000> this<00:00:19.270> week<00:00:20.040> I<00:00:21.040> think<00:00:21.970> last

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
talk about bream this week I think last

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.859 
talk about bream this week I think last
week<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:23.340> installation<00:00:24.340> of<00:00:24.520> bream<00:00:25.240> was<00:00:25.570> given

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
week the installation of bream was given

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.939 
week the installation of bream was given
out<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:27.160> time<00:00:27.400> it's<00:00:27.960> 950<00:00:28.960> ringgit<00:00:29.410> per

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
out this time it's 950 ringgit per

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.540 
out this time it's 950 ringgit per
person<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.660> first<00:00:31.900> bream<00:00:32.140> was<00:00:32.290> 500<00:00:32.920> the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
person the first bream was 500 the

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.170 
person the first bream was 500 the
second<00:00:33.970> bream<00:00:34.180> was<00:00:34.480> 650<00:00:35.350> ringi<00:00:35.650> and<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
second bream was 650 ringi and the

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.049 
second bream was 650 ringi and the
recipe<00:00:37.629> ins<00:00:37.750> I<00:00:38.199> think<00:00:38.739> they<00:00:38.890> were<00:00:38.949> about<00:00:39.190> 3

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
recipe ins I think they were about 3

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.360 
recipe ins I think they were about 3
million<00:00:40.239> people<00:00:40.690> so<00:00:41.260> if<00:00:41.410> we<00:00:41.530> do<00:00:41.680> a<00:00:42.070> bit<00:00:42.280> of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
million people so if we do a bit of

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.450 
million people so if we do a bit of
calculation<00:00:43.229> the<00:00:44.229> total<00:00:44.650> bream<00:00:44.920> now<00:00:45.159> per

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
calculation the total bream now per

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
calculation the total bream now per
person<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.650> 2100<00:00:47.650> degree<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:50.320> we<00:00:51.809> multiply

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
person is 2100 degree if we multiply

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.549 
person is 2100 degree if we multiply
2100<00:00:54.010> year<00:00:54.190> by<00:00:54.909> the<00:00:55.510> three<00:00:55.750> million<00:00:56.019> recipient

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
2100 year by the three million recipient

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.649 
2100 year by the three million recipient
we<00:00:56.799> would<00:00:57.040> be<00:00:57.250> having<00:00:57.610> some<00:00:58.360> total<00:00:59.199> sum<00:00:59.440> of<00:01:00.659> 6.3

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
we would be having some total sum of 6.3

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.520 
we would be having some total sum of 6.3
