00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
steel and added Batman somewhere in the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.490 
steel and added Batman somewhere in the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
it's a it's obviously hinting at the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.509 
it's a it's obviously hinting at the
future<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.650> Justice<00:02:39.070> League<00:02:39.160> coming
