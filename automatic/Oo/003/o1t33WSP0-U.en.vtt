we can do to encourage more young boys

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.609 
we can do to encourage more young boys
and<00:01:44.790> girls<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.509> study<00:01:45.720> maths<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.259> physics<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and girls to study maths and physics to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
and girls to study maths and physics to
go<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> degrees<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.310> engineering<00:01:47.399> we

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
go on to degrees in engineering we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.210 
go on to degrees in engineering we
should<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.649> there's<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
should do that and because there's a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
should do that and because there's a
huge<00:01:50.820> demand<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.299> their<00:01:51.509> skills<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
huge demand for their skills and it's a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.230 
huge demand for their skills and it's a
route<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.070> real<00:01:53.189> intellectual<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.909> economic

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
route to real intellectual and economic

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.030 
route to real intellectual and economic
fulfillment<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.930> would<00:01:55.680> love<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
fulfillment I would love to be a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.550 
fulfillment I would love to be a
particle<00:01:56.520> physicist<00:01:56.939> always<00:01:57.750> probably<00:01:58.140> they

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
particle physicist always probably they

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800 
particle physicist always probably they
just<00:01:58.770> work<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.280> an<00:01:59.490> subatomic<00:02:00.210> particles

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
just work with an subatomic particles

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.749 
just work with an subatomic particles
they<00:02:01.049> usually<00:02:01.380> experiment<00:02:02.009> by<00:02:02.130> smashing<00:02:02.670> them

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
they usually experiment by smashing them

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.819 
they usually experiment by smashing them
together<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.360> answer<00:02:03.930> everything<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.590> just

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
together like answer everything I just

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:05.910 
together like answer everything I just
love<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.399> papi

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
love to be papi

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.469 
love to be papi
part<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.189> because<00:02:06.610> this<00:02:06.850> quite

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
part of that because this quite

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.600 
part of that because this quite
influential<00:02:07.990> research<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.770> think<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
influential research I think the

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.729 
influential research I think the
government's<00:02:10.209> plans<00:02:10.479> are<00:02:10.810> really<00:02:11.500> good<00:02:11.620> at

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
government's plans are really good at

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.430 
government's plans are really good at
the<00:02:11.830> moment<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.370> think<00:02:12.520> they<00:02:12.910> would<00:02:13.440> encourage

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
the moment I think they would encourage

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.860 
the moment I think they would encourage
more<00:02:14.890> people<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.370> take<00:02:16.300> an<00:02:16.450> interest<00:02:16.599> in

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
more people to take an interest in

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.600 
more people to take an interest in
physics<00:02:17.230> because<00:02:17.500> i<00:02:17.680> think<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.040> quite<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
physics because i think is quite the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.210 
physics because i think is quite the
subject<00:02:19.390> which<00:02:20.140> not<00:02:20.440> many<00:02:20.470> people<00:02:20.890> know<00:02:21.040> much

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
subject which not many people know much

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.690 
subject which not many people know much
about<00:02:21.400> there's<00:02:22.000> lots<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.400> people<00:02:24.400> assume

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
about there's lots of and people assume

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.110 
about there's lots of and people assume
that<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.239> quite<00:02:25.450> hard<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.950> people

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
that it's quite hard but and so people

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.030 
that it's quite hard but and so people
usually<00:02:28.120> steer<00:02:28.989> away<00:02:29.140> from<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:29.860> they

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
usually steer away from it but they

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.410 
usually steer away from it but they
don't<00:02:30.250> actually<00:02:30.280> realize<00:02:30.790> how<00:02:30.970> interesting

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
don't actually realize how interesting

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.660 
don't actually realize how interesting
it<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.690> be<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.500> i<00:02:32.530> think<00:02:32.650> if<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.310> government

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
it can be so i think if the government

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.370 
it can be so i think if the government
did<00:02:33.790> go<00:02:33.940> forward<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:34.569> their<00:02:34.780> plans<00:02:35.019> then

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
did go forward it with their plans then

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.979 
did go forward it with their plans then
just<00:02:36.040> encourage<00:02:36.400> more<00:02:36.580> people<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.000> take<00:02:37.750> part

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
just encourage more people to take part

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.530 
just encourage more people to take part
really
