00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.049
 from wetter.net 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.060
 the heat is now turning right on us 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.680
 See a map of Europe here 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.360
 coming saturday the 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.800
 temperature distribution to be more accurate 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.139
 and the temperatures are over 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.599
 Central Europe on the coming Saturday, after all 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.119
 very similar to the temperatures above 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.369
 Sahara This hot Sahara is in air 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.439
 the past days about spain 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.070
 portugal and france to us 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.109
 drawn 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.119
 even today on thursday girls already 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.690
 reach the temperatures really hot 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.240
 on the Rhine 36 to 38 degrees in the shade 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.300
 it stays a bit cooler in the northeast 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.050
 there will be a maximum of 25 to 30 degrees 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.090
 expected 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.040
 in the afternoon but then also 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.880
 Individual heat storms form above all 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.950
 things in the west 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.690
 yes and where it can occur there 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.880
 really hard to go with it 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.770
 storm with heavy rain hail and also 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.630
 squalls also in the coming night 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.400
 there are still some thunderstorms this 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.230
 but gradually fall in itself 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.110
 otherwise the sky is usually together 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.610
 cloudless and the temperatures are not 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.280
 more so far back 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.429
 partly in the early morning between 22 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 and 24 degrees in the west so to sleep 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.539
 These values ​​are not very good 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.999
 suitable we also speak 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.280
 Temperatures around or above 20 degrees in the 

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:19.289
 night of a tropical night 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.420
 friday goes on similarly hot there are 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.789
 a lot of sunshine and the temperatures 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.740
 reach up to 38 degrees in the shade 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.289
 there is also the single act 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.359
 violent heat thunderstorms brings the saturday 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.999
 then probably the peak of 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.859
 around the 40 degrees yes and that can 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:38.429
 probably here and there even the 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:40.710
 all-time record of 40 2 degrees in danger 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.780
 bring a lot of sunshine and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.380
 fierce again in the afternoon and evening 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.600
 storm 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.450
 Sunday will be very hot again 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.179
 with temperatures between 29 and 39 degrees 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.159
 but also here are local in the afternoon 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.590
 single thunderstorms possible 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.569
 at that time still briefly the next week 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.060
 and there we see the heat that leaves 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.939
 not really after she goes on monday 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.560
 at 37 degrees in the top something back 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.859
 but on tuesday it draws again 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.229
 on to peak values ​​up to 39 degrees 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.629
 again a lot of sun later violent again 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.530
 showers and thunderstorms and on wednesday there 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.959
 he puts the whole 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.450
 big heat probably a break 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.700
 the temperatures reach 24 to 34 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.160
 The highest value is still in the picture 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.700
 east and there are some violent 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.380
 storm 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.510
 but the trend for the second 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.800
 Julie's weekend could be back then 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.050
 get really hot 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.489
 with that heated prospect there 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.780
 I wish you a nice day 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.780
