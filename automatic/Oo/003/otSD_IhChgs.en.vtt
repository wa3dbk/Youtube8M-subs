00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.370
 in today's class I'm going to give you some 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.769
 Basic concepts for recording guitars 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.540
 line line record means 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.580
 connect the guitar directly to the 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.680
 sound plate instead of recording it with 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.840
 an amplifier and a microphone is a 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.150
 very simple technique and very used in 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.099
 home studies my first recommendation 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.140
 is that they record with the guitar to the maximum 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.359
 volume and control the entry level 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.009
 from the sound board but with a lot 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.289
 careful not to make some of the 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.689
 following errors the first error is 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.669
 record a signal too low from this 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.949
 mode we do not take advantage of the dynamic range and 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.539
 the resolution my system offers me and 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.280
 weak signals tend to be more 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.769
 noisy because they are closer to the floor 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.780
 of noise the second error is everything 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.379
 otherwise record with the signal too 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.969
 high 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.530
 this means that some peaks of my 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.570
 signal exceed the maximum volume 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.850
 allowed by my system and that's going to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.379
 sound like a clip eo or a saturation and 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.050
 this problem is even worse than the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.940
 earlier because you can not reverse and 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.550
 here we have a healthy signal away from 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.120
 noise floor and far from saturating let's 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.120
 see how you hear 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.640
 as you can notice the recorded guitars 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 line do not have a great sound per se 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.010
 same 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.160
 you always have to process them with some 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.230
 plugin like the guitar or the amplitude in 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.090
 this case I will use any preset of 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.180
 the amplitude only for them to listen 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.980
 the guitar processed later I'm going to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.050
 do some specific tutorial for 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.560
 teach them to use this plugin we are going to 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.560
 listen to this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420
 Y 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.159
 as a conclusion I can tell you that 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.780
 record line guitars and process them 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.950
 with these plugins is a very good 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.500
 option when they do not have a good 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.360
 amplifier and a good microphone does not 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.100
