00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.670 
her a garment and she'll work it you
know<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.480> think<00:01:57.900> that's<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> best<00:01:58.470> part

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
know so I think that's the best part

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.790 
know so I think that's the best part
about<00:01:58.740> her<00:01:59.030> conversational<00:02:00.030> prints<00:02:00.770> also<00:02:01.770> I

about her conversational prints also I

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.710

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
if something looks nice it's just a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.930 
if something looks nice it's just a
matter<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.739> putting<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.160> on<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.640> going<00:03:44.850> ahead

with<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.300> show<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> mean<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.840> thought<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.320> show

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
with the show I mean I thought the show

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.070

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
better way than putting a gold or a
