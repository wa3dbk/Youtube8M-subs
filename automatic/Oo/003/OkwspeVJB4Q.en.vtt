today<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.510> will<00:00:00.690> show<00:00:01.020> you<00:00:01.079> my<00:00:02.070> new<00:00:02.100> machine

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
today I will show you my new machine

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.900 
today I will show you my new machine
it's<00:00:03.240> called<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.190> recycling<00:00:05.190> sorting

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
it's called the recycling sorting

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.700

machine

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
machine

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.910 
machine
in<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.090> put<00:00:09.120> what<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.110> want<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.559> sort

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
in here you put what you want to sort

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.440 
in here you put what you want to sort
out<00:00:11.910> put<00:00:12.330> last<00:00:12.870> wood<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.860> iron<00:00:14.400> blocks

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
out put last wood and iron blocks

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.980 
out put last wood and iron blocks
this<00:00:16.289> machine<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> even<00:00:17.640> designed<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:18.390> mock

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
this machine is even designed for mock

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.939 
this machine is even designed for mock
grinders<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.630> automatic<00:00:21.630> farms<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.740> will

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
grinders and automatic farms and I will

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.100

show<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.189> food<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.480> minute

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
show you food in a minute

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.109 
show you food in a minute
once<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.740> select<00:00:26.539> what<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.780> want<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.140> sort

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
once you select what you want to sort

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.549 
once you select what you want to sort
you<00:00:30.119> switch<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:32.030> each<00:00:33.030> object<00:00:33.559> its

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
you switch it on and each object its

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.180 
you switch it on and each object its
captured<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:35.969> machine<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:37.379> see<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
captured from the machine can see the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.690 
captured from the machine can see the
blocks<00:00:38.579> cut<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:40.200> design<00:00:40.470> and<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.610> eyes

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
blocks cut your design and the eyes

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.330 
blocks cut your design and the eyes
this<00:00:44.600> is<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:45.020> bill<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:45.770> can<00:00:46.010> throw

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
this is the bill you can throw

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.060 
this is the bill you can throw
everything<00:00:46.940> in<00:00:47.329> here<00:00:47.750> when<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:48.379> objects

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
everything in here when the objects

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.780 
everything in here when the objects
passed<00:00:49.450> predict<00:00:50.530> captured<00:00:51.530> blocks<00:00:52.010> if

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
passed predict captured blocks if

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:11.789 
passed predict captured blocks if
they're<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.449> same<00:00:53.860> they<00:00:54.860> stop

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.280 

if<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:13.159> doesn't<00:01:13.610> match<00:01:13.820> any<00:01:14.240> of<00:01:14.450> these<00:01:14.810> blocks

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
if it doesn't match any of these blocks

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:24.030 
if it doesn't match any of these blocks
it<00:01:15.680> will<00:01:16.400> go<00:01:16.640> in<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.090> lava

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:33.100 

if<00:01:25.040> we<00:01:25.430> stop<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.030> machine<00:01:31.330> all<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.510> saturated

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
if we stop the machine all the saturated

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.060 
if we stop the machine all the saturated
blocks<00:01:33.940> come<00:01:34.940> out<00:01:35.210> here

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.880 

you

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:22.400 

I<00:02:07.800> start<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:09.010> machine<00:02:12.840> you're<00:02:13.840> captured

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.910

the<00:02:26.400> objects<00:02:27.120> will<00:02:27.300> fall<00:02:27.630> down<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.650> this

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the objects will fall down here this

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:53.460 
the objects will fall down here this
would<00:02:29.910> come<00:02:30.209> from<00:02:30.510> an<00:02:30.750> automatic<00:02:31.709> alarm

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:02.170
