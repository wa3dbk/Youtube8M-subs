00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.560
 it is certainly not wrong to say that 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.450
 design concepts that before 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.180
 concerned the so-called big car 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.189
 today instead they also concern cars of the 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.779
 smaller segments the so-called cities 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.550
 car that we see in our cities that 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.230
 what it means means we don't have 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.880
 plus the cans that run in between 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.070
 in the legs when we are in our streets 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.989
 of our cities but we have car 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.249
 like the kia picanto that starts from about 9 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.529
 thousand the version this instead 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.940
 urban 3 doors with 1000 engine that 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.620
 it costs about 11,000 beautiful the front is 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.780
 developed vertically with the nest 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.550
 this too is nice 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.039
 this red plastic frame that 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.980
 but with a very racing effect 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.469
 impact also the LEDs we have in the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.440
 front optical unit that are not the 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.510
 unique LEDs inserted by those who know about this 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.320
 car that meanwhile we show you 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.670
 in all its length but which are 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.710
 shooting also in the optical group 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.440
 back where we have for stops 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.840
 still led and then led as well in the lights of 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.979
 position with these band really 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.990
 interesting 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.409
 the illness inevitably does not have one 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.820
 capacity from berlin na but it's obvious though 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.520
 we'll just have to beat the seats for 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.799
 increase the volume the real question that 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.360
 you will probably be doing it yes but 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.119
 as there is in this car there is 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.060
 high history quite comfortable because pur 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.240
 not being able to deep east to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.149
 steering wheel can orient in length in 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.219
 seat depth then an access 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.979
 thanks to the very wide tailgate 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:40.969
 really easy they are all down everyone 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.310
 back like I'm fine between 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.829
 the other I also see very well I had 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.850
 cold hands first but fortunately in 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.469
 this car 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.329
 the heated steering wheel then gloves them 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.110
 I can throw it away and now let's go to 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.430
 drive it well friends hd engines we are 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.790
 at the wheel today of 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.030
 picanto three-door urban model 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.450
 the engine is a 1000 3 cylinder from 69 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.830
 horses with only 99 grams per 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.460
 kilometer with regard to 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.520
 CO2 emissions really below 100 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.010
 grams and is as good as what 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.240
 let's start talking about the street despite being 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.180
 a purely urban car the estate 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.740
 street is not never a problem 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.350
 also because the pace of this picanto 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.080
 it's long enough 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.880
 equally good is the steering that has one 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.640
 crown a little big but a servant 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.930
 assistance such as sports because yes 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.989
 stiffens I say a lot but in 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.450
 reality is right when we increase 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.390
 the gait while in the city it always remains 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.410
 very very soft the steering the thing 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.660
 that struck me that in this 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.950
 very much is the clutch system e 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.030
 change because it has grafts really 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.100
 always precise and punctual but none 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.380
 problem and the clutch is really a lot 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.330
 soft thing in the city if we have 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.380
 an automatic gearbox 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:14.030
 it's always nice to have five marches that 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.460
 I'm quite well spaced. I talk to you 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.670
 now by 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.190
 interior and ride comfort then the 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.190
 suspensions absorb the well enough 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.700
 road bumps 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.090
 maybe they ask to cure a little bit of 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.960
 more 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.140
 the soundproofing which is the only flaw 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.850
 This car is not good not to 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.380
 city gaits 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.170
 but when we started going a pace 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.020
 highways around 100 120 130 here 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.870
 the noise of both the engine and the flows 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.690
 aerodynamics begins to be felt 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.530
 that first roundabout no problem 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.390
 we write in second the motor is 69 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.670
 horses are also gritty what 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.730
 I told you before you feel like the engine 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.470
 when we accelerate it starts to make itself heard 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.010
 I had to raise the tone a little bit 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.000
 of my voice to dominate it here we are 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.480
 in the tract with 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 grainy holes and asphalt what 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.799
 says first rolling noise of the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.299
 tires a little bit into the car 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.459
 while for comfort 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.210
 of the suspensions there are no problems 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.930
 they are calibrated rather on the soft and 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.230
 they absorb every kind of roughness well 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.430
 road 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.760
 then looking at tools we have 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.340
 tachometer we have obviously the 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.160
 speedometer speedometer indicator 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.560
 gasoline thing but also in all this is missing 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.560
 an outdoor temperature indicator 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.860
 strange is missing but what is there 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.510
 a respectable accessory attraction 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.430
 because we have seats that are 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.950
 heated and we also have the buttons 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.470
 here in the middle of the tunnel and you can 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.780
 move to two levels of heating 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.360
 but not just those mornings 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.670
 particularly cold maybe and maybe 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.440
 united there is not just because there is a 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.210
 button in the dashboard that activates 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.530
 even the heating of the 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.360
 steering wheel crown a little strange 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.810
 the absence given all these options 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.840
 bluetooth on the radio which is one 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.410
 classic unit but can read either 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.480
 the mp3 is the ipod thanks to the socket la 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.260
 down but then we will, as usual, 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.150
 focus on infotainment of this too 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.960
 now let 's take the test of 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.690
 acceleration and braking memory that I am 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.730
 153 the maximum number of kilometers per hour 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.760
 reach this fair price we feel 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:51.700
 the character of this engine 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.700
 above 4,000 rpm it becomes almost bad 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:06:01.390
 limiter at 6500 we arrive here in 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:05.650
 braked event date of abs accomplice the 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.880
 we are reduced weight by ton 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.340
 braking distances were 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.710
 really short graph of this 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.550
 picanto even if we arrived not 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:19.300
 own slow to our usual test of 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.220
 braking off very good absorption 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.870
 suspension now we have the 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:30.030
 classic left right to left 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.030
 the stability test 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.190
 I obviously emphasize this roundabout 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.600
 even releasing the accelerator in 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.210
 We didn't get out of corners 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.320
 problems if law succeeds a little 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:49.190
 back but are always a lot of reactions 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.220
 well controlled obviously there is the sp 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.480
 it can be disarmed it speaks to you quickly 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.470
 of interior finishes 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:01.970
 I really like this bronze band that 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:04.520
 it has a soft touch finish like it is almost 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.890
 velvety and almost rubbery very beautiful from 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.810
 touching also to see is not bad 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.130
 air conditioning is obviously manual 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.230
 it works pretty well of course 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.900
 we will have to play here a little with 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.400
 the temperature knob for 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.750
 find the optimal one but is equipped with 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.370
 air conditioning then compressor 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.930
 for plastic conditioning 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:31.730
 good enough no sense of 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:33.790
 chip and saddlery partially in leather e 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:37.850
 you can already see how the side panels 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.050
 be dressed while the seat is in 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.140
 fabric 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:45.920
 as for consumption we are up 

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.690
 an average of 14 km with a liter 

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.060
 they were three cylinders we expected 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:54.330
 something something less 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:58.080
 but I would say that we are average 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:00.480
 on average a notable plus of this 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.610
 I always remember the guarantee because 

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.790
 this one who has it you can drive for 7 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:08.340
 years or 150,000 kilometers without worrying 

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.280
 because it will be covered by the warranty 

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.970
 official of the house for hd engines 

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.970
