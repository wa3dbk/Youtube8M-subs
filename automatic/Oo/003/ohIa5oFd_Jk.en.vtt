one<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.610> real<00:01:54.790> problems<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.480> how<00:01:55.720> do<00:01:55.780> you

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
one of the real problems is how do you

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.990 
one of the real problems is how do you
tell<00:01:56.080> individuals<00:01:56.290> apart<00:01:57.010> and<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:57.670> what<00:01:57.850> we've

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
tell individuals apart and so what we've

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.270 
tell individuals apart and so what we've
been<00:01:58.030> doing<00:01:58.210> for<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.810> last<00:01:58.900> 25<00:01:59.320> years<00:01:59.500> is<00:02:00.070> the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
been doing for the last 25 years is the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.190 
been doing for the last 25 years is the
traditional<00:02:00.850> method<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.270> marking<00:02:01.810> penguins

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
traditional method of marking penguins

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.860 
traditional method of marking penguins
we<00:02:02.650> kind<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.950> put<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.250> band<00:02:03.580> on<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.180> penguin<00:02:04.510> so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
we kind of put a band on a penguin so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.710 
we kind of put a band on a penguin so
this<00:02:05.260> is<00:02:05.410> what<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> band<00:02:06.070> looks<00:02:06.310> like<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:07.240> we

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
this is what a band looks like and we

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.600 
this is what a band looks like and we
actually<00:02:07.900> put<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.679> left<00:02:08.890> flipper<00:02:09.250> so

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
actually put it on the left flipper so

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.880 
actually put it on the left flipper so
it's<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.970> little<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.509> wearing<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.020> bracelet<00:02:11.620> or

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
it's a little like wearing a bracelet or

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.250 
it's a little like wearing a bracelet or
something<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.900> can<00:02:14.080> tell

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
something like that and so we can tell

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.320 
something like that and so we can tell
the<00:02:14.410> individuals<00:02:14.950> apart<00:02:15.340> what<00:02:15.940> we're<00:02:16.090> trying

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
the individuals apart what we're trying

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.110 
the individuals apart what we're trying
to<00:02:16.450> do<00:02:16.630> now<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:17.370> instead<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.430> having<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.850> read

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
to do now is instead of having to read

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.800 
to do now is instead of having to read
the<00:02:19.300> band

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
the band

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.380 
the band
let<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> penguin<00:02:20.860> identify<00:02:21.550> themselves<00:02:22.060> and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
let the penguin identify themselves and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.030 
let the penguin identify themselves and
we're<00:02:22.780> doing<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.200> by<00:02:23.380> putting<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.770> little

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
we're doing this by putting a little

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.510 
we're doing this by putting a little
tiny<00:02:24.280> tag<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:25.090> their<00:02:25.630> foot<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.350> then<00:02:27.130> that's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
tiny tag in their foot and then that's

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.010 
tiny tag in their foot and then that's
like<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> barcode<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.360> you'd<00:02:28.600> put<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.900> your

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
like a barcode that you'd put in your

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.790 
like a barcode that you'd put in your
dog<00:02:29.230> or<00:02:29.530> cats<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.040> they<00:02:30.430> walk<00:02:30.790> across<00:02:31.060> a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
magnetic grate and they tell us who they

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.320 
magnetic grate and they tell us who they
are

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
bother the Penguins at all and we can

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.979 
bother the Penguins at all and we can

the forage how long are they staying

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.539 
the forage how long are they staying
home<00:03:40.690> with<00:03:40.900> their<00:03:41.019> chicks<00:03:41.320> and<00:03:41.590> then<00:03:42.220> we<00:03:42.370> can

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
home with their chicks and then we can

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.490 
home with their chicks and then we can
start<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.970> look<00:03:43.120> at<00:03:43.299> what's<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.870> effect<00:03:44.320> of
