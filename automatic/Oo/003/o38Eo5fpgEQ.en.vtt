00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
to fit in a third row back there so they

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.300 
to fit in a third row back there so they
increased<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.109> storage<00:03:22.440> capacity<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:23.010> kept

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
want to set it to so if you have shorter

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.520 
want to set it to so if you have shorter
people<00:04:11.669> operating<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.329> vehicle<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.930> they

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
people operating this vehicle and they

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.460 
people operating this vehicle and they
feel<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.370> need<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.579> jump<00:04:15.030> up<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.359> grab<00:04:16.079> back<00:04:16.289> I

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
feel the need to jump up and grab back I

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.270 
feel the need to jump up and grab back I
can't<00:04:16.889> reach<00:04:17.070> it

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
can't reach it

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.520 
can't reach it
you<00:04:17.759> can<00:04:17.880> actually<00:04:18.030> hold<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.509> down<00:04:18.630> here<00:04:18.989> and

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
you can actually hold it down here and

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.379 
you can actually hold it down here and
you<00:04:19.650> can<00:04:20.070> hold<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.310> button<00:04:20.579> it'll<00:04:20.909> lock<00:04:21.150> it

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389
