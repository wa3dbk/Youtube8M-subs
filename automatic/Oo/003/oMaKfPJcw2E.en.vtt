playing it at least for quite a while I

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.100 
playing it at least for quite a while I

battlefield 4 hardline comes out which

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.189 
battlefield 4 hardline comes out which
I'm<00:05:52.879> planning<00:05:53.089> on<00:05:53.150> getting<00:05:53.270> for<00:05:53.599> PC<00:05:53.990> as<00:05:54.169> well

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
I'm planning on getting for PC as well

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.649 
I'm planning on getting for PC as well
and<00:05:54.589> that<00:05:54.919> looks<00:05:55.129> like<00:05:55.250> a<00:05:55.279> lot<00:05:55.460> of<00:05:55.580> fun<00:05:55.729> but<00:05:56.599> I

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
and that looks like a lot of fun but I

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:57.670 
and that looks like a lot of fun but I
will<00:05:56.810> begin<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.050> call<00:05:57.199> through<00:05:57.379> the<00:05:57.409> advance

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
will begin to call through the advance

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.730 
will begin to call through the advance
work<00:05:57.919> where<00:05:58.069> I<00:05:58.099> think<00:05:58.189> on<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.550> ps4<00:05:59.439> and<00:06:00.439> I<00:06:00.560> make

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
work where I think on the ps4 and I make

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.559 
work where I think on the ps4 and I make
an<00:06:00.860> Xbox<00:06:01.189> one<00:06:01.279> but<00:06:01.550> ps4<00:06:01.969> at<00:06:02.029> this<00:06:02.149> time<00:06:02.389> it's

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
an Xbox one but ps4 at this time it's

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.300 
an Xbox one but ps4 at this time it's
just<00:06:02.599> because<00:06:03.020> there's<00:06:03.560> way<00:06:03.710> more<00:06:03.740> people<00:06:04.069> who

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
just because there's way more people who

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.110 
just because there's way more people who
own<00:06:04.460> a<00:06:04.490> ps4

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
own a ps4

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.610 
own a ps4
hence<00:06:05.689> I<00:06:05.810> think<00:06:06.020> I'll<00:06:06.080> get<00:06:06.199> a<00:06:06.229> better<00:06:06.349> chance

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
hence I think I'll get a better chance

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.559 
hence I think I'll get a better chance
for<00:06:06.919> matching<00:06:07.250> out<00:06:07.370> with<00:06:07.490> more<00:06:07.969> people<00:06:08.180> and

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
for matching out with more people and

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.149 
for matching out with more people and
not<00:06:08.629> be<00:06:08.810> sitting<00:06:08.990> them<00:06:09.259> you<00:06:09.319> know<00:06:09.469> lobbies

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:10.159 
not be sitting them you know lobbies

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.850 
not be sitting them you know lobbies
with<00:06:10.279> nobody<00:06:10.639> and<00:06:10.879> whatnot<00:06:11.810> so<00:06:12.139> anyways

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
with nobody and whatnot so anyways

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.709 
with nobody and whatnot so anyways
