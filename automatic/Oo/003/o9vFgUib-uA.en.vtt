00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:13.349
 Good, the recipe that we will prepare today is a recipe 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.738
 super easy to prepare 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.640
 It is a very typical recipe for French cuisine and you will see that it is very good. 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.550
 To do it we will need: mold bread, what we use at home. 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.980
 and the amount we want, depending on the amount of sandwiches 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.300
 what we want to do 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.560
 Then, cuts of sweet ham or sweet ham, 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.149
 grated gruyere cheese. 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 It is better to use gruyère cheese because it is the original that is used 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.560
 in the recipe, 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.479
 but if you do not have it, nothing happens. Especially, from a cheese that is melted 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:48.019
 well, 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.838
 and that it is grilled well in the oven. 

00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:57.958
 For the rest, the one you have at home. And, then, the bechamel sauce that 

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:00.880
 In another video I showed you how to do it, 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.650
 And I will leave you the link of the video, the link, 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.368
 In the video description, if you want to do it, you can do it. 

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:13.790
 First, we will take two slices of bread mold 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.920
 and the bechamel that we have left 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.629
 at room temperature 

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:21.959
 we will spread it to the 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:26.079
 top of the slice that we will use as a base. 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.929
 And we will spread the bechamel sauce for everything 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.200
 the base on our Croque monsieus sandwich. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.629
 The bechamel, above all, we must do that is not very consistent, 

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:41.489
 To be manageable but not very liquid. 

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.799
 Then, when we already have the base prepared, 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.670
 And well spread bechamel, 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.239
 We will add the gruyère cheese. 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.329
 well, 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.659
 everywhere, 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.659
 and scratched 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.170
 And now we'll put it over 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.170
 a cut of sweet ham. 

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:30.709
 We will put it well everywhere 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.658
 And in the other slice, in the face that will touch 

00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:38.388
 the ham, 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.588
 too, 

00:02:41.588 --> 00:02:48.588
 We will sprinkle it with bechamel sauce. 

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:50.628
 Once, well greased 

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.569
 we will contact the bechamel sauce 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.299
 with York ham or sweet ham. 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.348
 And we will tighten well so that everything is left 

00:03:00.348 --> 00:03:01.948
 well distributed. 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.558
 And, finally, you see that it's a very easy recipe, 

00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:10.158
 At the top we will spread it again 

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:13.348
 the bechamel sauce. 

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:20.348
 Meanwhile, we will have the preheated oven. 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.329
 And, now, we'll put thick cheese again 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:37.329
 above. 

00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:43.889
 We already have in our Croque Monsieur sandwiches 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.179
 Preparations and places in the oven tray. The oven has preheated it to 200 degrees 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.539
 for ten minutes, 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.598
 And now we will put them for 10 minutes to cook. 

00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:57.468
 You will see that, above all, it is important 

00:03:57.468 --> 00:04:01.808
 Leave the cheese off and let the top part be grateful. 

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:05.899
 It's been 10 minutes now and as you see, we already have what is part of 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:09.308
 top of sugar and melted cheese. So now Yalo is the only one we have 

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:11.149
 to do is enjoy it. 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.808
 Yes, by chance, it would get cold 

00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:17.798
 You can heat the microwave and it would be just as good. Or even give it to him 

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:21.000
 Bumblebee and it would look great, too. 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.709
 Well, here we have the result of our richest 

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:25.810
 Sandwich Croque Monsieur. 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.629
 As you can see, it is very easy to prepare, prepare in five minutes and it is 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.860
 very nice So I hope you liked the recipe, if so, give it to
