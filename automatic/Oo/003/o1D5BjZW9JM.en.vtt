00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.390 
high-speed Internet at their location
they've<00:00:23.000> tried<00:00:23.450> getting<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.650> service<00:00:24.950> with

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
they've tried getting a service with

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.659 
they've tried getting a service with
their<00:00:25.640> wireless<00:00:26.390> hub<00:00:26.750> they<00:00:27.080> can<00:00:27.320> get<00:00:27.500> a<00:00:27.669> good

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
their wireless hub they can get a good

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.940 
their wireless hub they can get a good
signal<00:00:28.970> outside<00:00:29.390> with<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.080> wireless<00:00:30.290> hub<00:00:30.710> but

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
signal outside with the wireless hub but

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.740 
signal outside with the wireless hub but
when<00:00:31.279> they<00:00:31.430> put<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.759> hub<00:00:31.939> inside<00:00:32.480> the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
when they put the hub inside the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.200 
when they put the hub inside the
building<00:00:33.230> they<00:00:34.220> can<00:00:34.430> no<00:00:34.579> longer<00:00:34.850> get<00:00:35.180> any

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
building they can no longer get any

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.990 
building they can no longer get any
signal<00:00:35.870> at<00:00:35.990> all<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:36.560> what<00:00:37.370> we've<00:00:37.579> done<00:00:37.790> is

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
signal at all so what we've done is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.540 
signal at all so what we've done is
we've<00:00:38.210> installed<00:00:38.870> this<00:00:40.210> antenna<00:00:41.210> here<00:00:42.550> this

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
we've installed this antenna here this

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.580 
we've installed this antenna here this
is<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.760> hub<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.270> works<00:00:44.570> or<00:00:44.930> sorry<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:45.290> is<00:00:45.470> an

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
is a hub that works or sorry this is an

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.800 
is a hub that works or sorry this is an
antenna<00:00:45.980> that<00:00:46.780> any<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.200> wireless<00:00:48.650> hub

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
antenna that any of the wireless hub

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.810 
antenna that any of the wireless hub
Rogers<00:00:50.810> bell<00:00:51.140> or<00:00:51.470> Telus<00:00:52.010> hubs<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:54.490> it<00:00:55.490> allows

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
Rogers bell or Telus hubs and it allows

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.780 
Rogers bell or Telus hubs and it allows
you<00:00:56.060> to<00:00:56.120> get<00:00:56.360> a<00:00:56.420> good<00:00:56.720> signal<00:00:57.050> outside<00:00:57.860> and

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
you to get a good signal outside and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.910 
you to get a good signal outside and
then<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.120> run<00:00:59.330> a<00:00:59.360> cable<00:00:59.690> in<00:01:00.020> that<00:01:00.230> connects<00:01:00.680> to

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
then you run a cable in that connects to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.560 
then you run a cable in that connects to
the<00:01:01.040> hub<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.890> use<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.129> external<00:01:04.850> antenna

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
the hub and use the external antenna

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.450 
the hub and use the external antenna
connector<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.409> connect<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:07.009> up<00:01:07.070> and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
connector so you connect that up and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.410 
connector so you connect that up and
then<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:08.090> get<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.270> good<00:01:08.570> signal<00:01:09.790> inside<00:01:10.790> so

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
then you can get a good signal inside so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.170 
then you can get a good signal inside so
that<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:11.689> can<00:01:11.869> have<00:01:12.020> internet<00:01:12.740> service<00:01:13.180> so

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
that you can have internet service so

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.789 
that you can have internet service so
I'll<00:01:14.270> show<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.720> hub<00:01:14.869> inside<00:01:15.289> we've<00:01:15.590> run

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
I'll show you the hub inside we've run

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.160 
I'll show you the hub inside we've run
the<00:01:15.979> cabling<00:01:16.460> in<00:01:16.700> from<00:01:17.359> here<00:01:17.689> into<00:01:18.049> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
the cabling in from here into the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.990 
the cabling in from here into the
building<00:01:18.590> here

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.950 

so<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.870> is<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.410> hub<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.670> bottom<00:01:24.180> cable

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
so this is the hub here the bottom cable

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.290 
so this is the hub here the bottom cable
that<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:25.590> black<00:01:25.860> cable<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
that you see the black cable with the

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.870 
that you see the black cable with the
brass<00:01:27.540> connector<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.710> antenna<00:01:29.310> cable

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
brass connector that's the antenna cable

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.950 
brass connector that's the antenna cable
that<00:01:30.120> is<00:01:30.480> coming<00:01:31.260> in<00:01:31.650> from<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.960> outdoor

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that is coming in from the outdoor

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.910 
that is coming in from the outdoor
antenna<00:01:35.330> so<00:01:36.330> it's<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.630> high<00:01:36.810> gain<00:01:37.140> antenna<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
antenna so it's a high gain antenna and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.010 
antenna so it's a high gain antenna and
it<00:01:38.010> connects<00:01:38.370> to<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.760> internal<00:01:39.420> antenna

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it connects to the internal antenna

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.580 
it connects to the internal antenna
connector<00:01:40.620> on<00:01:40.800> that<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
connector on that up here so that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.850 
connector on that up here so that
antenna<00:01:44.220> will<00:01:44.490> work<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:45.000> any<00:01:45.660> Bell<00:01:46.110> Rogers

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
antenna will work with any Bell Rogers

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.390 
antenna will work with any Bell Rogers
or<00:01:47.040> tell<00:01:47.460> us<00:01:47.490> hub<00:01:48.830> sometimes<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:49.980> need<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> get

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
or tell us hub sometimes you need to get

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.250 
or tell us hub sometimes you need to get
a<00:01:50.430> different<00:01:50.940> adapter<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.110> will

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
a different adapter so that it will

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.850 
a different adapter so that it will
adapt<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.100> different<00:01:53.460> types<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.970> hubs<00:01:54.240> but

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
adapt to the different types of hubs but

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
adapt to the different types of hubs but
the<00:01:55.860> antenna<00:01:56.250> gives<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> much<00:01:57.300> better

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the antenna gives you a much better

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.719 
the antenna gives you a much better
signal<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.440> high<00:01:58.650> gain<00:01:58.920> antenna<00:01:59.460> it's

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
signal it's a high gain antenna it's

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.080 
signal it's a high gain antenna it's
also<00:02:00.080> more<00:02:01.080> directional<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.160> can<00:02:02.490> point

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
also more directional so you can point

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330 
also more directional so you can point
it<00:02:03.270> towards<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.930> tower<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.680> optimal

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it towards the tower to get optimal

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.240 
it towards the tower to get optimal
signal<00:02:05.729> strength<00:02:06.060> which<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:07.229> turn<00:02:07.860> will

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
signal strength which it in turn will

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.400 
signal strength which it in turn will
give<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> more<00:02:09.240> improved<00:02:09.660> stable<00:02:10.410> speeds

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
give you a more improved stable speeds

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.080 
give you a more improved stable speeds

and<00:03:03.129> three<00:03:03.939> point<00:03:04.209> two<00:03:04.480> eight<00:03:04.510> megabits<00:03:05.230> per

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
and three point two eight megabits per

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.460 
and three point two eight megabits per
second<00:03:05.860> upload<00:03:06.220> speed<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:08.290> was

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
second upload speed so that was

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.699 
second upload speed so that was
considerably<00:03:09.280> better<00:03:09.519> too<00:03:10.349> when<00:03:11.349> they<00:03:11.470> put

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
considerably better too when they put

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.890 
considerably better too when they put
the<00:03:11.829> hub<00:03:12.040> inside<00:03:12.640> here<00:03:13.090> they<00:03:13.269> weren't<00:03:13.750> really

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
the hub inside here they weren't really

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.220 
the hub inside here they weren't really
getting<00:03:14.170> any<00:03:14.500> signal<00:03:15.069> at<00:03:15.220> all<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:16.230> it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
getting any signal at all in it it

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.530 
getting any signal at all in it it
worked<00:03:17.530> terribly<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.430> once<00:03:18.879> we<00:03:19.060> put<00:03:19.299> the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
worked terribly so once we put the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.289 
worked terribly so once we put the
antenna<00:03:20.079> outside<00:03:20.409> and<00:03:21.010> got<00:03:21.760> them<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.120> nice

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
antenna outside and got them a nice

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.210 
antenna outside and got them a nice
strong<00:03:22.629> signal<00:03:23.170> their<00:03:23.349> speeds<00:03:23.739> are<00:03:23.980> fairly

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
strong signal their speeds are fairly

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:36.160 
strong signal their speeds are fairly
consistent<00:03:24.519> like<00:03:25.269> this

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.230
