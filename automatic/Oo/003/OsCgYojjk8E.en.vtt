00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
let's go with one gram of protein per

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.179 
let's go with one gram of protein per
pound<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.400> bodyweight<00:01:24.409> for<00:01:25.409> instance<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.979> weigh

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
pound of bodyweight for instance I weigh

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.039

about a hundred and thirty pounds I

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.249 
about a hundred and thirty pounds I
would<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.409> consuming<00:01:29.040> 130<00:01:30.030> grams<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.750> protein

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
would be consuming 130 grams of protein

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.249 
would be consuming 130 grams of protein
per<00:01:31.710> day<00:01:32.000> alright<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> would<00:01:33.600> divide<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
per day alright so I would divide that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.800 
per day alright so I would divide that
out<00:01:34.530> throughout<00:01:35.189> my<00:01:35.460> meals<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> have

about how many grams I'm consuming at
each<00:01:39.390> meal<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:42.270> protein<00:01:43.049> my

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
each meal so I have here my protein my

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.730 
each meal so I have here my protein my
carbohydrate<00:01:44.310> I'm<00:01:44.670> gonna<00:01:45.180> use<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.079> scale<00:01:46.439> that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
ounces of protein at each meal so I have

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.500 
ounces of protein at each meal so I have
my<00:02:22.360> four<00:02:22.630> ounces<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.930> protein<00:02:23.280> next<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.430> a

my four ounces of protein next is a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.620 
my four ounces of protein next is a
carbohydrates

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
carbohydrates

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.900 
carbohydrates
I<00:02:25.690> usually<00:02:26.050> go<00:02:26.410> by<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.680> guideline<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.520> about<00:02:27.760> a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
I usually go by the guideline of about a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.500 
I usually go by the guideline of about a
hundred<00:02:28.390> grams<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:29.200> carbs<00:02:29.800> per<00:02:30.040> day<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.910> I

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
hundred grams of carbs per day and I

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.080 
hundred grams of carbs per day and I
sometimes<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.830> know<00:02:32.950> go<00:02:33.280> maybe<00:02:33.730> slightly

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
sometimes you know go maybe slightly

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.780 
sometimes you know go maybe slightly
over<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.900> um<00:02:35.170> sometimes<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.070> little<00:02:36.160> bit<00:02:36.310> under

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
over and um sometimes a little bit under

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.480 
over and um sometimes a little bit under
but<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:36.970> stay<00:02:37.420> around<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.170> range<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.890> that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
but I stay around that range and that

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.400 
but I stay around that range and that
seems<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.000> be<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> healthy<00:02:40.660> range<00:02:40.930> for<00:02:41.230> most

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
seems to be a healthy range for most

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.520 
seems to be a healthy range for most
people<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.030> gonna<00:02:43.210> be<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> lower<00:02:44.080> side

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
people it is gonna be on the lower side

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.830 
people it is gonna be on the lower side
but<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.340> want<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.700> take<00:02:45.940> advantage<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.570> when

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
but you want to take advantage of when

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.600 
but you want to take advantage of when
you<00:02:47.020> eat<00:02:47.230> your<00:02:47.380> carbs<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.070> want<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.370> space

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
you eat your carbs and you want to space

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.580 
you eat your carbs and you want to space
them<00:02:48.670> around<00:02:49.330> say<00:02:49.600> your<00:02:49.780> workouts<00:02:50.290> are<00:02:50.470> your

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
most active times of the day which are

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.840 
most active times of the day which are
typically<00:02:52.930> going<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.260> be<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.740> morning<00:02:54.010> so

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
typically going to be in the morning so

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.080 
typically going to be in the morning so
I<00:02:54.880> have<00:02:55.210> my<00:02:55.390> carbs<00:02:55.840> here<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.850> I'm<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.000> to

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
I have my carbs here and I'm going to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.840 
I have my carbs here and I'm going to
place<00:02:58.420> them<00:02:58.720> on<00:02:58.780> my<00:02:58.960> scale<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.160> was<00:03:00.400> at<00:03:00.550> four

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
place them on my scale and I was at four

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.750 
place them on my scale and I was at four
ounces<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.600> should<00:03:01.870> now<00:03:02.110> go<00:03:02.440> let's<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.220> six

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
ounces and I should now go let's see six

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.350 
ounces and I should now go let's see six
so<00:03:04.060> I'm<00:03:04.630> at<00:03:04.840> two<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.350> half<00:03:05.590> ounces<00:03:06.250> of

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
so I'm at two and a half ounces of

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.380 
so I'm at two and a half ounces of
carbohydrates<00:03:07.360> right<00:03:07.660> here<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:09.220> this<00:03:10.180> is<00:03:10.360> a

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
carbohydrates right here and this is a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.010 
carbohydrates right here and this is a
1/2<00:03:11.070> let's<00:03:12.070> see<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:13.090> was<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.300> half<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.780> cup

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
1/2 let's see the this was a half a cup

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.660 
1/2 let's see the this was a half a cup
so<00:03:15.450> you're<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.320> range<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.860> around<00:03:18.010> thirty

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
so you're in the range of around thirty

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.570 
so you're in the range of around thirty
grams<00:03:19.150> with<00:03:19.570> this<00:03:19.780> portion<00:03:20.440> right<00:03:20.920> here<00:03:21.340> which

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
grams with this portion right here which

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.370 
grams with this portion right here which
is<00:03:21.790> good<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.270> feel<00:03:22.570> like<00:03:22.780> I'm<00:03:22.930> gonna<00:03:23.080> still<00:03:23.350> have

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
is good I feel like I'm gonna still have

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.610 
is good I feel like I'm gonna still have
space<00:03:23.920> for<00:03:23.950> more<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.810> then<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.959> comes<00:03:26.230> to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
space for more and then it comes to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.360 
space for more and then it comes to
vegetables<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.450> with<00:03:29.230> vegetables<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.070> kind

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
vegetables so with vegetables you kind

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.460 
vegetables so with vegetables you kind
of<00:03:30.489> get<00:03:30.640> like<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.880> free<00:03:31.180> pass<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.900> my<00:03:32.020> opinion

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
of get like a free pass in my opinion

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.690 
of get like a free pass in my opinion
especially<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:32.950> you're<00:03:33.070> going<00:03:33.220> with<00:03:33.370> green

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
especially if you're going with green

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.510 
especially if you're going with green
vegetables<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.630> typically<00:03:35.440> go<00:03:35.709> by<00:03:35.950> about<00:03:36.160> one

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
vegetables I typically go by about one

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.479 
vegetables I typically go by about one
cup<00:03:36.880> at<00:03:37.570> each<00:03:37.810> meal<00:03:38.170> but<00:03:38.890> if<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:39.280> go<00:03:39.459> over

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
cup at each meal but if you go over

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.150 
cup at each meal but if you go over
under<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.570> no<00:03:40.930> big<00:03:41.200> deal<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.739> don't<00:03:41.800> even
