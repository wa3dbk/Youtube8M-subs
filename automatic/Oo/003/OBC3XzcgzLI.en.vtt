on my skin after I wash my face just to
kind<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.920> see<00:03:41.190> if<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.970> helps<00:03:42.329> reduce<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
kind of see if it helps reduce the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.319 
kind of see if it helps reduce the
redness<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.829> haven't<00:03:44.220> seen<00:03:44.430> any<00:03:44.640> change<00:03:45.060> to

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
redness and I haven't seen any change to

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.870 
redness and I haven't seen any change to
be<00:03:45.420> honest<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.230> like<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.950> said<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.430> oil<00:03:47.610> it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
be honest and like I said of the oil it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.390 
be honest and like I said of the oil it
makes<00:03:48.090> me<00:03:48.269> more<00:03:48.420> oily<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.290> I'm<00:03:49.799> not<00:03:49.980> gonna<00:03:50.130> say

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
makes me more oily so I'm not gonna say

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.610 
makes me more oily so I'm not gonna say
that<00:03:50.549> this<00:03:50.670> product<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.209> bust<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:52.380> it

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
that this product is a bust I do like it

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.590 
that this product is a bust I do like it
I<00:03:52.799> think<00:03:52.859> there<00:03:53.280> are<00:03:53.370> certain<00:03:53.730> uses<00:03:54.030> for<00:03:54.480> it

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
I think there are certain uses for it

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.810 
I think there are certain uses for it
you<00:03:55.109> know<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> skin<00:03:55.950> refresher<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.489> think

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
you know like a skin refresher I think

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.500 
you know like a skin refresher I think
it's<00:03:56.970> beautiful<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:59.130> pore<00:03:59.459> minimizing<00:04:00.030> I

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
it's beautiful but the pore minimizing I

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.340 
it's beautiful but the pore minimizing I
just<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.260> don't<00:04:01.709> see<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.430> doing<00:04:02.670> anything<00:04:03.090> maybe

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
just I don't see it doing anything maybe

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.470 
just I don't see it doing anything maybe
it'll<00:04:04.350> work<00:04:04.380> in<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.799> long<00:04:05.040> run<00:04:05.329> like<00:04:06.329> it

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
it'll work in the long run like it

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.360 
it'll work in the long run like it
doesn't<00:04:06.810> really<00:04:06.900> say<00:04:07.230> but<00:04:07.530> maybe<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.160> have<00:04:08.340> to

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
doesn't really say but maybe you have to

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.190 
doesn't really say but maybe you have to
use<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.970> for<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.180> month<00:04:09.359> or<00:04:09.510> two<00:04:09.660> before<00:04:09.840> it'll

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
use it for a month or two before it'll

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.460 
use it for a month or two before it'll
help<00:04:10.410> with<00:04:10.500> your<00:04:10.739> pore<00:04:11.010> size<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.609> don't<00:04:12.239> see<00:04:12.930> a

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
help with your pore size I don't see a

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.330 
help with your pore size I don't see a
spray<00:04:14.100> doing<00:04:14.609> that<00:04:14.760> honest

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
spray doing that honest

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.979 
spray doing that honest
now<00:04:15.670> when<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:15.970> spray<00:04:16.359> something<00:04:16.630> on<00:04:16.810> your

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
now when you spray something on your

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.240 
now when you spray something on your
face<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.440> then<00:04:17.530> you're<00:04:17.650> putting<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.950> liquid

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
face and then you're putting a liquid

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.470 
face and then you're putting a liquid
foundation<00:04:18.400> on<00:04:18.850> top<00:04:18.880> of<00:04:19.239> it

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
foundation on top of it

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.270 
foundation on top of it
it<00:04:19.720> can<00:04:19.959> move<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:20.350> spray<00:04:20.620> on<00:04:20.680> your<00:04:20.829> face<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:21.250> I

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
it can move this spray on your face so I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.409 
it can move this spray on your face so I
don't<00:04:21.519> even<00:04:21.700> know<00:04:22.000> how<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.240> would<00:04:22.919> stick<00:04:23.919> I

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
don't even know how it would stick I

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.409 
don't even know how it would stick I
don't<00:04:25.419> know<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:27.040> don't<00:04:27.280> know<00:04:27.340> overall<00:04:28.150> I

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
don't know so I don't know overall I

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.920 
don't know so I don't know overall I
think<00:04:28.510> that<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.620> spray<00:04:30.490> doesn't<00:04:30.820> really<00:04:31.720> do

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
think that this spray doesn't really do

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.250 
think that this spray doesn't really do
what<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.230> says<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.800> can<00:04:33.340> do<00:04:33.520> but<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:34.780> good

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
what it says it can do but it is good

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.650 
what it says it can do but it is good
for<00:04:35.440> other<00:04:35.590> uses<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.220> it's<00:04:36.370> not<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.639> total<00:04:37.210> fail

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
for other uses so it's not a total fail

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.020 
for other uses so it's not a total fail
I<00:04:37.930> do<00:04:38.020> like<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.889> I'm<00:04:39.160> glad<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.490> bought<00:04:39.820> it

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
I do like it and I'm glad I bought it

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.840 
I do like it and I'm glad I bought it
I'm<00:04:40.540> also<00:04:40.780> glad<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.110> used<00:04:41.470> my<00:04:41.710> 20%<00:04:42.100> off<00:04:42.370> coupons

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
I'm also glad I used my 20% off coupons

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.900 
I'm also glad I used my 20% off coupons
and<00:04:43.120> buy<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.300> so<00:04:43.870> that's<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.639> does<00:04:45.880> feel

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
and buy it so that's it it does feel

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.300 
and buy it so that's it it does feel
really<00:04:46.090> good<00:04:46.450> on<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.690> face<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:47.169> do<00:04:47.650> like<00:04:48.070> it

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.010 
really good on the face I do like it
it's<00:04:48.520> just<00:04:48.910> I<00:04:49.150> don't<00:04:49.210> think<00:04:49.510> it<00:04:49.630> does<00:04:49.780> what<00:04:49.930> it

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
it's just I don't think it does what it

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.140 
it's just I don't think it does what it
says<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.320> does<00:04:50.350> so<00:04:50.830> that's<00:04:51.370> my<00:04:51.550> honest<00:04:51.850> opinion

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
says it does so that's my honest opinion

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.969 
says it does so that's my honest opinion
I'm<00:04:52.270> sorry<00:04:52.540> if<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.930> guys<00:04:53.050> saw<00:04:53.260> this<00:04:53.410> spray

don't<00:05:17.590> think<00:05:17.919> that<00:05:18.010> it<00:05:18.850> does<00:05:18.910> what<00:05:19.300> it<00:05:19.390> says<00:05:19.419> it

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
don't think that it does what it says it

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.840

does<00:05:19.750> for<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:20.650> it<00:05:21.010> gets<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.460> failing<00:05:21.669> grade

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
does for that it gets a failing grade

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.680 
does for that it gets a failing grade

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
but it is good at other things so well I

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.140 
but it is good at other things so well I
