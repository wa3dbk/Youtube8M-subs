I<00:00:24.630> believe<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.800> JJ<00:00:26.430> Yeley<00:00:26.789> yes<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.180> is

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.790 

and<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.930> yellow<00:00:34.200> flag<00:00:34.440> comes<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.840> we

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and the yellow flag comes out and we

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.490 
and the yellow flag comes out and we
check<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.280> tally<00:00:38.580> as<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.630> scoring<00:00:40.020> resets

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
check the tally as the scoring resets

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200 
check the tally as the scoring resets
with<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.830> field<00:00:41.070> crossing<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> start/finish

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
with the field crossing the start/finish

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
with the field crossing the start/finish
line<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.690> Jimmie<00:00:42.870> Johnson<00:00:42.960> has<00:00:43.530> gone<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
line and Jimmie Johnson has gone all the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.420 
line and Jimmie Johnson has gone all the
way<00:00:44.190> back<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.870> 26th<00:00:45.870> place<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:47.040> know<00:00:47.129> he<00:00:47.250> had<00:00:47.400> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
way back to 26th place you know he had a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.090 
way back to 26th place you know he had a
nice<00:00:47.760> run<00:00:48.030> off<00:00:48.269> turn<00:00:48.540> four<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
nice run off turn four and I think that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.340 
nice run off turn four and I think that
he<00:00:50.190> thought<00:00:50.460> maybe<00:00:50.699> Carl<00:00:51.090> might<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
he thought maybe Carl might get out of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.990 
he thought maybe Carl might get out of
it<00:00:52.470> as<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.739> got<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.040> in<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.370> three<00:00:53.670> whitey

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it as they got that in here three whitey

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.549 
it as they got that in here three whitey

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
I'm sure Jimmy didn't know Harvick was

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500 
I'm sure Jimmy didn't know Harvick was
going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> inside<00:00:56.340> Carl<00:00:57.269> doing

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
going to the inside Carl doing

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360
