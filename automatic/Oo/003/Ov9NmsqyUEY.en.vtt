00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.090
 In that sense we say of the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.329
 South Korean wedding island shot 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.779

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.440
 I can devour a commercial break 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.400
 I'm going to take a quick break now and 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.950

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.950
 [Music] 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.980
 give me strength and convince 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.800

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.199

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.659

 Book of Austrian politicians to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.160
 Of course that's a bit difficult 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.509
 because I do not know how far the two are 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.539
 So it's like persona sonja 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.090
 heinemann but you do not have to go on 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.410
 what would be interesting to say 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:38.289
 as it does when I'm a striker 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:42.180
 Just call and I say and and 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.620
 then hear what he has understood 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.530
 then only a small one is needed 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.820
 spraying, so to speak, in the ember interviewed 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.580

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.250

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.240

 like franz Beck maker 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.060

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:18.110
 but there is something left 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.900
 realistic and too young 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.070
 i may look like shit and you 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.080

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.539
 when a woman has a good body 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.780
