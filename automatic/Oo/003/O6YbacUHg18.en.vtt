00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
always been very obsessed with sounds

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.420 
always been very obsessed with sounds
especially<00:00:17.970> sound<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.109> drums<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.800> how<00:00:20.010> it

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
especially sound of drums and how it

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.519 
especially sound of drums and how it
translates<00:00:20.939> from<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.480> acoustic<00:00:21.810> instrument

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
translates from the acoustic instrument

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.179 
translates from the acoustic instrument
onto<00:00:23.310> recorded<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.330> live<00:00:24.800> example<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.920> what's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
onto recorded or live example of what's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:35.420 
onto recorded or live example of what's
what's<00:00:27.000> being<00:00:27.210> miked<00:00:27.510> or<00:00:27.869> amplified<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:34.430> guess

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
what's being miked or amplified I guess

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.569 
what's being miked or amplified I guess
the<00:00:35.550> obsession<00:00:36.059> probably<00:00:36.510> started<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.950> my

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the obsession probably started in my my

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.209 
the obsession probably started in my my
mid-teens<00:00:39.149> used<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.020> sit<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.770> basement

and record and mix ourselves and that

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.680 
and record and mix ourselves and that
just<00:00:43.890> kept<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.760> through<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.329> teen<00:00:45.660> years

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
just kept going through my teen years
