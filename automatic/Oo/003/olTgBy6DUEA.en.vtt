chromecast actually works people seem to
think<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.269> YouTube<00:02:44.780> sends<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.320> content<00:02:45.739> to

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
think that YouTube sends the content to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.400 
think that YouTube sends the content to
your<00:02:46.430> phone<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.880> your<00:02:47.360> phone<00:02:47.390> then<00:02:47.959> mirrors

the content to the chromecast however

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.080 
the content to the chromecast however
that<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.620> case<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.370> chromecast<00:02:52.970> has

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
that is not the case the chromecast has

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.870 
that is not the case the chromecast has
its<00:02:53.360> own<00:02:53.570> internet<00:02:54.170> connection<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.430> YouTube

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
its own internet connection so YouTube

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880 
its own internet connection so YouTube
