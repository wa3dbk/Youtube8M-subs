00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 Hi there, this is a bioware video blog and we 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.879
 talking about beer 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 Today we have a review of Lithuanian beer 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.039
 and with snacks that we 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.119
 cooked past snack reviews 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.939
 this review we will finish 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.270
 review and baltic so to speak 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.059
 beer producers and today we have in 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.969
 review as much wind and wolf with immelman is 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.120
 beer regret nobody brought it to us 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.719
 we bought a beer to finish 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.570
 get the picture completely 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 tested Baltic spectrum 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.680
 breweries in this case two beers it 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.870
 one of them is lager other unfiltered 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.430
 beer i want to start unfiltered variety 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 of beer 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.769
 know this case is a bucket floor with his 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 very much compared with the Baltic 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.510
 eight, too, as you learn 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.860
 unfiltered beer has four two 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:18.420
 hulka but a percentage of alcohol and stands in 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 about 80 rubles. Well, let's see 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.049
 what is he like because 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.100
 the bank we can not know how she 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.100
 it smells and what it looks like 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.080
 beer has a very interesting smell 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.200
 sweet as stated in the description this beer 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.330
 produced at the carlsberg plant and then 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:48.580
 there is something very interesting beer has 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:51.560
 sweet taste and smell sense and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:58.610
 slightly gives some apple 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:02.420
 notes in the course of about the same situation 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:07.819
 that is, it is no unfiltered beer is not 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.519
 strong densities and she has some 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.420
 apple flavor 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:17.299
 in principle, very tasty and he 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.890
 very interesting in terms of taste is clearly himself 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.010
 for would compare it not with baltic 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.390
 eight and with some sort of beer 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.850
 Type know there red if and so on but 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.830
 she doesn’t have much less 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.590
 This fruit or berries are not expressed. 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:38.570
 delicious but has how to tell you there 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.810
 sufficiently identified but not strong 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.150
 smack and it seems to me she can 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.730
 like that is, I principle is beer 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.609
 I advise you to try dear 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.010
 subscribers as you see it in alpha 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.959
 sandy le mans is very similar to Latvian 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.560
 beer that we surveyed here it is 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.450
 recognizable foil and size 1 pint 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.600
 brewery founded rafael valv and 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.130
 it turned out that it happened 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.440
 Jewish beer that is, they were and time 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.620
 and then in alpha 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.519
 rafael inherited the whole thing to his 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.380
 son and son began to develop his as 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.850
 brewing company to large 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.930
 sizes and bought the brewery Engelmann 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.040
 and it came out like this — here's a foil 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.650
 on the surface can really 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.440
 some kind of thing 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.180
 or 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.060
 is there any law someone 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.060
 there licked the can and poisoned therefore 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.810
 now do foil caps on top 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.790
 they can not be attached just on top of it 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.530
 lies with the principle of beer has become very 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.750
 recognizable since this beer came from 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.100
 us Peter glasses your na can him 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:01.220
 everywhere find like previous sample 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:06.570
 this schwitters by the way shvi coward means lighthouse 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.850
 let's try what does it look like 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:14.370
 wimp organized beer with a loose 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:17.160
 frothy scary smelly honest but 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.560
 in principle, I remember the smell after all 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.680
 this is brewing 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.380
 say concept avi therefore probably have 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.160
 there they have to say favorite topic 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:33.530
 transfer such a case to dunk your asses 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.530
 yes everywhere let's try 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.730
 bush beer is much better than the smell of beer 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.920
 to taste generally sweet enough 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:52.180
 nice but he has such an aftertaste 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.950
 from the smell is not very nice like this 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.230
 in principle, the beer is quite light and 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.820
 tender 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:05.410
 if you eat it right away 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:11.500
 delicious then these are up to impressions 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:20.860
 smoothed out and becomes quite everything 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:22.780
 cool attacks on you bought for 105 rubles well 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.670
 outwardly all this of course everything is beautiful it 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.760
 foil here is such a large gold 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:33.010
 Bank for 105 rubles, by the way, we get 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:36.280
 pints is 560 to 568 basically beer 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:41.800
 I do n’t know anything up to 105 rubles 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:43.690
 You can buy tastier but at the same time 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.720
 it has an interesting taste that is there 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:50.020
 what to try I will advise him too 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.820
 also at the request is very interesting 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.210
 there is for someone she can write 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.940
 the real most beloved and respected 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.980
 sports drink so when the beer appeared 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.900
 most recently she can with time 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.740
 will spoil as unfortunately it happens 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:10.660
 with many varieties 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:13.750
 for now let's move on to the estimates so 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.550
 estimates we will have such age with rus 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.070
 we will get seven and a half points 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.960
 the beer is very nice and the bottom is interesting 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.790
 especially not like this one here 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.650
 original flavor that gives away 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.890
 somehow an apple can be 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.230
 something again I don’t really feel them 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.170
 and in alpha son Gelman gets from us 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:36.550
 solid 6 bo basically stage with me 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:40.300
 pleased but quite tasty and and 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.760
 I have seem him well, I would still have had a drink 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.510
 especially the best friend I liked there 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.790
 this review, what else can I tell you to drink 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.570
 only good beer was mirvari with you 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.570
