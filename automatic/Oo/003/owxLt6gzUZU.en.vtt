 10 weight gradually do not exaggerate 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.510
 do not lose 10 kilos 8 kilos in a month is 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.670
 An atrocity 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.879
 we have to lose weight a little bit to 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.650
 little so that the skin does not leave us if 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.900
 we recommend that you lose between 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.760
 kilo and a kilo a week and eye with a 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.340
 balanced diet 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.790
 Y 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.790
 ah 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.629
 to avoid the speed they should not 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 missing the proteins is to say fish 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.659
 meat eggs payment proteins are so 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.850
 important because it makes us the 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.490
 muscle has strength that the skin has 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.280
 its urgency those skins we see that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.549
 are soft tombstones really have a 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.110
 very poor protein diet 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.759
 we insist on the proteins that is what 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.950
 that has always been taken for 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.259
 avoid these deficiencies is very important 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.929
 for health and especially in this case 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.300
 we are talking about health and youth 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.130
 for our skin other foods very 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.530
 important are going to be the fruits 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.590
 fresh vegetables nuts and 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.960
 Also olive oil 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 and what do I recommend from your reality? 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.060
 feeding the sugar and the flours 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.420
 refined all this what makes us is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.640
 poison the organism we have to have 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.429
 very much care the sausages the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.439
 fried food processed food 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.689
 scrap and cow's milk and its 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.819
 derivatives the milk sticks little by little 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.799
 in the intestinal lining and form 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.170
 of those flakes that ultimately prevent the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.909
 good absorption of nutrients creating 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.049
 toxic waste that will circulate through the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.200
 bloodstream and therefore 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.239
 deteriorate the skin but the soil 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.670
 talked about losing weight gradually 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.040
 of maintaining a balanced diet and 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.630
 Now to hydrate yourself very well 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.370
 adequate hydration will depend on 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.040
 many things of the climate in which we live 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.959
 of the stature of the lifestyle that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.360
 we carry if we are more active or less 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.910
 well it is recommended that we drink between a 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.440
 liter and a half of water a day that 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.060
 it happens to us that we find many 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.459
 people who do not like to drink water 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.680
 for that we have several tricks we can 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.680
 make water flavored water with cucumber or 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.930
 water with strawberry 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.790
 with orange with lemon and so at least 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.069
 give it another touch 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.530
