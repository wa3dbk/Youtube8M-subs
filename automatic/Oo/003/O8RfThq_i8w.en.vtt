00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello everyone, I'm the maximum and we're here 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.420
 in a new gta 5 online video 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.309
 we are in gta for pc and we will see 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.980
 something that good the prediction the title 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.900
 the miniature that is that it is the snowy day 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.030
 here we are seeing as with only 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.430
 a button just added snowy day in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.410
 gta the jumps in all jumps not in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.470
 the whole city or even the mountain of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.090
 syrian everything is completely snowed and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.150
 It's funny because also within the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.730
 cars and clothes looks snowy you see 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.640
 as if you had gray hair 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.190
 he has it or what he has is that he has the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.750
 hair since it has a lot of dandruff I do not know about 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.480
 him but he also has white and is 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.010
 curious is very very cool because 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.050
 root of this are going to come a lot 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.329
 modes that are going to be lip before as well as 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.340
 for example in the garage editor that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.350
 you can add everything you want in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.390
 the garages up to the bone in the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.800
 the hole that you have of free car 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.870
 you can put the car that you want 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 you can put it with the engine that gives you the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.039
 you can customize it with the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.320
 body the color you can do what 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.820
 you like it there is also a moment in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.059
 the one that you have infinite ammunition and you see 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.710
 very cool because you're with the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.479
 and there's no need to recharge if it's going 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.750
 firing a fat from other filled 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.820
 all of flares is super cool is very 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.930
 interesting that the truth may be the goal 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.610
 to teach one of you if you 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.829
 they like these things and yes well 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.049
 slides so keep adding mods and 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.909
 seeing things that are worth seeing 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.070
 it's not looking at the clothes look at the clothes now 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.590
 same you see or I am completely 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.579
 white in the snowy let's say it gives you a 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.159
 effect of which I am that is falling me 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.140
 the snow on top is explain you here 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.940
 up I wanted to see everything from a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.229
 high perspective 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.270
 we are on the plane that also the plane 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.369
 it has a snowy effect or everything is 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.679
 snowy explain t 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.299
 the thing is that everything everything everything everything 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.429
 it is white it is as if as if 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.770
 we were at Christmas there has been a 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.599
 small use we are missing the trees 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.569
 Christmas and all that is super cool dude 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.890
 then he has a parachute and he is not 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.049
 Thinking about making a small direct 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.549
 the best the weekend I will do a 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.979
 straight from this if this follows 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.539
 working and face did not seem like 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.429
 maybe there's a live show with 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.470
 subscribers of snowed and such maybe 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.580
 you will like it very much and good that more 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.440
 tell you 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.240
 what I said about the modes that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.200
 there may be many more things to 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.690
 root of this is calling me then what 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.960
 what it said is that in gta 4 there is not everything 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.950
 can put airplanes cars 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.900
 absolutely everything you imagine 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.360
 you can do it as of now 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.880
 Well, there may be many more 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.050
 things here yes we do not say no 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.030
 we cut off the supply of not us 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.490
 cut the cable so to speak no no we 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.990
 gives us freedom to be able to do 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.460
 all the ways that we want do not 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.980
 I have done I obviously do not mean 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.110
 I speak for those who do these 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.400
 things that the truth is that they do not stain the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.870
 game does not give you years of the game and now 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.000
 same I have a public session in a 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.709
 private session session management forgiveness 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.120
 private only and I 'm not bothering to 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.420
 no one I'm just trying this mode 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.860
 and I'm not doing anything bad 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.709
 the truth that I like very much 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.170
 this and I do not know why subtract us wants that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.060
 let's add the truth is that this does not harm 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.310
 the game this does not bother this does not 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.170
 nothing what for example the ammunition 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.030
 infinite well maybe not but yes 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.209
 I 'm not using those things I do not know 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.170
 if you use it to teach you what not to 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.970
 modify the game to hurt or 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.250
 none of that and the truth that I would like 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.930
 very much that the modes could be 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.120
 put for gta 4 because you could do 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.330
 a lot of stories a lot of things do not 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 I know we could do that is that you have 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.500
 your imagination because that 's what 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.540
 it can be done in gta or whatever 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.130
 you can imagine it can be done in gta 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.069
 can be modified can be done 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.840
 absolutely what what you want like that 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.180
 how good it was only this I hope that 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.590
 you liked the snowy day we can 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.510

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.980
 win from now on gta for pc 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.440
 forget do not forget that this is only 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.690
 for pc and I guess for those who 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.890
 they want the ps3 but well this has been 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.600
 I hope you liked it and if
