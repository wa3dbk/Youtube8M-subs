 In general, in theory, no bonuses do not give 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.530
 in my opinion only if in the game and I have 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.870
 so here and I have already rummaged a little bit 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
 and even played one game in order to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.790
