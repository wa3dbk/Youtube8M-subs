00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.670
 hi girls, guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.999
 well i am rocking and welcome one day 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.740
 over the canal today I bring not 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:13.289
 I would look for a home remedy 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.650
 say it so generalizing to eliminate 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:19.050
 the hair permanently 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 I would say that only facial supposes that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.949
 also applies to body hair at 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.990
 better for women that we have the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.669
 hair around here finer or we do not have 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.430
 a lot in our arms could work 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.070
 I do not think it's worth for men 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.870
 with a very hard hair because maybe in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 the English or the legs not even 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.339
 I think it can work for us 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.830
 for us in English and legs like that 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.150
 that I have reduced it to facial area and 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.610
 we know that here we have maybe more 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.350
 nice if you are more white or more 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.900
 brunettes than me because I have hair 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.820
 chestnut I do not have it black because some 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.150
 girl you notice the evil to me is not that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.860
 I do not see myself much but I do not like it 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.900
 then I bring you this remedy 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.909
 grow or you will see right away how it 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.750
 it's very simple so let's see 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.750
 the step by step 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.340
 you're just going to need a spoonful of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.970
 turmeric as you are seeing here and a half 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.100
 teaspoon of water 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.950
 the only thing we have to do very 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.110
 simple is to pour the water into the turmeric 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.060
 and mix it with your finger like 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.790
 you see there I have thrown all the water to go 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.110
 mixing and see the consistency at the end 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.200
 I had to throw everything has to be 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.050
 a paste as you see in the clip or very 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.240
 thick neither too watery now what 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.820
 I'm watching and you have to take it for 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.680
 the area a layer that covers perfectly 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.720
 where you have the benito you think 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.490
 that's go and that's not to 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.160
 do nothing else we are going to let him act 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.110
 15-20 minutes until you see that it is 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.420
 It's dry, I 've only done it for 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.690
 the area of ​​say the sideburns of the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.690
 jaw 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.580
 good and as you can see has been super simple 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.259
 two ingredients turmeric and water os 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.600
 I recommend that you try it, I also 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.759
 I'm trying with milk and I love you 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.190
 do teach to do with water because the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.750
 more simply do not know if milk 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.700
 vegetable function not tested or with 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.819
 Soya milk or rice milk 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.200
 tried with cow's milk then this 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.170
 It's very simple as you have seen 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.940
 you leave on the face 15 minutes 20 minutes 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.860
 until it dries and then what 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.170
 we drag in circular shapes and 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.350
 rinse I recommend doing it by the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.420
 This is already a criterion because 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.489
 tomorrow or if then you are going to leave mojo 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.750
 I know you spot is a little bit 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.640
 it is a little yellow but not 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.530
 you scare your hands they are also going to 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.480
 stay a little yellow but after 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.819
 you see her with soap and with a disc 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.850
 makeup you can rub either your 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.040
 facial tonic or your cleansing milk 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.080
 for example and it goes perfectly I 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.670
 I say at night because I do it 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.940
 at night 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.260
 in the shower or I put it on and when 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.230
 I want to take it off, he told me to shower and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.730
 So with the soap and everything is going 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.319
 perfectly for example the other day I 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.770
 I am here a speck ies diego disc 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.239
 of makeup facial tonic and disc 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.100
 it stays yellow and your skin is already 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.700
 perfectly then hydrated as 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.160
 always and it's 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.989
 this remedy is supposed to eliminate the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.819
 hair permanently I still like 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.950
 I have to try even more days 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.780
 I'll tell you but people say 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.060
 that works and that goes very well apart 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.069
 it is for nothing it does not itch is nothing 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.910
 harmful to the skin unless 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.970
 have 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.890
 obviously allergy either the milk of 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.980
 cow replace it with water or 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.230
 turmeric that in any case then not what 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.640

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.590
 arms and above all I tell you what 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.610
