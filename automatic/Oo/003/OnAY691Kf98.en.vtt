00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.839

 Kopp with "I'll see if it's fruitful 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.610
 At least that smells of crispy bread after fresh coffee 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.540
 With such a man the store threatens that we are now just right for me 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.520
 but difficult to imagine yet 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 the report was on her freshly laundered clothes 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.210
 Under no circumstances was the building services manager 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.060

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 so that everything is always safe

 if a resident needs help with setting up his room he is 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.440
 always there for him 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.720
 he takes care of all the repairs ministers hang on pictures 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.169
 leave 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.859
 All formalities and dealing with authorities, they are helpful 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.559
 and the nice family doctors can work together with the nursing staff 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.599

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.349
 Today is delicious 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.009
 The real thing is explained in the cities 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.149
 The fresh ingredients are certainly not 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.179
 It smells like that 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.389
 too bad we can not join 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.859
 I'll keep the start 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.369
 He is coming to every room of his shopping right now 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:05.190
 the market can 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.190
 Munich so much 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 and now show me what Carlos Tevez 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.499
 after so much liquid ran some mistakes, of course I am pleased too 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.499
 not too short 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.039
 as if they were right 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.269
 and how do you like the small pond with the stream 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.339
 and what if the holidays are out 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.339
 the strong times more accurate 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.629
 but we have 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.629
 Rusal round 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.419
 Now I have time for you too 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:36.550
 then 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.550
 that feels good 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.509
 but I had to see the damage to the right 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.729
 Well everything seems to be alright 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.900
 Mr Schmidt and his volunteer keepers if you are not too 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.309
 believe the over 100 animals 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.309
 but where is it not over? 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 I thought so again already on big role 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.809
 Angie is the cat of mourning Erhard 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:08.979
 I think it's a mystery to me 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.979
 I need a short break now 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.879
 what's up? 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.289
 Schalke take a closer look 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.409
 but that is very popular only on the asia internet 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.770
 I am now closing the day bitter pill 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.919
 that manages to pay his bills 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:29.920
 home 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.420
