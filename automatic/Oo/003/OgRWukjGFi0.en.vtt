00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
little bit of sign language and I'd

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.800 
little bit of sign language and I'd
learnt<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.240> are<00:00:30.330> different<00:00:30.630> signs

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240 
learnt that there are different signs
for<00:00:31.050> different<00:00:31.289> countries<00:00:31.590> some<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.160> those
