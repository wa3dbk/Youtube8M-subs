what's up YouTube my name is Kenneth
today<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.700> show<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:03.000> few<00:00:03.120> souls

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
today I'm going to show you a few souls

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.900 
today I'm going to show you a few souls
I<00:00:03.629> did<00:00:03.810> on<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.319> gear<00:00:04.560> ball<00:00:04.799> before<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.670> show<00:00:05.850> you

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
I did on the gear ball before I show you

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.070 
I did on the gear ball before I show you
that<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.120> wanted<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> show<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.690> few<00:00:06.870> other

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
that I wanted to show you a few other

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.320 
that I wanted to show you a few other
things<00:00:07.140> first<00:00:08.010> off<00:00:08.280> people<00:00:08.610> asked<00:00:09.120> if<00:00:09.210> you

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
things first off people asked if you

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.910 
things first off people asked if you
could<00:00:09.480> change<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.080> color<00:00:10.260> scheme<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
could change the color scheme on the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.709 
could change the color scheme on the
gear<00:00:11.070> ball<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.759> answer<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.090> yes<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.540> can

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
gear ball and the answer is yes you can

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
gear ball and the answer is yes you can
get<00:00:12.840> these<00:00:13.019> tiles<00:00:13.500> off<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.400> are<00:00:14.490> plugged<00:00:14.790> in

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
get these tiles off that are plugged in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.029 
get these tiles off that are plugged in
it's<00:00:15.599> kind<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.870> hard<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.199> get<00:00:16.320> underneath<00:00:16.680> them

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
it's kind of hard to get underneath them

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.320 
it's kind of hard to get underneath them
but<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.609> can<00:00:17.699> get<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:17.910> fingernails

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
but you can get your fingernails

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.240 
but you can get your fingernails
underneath<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> tiles<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:20.010> pull

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
underneath the tiles and you can pull

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.970 
underneath the tiles and you can pull
unplug<00:00:20.760> these<00:00:21.000> tiles<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.529> other<00:00:22.680> thing<00:00:22.890> I

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
unplug these tiles and the other thing I

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.380 
unplug these tiles and the other thing I
wanted<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> mention<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.760> found<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> cool<00:00:24.240> way

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
wanted to mention is I found a cool way

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.029 
wanted to mention is I found a cool way
you<00:00:24.449> can<00:00:24.750> turn<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.320> puzzle<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> way<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you can turn the puzzle and the way to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.640 
you can turn the puzzle and the way to
do<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.789> hold<00:00:27.060> two<00:00:27.240> opposite<00:00:27.900> centers

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
do that is you hold two opposite centers

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.410 
do that is you hold two opposite centers
and<00:00:28.920> then<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.279> turn<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.730> side<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.240> turn

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and then you can turn one side and turn

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.900 
and then you can turn one side and turn
the<00:00:30.660> other<00:00:30.779> side<00:00:31.489> anyway<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> think<00:00:32.669> that's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the other side anyway I think that's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.270 
the other side anyway I think that's
cool<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> cool<00:00:33.420> way<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.469> turn<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> puzzle

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
cool a cool way to just turn the puzzle

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.000 
cool a cool way to just turn the puzzle
instead<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.140> so

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
instead of just going like this so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.810 
instead of just going like this so
that's<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:40.050> let's<00:00:40.320> show<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.829> some<00:00:41.219> solves

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
that's it now let's show you some solves

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.340 
that's it now let's show you some solves
so<00:00:44.820> first<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> show<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.539> 9<00:00:45.840> solves

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so first I'm going to show you 9 solves

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
so first I'm going to show you 9 solves
all<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.800> once<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
all at once and then I'm going to

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
all at once and then I'm going to
highlight<00:00:48.300> two<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.719> them<00:00:49.250> before<00:00:50.250> solving<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
highlight two of them before solving the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.979 
highlight two of them before solving the
gear<00:00:51.059> ball<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> want<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> talk<00:00:51.809> about

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
gear ball I want to talk about

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.590 
gear ball I want to talk about
scrambling<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.149> scrambling<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> gear<00:00:54.420> ball

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
scrambling it scrambling the gear ball

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.500 
scrambling it scrambling the gear ball
is<00:00:54.809> easy<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> find<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
is easy but what you find out is that it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.819 
is easy but what you find out is that it
doesn't<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.140> messed<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
doesn't get all that messed up and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.250 
doesn't get all that messed up and
that's<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.640> gears<00:01:00.140> damage<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's because the gears damage the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
that's because the gears damage the
tubes<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.100> can't<00:01:02.489> scramble<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.120> as

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
tubes so that you can't scramble it as

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
tubes so that you can't scramble it as
much<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.690> could<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> 3x3<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
much as you could a 3x3 and because of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.190 
much as you could a 3x3 and because of
this<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> corners<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.390> always<00:01:06.570> within<00:01:06.750> 5

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
this the corners are always within 5

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740 
this the corners are always within 5
moves<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.830> being<00:01:08.040> solved<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> found<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
moves of being solved so I found that it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.660 
moves of being solved so I found that it
closed<00:01:09.990> my<00:01:10.260> eyes<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.890> scrambling<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
closed my eyes well scrambling it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.730 
closed my eyes well scrambling it
because<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.540> would<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> corners<00:01:13.590> were

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
because I would see the corners were

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.320 
because I would see the corners were
getting<00:01:13.979> close<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> being<00:01:14.520> solved<00:01:15.090> just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
getting close to being solved just

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
getting close to being solved just
randomly<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.409> would<00:01:16.650> purposely<00:01:17.189> make<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
randomly and I would purposely make it a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.810 
randomly and I would purposely make it a
little<00:01:17.850> harder<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> better<00:01:20.070> random

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
little harder and to get a better random

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.399 
little harder and to get a better random
solve<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.330> had<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> close<00:01:21.659> my<00:01:21.720> eyes<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.290> way

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
solve I had to close my eyes that way

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
solve I had to close my eyes that way
and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:22.830> once<00:01:22.979> all<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> ones

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and then once all I would get the ones

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
and then once all I would get the ones
where<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> corner<00:01:24.930> probably<00:01:25.259> wanted<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.560> move

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
where the corner probably wanted to move

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.780 
where the corner probably wanted to move
in<00:01:26.280> itself<00:01:28.100> now<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> stop<00:01:29.549> talking

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
in itself now I'm going to stop talking

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.580 
in itself now I'm going to stop talking
while<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> script<00:01:30.659> while<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> solved<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
while I script while I solved the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
while I script while I solved the
puzzles<00:01:32.009> because<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:33.119> happened<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.479> fast

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
puzzles because it happened so fast

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.260 
puzzles because it happened so fast
there's<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.430> want<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.180> guys

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
there's so much to see I want you guys

00:01:36.270 --> 00:02:04.860 
there's so much to see I want you guys
to<00:01:36.329> take<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.020> ready<00:01:37.259> set<00:01:37.560> go

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.450 

so<00:02:05.870> here's<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.230> first<00:02:06.440> of<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.800> two<00:02:06.980> I<00:02:07.010> wanted

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
so here's the first of the two I wanted

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.130 
so here's the first of the two I wanted
to<00:02:07.550> highlight<00:02:07.760> this<00:02:08.150> one<00:02:08.210> was<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.720> fastest

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
to highlight this one was the fastest

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.410 
to highlight this one was the fastest
one<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.530> wasn't<00:02:09.800> lucky<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.490> what<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.030> mean<00:02:11.270> by

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
one that wasn't lucky and what I mean by

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.840 
one that wasn't lucky and what I mean by
that<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.190> didn't<00:02:13.490> skip<00:02:13.700> any

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
that is on this one I didn't skip any

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.150 
that is on this one I didn't skip any
steps<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.810> here<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:15.140> go<00:02:15.260> first<00:02:15.560> I'm<00:02:15.860> going<00:02:16.070> to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
steps so here we go first I'm going to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.360 
steps so here we go first I'm going to
solve<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.820> corners<00:02:17.060> around<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.690> center's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
solve the corners around the center's

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.650 
solve the corners around the center's
now<00:02:19.370> I'm<00:02:19.550> going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.760> put<00:02:19.940> all<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.240> edges<00:02:20.540> in

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
now I'm going to put all the edges in

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.050 
now I'm going to put all the edges in
the<00:02:20.750> right<00:02:21.020> place<00:02:24.340> now<00:02:25.340> I'm<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> orient

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
the right place now I'm going to orient

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.210 
the right place now I'm going to orient
the<00:02:26.240> edges<00:02:29.140> last<00:02:30.140> thing<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.560> spin<00:02:31.040> those

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
the edges last thing is to spin those

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.760 
the edges last thing is to spin those
gears<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.900> cube<00:02:33.170> will<00:02:33.320> be<00:02:33.350> solved<00:02:35.770> so

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
gears and the cube will be solved so

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.740 
gears and the cube will be solved so
that<00:02:36.920> was<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.400> fastest<00:02:37.910> non<00:02:38.090> lucky<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.570> now

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
that was the fastest non lucky one now

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.030 
that was the fastest non lucky one now
I'm<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:39.080> going<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.230> show<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.470> guys<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
I'm just going to show you guys the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.430 
I'm just going to show you guys the
fastest<00:02:40.520> one<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.930> one<00:02:42.140> was<00:02:42.260> pretty

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
fastest one and this one was pretty

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.580 
fastest one and this one was pretty
quick<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.150> yeah<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.510> here<00:02:44.720> we<00:02:44.780> go<00:02:44.930> first<00:02:45.260> thing

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
quick and yeah so here we go first thing

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.370 
quick and yeah so here we go first thing
is<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:46.100> solve<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> corners<00:02:47.260> around<00:02:48.260> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
is you solve the corners around the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.560 
is you solve the corners around the
center's<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:49.400> edges<00:02:49.910> are<00:02:50.030> already<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
center's the edges are already in the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.960 
center's the edges are already in the
right<00:02:50.690> place<00:02:50.960> so<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.290> go<00:02:51.440> right<00:02:51.710> into

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
right place so you go right into

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.030 
right place so you go right into
orienting<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.090> edges<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.600> now<00:02:54.320> I'm<00:02:54.710> going<00:02:54.920> to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
orienting the edges and now I'm going to

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.400 
orienting the edges and now I'm going to
spin<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> gears<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:56.660> solve<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.020> cube<00:02:59.380> so<00:03:00.380> I

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
spin the gears to solve the cube so I

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.840 
spin the gears to solve the cube so I
hope<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.740> guys<00:03:00.890> enjoyed<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.460> video<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.760> do
