you end up with a totally different
stitch<00:02:15.190> for<00:02:15.790> some<00:02:16.030> strange<00:02:16.300> reason<00:02:17.130> when

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
stitch for some strange reason when

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.620 
stitch for some strange reason when
you're<00:02:18.250> doing<00:02:18.430> circular<00:02:18.640> knitting<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.480> end

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
you're doing circular knitting you end

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.710 
you're doing circular knitting you end
up<00:02:19.750> with<00:02:20.070> stockinette<00:02:21.070> or<00:02:21.310> whatever<00:02:21.820> looks

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
up with stockinette or whatever looks

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.470 
up with stockinette or whatever looks
like<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.410> on<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.590> other<00:02:23.710> side<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.100> looks

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
like this and on the other side it looks

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.260 
like this and on the other side it looks
more<00:02:25.480> normal<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.520> but<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.940> thing<00:02:28.150> is

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
more normal like this but the thing is

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.510 
more normal like this but the thing is
it<00:02:28.570> kind<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.780> curls<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.320> itself<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.010> I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
it kind of curls it on itself and I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.720 
it kind of curls it on itself and I
didn't<00:02:30.790> know<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.740> I'm<00:02:32.740> trying<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.520> press

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
didn't know that so I'm trying to press

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.260 
didn't know that so I'm trying to press
it<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.030> stuff<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:35.370> with<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.520> one<00:02:36.760> I'm<00:02:37.000> doing

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
it and stuff but with this one I'm doing

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.040 
it and stuff but with this one I'm doing
alternating<00:02:37.690> knit<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.650> purl<00:02:38.680> stitches<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:40.390> it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
alternating knit and purl stitches so it

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.960 
alternating knit and purl stitches so it
should<00:02:41.380> give<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.680> ribbing<00:02:42.220> or<00:02:42.460> some<00:02:42.730> sort<00:02:42.910> of

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
should give it ribbing or some sort of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.300 
should give it ribbing or some sort of
texture<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:44.110> already<00:02:44.260> feels<00:02:44.620> thicker<00:02:44.920> so

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
texture and it already feels thicker so

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.800 
texture and it already feels thicker so
I'm<00:02:45.850> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> try<00:02:46.210> that<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.540> see<00:02:46.630> if<00:02:46.720> that

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
I'm going to try that and see if that

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.200 
I'm going to try that and see if that
works<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.950> obviously<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.730> not<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:48.940> perfect

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
works this obviously it's not a perfect

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.390 
works this obviously it's not a perfect
hat<00:02:49.630> I'm<00:02:50.230> thinking<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:50.890> giving<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.340> someone

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
hat I'm thinking of giving it to someone

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.870 
hat I'm thinking of giving it to someone
with<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> smaller<00:02:52.120> head<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:52.990> in<00:02:53.110> case<00:02:53.880> also

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
with a smaller head just in case also

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.260 
with a smaller head just in case also
the<00:02:55.060> top<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.720> kind<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.320> like<00:02:56.489> ridged<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.850> I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
the top is kind of like ridged and I

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.940 
the top is kind of like ridged and I
think<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.930> pulled<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.290> all<00:02:59.410> too<00:02:59.709> tight<00:02:59.920> or

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
think I pulled it all too tight or

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.630 
think I pulled it all too tight or
something<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:02.739> anyway<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.100> don't<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.550> it's

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
something but anyway I don't think it's

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.420 
something but anyway I don't think it's
bad<00:03:03.760> for<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.030> first<00:03:04.180> try<00:03:04.800> so<00:03:05.800> yeah<00:03:05.980> if<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.280> want

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
bad for a first try so yeah if you want

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.920 
bad for a first try so yeah if you want
to<00:03:06.489> start<00:03:06.700> knitting<00:03:06.910> hats<00:03:07.180> it's<00:03:07.570> probably<00:03:07.870> a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
to start knitting hats it's probably a

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.010 
to start knitting hats it's probably a
good<00:03:07.959> idea<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.380> do<00:03:08.770> some<00:03:09.540> regular<00:03:10.540> straight

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
good idea to do some regular straight

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.830 
good idea to do some regular straight
knitting<00:03:11.200> like<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.770> scarf<00:03:12.250> first<00:03:13.120> just<00:03:13.720> a

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
knitting like that scarf first just a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.140 
knitting like that scarf first just a
practice<00:03:14.320> getting<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.680> stitches<00:03:15.040> down<00:03:15.220> so

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
practice getting the stitches down so

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.870 
practice getting the stitches down so
basically<00:03:16.600> what<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:16.989> need<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.320> start<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:18.340> mean

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
basically what you need to start I mean

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.900 
basically what you need to start I mean
if<00:03:19.030> you're<00:03:19.209> going<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.420> do<00:03:19.600> your<00:03:20.519> scarf<00:03:21.519> just

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
if you're going to do your scarf just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.940 
if you're going to do your scarf just
starting<00:03:22.300> out<00:03:22.420> or<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:23.380> need<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> set<00:03:23.830> of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
starting out or you need a set of

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.449 
starting out or you need a set of
needles<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.630> started<00:03:25.630> with<00:03:25.780> fives<00:03:26.230> which<00:03:27.100> are

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
needles I started with fives which are

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.830 
needles I started with fives which are
really<00:03:27.970> small<00:03:29.160> kind<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.580> so<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:31.420> small<00:03:31.720> of

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
really small kind of and so the small of

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.500 
really small kind of and so the small of
the<00:03:31.930> needle<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.410> tighter<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.150> fabric<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.330> I

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
the needle the tighter the fabric is I

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.270 
the needle the tighter the fabric is I
mean<00:03:34.780> like<00:03:34.930> smaller<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.620> stitches<00:03:36.010> are<00:03:36.040> going

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
mean like smaller the stitches are going

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.009 
mean like smaller the stitches are going
to<00:03:36.340> be<00:03:36.459> did<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.269> see<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.540> these<00:03:37.750> stitches

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
to be did you see that these stitches

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.600 
to be did you see that these stitches
are<00:03:38.440> in<00:03:39.100> five<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.800> these<00:03:41.800> stitches<00:03:42.130> are<00:03:42.489> made

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
are in five and these stitches are made

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.330 
are in five and these stitches are made
from<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.940> seven<00:03:43.739> it's<00:03:44.739> not<00:03:44.830> really<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.190> much

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
from a seven it's not really that much

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.460 
from a seven it's not really that much
of<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.550> difference<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.870> can<00:03:47.019> see<00:03:47.230> because

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
of a difference that you can see because

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.040 
of a difference that you can see because
they're<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:47.890> close<00:03:48.630> but<00:03:49.630> like

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
they're so close but like

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.840 
they're so close but like
this<00:03:50.230> stuff<00:03:50.500> are<00:03:50.710> huge<00:03:51.220> in<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.490> road<00:03:51.580> and

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
this stuff are huge in the road and

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.180 
this stuff are huge in the road and
you're<00:03:52.660> gonna<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:53.080> going<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.290> go<00:03:53.410> faster<00:03:53.920> but

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
you're gonna it's going to go faster but

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.120 
you're gonna it's going to go faster but
it's<00:03:54.670> gonna<00:03:55.270> have<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.690> bigger<00:03:56.320> gaps<00:03:56.650> and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
it's gonna have like bigger gaps and

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.450 
it's gonna have like bigger gaps and
stuff<00:03:57.340> like<00:03:57.460> that<00:03:57.550> um<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.010> think<00:04:00.100> that<00:04:00.310> a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
stuff like that um so I think that a

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.730 
stuff like that um so I think that a
good<00:04:00.670> size<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.180> sort<00:04:01.420> out<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:01.780> seven<00:04:02.290> maybe<00:04:02.620> a

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
good size to sort out is seven maybe a

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.470 
good size to sort out is seven maybe a
little<00:04:02.920> bigger<00:04:03.130> I<00:04:03.580> use<00:04:04.570> my<00:04:04.780> boo<00:04:05.020> which<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:06.760> I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
little bigger I use my boo which is I

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.820 
little bigger I use my boo which is I
think<00:04:10.480> it's<00:04:10.810> supposed<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.320> be<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.470> little<00:04:11.680> more

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
think it's supposed to be a little more

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.620 
think it's supposed to be a little more
expensive<00:04:12.430> than<00:04:13.020> metal<00:04:14.550> but<00:04:15.550> I'm<00:04:15.910> used<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.450> it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
expensive than metal but I'm used to it

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.120 
expensive than metal but I'm used to it
because<00:04:16.780> my<00:04:17.080> first<00:04:17.230> one<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.470> for<00:04:17.590> bambor<00:04:17.890> so<00:04:18.100> I

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
because my first one is for bambor so I

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.400 
because my first one is for bambor so I
just<00:04:18.400> like<00:04:18.580> keep<00:04:18.760> using<00:04:19.030> them<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:20.290> I<00:04:20.350> think

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
just like keep using them and I think

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.350 
just like keep using them and I think
eventually<00:04:20.590> they<00:04:21.010> splinters<00:04:21.519> like<00:04:22.000> but<00:04:22.210> that

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
eventually they splinters like but that

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.270 
eventually they splinters like but that
hasn't<00:04:22.510> happened<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:22.930> bind<00:04:23.110> yet<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:24.040> you'll

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
hasn't happened to bind yet and you'll

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.450 
hasn't happened to bind yet and you'll
also<00:04:24.430> need<00:04:24.730> a<00:04:24.790> whole<00:04:25.150> jar<00:04:25.590> or<00:04:26.590> something<00:04:26.830> if

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
also need a whole jar or something if

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.220 
also need a whole jar or something if
you're<00:04:27.610> first<00:04:27.850> starting<00:04:27.940> out<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:28.690> might<00:04:29.080> be

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
you're first starting out it might be

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.560 
you're first starting out it might be
easier<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:29.950> use<00:04:30.360> something<00:04:31.360> that's<00:04:31.390> very

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
easier to use something that's very

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.860 
easier to use something that's very
gated<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.490> can<00:04:33.790> so<00:04:34.390> that<00:04:34.420> like<00:04:34.720> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
gated so that you can so that like the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.180 
gated so that you can so that like the
strings<00:04:35.170> or<00:04:35.320> different<00:04:35.560> color<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:35.980> you<00:04:36.040> don't

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
strings or different color so you don't

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.540 
strings or different color so you don't
get<00:04:36.310> them<00:04:36.490> confused<00:04:37.410> but<00:04:38.410> eventually<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.400> can

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
get them confused but eventually you can

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.310 
get them confused but eventually you can
I<00:04:39.730> mean<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.150> also<00:04:40.420> that<00:04:40.570> makes<00:04:40.780> like<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:40.990> cool

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
I mean and also that makes like a cool

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.050 
I mean and also that makes like a cool
like<00:04:41.560> striped<00:04:41.860> pattern<00:04:42.250> without<00:04:42.430> even<00:04:42.790> trying

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
like striped pattern without even trying

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.390 
like striped pattern without even trying
and<00:04:43.780> then<00:04:44.230> once<00:04:44.410> you've<00:04:44.590> made<00:04:44.740> your<00:04:44.800> practice

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
and then once you've made your practice

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.310 
and then once you've made your practice
scarf<00:04:45.700> you<00:04:45.850> can<00:04:45.910> move<00:04:46.180> on<00:04:46.390> to<00:04:46.660> circular

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
scarf you can move on to circular

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.790 
scarf you can move on to circular
knitting<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.890> um<00:04:50.070> making<00:04:51.070> hats<00:04:52.290> which<00:04:53.290> I

knitting and um making hats which I
don't<00:04:54.340> know<00:04:54.430> that's<00:04:54.669> a<00:04:54.790> big<00:04:54.880> thing<00:04:54.910> for<00:04:55.090> me<00:04:55.360> but

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
don't know that's a big thing for me but

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.980 
don't know that's a big thing for me but
yeah<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.500> can<00:04:56.680> make<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.890> lot<00:04:57.070> of<00:04:57.130> stuff<00:04:57.460> and

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
yeah you can make a lot of stuff and

a<00:05:05.320> package<00:05:05.740> for<00:05:06.010> like<00:05:08.190> nothing<00:05:09.190> more<00:05:09.340> than

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
a package for like nothing more than

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.250 
a package for like nothing more than
five<00:05:09.760> dollars<00:05:10.980> that's<00:05:11.980> just<00:05:12.580> insanity<00:05:13.260> so

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
five dollars that's just insanity so

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.020 
five dollars that's just insanity so
yeah<00:05:14.380> it's<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.680> fairly<00:05:14.950> cheap<00:05:15.250> hobby<00:05:15.760> and

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030
