00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.430 
may have an issue with it food gets
stuck<00:01:05.500> between<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:08.610> rubber<00:01:09.610> seal<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.440> where

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
stuck between the rubber seal and where

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.550 
stuck between the rubber seal and where
the<00:01:11.650> actual<00:01:12.160> threat<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.790> it's<00:01:13.690> really<00:01:14.020> hard<00:01:14.410> to

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
the actual threat is it's really hard to

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.270 
the actual threat is it's really hard to
clean<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:16.110> wish<00:01:17.110> there<00:01:17.290> was<00:01:17.380> another<00:01:17.410> way<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.040> do

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
clean I wish there was another way to do

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.450 
clean I wish there was another way to do
it<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.630> guess<00:01:20.080> they<00:01:20.770> were<00:01:20.830> thinking<00:01:21.370> about

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
it but I guess they were thinking about

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.160 
it but I guess they were thinking about
it<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:21.940> there<00:01:22.120> isn't<00:01:22.450> because<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.840> seal

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
it and there isn't because the seal

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.520 
it and there isn't because the seal
touches<00:01:24.070> this<00:01:24.250> part<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.910> it<00:01:25.180> really<00:01:25.390> makes<00:01:26.350> a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
touches this part and it really makes a

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.560 
touches this part and it really makes a
nice<00:01:26.680> tight<00:01:28.890> thermal<00:01:29.890> seal<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:33.300> you<00:01:34.300> know<00:01:34.420> it's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
nice tight thermal seal so you know it's

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.980 
nice tight thermal seal so you know it's
a<00:01:34.720> it's<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:35.020> give-and-take<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.990> situation

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
a it's a give-and-take kind of situation

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.110 
a it's a give-and-take kind of situation
