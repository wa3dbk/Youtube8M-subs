00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 I die I confess that this was not the 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.680
 video that I had planned for this 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.410
 week 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.019
 reasons beyond my control 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.179
 I had to postpone the video that 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.179
 I wanted to go up for the next few weeks 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.200
 i 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.810
 ace 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.810
 the people 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.260
 I already need a 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.580
 new computer but it is already so 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.380
 let's make a last minute style video 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:44.790
 tim now 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:47.610
 and that the clear subject is whether blessed 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.230
 be technological though not so blessed 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.240
 be the means by which 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 we currently have to get to the 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.860
 technology yes because for example 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.180
 let's imagine that we walk in a stopper where 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.090
 the front vehicle is 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.560
 completely stopped then you decide 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.420
 enter to facebook or twitter to 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.420
 publish how stinky the plug is 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.430
 because more than getting off the express just 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.760
 when I'm reaching the virgin in 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.560
 toa low and there's no dinner there but also 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.590
 when I'm on the highway coming out of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.640
 guaynabo I do not have a little signal 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.710
 and once not once and when I take for 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.320
 go to the north of it go then 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.670
 in all the number two there is no 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.360
 culture to me is for love of god not all 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.940
 they live in cash or in a king 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.950
 but one thing is the coverage and another 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.200
 thing is when you call the number of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.480
 service and they answer you some models of 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.490
 jupiter that in their life they have used a 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.410
 electronic device and to top it off 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.160
 they talk as if they were reading what 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.380
 a book literally with 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.500
 welcome to please dial your number 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.500
 phone 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.800
 I connect 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.170
 hello my name is ramÃ³n milestone in that you 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.209
 I can help 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.520
 and if I wanted to know why I have 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.940
 and two days without Internet service 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.940
 my phone 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.200
 my name 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.090
 the last four digits 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.880
 what happens that what I want to know 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.040
 for what reason 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.590
 and paying for an internet service 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:04.299
 which now currently I do not have it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:04.299
 but it is not easy 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.400
 the phone number is precisely the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.260
 same that I marked next to when it came out 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.330
 speaking the recorder at the beginning of this 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.000
 same call to the archers you have your 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:25.670
 ear of a gentleman at the moment we do not have 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.290
 No breakdown to dine in area where the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.130
 that you find yourself for what you 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:35.570
 We recommend that you understand it again in 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.670
 five minutes because they make me 25,000 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.740
 questions to the end tell me that 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.490
 turn off and turn on my cell phone for five 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.380
 minutes and in that way miraculously 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.940
 everything is going to be resolved and the 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.250
 sign seriously what technologies indicates 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.960
 I really love technology without the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.670
 technology that had the opportunity to 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.200
 get to where everyone from direct are 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.690
 responsible for having changed the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.210
 life a practical way why I 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.460
 I love technology but what do they tell me? 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.190
 when social networks gives them with 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.440
 script and already that again I'm in the 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.420
 same field that you know a little bit more 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.470
 front where there are signs but the 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.390
 perfect moment 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.209

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.130
