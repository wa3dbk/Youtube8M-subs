00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.560
 volitional force 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.299
 in previous lessons I explained to you 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.400
 ways by which one person 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.330
 may attract others in personal 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.789
 job interview 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.360
 through the power of suggestion and so on 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.340
 so to the person who is trying 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.609
 impress the other 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.039
 help the other two forces the first of these 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.499
 helping forces is what is known by 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.330
 in the name of the attractive property of thoughts about 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.829
 which I will speak in the following 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.440
 lessons 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:36.710
 2 is the volitional impact of the mind of one 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.809
 faces on the other's mind these two different 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.149
 manifestations of fortitude are very different 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.370
 one from the other in the first case 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.590
 attractive properties of thoughts once 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.690
 being set in motion acts 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.170
 on others besides conscious effort 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.390
 your mind your resolute thought about 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.719
 something set in motion mighty 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.070
 force that affects others 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.710
 case of volitional impact 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.989
 mental vibrations are sent and 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.379
 prompted by a conscious force 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.330
 will 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.370
 sending and sent to 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.360
 to any particular object 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.940
 when does the motive force cease 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.190
 the oscillations stop and i can't 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.680
 pick a suitable common expression 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.110
 which could be suitable for this 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.080
 forms of power of thought and since I do not find 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.210
 convenient to talk about her as 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.790
 conscious effort of will producing 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.680
 mental vibrations directing them 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.250
 on a certain subject I by 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.740
 the need to wait and the meaning of the word 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.170
 expressing this concept accordingly 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.590
 from now on I will use the term 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.220
 want for expression just now 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.500
 certain concepts 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.050
 this word should not be confused with the word 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.380
 desires meaning free expression 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.660
 will of choice I will also use 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.160
 in these cases, the phrase volitional 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.540
 power originating from the same root 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.910
 volitional strength is one of the most 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.070
 powerful forces of nature and at the same 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.320
 time she belongs to the least 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.540
 studied it is used 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.640
 unconsciously more or less by all 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.470
 some people are familiar with her 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.980
 results without understanding the laws and and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.080
 development and its occurrence can be strongly 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.570
 increase by reasonable development 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.690
 exercises devoting them enough 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.880
 time, I will show you the exercise 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.230
 for the development of this force itself in 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.790
 a lesson on focusing to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.280
 be able to reasonably use 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.200
 volitional force 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.530
 it is necessary to understand the true nature of the will 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.760
 that is, you must exercise by yourself 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.800
 true man many of us have 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.850
 habit of thinking of my own I rather 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.650
 how about the physical body this 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.450
 materialistic point of view others 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.390
 I think of my own as a kind 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.910
 spiritual creation by the governing body and 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.480
 being in the brain is kind of 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.310
 correct but not quite true 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.010
 some create a higher existence 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.470
 I'm in a man and only a few know 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.410
 this is the highest I lived according to his 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.980
 i am so true in command 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.160
 perfect and reason as far as reason 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.459
 perfect body and they are both body and mind 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.070
 subordinate to him both his instrument and serves 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.239
 to fulfill its purpose if 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.880
 he will wish to use them true 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.820
 i have what we feel when minutes and 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.800
 of dreams or deepening itself we think 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.370
 or say i have 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.280
 all of us were conscious in ourselves that was true 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.790
 in some moments of your life, well, not 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.120
 know all its value set aside in 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.950
 side of this book for a few seconds and 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.350
 loosening the muscles of your case and reaching 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.900
 think of a passive state of mind 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.290
 calmly and coolly based 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.870
 i eat and try to imagine 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.130
 your true superior body and mind 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.590
 if you only brought in must 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.730
 able to body and mind you will see in yourself 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.830
 flicker true i keep up 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.130
 she will be in your mind 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:24.490
 truths nothing can hurt 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:29.220
 or exterminate the true self body and mind 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:32.440
 will disappear but I am forever and indestructible 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.320
 she is powerful and when the mind 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.630
 learn to obey his influence being 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.710
 man as it were change and acquire 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.710
 unknown forces
