00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
either tighten or loosen this bolt so if

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.260 
either tighten or loosen this bolt so if
I<00:01:40.810> wanted<00:01:41.229> this<00:01:41.679> table<00:01:42.219> to<00:01:42.549> set<00:01:42.850> up<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:43.060> little

I wanted this table to set up a little

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.590 
I wanted this table to set up a little
lower<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:47.429> would<00:01:48.429> simply<00:01:48.640> loosen<00:01:49.179> that<00:01:49.299> bolt

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
lower I would simply loosen that bolt

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.080 
lower I would simply loosen that bolt
and<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.860> table<00:01:51.250> will<00:01:52.170> lower<00:01:53.170> down<00:01:53.819> if<00:01:54.819> you

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090

find that this isn't enough of an
adjustment<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:58.000> can<00:01:58.380> unscrew<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.950> little

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
adjustment you can unscrew this little

screw and move it up one length on the
chain<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.849> will<00:02:04.390> work<00:02:04.599> just<00:02:04.630> fine<00:02:05.140> but<00:02:05.500> for

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
chain that will work just fine but for

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.490 
chain that will work just fine but for
most<00:02:06.579> typical<00:02:07.209> domestic<00:02:07.569> sewing<00:02:08.079> machines
