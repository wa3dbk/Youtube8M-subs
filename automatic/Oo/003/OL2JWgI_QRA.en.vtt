00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
time for college we didn't have any

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.959 
time for college we didn't have any
money<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.710> Syracuse<00:00:14.160> University<00:00:14.700> gave<00:00:14.820> me<00:00:14.940> a

full scholarship and I thought it was

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.790 
full scholarship and I thought it was
fascinating<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.790> an<00:00:18.680> organization<00:00:19.680> would

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
fascinating that an organization would

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.409 
fascinating that an organization would
take<00:00:20.009> a<00:00:20.040> chance<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.520> me<00:00:20.730> these<00:00:20.939> are<00:00:21.090> people
