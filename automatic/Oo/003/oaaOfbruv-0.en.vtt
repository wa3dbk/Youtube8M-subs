yeah<00:00:19.349> we<00:00:20.349> have<00:00:20.499> any<00:00:20.679> others<00:00:21.749> over<00:00:22.749> there<00:00:26.460> this

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
yeah we have any others over there this

00:00:27.460 --> 00:01:09.380 
yeah we have any others over there this
is<00:00:27.640> nuclear<00:00:28.150> energy

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.740

extremely efficient fuel source in fact

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.280 
extremely efficient fuel source in fact
is<00:01:17.070> 1,500<00:01:18.070> times<00:01:18.280> more<00:01:18.970> efficient<00:01:19.479> than<00:01:19.509> coal

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
is 1,500 times more efficient than coal

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.319 
is 1,500 times more efficient than coal
there's<00:01:20.950> an<00:01:21.100> extremely<00:01:21.399> low<00:01:21.729> amount<00:01:22.180> of

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
there's an extremely low amount of

pollution released into the environment

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.899 
pollution released into the environment
this<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.159> very<00:01:24.579> good

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
this is very good

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.060 
this is very good
because<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.780> coal-fired<00:01:26.049> power<00:01:26.649> plants

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
because the coal-fired power plants

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.160 
because the coal-fired power plants
release<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.369> great<00:01:27.670> amount<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.180> sulfuric<00:01:28.720> acid

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
release a great amount of sulfuric acid

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.560 
release a great amount of sulfuric acid
which<00:01:29.560> leads<00:01:29.829> to<00:01:30.009> acid<00:01:30.399> rain<00:01:30.579> but

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
which leads to acid rain but

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.149 
which leads to acid rain but

did you know

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.359 
did you know
one<00:01:40.880> kilogram<00:01:41.180> of<00:01:41.719> uranium<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.710> powerful

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
one kilogram of uranium is powerful

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.639 
one kilogram of uranium is powerful
enough<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.759> create<00:01:44.149> 20<00:01:44.810> trillion<00:01:45.140> joules<00:01:45.500> of
