CES video we're here with Leo from
seagate<00:00:14.660> oh<00:00:14.930> we<00:00:15.860> go<00:00:15.980> hey<00:00:16.340> done<00:00:16.550> I<00:00:16.820> believe<00:00:17.420> you

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
seagate oh we go hey done I believe you

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.750 
seagate oh we go hey done I believe you
got<00:00:17.689> some<00:00:17.990> refundable<00:00:18.800> stuff<00:00:19.189> to<00:00:19.310> show<00:00:19.460> yeah

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
got some refundable stuff to show yeah

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.400 
got some refundable stuff to show yeah
absolutely<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.689> what<00:00:20.840> we're<00:00:20.930> showing<00:00:21.050> here<00:00:21.200> is

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
absolutely so what we're showing here is

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.470 
absolutely so what we're showing here is
our<00:00:21.740> current<00:00:22.099> goflex<00:00:22.520> for<00:00:22.670> Mac<00:00:22.790> line<00:00:23.000> so

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
our current goflex for Mac line so

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.570 
our current goflex for Mac line so
basically<00:00:23.960> what<00:00:24.140> we<00:00:24.290> have<00:00:24.439> here<00:00:24.830> is<00:00:24.950> drives

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
basically what we have here is drives

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.010 
basically what we have here is drives
that<00:00:25.820> have<00:00:25.970> both<00:00:26.210> firewire<00:00:26.690> and<00:00:26.900> USB

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
that have both firewire and USB

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.470 
that have both firewire and USB
solutions<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:28.279> from<00:00:28.850> the<00:00:28.939> architecture<00:00:29.449> of

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
solutions and from the architecture of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.390 
solutions and from the architecture of
the<00:00:29.600> product<00:00:29.930> you<00:00:29.990> can<00:00:30.140> actually<00:00:30.320> attach<00:00:30.710> the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
the product you can actually attach the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.740 
the product you can actually attach the
interface<00:00:31.850> from<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.239> storage<00:00:32.480> portion

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
interface from a storage portion

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.070 
interface from a storage portion
entirely<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.269> basic<00:00:35.269> at<00:00:35.390> this<00:00:35.540> point<00:00:35.870> the

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
entirely so basic at this point the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.780 
entirely so basic at this point the
drive<00:00:36.320> inside<00:00:36.769> of<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.280> actually<00:00:37.580> faster

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
drive inside of this is actually faster

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.250 
drive inside of this is actually faster
than<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.210> interface<00:00:38.600> can<00:00:38.809> put<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.140> we're

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
than the interface can put so we're

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.680 
than the interface can put so we're
showing<00:00:39.440> firewire<00:00:39.980> 800<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:40.580> basically<00:00:41.420> with

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
showing firewire 800 and basically with

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.420 
showing firewire 800 and basically with
that<00:00:41.870> with<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:42.350> interface<00:00:43.010> will<00:00:43.219> see

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
that with that interface will see

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.760 
that with that interface will see
anywhere<00:00:43.700> between<00:00:43.850> 65<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.630> 85<00:00:45.020> megabytes<00:00:45.559> per

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
anywhere between 65 to 85 megabytes per

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.560 
anywhere between 65 to 85 megabytes per
second<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.190> that's<00:00:46.730> actually<00:00:46.940> slower<00:00:47.360> than

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
second and that's actually slower than

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.049 
second and that's actually slower than
what<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.809> dr<00:00:47.960> can<00:00:48.170> output<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.340> with<00:00:49.969> the

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
what the dr can output so with the

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.150 
what the dr can output so with the
current<00:00:50.239> existing<00:00:50.780> hardware<00:00:51.140> what<00:00:51.710> we<00:00:51.829> can<00:00:51.980> do

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
current existing hardware what we can do

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.369 
current existing hardware what we can do
is<00:00:52.550> we<00:00:52.760> can<00:00:52.790> actually<00:00:52.910> remove<00:00:53.239> what<00:00:54.230> we're

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
is we can actually remove what we're

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.310 
is we can actually remove what we're
calling<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.950> bottleneck<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:56.320> transition

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
calling the bottleneck and transition

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.639 
calling the bottleneck and transition
here<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.649> what<00:00:58.180> we're<00:00:59.180> now<00:00:59.329> launching<00:00:59.649> our

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
here to what we're now launching our

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.950 
here to what we're now launching our
Thunderbolt<00:01:01.010> interface<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.239> it's<00:01:02.449> an<00:01:02.539> adapter

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
Thunderbolt interface so it's an adapter

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.660 
Thunderbolt interface so it's an adapter
three<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.739> half<00:01:03.770> inch<00:01:04.009> version<00:01:04.220> has<00:01:04.489> two

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
three and a half inch version has two

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.730 
three and a half inch version has two
ports<00:01:05.059> allows<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:05.840> daisy<00:01:06.140> chaining<00:01:06.440> up<00:01:06.619> to

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
ports allows for daisy chaining up to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.510 
ports allows for daisy chaining up to
six<00:01:06.950> devices<00:01:08.590> good<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.770> then<00:01:10.039> we'll<00:01:10.190> put<00:01:10.399> this

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
six devices good and then we'll put this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.270 
six devices good and then we'll put this
on<00:01:10.700> here<00:01:10.910> and<00:01:11.530> basically<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.039> same

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
on here and basically with the same

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.730 
on here and basically with the same
drive<00:01:13.580> that<00:01:13.820> we<00:01:13.880> were<00:01:14.000> seeing<00:01:14.240> 65<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.049> 85<00:01:15.200> makes

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
drive that we were seeing 65 to 85 makes

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.260 
drive that we were seeing 65 to 85 makes
or<00:01:15.920> second<00:01:16.220> we're<00:01:16.670> actually<00:01:16.790> gonna<00:01:16.970> run<00:01:17.210> the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
or second we're actually gonna run the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.640 
or second we're actually gonna run the
same<00:01:17.479> test<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.960> we're<00:01:18.049> gonna<00:01:18.140> see<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.619> lot

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
same test and we're gonna see a lot

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.190 
same test and we're gonna see a lot
faster<00:01:19.310> speeds<00:01:19.549> because<00:01:19.729> now<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.750> interface

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
faster speeds because now the interface

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.590 
faster speeds because now the interface
can<00:01:21.860> handle<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.340> fold<00:01:22.580> rizvi<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.330> drive

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
can handle the fold rizvi to the drive

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.410 
can handle the fold rizvi to the drive
so<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:24.500> before<00:01:24.650> we<00:01:25.040> will<00:01:25.159> sing<00:01:25.369> around<00:01:25.520> 60

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
so just before we will sing around 60

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.420 
so just before we will sing around 60
megabytes<00:01:26.689> per<00:01:26.990> second<00:01:27.290> on<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.470> right<00:01:27.500> now

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
megabytes per second on the right now

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.010 
megabytes per second on the right now
i'm<00:01:28.580> 80<00:01:28.729> megabytes<00:01:29.180> per<00:01:29.360> second<00:01:29.659> on<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.810> run

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
i'm 80 megabytes per second on the run

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.570 
i'm 80 megabytes per second on the run
the<00:01:30.110> reading<00:01:30.409> now<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:30.890> will<00:01:30.950> serve<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
the reading now and I will serve you the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.070 
the reading now and I will serve you the
Thunderbolt<00:01:32.000> performance<00:01:32.420> absolutely<00:01:32.930> so

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
Thunderbolt performance absolutely so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.050 
Thunderbolt performance absolutely so
let's<00:01:33.259> run<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.530> test<00:01:33.740> real<00:01:33.950> quick<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:34.790> we<00:01:34.909> can

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
let's run the test real quick and we can

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.030 
let's run the test real quick and we can
see<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.299> numbers<00:01:35.600> go<00:01:35.750> up<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.259> then<00:01:36.590> we'll<00:01:36.830> see

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
see the numbers go up and then we'll see

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.030 
see the numbers go up and then we'll see
anywhere<00:01:37.280> between<00:01:37.780> 165<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:39.020> 175<00:01:39.799> of<00:01:39.979> the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
anywhere between 165 to 175 of the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.469 
anywhere between 165 to 175 of the
rights<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.490> all<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:40.970> reads<00:01:41.150> we'll<00:01:41.360> see

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
rights and all the reads we'll see

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.870 
rights and all the reads we'll see
between<00:01:41.659> 180<00:01:44.590> yo<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:45.770> Nelson<00:01:46.159> performance<00:01:46.700> yes

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
between 180 yo so Nelson performance yes

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.539 
between 180 yo so Nelson performance yes
great<00:01:47.630> performance<00:01:47.900> gain<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.530> again<00:01:48.979> we're

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
great performance gain and again we're

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.520 
great performance gain and again we're
coming<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:49.939> at<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.509> little<00:01:51.020> bit<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.259> you<00:01:51.500> know

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
coming in at a little bit of a you know

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.499 
coming in at a little bit of a you know
