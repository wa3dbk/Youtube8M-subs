00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.859 
has the big plan but though quijote
doflamingo<00:01:52.159> had<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.310> even<00:01:53.490> bigger<00:01:53.759> plan<00:01:54.090> like

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
doflamingo had an even bigger plan like

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
doflamingo had an even bigger plan like
you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.290> pretty<00:01:55.439> much<00:01:55.649> seeming<00:01:56.189> as

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
you know it's pretty much seeming as

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.120 
you know it's pretty much seeming as
though<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.090> government<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.750> no<00:01:58.619> flamingo

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
though the government and no flamingo

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.730 
though the government and no flamingo
decided<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.759> team<00:01:59.939> up<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.560> capture<00:02:01.560> law

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
decided to team up and capture law

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.990 
decided to team up and capture law
instead<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> guess<00:02:02.640> they<00:02:02.790> probably

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
instead because I guess they probably

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.539 
instead because I guess they probably
found<00:02:03.689> out<00:02:03.960> about<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.590> law<00:02:04.770> had<00:02:05.009> done<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
found out about what law had done and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.089 
found out about what law had done and

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
punk hazard and violating everything and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.740 
punk hazard and violating everything and
they're<00:02:08.640> pretty<00:02:08.789> much<00:02:09.000> been<00:02:09.179> aside<00:02:09.509> with

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
they're pretty much been aside with

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.140 
they're pretty much been aside with
doflamingo<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:11.039> yo<00:02:11.190> let's<00:02:11.340> capture<00:02:11.640> law

chapter<00:02:21.489> just<00:02:22.180> absolute<00:02:22.810> madness<00:02:23.170> going<00:02:23.769> on

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
chapter just absolute madness going on

chapter just absolute madness going on
is<00:02:24.189> like<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:24.909> you<00:02:25.030> also<00:02:25.209> got<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> small

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
is like then you also got the small

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.600 
is like then you also got the small
connection<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.099> making<00:02:27.340> me

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
connection and it's really making me

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.039 
connection and it's really making me
think<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:28.239> there's<00:02:28.510> something<00:02:28.689> more<00:02:28.989> to

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
think that there's something more to

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.170 
think that there's something more to
this<00:02:29.230> toy<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:30.370> he<00:02:30.459> sees<00:02:30.640> Rebecca<00:02:31.000> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
this toy because he sees Rebecca and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.520 
this toy because he sees Rebecca and
Rebecca<00:02:31.420> first<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.810> all<00:02:31.930> looks<00:02:32.079> like<00:02:32.140> she's<00:02:32.379> in

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
Rebecca first of all looks like she's in

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.140 
Rebecca first of all looks like she's in
some<00:02:32.709> sort<00:02:32.739> of<00:02:32.980> prison<00:02:33.430> cell<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:33.819> whatever<00:02:34.090> I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
some sort of prison cell or whatever I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.520 
some sort of prison cell or whatever I
don't<00:02:34.209> know<00:02:34.390> that's<00:02:34.599> just<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.989> bars<00:02:35.290> of<00:02:35.409> the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
don't know that's just the bars of the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.140 
don't know that's just the bars of the
windows<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.190> say<00:02:36.310> don't<00:02:36.430> have<00:02:36.640> windows<00:02:37.000> in

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
windows and say don't have windows in

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.880 
windows and say don't have windows in
that<00:02:37.299> town<00:02:37.720> or<00:02:37.870> something<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.650> makes<00:02:38.769> you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that town or something but it makes you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.280 
that town or something but it makes you
think<00:02:39.069> what<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.549> Rebecca's<00:02:40.200> connection<00:02:41.200> with

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
think what is Rebecca's connection with

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.750 
think what is Rebecca's connection with
the<00:02:41.379> toy<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.709> was<00:02:41.859> very<00:02:42.010> brief<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.459> very

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
the toy that was very brief and very

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.000 
the toy that was very brief and very
like<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.329> know<00:02:43.390> out<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.540> nowhere<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:44.890> a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
like you know out of nowhere but it's a

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.220 
like you know out of nowhere but it's a
possibility<00:02:45.310> maybe<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.819> toy<00:02:46.060> ate<00:02:46.690> some<00:02:47.019> sort

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
possibility maybe that toy ate some sort

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.649 
possibility maybe that toy ate some sort
of<00:02:47.260> devil<00:02:47.590> fruit<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:47.920> became<00:02:48.159> a<00:02:48.190> toy<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:49.540> a

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
of devil fruit and became a toy just a

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.300 
of devil fruit and became a toy just a
thought<00:02:49.690> maybe<00:02:50.079> he<00:02:50.200> ate<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.530> toy<00:02:50.680> toy<00:02:50.920> fruit<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.870 
he had a devil for that tournament to a
toy<00:05:37.450> that's<00:05:37.660> my<00:05:38.050> theory<00:05:38.260> on<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:38.880> the

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
toy that's my theory on that and the

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.330 
toy that's my theory on that and the
government<00:05:40.360> got<00:05:40.479> law<00:05:41.380> they<00:05:41.889> I<00:05:41.919> think<00:05:42.039> they

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
government got law they I think they

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.190 
government got law they I think they
pull<00:05:43.000> one<00:05:43.180> over<00:05:43.270> with<00:05:43.570> no<00:05:43.720> flamingo<00:05:44.169> and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
pull one over with no flamingo and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.690 
pull one over with no flamingo and
that's<00:05:44.440> what's<00:05:44.620> up<00:05:44.770> with<00:05:44.889> that<00:05:44.919> that's<00:05:45.580> all

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700
