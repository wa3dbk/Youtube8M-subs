00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
is infrared to this because this was an

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
I get those on the side there might a

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.960 
I get those on the side there might a
little<00:02:51.430> odd<00:02:51.670> but<00:02:51.700> what<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.060> can<00:02:52.209> also<00:02:52.300> do<00:02:52.840> is

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
little odd but what you can also do is

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.810 
little odd but what you can also do is
use<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.000> apple<00:02:55.540> TV<00:02:55.750> then<00:02:56.470> what<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.459> apple

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
use the apple TV then what the apple

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.540 
use the apple TV then what the apple
remote<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:59.350> actually<00:02:59.650> control<00:02:59.980> their<00:03:00.280> soccer

remote to actually control their soccer

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.050 
remote to actually control their soccer

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
because they there that geared towards

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.979 
because they there that geared towards
them<00:03:04.300> actually<00:03:05.200> using<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.800> for<00:03:06.780> apples<00:03:07.780> and

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989

on the go what you can do to connect it

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.280 
on the go what you can do to connect it
through<00:03:51.519> this<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.180> connect<00:03:52.480> your<00:03:52.570> Xbox<00:03:53.140> to

hard this is I don't have a TV here so

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.840 
hard this is I don't have a TV here so
it's<00:04:14.890> going<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.070> be<00:04:15.190> it's<00:04:15.370> going<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.640> be<00:04:15.730> pretty

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
it's going to be it's going to be pretty

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.449 
it's going to be it's going to be pretty
useful<00:04:16.859> signals<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.979> USB

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
useful signals that and this is a USB

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.290 
useful signals that and this is a USB
extension<00:04:22.000> cable<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.340> see<00:04:24.729> this<00:04:25.030> goes

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
extension cable so see this goes

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.470 
extension cable so see this goes
straight<00:04:25.780> into<00:04:25.990> the

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
straight into the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.470 
straight into the
pro<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:28.160> this<00:04:28.340> can<00:04:28.550> extend<00:04:28.910> this<00:04:28.970> little<00:04:29.300> gives

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
pro so this can extend this little gives

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.890 
pro so this can extend this little gives
you<00:04:29.570> great<00:04:29.780> flexibility<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:30.590> order<00:04:31.720> also<00:04:32.720> last

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
you great flexibility in order also last

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.840 
you great flexibility in order also last
and<00:04:33.290> in<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.500> box<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:34.100> is<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.720> very<00:04:35.720> small

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
and in the box this is the very small

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:54.270 
and in the box this is the very small
receive<00:04:37.850> early<00:04:38.000> yet<00:04:38.360> it's<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.720> actual<00:04:38.900> area

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.160 

yeah<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:55.760> that's<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.120> arrow<00:04:56.480> you<00:04:56.840> get<00:04:57.020> to

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
yeah so that's the arrow you get to

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.710 
yeah so that's the arrow you get to
actually<00:04:57.260> get<00:04:57.590> all<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.830> single<00:04:58.450> it's<00:04:59.450> not

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
actually get all the single it's not

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.660 
actually get all the single it's not
actually<00:05:00.110> i<00:05:00.350> would<00:05:00.500> have<00:05:00.740> thought<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:01.490> would

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
actually i would have thought it would

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.240 
actually i would have thought it would
be<00:05:01.850> longer<00:05:02.090> I've<00:05:02.570> had<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:03.020> don't<00:05:03.560> get<00:05:03.890> over<00:05:04.100> the

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
be longer I've had I don't get over the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.990 
be longer I've had I don't get over the
past<00:05:04.490> the<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:05.390> actual<00:05:05.540> hardware<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:07.490> aerial

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
past the the actual hardware this aerial

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.790 
past the the actual hardware this aerial
is<00:05:08.210> much<00:05:08.960> much<00:05:09.650> shorter<00:05:09.710> than<00:05:10.250> I<00:05:10.490> had<00:05:10.700> before

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
is much much shorter than I had before

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.900 
is much much shorter than I had before
which<00:05:12.800> is<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:13.310> little<00:05:13.700> bit<00:05:13.820> of<00:05:13.910> surprise<00:05:14.090> ghost

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
which is a little bit of surprise ghost

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.500 
which is a little bit of surprise ghost
yeah<00:05:16.910> that<00:05:18.580> looks<00:05:19.580> like<00:05:19.760> I<00:05:19.970> might<00:05:20.210> have<00:05:20.480> to

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
yeah that looks like I might have to

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.860 
yeah that looks like I might have to
plug<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:20.990> into<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:22.210> building's<00:05:23.210> aerial<00:05:23.630> so

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
plug it into the building's aerial so

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.170 
plug it into the building's aerial so
I'd<00:05:23.960> like<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.260> get<00:05:24.410> coaxial<00:05:24.890> cable<00:05:25.280> anyway<00:05:25.700> and

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
I'd like to get coaxial cable anyway and

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.360 
I'd like to get coaxial cable anyway and
so<00:05:26.750> I'll<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:26.930> goes<00:05:27.350> straight<00:05:28.130> into<00:05:28.520> there<00:05:29.320> so

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
so I'll just goes straight into there so
