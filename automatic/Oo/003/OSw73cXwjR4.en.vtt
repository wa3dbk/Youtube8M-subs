00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.379 

okay<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.620> logic<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.520> base<00:00:02.669> buttons<00:00:03.120> is

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
okay so the logic of the base buttons is

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.140 
okay so the logic of the base buttons is
really<00:00:03.750> not<00:00:04.080> too<00:00:04.290> difficult<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.830> grasp<00:00:05.150> looks

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
really not too difficult to grasp looks

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.570 
really not too difficult to grasp looks
like<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> lot<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.629> buttons<00:00:06.899> but<00:00:07.710> here's<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.160> key

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
like a lot of buttons but here's the key

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.330 
like a lot of buttons but here's the key
the<00:00:09.090> buttons<00:00:09.420> are<00:00:09.570> arranged<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.139> lines<00:00:10.410> like

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
the buttons are arranged in lines like

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.570 
the buttons are arranged in lines like
this<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.450> direction<00:00:12.660> okay<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:14.340> can<00:00:14.460> see

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
this in this direction okay you can see

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.609 
this in this direction okay you can see
there's<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.880> line<00:00:15.089> there's<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.780> line<00:00:16.049> there's<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
there's a line there's a line there's a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.019 
there's a line there's a line there's a
line<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.130> those<00:00:18.000> lines<00:00:18.330> go<00:00:18.990> by<00:00:19.550> fifths<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:20.910> if

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
line and those lines go by fifths so if

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.490 
line and those lines go by fifths so if
you<00:00:21.119> understand<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> concept<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.170> fifth

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
you understand the concept of a fifth

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.910 
you understand the concept of a fifth
right<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.779> know<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.050> five<00:00:25.380> you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
right it's just you know it's five you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.939 
right it's just you know it's five you
know<00:00:26.010> whole<00:00:26.279> steps<00:00:26.820> away<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:28.289> C<00:00:28.560> chord

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
know whole steps away so in a C chord

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.260 
know whole steps away so in a C chord
right<00:00:30.800> you<00:00:31.800> know<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.099> fifth<00:00:32.399> away<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> C

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
right you know the fifth away from the C

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.250 
right you know the fifth away from the C
is<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.260> G<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> fifth<00:00:35.280> whole<00:00:35.640> step<00:00:35.969> away

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
is the G it's the fifth whole step away

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.150 
is the G it's the fifth whole step away
so<00:00:37.340> they<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.730> fifths<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
so they go by fifths right so if this is

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
so they go by fifths right so if this is
the<00:00:41.309> C<00:00:41.640> right<00:00:44.989> C<00:00:45.989> chord<00:00:46.550> right<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.940> going

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the C right C chord right that's going

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
the C right C chord right that's going
to<00:00:48.239> apply<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.719> whole<00:00:48.989> line<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.710> I'll

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to apply to this whole line and I'll

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.709 
to apply to this whole line and I'll
tell<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.280> they're<00:00:50.460> broken<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.449> next

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
tell you how they're broken up the next

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.470 
tell you how they're broken up the next
set<00:00:51.960> over<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.219> G<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:54.030> G<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.449> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
set over is going to be G because G is a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.980 
set over is going to be G because G is a
fifth<00:00:54.809> away

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
fifth away

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.320 
fifth away

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
[Music]

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.850

then<00:00:59.330> the<00:00:59.420> next<00:00:59.750> side<00:00:59.930> away<00:01:00.050> from<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.590> is

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
then the next side away from that is

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.260 
then the next side away from that is
going<00:01:01.130> to<00:01:01.400> be<00:01:01.550> let's<00:01:01.850> see<00:01:02.000> what<00:01:02.180> is<00:01:02.270> it<00:01:04.270> it's

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
going to be let's see what is it it's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.970 
going to be let's see what is it it's
going<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.480> be<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.630> D<00:01:05.900> right<00:01:06.560> because<00:01:06.740> that's<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
going to be a D right because that's the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.010 
going to be a D right because that's the
next<00:01:07.190> set<00:01:07.430> away<00:01:09.940> so<00:01:10.940> it<00:01:11.060> goes<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.420> fifths<00:01:11.840> right

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
next set away so it goes in fifths right

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.210 
next set away so it goes in fifths right
C<00:01:12.680> G<00:01:13.430> D<00:01:14.120> right<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.290> other<00:01:15.410> side<00:01:15.650> of<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:15.860> C<00:01:16.040> will

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
C G D right the other side of the C will

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.330 
C G D right the other side of the C will
be<00:01:16.250> an<00:01:16.400> F<00:01:16.729> okay<00:01:17.170> now<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.770> other<00:01:18.920> way<00:01:19.130> they're

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
be an F okay now the other way they're

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.910 
be an F okay now the other way they're
arranged<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:20.810> let's<00:01:20.990> just<00:01:21.200> take<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.620> this

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
arranged is so let's just take the this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.770 
arranged is so let's just take the this
line<00:01:22.190> that's<00:01:22.760> C<00:01:23.119> okay<00:01:24.580> we've<00:01:25.580> got<00:01:25.790> a<00:01:25.820> we've<00:01:26.750> got

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
line that's C okay we've got a we've got

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.600 
line that's C okay we've got a we've got
kind<00:01:27.229> of<00:01:27.290> what's<00:01:27.500> called<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.860> base<00:01:28.040> note<00:01:28.430> or

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
kind of what's called the base note or

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.190 
kind of what's called the base note or
the<00:01:28.700> root<00:01:28.940> note<00:01:29.240> in<00:01:29.450> this<00:01:30.020> row<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:32.780> one<00:01:32.960> right

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
the root note in this row the one right

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280 
the root note in this row the one right
next<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.740> here<00:01:34.280> makes<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.910> major<00:01:35.180> chord

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
next to it here makes the major chord

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.040 
next to it here makes the major chord
the<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:39.000> third<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.300> away<00:01:39.660> actually

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
the one the third one away actually

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.039 
the one the third one away actually
makes<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.620> minor<00:01:40.890> chord

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
makes a minor chord

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.539 
makes a minor chord
the<00:01:43.740> next<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.369> makes<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> seventh<00:01:46.549> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the next one down makes the seventh the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.080 
the next one down makes the seventh the
final<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.149> down<00:01:48.359> is<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> diminished<00:01:49.229> chord

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
final one down is the diminished chord

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.480 
final one down is the diminished chord
so<00:01:51.090> they're<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.719> line<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.250> if

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
so they're all in a line right so if

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
so they're all in a line right so if
this<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.850> C<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.929> lot<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
this is C and actually a lot of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.749 
this is C and actually a lot of
accordions<00:01:56.009> they<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> little<00:01:56.579> rhinestone

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
accordions they have a little rhinestone

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.969 
accordions they have a little rhinestone
or<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> little<00:01:57.630> dimple<00:01:58.289> or<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> little<00:01:58.710> bump

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
or a little dimple or a little bump

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.100 
or a little dimple or a little bump
there<00:01:59.039> so<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.060> feel<00:02:00.329> where<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.630> seat<00:02:00.899> is

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
there so you can feel where the seat is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.609 
there so you can feel where the seat is
middle<00:02:01.439> C<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> C<00:02:02.969> root<00:02:03.810> then

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
middle C this will be the C root then

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
middle C this will be the C root then
the<00:02:04.860> major<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.700> minor<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.299> seventh<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.049> the
