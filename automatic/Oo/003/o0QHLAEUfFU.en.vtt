00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.110 
alright so you want to get your model

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.950 
alright so you want to get your model
into<00:00:07.320> source<00:00:07.620> using<00:00:08.040> 3d<00:00:08.460> studio<00:00:08.750> the<00:00:09.750> latest

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
into source using 3d studio the latest

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.810 
into source using 3d studio the latest
version<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.559> what<00:00:10.740> we're<00:00:10.889> model<00:00:11.220> tools<00:00:11.460> makes

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
version of what we're model tools makes

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.420 
version of what we're model tools makes
that<00:00:12.059> extremely<00:00:12.690> easy<00:00:13.170> I'm<00:00:14.010> going<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.280> share

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
that extremely easy I'm going to share

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.220 
that extremely easy I'm going to share
to<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.910> now<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.510> may<00:00:15.840> have<00:00:15.900> seen<00:00:16.110> this

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
to do that now you may have seen this

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
to do that now you may have seen this
model<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.650> other<00:00:16.770> tutorials<00:00:17.010> we're<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:18.150> to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
model in other tutorials we're going to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.810 
model in other tutorials we're going to
give<00:00:18.330> us<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.570> new<00:00:18.750> name<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.190> it's<00:00:20.190> a<00:00:20.280> completely

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
give us a new name and it's a completely

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.490 
give us a new name and it's a completely
different<00:00:21.180> model<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.690> one<00:00:21.870> is<00:00:22.050> not<00:00:22.290> in

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
different model this one is not in

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340 
different model this one is not in
source<00:00:22.770> right<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.280> so<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.840> I'm<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.110> to<00:00:25.230> do

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
source right now so all I'm going to do

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
source right now so all I'm going to do
is<00:00:25.590> click<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:26.010> pick<00:00:26.220> tool<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.670> say<00:00:26.850> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
is click the pick tool to say that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.540 
is click the pick tool to say that
that's<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.420> model<00:00:27.780> and<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:29.190> just<00:00:29.460> going

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that's my model and now I'm just going

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.430 
that's my model and now I'm just going
to<00:00:29.670> hit<00:00:29.880> run<00:00:30.090> export<00:00:32.420> and<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> exporter

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to hit run export and now the exporter

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.080 
to hit run export and now the exporter
is<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> go<00:00:34.860> through<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.370> export<00:00:35.969> my

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
is going to go through and export my

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.919 
is going to go through and export my
model<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.730> compiler<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.510> through<00:00:39.749> its

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:39.929 
model the compiler is going through its

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.000 
model the compiler is going through its
now<00:00:40.079> done<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.820> opened<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.449> a<00:00:42.690> window<00:00:43.440> showing

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
now done it opened up a window showing

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.569 
now done it opened up a window showing
me<00:00:44.280> Mike<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.879> see<00:00:45.120> file<00:00:45.390> my<00:00:46.129> SMD<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.249> all<00:00:47.370> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
me Mike you see file my SMD and all that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.910 
me Mike you see file my SMD and all that
if<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.600> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> open<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.409> model<00:00:49.710> viewer

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
if I want to open up the model viewer

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:07.560 
if I want to open up the model viewer
now<00:00:52.999> let's<00:00:53.999> go<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.719> model<00:00:55.109> viewer<00:00:55.319> here

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.020 

there<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:08.689> is<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:09.770> it<00:01:09.890> has<00:01:10.009> no<00:01:10.219> textures<00:01:10.729> on<00:01:10.880> it

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
there it is now it has no textures on it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.730 
there it is now it has no textures on it
because<00:01:11.240> i<00:01:11.299> did<00:01:11.539> not<00:01:11.570> export<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.259> textures

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
because i did not export the textures

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.560 
because i did not export the textures
i'll<00:01:13.159> explain<00:01:13.610> that<00:01:13.670> in<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:14.000> minute<00:01:15.969> also<00:01:16.969> this

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
i'll explain that in a minute also this

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.440 
i'll explain that in a minute also this
model<00:01:18.020> did<00:01:18.170> not<00:01:18.350> have<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.890> collision<00:01:19.520> hall<00:01:19.820> let

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
model did not have a collision hall let

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.389 
model did not have a collision hall let
me<00:01:20.509> show<00:01:20.689> you<00:01:20.719> the<00:01:20.899> new<00:01:21.049> tool<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.500> make<00:01:21.649> you<00:01:21.890> get

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
me show you the new tool to make you get

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.510 
me show you the new tool to make you get
the<00:01:22.520> collision<00:01:22.909> Hall<00:01:23.119> in<00:01:23.329> very<00:01:23.720> quickly<00:01:24.520> you

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
the collision Hall in very quickly you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.830 
the collision Hall in very quickly you
don't<00:01:25.700> even<00:01:25.819> have<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.090> build<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.479> collision

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
don't even have to build a collision

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.600 
don't even have to build a collision
hall<00:01:27.020> anymore<00:01:27.229> if<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:27.829> want<00:01:28.069> you<00:01:28.250> can<00:01:28.369> click

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
hall anymore if you want you can click

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.899 
hall anymore if you want you can click
this<00:01:28.789> option<00:01:29.000> auto<00:01:29.509> hall<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.679> if<00:01:31.100> we<00:01:31.250> now<00:01:31.579> run

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
this option auto hall and if we now run

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.919 
this option auto hall and if we now run
the<00:01:31.969> exporter<00:01:36.520> we're<00:01:37.520> going<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.819> see<00:01:38.179> that<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
the exporter we're going to see that the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.120 
the exporter we're going to see that the
studio<00:01:39.679> model<00:01:39.950> made<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:42.289> collision<00:01:42.679> hall<00:01:42.830> for

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
studio model made the collision hall for

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.569 
studio model made the collision hall for
us<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.030> we<00:01:44.060> turn<00:01:44.299> on<00:01:44.390> physics<00:01:44.780> here<00:01:45.020> boo<00:01:45.950> now

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
us so we turn on physics here boo now

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.550 
us so we turn on physics here boo now
this<00:01:46.759> is<00:01:46.819> probably<00:01:47.179> not<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.450> collision<00:01:48.409> Hall

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
this is probably not the collision Hall

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.249 
this is probably not the collision Hall
you<00:01:48.649> want<00:01:48.890> here<00:01:49.329> if<00:01:50.329> you<00:01:50.630> wanted<00:01:50.929> to<00:01:51.020> follow

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
you want here if you wanted to follow

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.839 
you want here if you wanted to follow
this<00:01:51.500> you're<00:01:51.770> going<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.069> have<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.459> do<00:01:52.610> some

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
this you're going to have to do some

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.969 
this you're going to have to do some
extra<00:01:53.119> work<00:01:53.239> to<00:01:53.720> make<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.409> collision<00:01:54.799> hall

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
extra work to make the collision hall

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.609 
extra work to make the collision hall
follow<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.759> shape<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.299> have<00:01:56.479> concavities<00:01:57.439> in

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
follow the shape and have concavities in

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.520 
follow the shape and have concavities in
here<00:01:57.829> but<00:01:58.549> if<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:58.939> just<00:01:59.239> need<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.530> collision

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
here but if you just need a collision

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.760 
here but if you just need a collision
hall<00:02:00.739> that<00:02:00.920> wraps<00:02:01.280> your<00:02:01.520> model<00:02:01.939> like<00:02:02.479> this

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
hall that wraps your model like this

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.309 
hall that wraps your model like this
then<00:02:03.770> that's<00:02:04.009> all<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.429> have<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.670> do<00:02:04.849> now<00:02:05.060> is

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
then that's all you have to do now is

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.259 
then that's all you have to do now is
click<00:02:06.319> this<00:02:06.590> Auto<00:02:06.920> Hall<00:02:07.250> button<00:02:07.640> also<00:02:08.239> i

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
click this Auto Hall button also i

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.089 
click this Auto Hall button also i
wanted<00:02:08.599> to<00:02:08.690> point<00:02:08.869> out<00:02:09.049> that<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.530> reason<00:02:09.950> why

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
wanted to point out that the reason why

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.860 
wanted to point out that the reason why
you<00:02:10.130> only<00:02:10.369> had<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.640> click<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.269> button<00:02:11.480> in

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
you only had to click this button in

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.590 
you only had to click this button in
this<00:02:12.049> is<00:02:12.290> because<00:02:12.829> the<00:02:13.549> name<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:14.060> your<00:02:14.150> model

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
this is because the name of your model

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.870 
this is because the name of your model
by<00:02:14.930> default<00:02:15.500> comes<00:02:16.010> from<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> name<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.760> your

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
by default comes from the name of your
