00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
angle in glows I'm I was told it was in

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.440 
angle in glows I'm I was told it was in
glow<00:01:54.530> nut<00:01:54.740> inglot<00:01:55.100> but<00:01:55.730> it's<00:01:55.910> built<00:01:56.120> in<00:01:56.270> blood

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
glow nut inglot but it's built in blood

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.950 
glow nut inglot but it's built in blood
so<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:56.750> confused<00:01:57.080> me<00:01:57.350> anyway<00:01:57.920> anglo<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:59.240> gel

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
so it confused me anyway anglo a gel

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.530 
so it confused me anyway anglo a gel
liner<00:02:00.200> in<00:02:01.330> 77<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:03.040> apparently<00:02:04.040> mines<00:02:04.910> chunkin

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
liner in 77 and apparently mines chunkin

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.100 
liner in 77 and apparently mines chunkin
up<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.810> bunch<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.990> I'm<00:02:08.990> trying<00:02:09.500> my<00:02:09.710> hardest<00:02:09.890> to

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
up a bunch so I'm trying my hardest to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.490 
up a bunch so I'm trying my hardest to
apply<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:17.240> very<00:02:17.780> hard<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.140> me<00:02:18.350> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
apply it and it's very hard for me to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.900 
apply it and it's very hard for me to
watch<00:02:18.530> because<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.910> badly<00:02:20.210> want<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.750> just

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
watch because I so badly want to just

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:32.430 
watch because I so badly want to just
smooth<00:02:22.910> out<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.210> eyeliner

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:41.380

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.330 

and<00:02:41.510> then<00:02:42.110> after<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.530> cameras<00:02:42.920> were<00:02:43.040> off<00:02:43.069> I

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
and then after the cameras were off I

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.600 
and then after the cameras were off I
fixed<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:45.410> also<00:02:45.650> i'm<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.459> take
