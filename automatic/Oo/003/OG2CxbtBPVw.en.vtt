00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
think about it so I'm gonna go to an app

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.210 
think about it so I'm gonna go to an app
page<00:00:42.809> where<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:43.500> apps<00:00:43.649> selected

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
comparison so the first half is going to
