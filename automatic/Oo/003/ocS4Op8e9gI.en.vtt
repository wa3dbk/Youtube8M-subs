00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.810
 life is art second part 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.379
 this case we go with my favorite work that also comes in double because carlos 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:13.489
 mazon sicardi antonia dyson 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.580
 these artists who exhibit very little in common with each other perhaps the only thing that 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.980
 unites them in this matter is that both are 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.329
 plastic artist 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.999
 but while carolina antonia and I know he works on large fabrics 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.319
 on spacious surfaces with many colors 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.070
 it is in style when reading between pop and road and psychedelia and very close to 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.460
 the decorative ones 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.609
 works in a much smaller format more 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.609
 there was more enigmatic with more characters 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.660
 percent and good 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.240
 Despite these differences, both decided to exchange work 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.630
 and now they tell us 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.789
 both arms anthony hayes 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.520
 they chose the one and the other the time of 1 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.550
 and the other 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 look at you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.540

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.600
 99 the current one did not like the work to have in the plaza julio cortázar it seems to me in 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.380
 I like your territory very much what it does 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890
 four in the afternoon glass 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.700
 they justified on the cable the psn and pse 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 having flown daily with the usa 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.870
 then he appeared to this topic in the case of those who do not know who 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.079
 but he did not propose it within all of that because they are my trying to be in reality 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.119
 liked some hours will be partying because the assembly that 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.890
 the picture in this science 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.750
 that I like 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.030
 much as an object of prior conciliation meetings 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.329
 hinton tables was a work of the most atypical of

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.189

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:03.950
