year to four year so to us is actually a
new<00:02:55.400> beginning<00:02:55.910> because<00:02:56.660> we<00:02:57.170> can<00:02:57.380> be<00:02:57.500> packaged

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
new beginning because we can be packaged

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
actually allow us to develop our program

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.000 
actually allow us to develop our program

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
many respects this is an historic time

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.770 
many respects this is an historic time

and<00:03:15.530> what<00:03:16.010> we've<00:03:16.160> done<00:03:16.190> at<00:03:16.549> CityU<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.930> think

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
and what we've done at CityU is to think

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.590 
and what we've done at CityU is to think
about<00:03:18.410> what<00:03:19.130> should<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.430> curriculum<00:03:20.090> look<00:03:20.329> like

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
about what should a curriculum look like

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.620 
about what should a curriculum look like
in<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:21.500> day<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:21.829> age<00:03:22.130> where<00:03:22.519> we<00:03:22.700> have<00:03:22.880> such

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
in this day and age where we have such

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.800 
in this day and age where we have such
tremendous<00:03:24.130> forces<00:03:25.130> from<00:03:25.519> technology<00:03:26.359> and

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
tremendous forces from technology and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.890 
tremendous forces from technology and
from<00:03:26.930> globalization<00:03:27.440> we<00:03:28.220> recognized<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.329> if

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
from globalization we recognized that if

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.840 
from globalization we recognized that if
you<00:03:29.989> just<00:03:30.170> do<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.530> mathematics<00:03:31.250> of<00:03:31.459> going

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
you just do the mathematics of going

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.039 
you just do the mathematics of going
from<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.180> three<00:03:32.390> year<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.750> four<00:03:33.019> year

from a three year to a four year

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.979 
from a three year to a four year
curriculum<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:34.459> really<00:03:34.820> need<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.269> increase

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
curriculum you really need to increase

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.610 
curriculum you really need to increase
the<00:03:36.440> number<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.829> staff<00:03:37.359> substantially<00:03:38.620> simply

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
the number of staff substantially simply

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.830 
the number of staff substantially simply
put<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.400> would<00:03:40.489> be<00:03:40.549> about<00:03:40.850> another<00:03:41.180> third<00:03:41.570> and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
put it would be about another third and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.140 
put it would be about another third and
it's<00:03:42.560> very<00:03:42.739> difficult<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.430> do<00:03:43.609> that<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:44.120> a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
it's very difficult to do that on a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.750 
it's very difficult to do that on a
short<00:03:44.510> timeline<00:03:45.100> what<00:03:46.100> we<00:03:46.220> thought<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.640> an

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
short timeline what we thought is an

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.640 
short timeline what we thought is an
alternative<00:03:47.359> is<00:03:47.540> we<00:03:47.720> would<00:03:47.900> continue<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.379> hire

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
alternative is we would continue to hire

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.350 
alternative is we would continue to hire
faculty<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:49.700> very<00:03:49.940> deliberate<00:03:50.569> careful

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
faculty in a very deliberate careful

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.780 
faculty in a very deliberate careful
but<00:03:52.230> at<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> same<00:03:52.620> time<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.430> was<00:03:53.670> an

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
but at the same time this was an

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.000 
but at the same time this was an
opportunity<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.690> help<00:03:54.840> internationalize<00:03:55.740> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
opportunity to help internationalize the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.060 
opportunity to help internationalize the
campus<00:03:56.520> by<00:03:57.180> bringing<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.780> talented<00:03:58.440> scholars

from<00:03:59.250> around<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.760> world<00:03:59.940> who<00:04:00.690> could<00:04:00.870> assist

from around the world who could assist

from around the world who could assist
us<00:04:01.410> with<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.860> transition<00:04:02.460> I<00:04:02.910> think

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
us with this transition I think

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.290 
us with this transition I think
generally<00:04:04.470> speaking<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.100> great<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.910> be<00:04:05.940> in

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
generally speaking it is great to be in

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.040 
generally speaking it is great to be in
Asia<00:04:06.600> now<00:04:07.020> because<00:04:07.640> coming<00:04:08.640> from<00:04:09.060> Europe<00:04:09.600> from
