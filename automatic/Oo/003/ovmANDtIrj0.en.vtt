and<00:00:13.889> how<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.400> integrate<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.940> Geo<00:00:15.210> action

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and how can we integrate that Geo action

because<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.480> bit

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
because I see it's a little bit

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.779 
because I see it's a little bit
different<00:00:19.020> than<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> motion<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.460> very

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
different than the motion it's very

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.189 
different than the motion it's very
different<00:00:21.029> I'm<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.570> excited<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:21.960> this

numbers spelled out they have the colors
spelled<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.690> shapes<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.890> count

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100

the<00:00:38.280> sides<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:39.329> were<00:00:39.480> doing<00:00:39.860> geometry<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the sides we were doing geometry and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.799 
the sides we were doing geometry and
they<00:00:41.280> were<00:00:41.340> trying<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.329> were<00:00:42.390> giving<00:00:42.719> me

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
they were trying to they were giving me

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.540 
they were trying to they were giving me
all<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> attributes<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> shapes<00:00:44.309> they

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
all the attributes of the shapes they

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.740 
all the attributes of the shapes they
got<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.879> out<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> they<00:00:45.390> were<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.629> oh

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
got this out and they were like oh

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.229 
got this out and they were like oh
there's<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.530> many<00:00:46.620> vertices<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.059> many

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
there's so many vertices here in so many

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.450 
there's so many vertices here in so many
corners<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.020> angles<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.370> an

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
corners and angles and that was an

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.290 
corners and angles and that was an
obtuse<00:00:50.879> angle<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> cute<00:00:53.010> angle<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
obtuse angle or or a cute angle so this

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
obtuse angle or or a cute angle so this
part<00:00:54.660> has<00:00:54.809> been<00:00:54.930> very<00:00:55.500> beneficial<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:56.309> my

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
part has been very beneficial for my

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
part has been very beneficial for my
third<00:00:56.699> grade<00:00:56.969> students<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.570> use<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
third grade students we use it all the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.250 
third grade students we use it all the
time<00:00:58.609> this<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.879> very<00:01:00.329> interesting<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.020> well

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
time this is very interesting as well

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.549 
time this is very interesting as well
because<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:02.160> use<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.840> use<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> lot

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
because we use it it we use it in a lot

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
because we use it it we use it in a lot
of<00:01:04.589> different<00:01:04.830> ways<00:01:05.159> first<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.210> students

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
of different ways first of all students

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.030 
of different ways first of all students
have<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> hard<00:01:06.900> time<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.380> clockwise<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
have a hard time with clockwise and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.550 
have a hard time with clockwise and
counterclockwise<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.930> being<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.320> visual

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
counterclockwise so this being a visual

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.260 
counterclockwise so this being a visual
where<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> hands<00:01:11.580> pointing<00:01:12.150> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
where they have the hands pointing in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.149 
where they have the hands pointing in
the<00:01:12.390> different<00:01:12.720> directions<00:01:12.930> makes<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.650> great

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the different directions makes a great

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
the different directions makes a great
visual<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.360> refer<00:01:15.689> back<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.930> in

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
visual that they can refer back to in

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
visual that they can refer back to in
the<00:01:16.500> more<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:16.799> refer<00:01:17.130> back<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.060> more

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the more they refer back to it the more

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.350 
the more they refer back to it the more
natural<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.840> becomes<00:01:19.520> they<00:01:20.520> also<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
natural it becomes they also have the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
natural it becomes they also have the
counting<00:01:21.960> by<00:01:22.110> fives<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> fractions

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
counting by fives we have the fractions

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.170 
counting by fives we have the fractions
in<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.860> verbage<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
in here they have the the verbage that a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.480 
in here they have the the verbage that a
lot<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.659> students<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.259> trouble<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.890> with

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
lot of students have trouble with with

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.420 
lot of students have trouble with with
the<00:01:29.700> until<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> before<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.350> after<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.250> know

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the until and before and after you know

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.359 
the until and before and after you know
in<00:01:32.610> second<00:01:33.030> grade<00:01:33.409> yes<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
in second grade yes so we have all of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.760 
in second grade yes so we have all of
that<00:01:35.520> verbage<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.470> something

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that verbage here so it's not something

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
that verbage here so it's not something
that's<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.159> foreign<00:01:38.579> when<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> look<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.150> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
that's so foreign when you look at a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.390 
that's so foreign when you look at a
clock<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:40.020> those<00:01:40.229> words<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
clock you don't see those words so the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
clock you don't see those words so the
more<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.360> words<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.960> less<00:01:43.140> foreign

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
more they see the words the less foreign

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
more they see the words the less foreign
it<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.430> becomes<00:01:44.820> more<00:01:44.909> natural

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it is and it just becomes more natural

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870 
it is and it just becomes more natural
for<00:01:45.509> them<00:01:45.600> say<00:01:45.810> Oh<00:01:45.960> 15<00:01:46.770> minutes<00:01:47.100> until<00:01:47.250> or

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
for them say Oh 15 minutes until or

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.690 
for them say Oh 15 minutes until or
before<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.960> certain<00:01:49.350> time<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.549> is

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
before a certain time so this is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.740 
before a certain time so this is
something<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.270> keep<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.570> their<00:01:51.600> desk
