00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.659
 arriving denied 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:19.619
 It's hard to sleep almost the whole trip. 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:21.950
 night and if it does not resolve a plan b that is 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.950
 the energetic 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.009
 everybody thinks you know, right? 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.850
 do not even have to say the name and how it is 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.950
 What do you do to keep them cold? 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.400

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.030
 she had red bull 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.640
 a lot of people must be seen 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.810
 alone I do not drink Do not smoke Do not have 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.610
 seen then that takes it there my addiction 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.000
 Quotes Do not Do It So Badly 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 Just like a drug, he's a people who 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.220
 Leave a little more on, let's go. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.400
 there to put ice cold so put it here 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.830
 the output of the air conditioner Here is 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.880
 get out of the air conditioning what this 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.840
 You also all still 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.610
 conditioning 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.350
 Ideally, it is posited that here 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.900
 also gave frozen in that the madrid 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.490
 stayed a little below the ideal place 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.680
 wear that way 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.360
 so that she had stayed here well in the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.780
 exit and glory gets very cold stays 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.560
 It's very cold, even though it 's incredible. 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.940
 or more of the more if you have not 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.670
 an air-conditioned car to my 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.670
 car has air conditioning beauty for the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.770
 nearby shop and asks for a glass with 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.709
 ice with the problem 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.930
 I ask and I'm tired of asking or not 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.430
 could they sometimes complete the snake 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.959
 and show which greatly helps coca 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.670
 Glue in the middle is a trick I have 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.520
 I 'm in the profession and not long ago 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.959
 You must be 17 years old and work is 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.070
 this heavy truck driver's branch 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.600
 working and just like motoboy ever 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.590
 I worked with the light vehicle and already 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 I started straight through with the heavy medium and even 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.709
 today it's working out the way I am 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.350
 making me drink energetic and worth it 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.360
 you invest sometimes a little more 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.970
 expensive with energy is expensive to repeated the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.830
 Repeat card should cost on average 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.760
 20 reais 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.780
 I do not know if it's just buying four cans of 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.239
 red bull 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.400
 that you buy cheap costs $ 6 or 4 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.570
 the charges more 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.840
 but it's something I like who 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.030
 paid in beer and 56 is beer not 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.310
 Then I think it's worth it for me. 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.110
 invest in it and it is not always the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.209
 Sometimes we have a trip that I 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.040
 I arrive in a tone I do not take 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.650
 I got to take that one there that the chewing gum 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.660
 Helping me to keep the color is clear. 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.440
 that after a few hours of rest and 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.840
 Let's face 11 at 12 noon. 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.700
 steering wheel and what is wrong before the law 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.190
 but the greenery until today did not find 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.230
 solution to 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.270
 to comply with the law then meanwhile the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.750
 people are working this way 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:12.910
 The way you handle it with responsibility is 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.770
 clear that the main thing is life 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.530
 people independent of being my 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.130
 the one of the next one has to worry in its 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.720
 life and in your family the loss of a 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.310
 life 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.160
 it generates a huge huge loss 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.660
 not even sometimes not for those who are already gone 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.690
 That was his problem, it's over. 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.140
 but it leaves a huge hole a guy 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.870
 very large loss in the family to 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.680
 leaves a very large wound of your 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.090
 sons his wife his mother his brothers 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.160
 then very big loss that you 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.460
 lets you cause from the moment 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.600
 that you run the risk of losing your life 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.200
 from the moment you lose the 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.940
 life 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.400
 so that's what we should think 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:02.940
 To speak first, I'll take and 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.710
 bit is better take I repeat that die 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.419
 no, people are better you do not take rivet 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.970
 No, not too risky. 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.660
 I think it's best I'll take rivet 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.790
 who signed Sunday does not rest people 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.450
 take up the problem of having 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.280
 Insomnia is going to have health problems 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.740
 I know friend and work in the road. 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.440
 itapemirim 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.890
 maybe it's there until today that it 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:34.710
 We breakfasted and I am today to Arrebite 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:39.720
 driving at night and then taking the trio 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:42.220
 For me to sleep at day does not mean 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.290
 poetry to stay clearer at night I 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.830
 I take medicine not to sleep. 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.300
 edilton subway sunday anyone in sÃ£ 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.910
 consciousness is seeing that this is 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.890
 lead to death if it's going doing 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.130
 too big for him that is natural 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.320
 that you take a chance without taking medicine 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.940
 Stay awake also take medicine then 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.250
 The whole trip for the whole trip was the 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.860
 same kind thing one does not 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.439
 house awareness 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.659

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.610
 done right but one hour or another 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:15.419
 He's going to stop and take his life. 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.919
 although it will take the lives of other people 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.629
 I'm not perfect until today I do not 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.419
 I took it, I 'm not better than anyone because 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:26.280
 not because I have not taken it yet but I 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:28.740
 I believe that it makes me have more health 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.479
 and makes you live longer 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.800
