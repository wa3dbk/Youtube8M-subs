hey<00:00:00.599> everyone<00:00:00.989> make<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.410> guitar<00:00:01.740> guy<00:00:01.770> here

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hey everyone make the guitar guy here

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.490 
hey everyone make the guitar guy here
welcome<00:00:02.790> back<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.240> hope<00:00:03.510> you're<00:00:03.720> enjoying<00:00:03.840> our

welcome back I hope you're enjoying our

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.880 
welcome back I hope you're enjoying our
little<00:00:04.980> series<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.670> speed<00:00:06.629> picking<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.259> we're

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
little series on speed picking and we're

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.950 
little series on speed picking and we're
going<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> just<00:00:08.250> move<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.880> another<00:00:09.450> step<00:00:09.780> now

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
going to just move on another step now

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.540 
going to just move on another step now
from<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> last<00:00:10.559> video<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.010> did<00:00:11.040> which<00:00:11.400> was

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
from the last video I did which was

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.669 
from the last video I did which was
showing<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> scale<00:00:12.509> shape<00:00:12.870> using<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
showing you a scale shape using the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.289 
showing you a scale shape using the
speed<00:00:14.009> picking<00:00:14.250> idea<00:00:14.700> we're<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
speed picking idea we're going to

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.609 
speed picking idea we're going to
develop<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.750> little<00:00:15.960> bit<00:00:16.080> more<00:00:16.260> now<00:00:16.440> and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
develop that a little bit more now and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.560 
develop that a little bit more now and
try<00:00:17.279> some<00:00:17.460> different<00:00:17.609> ways<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.240> playing<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
try some different ways of playing the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.500 
try some different ways of playing the
same<00:00:18.869> scale<00:00:19.320> shape<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.160> same<00:00:20.430> idea<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.150> in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
same scale shape the same idea but in

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.050 
same scale shape the same idea but in
different<00:00:21.630> variations<00:00:22.369> now<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.760> hand

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
different variations now the right hand

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.580 
different variations now the right hand
for<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:24.990> exactly<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.560> same

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
for this is going to be exactly the same

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.650 
for this is going to be exactly the same
there's<00:00:26.010> no<00:00:26.130> change<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.510> our

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
there's no change it's just that our

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.970 
there's no change it's just that our
left<00:00:28.019> hand<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.560> change<00:00:28.769> slightly

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
left hand is going to change slightly

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.160 
left hand is going to change slightly
with<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> way<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.699> put<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.029> scale<00:00:30.300> shape<00:00:30.599> it's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
with the way we put the scale shape it's

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.690 
with the way we put the scale shape it's
just<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.410> combination<00:00:31.619> thing<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.430> an<00:00:32.550> F

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
just a combination thing it's like an F

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
just a combination thing it's like an F
medical<00:00:33.120> thing<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:34.079> through<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.469> we

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
medical thing so going through what we

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.060 
medical thing so going through what we
did<00:00:34.559> last<00:00:34.829> time<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.280> did<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:36.210> did<00:00:36.239> there

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
did last time we did that we did there

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:49.580 
did last time we did that we did there
it's<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.280> three<00:00:38.489> nights<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.289> I'd<00:00:49.379> call

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it's the three nights so what I'd call

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
it's the three nights so what I'd call
that<00:00:49.829> would<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.489> two<00:00:50.820> three<00:00:51.210> four<00:00:51.690> each

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that would be one two three four each

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
that would be one two three four each
each<00:00:52.140> string<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.770> sake<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.340> example

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
each string for the sake of this example

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
each string for the sake of this example
one<00:00:54.300> two<00:00:54.480> three<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:54.899> three<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.289> two

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
one two three one two three one two

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.800> two<00:00:56.039> three<00:00:56.070> four<00:00:56.430> each<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> those

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
three one two three four each of those

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
three one two three four each of those
things<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> three<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.809> two<00:00:57.960> three<00:01:00.440> but<00:01:01.440> we're

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
things is three one two three but we're

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.900 
things is three one two three but we're
gonna<00:01:01.649> mix<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.129> we're<00:01:02.309> gonna<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.579> three

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
gonna mix it up now we're gonna do three

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.759 
gonna mix it up now we're gonna do three
two<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.210> three<00:01:03.420> two<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.809> same<00:01:04.260> idea<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
two one three two one same idea with the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.440 
two one three two one same idea with the
right<00:01:05.010> hand<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.700> left<00:01:05.880> hand<00:01:06.119> has<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> go

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
right hand it's the left hand has to go

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:18.219 
right hand it's the left hand has to go
down<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.799> other<00:01:13.860> way<00:01:14.040> around

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.660 

so<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> same<00:01:19.770> thing<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.369> idea

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
so you do the same thing with that idea

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.450 
so you do the same thing with that idea
and<00:01:20.729> speeding<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.280> whatever

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and speeding it up so and to whatever

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.359 
and speeding it up so and to whatever
stage<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.780> awesome

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
stage you can get it to be awesome

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.039 
stage you can get it to be awesome
another<00:01:32.369> idea<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.000> that's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.630> second

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
another idea so that's that's a second

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.679 
another idea so that's that's a second
version<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.799> same<00:01:35.340> scale<00:01:35.670> shape<00:01:36.150> idea

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
version of that same scale shape idea

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.020 
version of that same scale shape idea
but<00:01:37.350> using<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> different<00:01:37.740> variety<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.610> one

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
but using a different variety of one

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.039 
but using a different variety of one
sieve<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.450> two<00:01:39.600> three

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
sieve one two three

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.170 
sieve one two three
three<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:41.939> quite

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
three two one now we can get quite

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:51.740 
three two one now we can get quite
creative<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.229> three<00:01:43.619> two<00:01:50.750> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
creative we can go one three two the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.060 
creative we can go one three two the
right<00:01:51.899> hand<00:01:52.110> doesn't<00:01:52.259> change<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:52.860> for

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
right hand doesn't change it all for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.270 
right hand doesn't change it all for
that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280 
that
so<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:53.700> another<00:01:53.880> idea<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> add<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.810> or

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
so there's another idea we can add in or

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:05.999 
so there's another idea we can add in or
we<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.740> two<00:01:56.189> three<00:01:56.430> one

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.080 

you<00:02:07.009> can<00:02:07.159> see<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.340> need<00:02:07.520> little<00:02:07.640> practice<00:02:08.000> on

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
you can see I need little practice on

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.380 
you can see I need little practice on
that<00:02:08.209> one<00:02:08.360> myself<00:02:09.879> that's<00:02:10.879> quite<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.090> cool<00:02:11.269> one

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
that one myself that's quite a cool one

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.490 
that one myself that's quite a cool one
as<00:02:11.510> well<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:11.900> there's<00:02:12.440> different

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
as well so there's different

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.110 
as well so there's different
combinations<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.459> can<00:02:13.610> keep<00:02:13.760> going<00:02:13.970> with

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
combinations and you can keep going with

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.759 
combinations and you can keep going with
those<00:02:14.360> combinations<00:02:15.049> just<00:02:15.319> trying<00:02:15.650> different

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
those combinations just trying different

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.979 
those combinations just trying different
ways<00:02:16.069> yeah<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:16.970> idea<00:02:17.330> is<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.660> get<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
ways yeah but the idea is to get the

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.690 
ways yeah but the idea is to get the
left<00:02:18.200> hand<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.860> right<00:02:18.890> hand<00:02:19.129> working

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
left hand and the right hand working

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.089 
left hand and the right hand working
together<00:02:20.170> often<00:02:21.170> we<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:21.440> pick<00:02:21.590> really<00:02:21.769> fast

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
together often we can pick really fast

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.800 
together often we can pick really fast
and<00:02:22.489> we<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.670> play<00:02:22.970> really<00:02:23.120> fast<00:02:23.209> their<00:02:23.629> left

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
and we can play really fast their left

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.110 
and we can play really fast their left
hand<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.830> combination<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.549> picking<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
hand but the combination of picking and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.570 
hand but the combination of picking and
playing<00:02:26.810> with<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.989> left<00:02:27.170> hand<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.620> actually

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
playing with a left hand is actually

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.820 
playing with a left hand is actually
kind<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.060> little<00:02:29.150> bit<00:02:29.299> out<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.510> sync<00:02:29.830> now

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
kind of a little bit out of sync now

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.229 
kind of a little bit out of sync now
remember<00:02:31.190> when<00:02:31.310> you're<00:02:31.370> playing<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.819> you

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
remember when you're playing this you

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.640 
remember when you're playing this you
can<00:02:32.390> do<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.599> on<00:02:32.720> an<00:02:32.780> acoustic<00:02:32.959> guitar<00:02:33.200> on

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
can do this on an acoustic guitar on

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.380 
can do this on an acoustic guitar on
electric<00:02:34.099> guitar<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.610> can<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.060> left-handed

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
electric guitar you can be left-handed

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.210 
electric guitar you can be left-handed
right-handed<00:02:35.870> doesn't<00:02:36.560> matter<00:02:36.769> doesn't

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
right-handed doesn't matter doesn't

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
really affect anything and it doesn't

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.449 
really affect anything and it doesn't

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
a pick for this particular example as

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.520 
a pick for this particular example as
long<00:02:44.239> as<00:02:44.360> you're<00:02:44.480> comfortable<00:02:44.690> picking<00:02:45.049> fast

if<00:02:46.010> not<00:02:46.459> check<00:02:46.790> out<00:02:46.940> those<00:02:47.120> videos<00:02:47.269> I've<00:02:47.690> got<00:02:47.900> I

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
if not check out those videos I've got I

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.710 
if not check out those videos I've got I
had<00:02:48.799> a<00:02:48.829> holder<00:02:49.099> pick<00:02:49.280> nice<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.209> confidently

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
