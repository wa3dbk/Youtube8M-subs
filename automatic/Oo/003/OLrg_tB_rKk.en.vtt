so there's one mystery solved I'm going
to<00:05:04.980> attempt<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.520> manual<00:05:06.060> override<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.780> this

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
to attempt a manual override on this

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.439 
to attempt a manual override on this
wall<00:05:07.500> click<00:05:08.220> over<00:05:08.490> technical<00:05:08.970> hold<00:05:09.540> on

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.980 

almost<00:05:13.169> there<00:05:13.729> remember<00:05:14.729> me<00:05:15.180> looking<00:05:15.479> rig<00:05:15.749> on

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
almost there remember me looking rig on

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.640 
almost there remember me looking rig on
the<00:05:16.020> next<00:05:16.559> hole<00:05:16.879> but<00:05:17.879> bullet<00:05:18.330> holes<00:05:18.650> don't

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
the next hole but bullet holes don't

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.860 
the next hole but bullet holes don't
worry<00:05:19.889> you'll<00:05:20.129> figure<00:05:20.400> out<00:05:20.689> seriously<00:05:21.689> do
