00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.060
The game today is simple

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.051
Build the garage of the dreams

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:11.234
I'm sure that you already did that

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.520
But we have a limit here of 500.000 reais here

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.200
It's '5 vacancies, 500 bucks'

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.820
It cannot be so easy, because otherwise we'll pick Porsche, Ferrari...

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.960
We have to have a limit of vacancies and budget

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.320
For you that loses nights finding cars, that rarities on the internet

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.020
We have a 'accelerated' here to see how is his garage

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.780
'5 vacancies, 500 bucks'

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.420
As my first car I've found a white Audi A6 Avant

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.140
Because my budget of 500, you know

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.900
I was squeezing, squeezing but I need to have a good car 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.960
The car have a different wheel, it is bigger

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.620
In Rio de Janeiro you will have a bit of wind

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.160
But R$ 286.000 is the first budget that I put inside the R$ 500.000

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.960
You spent a lot, no?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.500
But, at the same, the car is for the whole family

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.900
with the bags

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.580
So, my first is this big white here

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:11.734
And I'm very happy

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.160
After that what you chose?

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.300
The next is a car for Silvana

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.760
Is the only 0 km car of the list

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.940
Is a Kia Sportage 2.0

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.700
The car costs R$ 89.990

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.880
I was trying to found until the last one, and I had a help from the friends to find

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.613
It is below the normal price

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.680
So, 280, 89

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.540
We are arriving in the limit

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.320
We are in R$ 370.000

00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:40.387
I wanna see where you will put your 'go kart feeling'

00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:42.373
The car that you will want to drive in a race track

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:43.834
You will see

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.060
My third car, it is not for me

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
But I have a son who drives

00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:51.457
Will take a while to the boys drive on the streets

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.340
But the car have a golden in the sun, which recalls my car from 1996

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.740
Benson &amp; Hedges

00:02:00.532 --> 00:02:02.532
And I loved

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.099
It's a Mini One, little car

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.900
9000 kms, which is a very cool margin and have much more to come

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.380
It's a good price, R$ 47.000

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.460
We jumped from R$ 370.000 with more R$ 47.000

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.620
We are around R$ 400.000

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.620
By my calculations you are...

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:21.673
No, but I will put other cars

00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:23.813
Will you buy a shifter now?

00:02:23.813 --> 00:02:25.453
Will you put a shifter in your vacancy?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.520
My fourth car is a Gol GTS

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.960
A car that I lived emotions when I was a boy, in 87

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.200
A remember even the plate of my car, FAT-2801

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.880
Big playboy from the 80's and 90's you, eh?

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.240
Yeah, GTS, GTi

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.900
It was a car of playboys

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.180
For me was more a GTS, was a...

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.680
A humble playboy

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.707
Yeah, a humble playboy

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.940
My wheel was sandblasted, but I will change this one

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.820
But you didn't picked up a car for you

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.060
A car which is not for the family, the kids, not the nostalgic one

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.140
Your car

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.893
Your selfish and individual car

00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:08.208
But now, listen...

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.560
My fifth car is simply a car for me

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.920
A Lotus Exige, 1.8, very light

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.180
A car that I would like to drive even in Interlagos

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280
It's a kart

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:23.853
We already said about kart

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:25.413
It is rare, there is only two in Brazil

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.460
R$ 250.000

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.480
Hold on, we could not close the count

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.700
Did you remember the name of this program?

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.173
It is 500!

00:03:31.173 --> 00:03:32.433
Yeah, it's not 500?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.140
You are R$ 190.000 outside of the budget

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.060
But we will be nice because it's the first one

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.400
Nah, I passed, you know

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.880
The GTS is a car that tried to found in a good price

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.940
But the Lotus I couldn't leave out

00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:50.798
So, because you argued well in each one

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.640
It is the first program, so we will be nice and let you go beyond

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.200
But the Exige have to be on de 'Fast Lap' too

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.520
And, if you win the Stock Car's Million Race

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.880
You will have money to spend

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.613
Yeah!

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.860
And Rubinho wanted this Lotus very bad

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.440
Because in the next day he pushed hard and put 1 million in the pocket

00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:23.938
I had to pass...

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.660
Yeah, thanks

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.640
Thank you, thanks...

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.540
Pass here again, say "hello" man
