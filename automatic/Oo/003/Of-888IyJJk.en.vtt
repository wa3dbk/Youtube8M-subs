00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 the daily division in the topography of 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.799
 automatic 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.219
 let's automate the division process 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.230
 we stayed at the top graf in drawings let's 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.680
 a little on drawings 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:23.130
 let's click on file matters to choose 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:27.990
 the drawing here in batches we will open a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 file that is in open import 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.120
 let's change the scale because it 's a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:45.300
 big drawing put one to 20 thousand 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:47.129
 the right is to tie or even put 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.539
 sequential numbering is a thing of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.180
 list will appear all points 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.050
 let's stay in style variables 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.270
 points 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 let's click on the campaign symbol 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.890
 dilma put the first and second 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.439
 cycle option and we will now create 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.500
 the breakup mapping put xx in 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.909
 everything here I can put the chi-x state 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.240
 put some pear 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:20.939
 the gleba x the date I will put only of minor 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.159
 touch is a central with zone 23 45 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.200
 the configuration in the new configuration in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:33.990
 area is the H 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:36.540
 ok lot to album batch name 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.079
 aquino a name that will be a dock 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.290
 note that it appeared in the center of the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.829
 polygon 15 with lot number ok is 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:55.979
 perfect so here is land split 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:57.149
 lot will pop up a floating menu and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.070
 there 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.920
 what happens is to inform the area and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.430
 straight over a few points in the area 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.170
 area as I know the area 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.950
 total and I will put a smaller area 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.370
 that 50 hectares and put the next 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 step 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.160
 I want this side to be parallel here. 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.190
 OK 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.740
 clicked wait wait process 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.660
 processing then I come here 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.350
 division select a threshold of 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.810
 barbot with the starting point of this line 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.550
 The meeting goes from here to there is a 12 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.260
 initial click 12 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.360
 message appears on the screen. 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.090
 bit select endpoint 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:49.010
 after 12 with the next point 11 11 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:54.150
 11 report a little bit again 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.850
 automatic message of the shape division 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.730
 automated national manufacturer of 60 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.840
 note that it has 50 hectares each area 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.600
 everything automatically ok very useful is 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.320
 doing a mapping o everything has 50 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.200
 hectares 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.910
 please note that it was automatic I did not 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.550
 little did not do one 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.160
 see the video several times and try 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.730
 you too 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.730
 we ended up wrong
