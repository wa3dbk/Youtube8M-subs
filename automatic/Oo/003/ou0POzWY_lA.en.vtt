00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.120
 next here we have a kitchen 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.120
 of pvc color chocolate 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.809
 with relation to the ceiling 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.520
 as we can see is a battery of 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.220
 kitchens of pardon of the suppers to the chest 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.900
 and in this case, we can see that here 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.250
 we have one what there is a door 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.410
 We have a skull type bar but 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.980
 the here the particularity of this kitchen 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.380
 is that it has a frame 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.550
 of board type door what do you mean 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.850
 that what is the framework if the framework from 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.010
 about 6 centimeters and what is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.860
 this part calls you board type because 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.860
 the whole panel this is going a little bit 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.800
 what happens is that startle excels 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.730
 the view to the door and the one for the group 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.730
 committed is that this is going to happen 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.930
 well, it is far superior to any other 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.120
 kind of view that is smooth in this case 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.970
 I'm going to proceed to open a door like 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.610
 come you are they have three 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.460
 divisions that is would be the shelves 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.130
 white background is good that I do you well 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.870
 strong here you can see the screws by 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.210
 the back comes a plate 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.630
 super strong metal that this is the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.479
 pantry of the field of the bell 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.180
 bell is why it is a little shorter 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.090
 precisely because here goes the bell and 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.750
 here over here, I can proceed to 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.939
 open another door too and in this case 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.460
 well the bar handle this case will 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.030
 We call this type of cupboard cupboard 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.039
 blind because blind because 30 centimeters 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.530
 they are together you can see my hand 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:59.380
 here the cupboard arrives 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.960
 that is is more to the bottom of 30 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.470
 centimeters is going to be blind does it mean 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.030
 that we take advantage of every centimeter 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.210
 square 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.510
 slowly from your kitchen and then and it's very 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.970
 functional and it looks very very aesthetic 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.840
 then I hope with this then 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.960
 we can appreciate what this is 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.870
 this type of cuisine and here finally 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.820
 we have dinner if these are fixed 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.460
 these are the rooms in the views by 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.220
 down the traditional depth of the 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.890
 dinner is 30 centimeters however here 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.380
 we have a 60-centimeter cupboard 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.470
 depth what does it mean here that 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.260
 here we have here below in this part of 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.720
 here below the floor we have one what is 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.120
 the refrigerator and this part then you're 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.280
 deep cupboard flame is the only 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.330
 cupboard that has 60 centimeters of 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.770
 depth 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.730
 and with this we have concluded 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.480
 later this kitchen we are going to 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.920
 put a decorative molding type pvc 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.130
 also of a coordinated color is a 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.180
 crown type molding and then it's still going 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.450
 to give a king then a real ceo or better 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.150
 view this to this kitchen then without more 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.500
 for the moment then we'll see each other in the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.500
 next video thanks
