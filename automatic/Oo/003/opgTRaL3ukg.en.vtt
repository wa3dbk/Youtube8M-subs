 the increase in the price of fuel 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.920
 super unleaded and gas one of 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.959
 mentioned concerns indicating 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.750
 However, this increase could not 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.260
 no case constitute an obstacle to its 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.720
 anti-poverty policy 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.709
 the price increase of the super and the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.470
 gas is not a surprise measure that's 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.599
 a measure that should have been taken as soon as 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.310
 our arrival to business 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.030
 that is to say in May 2011 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.319
 maybe we should have 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.629
 communicate to this word malignant because the 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.250
 electricity sector was on the verge of 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.430
 gulf it had to take action 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.459
 restructuring at the level of this 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.739
 entity is then sailing 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.140
 how to lighten the weight of the measures to 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.069
 take on the most people 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:11.520
 poor and that's what we did 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.690
 did not hit the price of 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:19.230
 diesel did not hit the price of 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.040
 kerosene we hold to the 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.710

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.510
 and to take targeted measures 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.680
 different so that this solidarity 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:35.130
 reinforces my ratings of the most expensive 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.290
