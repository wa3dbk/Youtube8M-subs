now<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:29.939> thing<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.179> will<00:00:30.359> point<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.720> about<00:00:30.840> LED

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
now one thing I will point out about LED

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.229 
now one thing I will point out about LED
lighting<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.700> color<00:00:32.969> temperature

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
lighting is that the color temperature

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.150 
lighting is that the color temperature
can<00:00:33.690> vary<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.170> manufacturer<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
can vary from manufacturer to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.280 
can vary from manufacturer to
manufacturer<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.510> usually<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.020> more

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
manufacturer and it's usually the more

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.440 
manufacturer and it's usually the more
expensive<00:00:37.920> brands<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.670> more

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
expensive brands that have a more

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.299 
expensive brands that have a more
reliable<00:00:39.809> color<00:00:40.290> temperature<00:00:40.800> just

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
reliable color temperature just

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
reliable color temperature just
something<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.700> keep<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.000> mind<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.870> enough

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
something to keep in mind but enough

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.619 
something to keep in mind but enough
about<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.469> I've<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> great<00:00:44.700> tip<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.059> LED

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
about that I've got a great tip for LED

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.850 
about that I've got a great tip for LED
lighting<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.559> give<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.829> great

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
lighting that will give you great

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.940 
lighting that will give you great
results<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.789> save<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> couple<00:00:48.780> bucks<00:00:49.200> now

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

regardless<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.820> lighting<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.420> some

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
regardless of your lighting at some

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.360 
regardless of your lighting at some
point<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.289> probably<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.010> need<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
point you're probably going to need to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.369 
point you're probably going to need to
diffuse<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> light<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> right

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
diffuse that light just to get the right

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
diffuse that light just to get the right
amount<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.340> soften<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.940> light<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> little

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
amount or to soften your light a little

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.410 
amount or to soften your light a little
bit<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:58.430> traditional<00:00:59.430> diffusion<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
bit now traditional diffusion can be a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.900 
bit now traditional diffusion can be a
little<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:00.870> expensive<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.710> maybe<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.879> just

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
little bit expensive or maybe you just

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
little bit expensive or maybe you just
don't<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.390> enough<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.710> particular<00:01:05.040> day

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
don't have enough on that particular day

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.359 
don't have enough on that particular day
well<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> worry<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.200> solution<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
well not to worry the solution is in

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.210 
well not to worry the solution is in
your<00:01:08.520> kitchen<00:01:08.930> because<00:01:09.930> LED<00:01:10.380> lights<00:01:10.650> run<00:01:10.920> cool

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
your kitchen because LED lights run cool

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.460 
your kitchen because LED lights run cool
you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.909> use<00:01:12.150> average<00:01:12.390> run-of-the-mill

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you can use average run-of-the-mill

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.999 
you can use average run-of-the-mill
wax<00:01:14.310> paper<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.939> diffuse<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.049> lights<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
wax paper to diffuse your lights and it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
wax paper to diffuse your lights and it
will<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.369> melt<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.150> whether<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.570> 1<00:01:18.960> sheet<00:01:19.229> 2

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
look at what my wax paper diffuser will

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460 
look at what my wax paper diffuser will
do<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:29.549> LED<00:01:29.970> lights<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.930> here's<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.229> shot

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
do for your LED lights now here's a shot

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
do for your LED lights now here's a shot
with<00:01:31.619> no<00:01:31.860> diffusion<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> light<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
with no diffusion just the light it's a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.539 
with no diffusion just the light it's a
little<00:01:34.049> bit<00:01:34.200> harsh<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.070> might<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.369> what

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
little bit harsh but it might be what
