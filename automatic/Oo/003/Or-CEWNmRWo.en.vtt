the V 51 has many details worked out for

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
accessibility but how are the internals

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.949 
accessibility but how are the internals
so<00:03:30.860> let's<00:03:31.160> get<00:03:31.340> inside<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:32.360> hard<00:03:32.570> drive<00:03:32.750> cage

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
so let's get inside the hard drive cage

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.890 
so let's get inside the hard drive cage
design<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:33.620> interesting<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.150> elevated<00:03:35.720> and

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
design is interesting it is elevated and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.750 
design is interesting it is elevated and
does<00:03:36.170> not<00:03:36.350> make<00:03:36.590> contact<00:03:36.620> with<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> floor<00:03:37.520> I

think<00:03:38.180> this<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.480> brilliant

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
think this is brilliant

way I found this to work if you attach

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:09.679 
way I found this to work if you attach
the<00:05:07.769> cable<00:05:08.099> first<00:05:08.339> and<00:05:08.610> then<00:05:09.119> push<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.479> drive

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:09.689 
the cable first and then push the drive

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.199 
the cable first and then push the drive
caddy<00:05:09.959> in<00:05:10.289> but<00:05:11.279> that<00:05:11.309> doesn't<00:05:11.969> really<00:05:12.119> look

it<00:05:36.029> is<00:05:36.329> almost<00:05:36.749> non-existent<00:05:37.069> in<00:05:38.069> the<00:05:38.129> Vee<00:05:38.459> 51

there<00:05:39.749> are<00:05:39.869> only<00:05:39.989> a<00:05:40.139> few<00:05:40.439> cable<00:05:40.829> tie<00:05:40.949> points

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
there are only a few cable tie points

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:44.489 
but that's it

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:46.040

so<00:05:44.819> there's<00:05:45.029> no<00:05:45.119> way<00:05:45.239> to<00:05:45.269> clean<00:05:45.599> up<00:05:45.749> anything

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050
