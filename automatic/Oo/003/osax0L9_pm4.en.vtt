00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.069 
vision is 98 why i say 98 caring is very
good<00:04:06.099> because<00:04:06.639> that's<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.209> stat<00:04:07.449> that<00:04:07.479> makes<00:04:07.930> it

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
good because that's a stat that makes it

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.420 
good because that's a stat that makes it
so<00:04:08.229> it<00:04:08.319> doesn't<00:04:08.349> he<00:04:08.709> doesn't<00:04:08.829> fumble<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.400> ball

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
so it doesn't he doesn't fumble the ball

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.189 
so it doesn't he doesn't fumble the ball
a<00:04:09.609> lot<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.000> when<00:04:10.569> you're<00:04:10.720> looking<00:04:10.750> for<00:04:11.169> a

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
a lot so when you're looking for a

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.949 
a lot so when you're looking for a
halfback<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.949> really<00:04:12.190> want<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.430> look<00:04:12.579> at

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
halfback you really want to look at

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.659 
halfback you really want to look at
speed<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:14.229> guess<00:04:14.440> strength<00:04:14.919> and<00:04:15.190> then

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
speed I guess strength and then

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.099 
speed I guess strength and then
essentially<00:04:16.239> doesn't<00:04:16.539> show<00:04:16.630> here<00:04:16.840> but<00:04:16.989> when

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
essentially doesn't show here but when

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.319 
essentially doesn't show here but when
you<00:04:17.169> go<00:04:17.289> on<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.470> big<00:04:17.680> stats<00:04:18.180> trucking<00:04:19.180> is<00:04:19.299> a

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
you go on the big stats trucking is a

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.449 
you go on the big stats trucking is a
big<00:04:19.539> one<00:04:19.690> as<00:04:19.840> well<00:04:20.019> and<00:04:20.289> caring<00:04:20.799> caring<00:04:21.099> is<00:04:21.370> the

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
big one as well and caring caring is the

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.460 
big one as well and caring caring is the
one<00:04:21.579> so<00:04:21.729> he<00:04:21.760> doesn't<00:04:21.940> form<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.360> ball<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.539> lot<00:04:22.780> so

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
one so he doesn't form the ball a lot so

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.159 
one so he doesn't form the ball a lot so
yeah<00:04:23.590> let's<00:04:23.800> go<00:04:23.919> ahead<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.659> compare<00:04:25.659> him<00:04:25.900> to

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
yeah let's go ahead and compare him to

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.379 
yeah let's go ahead and compare him to
Bo<00:04:26.409> Jackson<00:04:27.039> that's<00:04:27.190> basically<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.120> main

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
Bo Jackson that's basically the main

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.649 
Bo Jackson that's basically the main
attraction<00:04:29.099> about<00:04:30.099> this<00:04:30.310> card<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:30.909> let's<00:04:31.479> go

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
attraction about this card so let's go

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:32.770 
attraction about this card so let's go
ahead<00:04:31.690> and

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
ahead and

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.650 
ahead and
go<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.020> lineup<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.760> look<00:04:35.760> at<00:04:35.880> Bo<00:04:36.120> Jackson

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
go to the lineup and look at Bo Jackson

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.960 
go to the lineup and look at Bo Jackson
so<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:37.650> says<00:04:37.920> Harris<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.430> there<00:04:38.580> just<00:04:38.760> because

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
like 15 on the console as well because

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.260 
like 15 on the console as well because
these<00:04:52.500> stats<00:04:52.800> are<00:04:52.950> insane<00:04:53.220> look<00:04:54.030> at<00:04:54.120> Bo

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270

Jackson's<00:04:54.840> are<00:04:54.930> all<00:04:55.110> like<00:04:55.440> 97<00:04:56.070> plus<00:04:56.520> for<00:04:57.270> the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
Jackson's are all like 97 plus for the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.870 
Jackson's are all like 97 plus for the
first<00:04:57.630> row<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.170> then<00:04:58.350> as<00:04:58.500> Louis<00:04:58.800> that's<00:04:58.980> in<00:04:59.190> 92

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
first row and then as Louis that's in 92

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.730 
first row and then as Louis that's in 92
and<00:05:00.180> that's<00:05:00.720> just<00:05:00.810> elusiveness<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.620> it's

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
and that's just elusiveness and it's

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.880 
and that's just elusiveness and it's
catches<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.310> 93<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.990> that's<00:05:04.170> really<00:05:04.410> really

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
catches in 93 so that's really really

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.370 
catches in 93 so that's really really
crazy<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.580> in<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.240> console<00:05:06.750> they<00:05:07.080> get<00:05:07.260> to

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
crazy and in the console they get to

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.110 
crazy and in the console they get to
throw<00:05:07.620> their<00:05:08.100> hat<00:05:08.310> back<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.760> throw<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.090> ball

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
throw their hat back and throw the ball

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.060 
throw their hat back and throw the ball
so<00:05:09.840> bold<00:05:10.080> Jackson<00:05:10.440> actually<00:05:10.680> has<00:05:10.770> some<00:05:10.890> really

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
so bold Jackson actually has some really

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.490 
so bold Jackson actually has some really
great<00:05:11.550> throwing<00:05:11.940> as<00:05:12.180> well<00:05:12.690> for<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.170> running

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
great throwing as well for a running

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.960 
great throwing as well for a running
back<00:05:13.650> but<00:05:13.920> let's<00:05:14.100> see<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.700> comparison

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
back but let's see the comparison

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.880 
back but let's see the comparison
between<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.570> beast<00:05:15.870> mode<00:05:16.110> Marshawn<00:05:16.620> Lynch

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
between the beast mode Marshawn Lynch

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.030 
between the beast mode Marshawn Lynch
and<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.760> bo<00:05:17.880> Jackson<00:05:18.420> so<00:05:19.380> I<00:05:19.410> know<00:05:19.560> most<00:05:19.890> of

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
and the bo Jackson so I know most of

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.220 
and the bo Jackson so I know most of
it's<00:05:20.190> going<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:20.400> be<00:05:20.460> read<00:05:20.700> beside<00:05:21.180> two<00:05:21.840> things

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
it's going to be read beside two things

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.650 
it's going to be read beside two things
I<00:05:22.470> think<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.830> was<00:05:22.890> two<00:05:23.130> or<00:05:23.310> three<00:05:23.580> things<00:05:23.850> so

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
I think it was two or three things so

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.470 
I think it was two or three things so
yeah<00:05:25.100> Marshawn<00:05:26.100> Lynch<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.670> beast<00:05:27.030> mode<00:05:27.270> one

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
yeah Marshawn Lynch the beast mode one

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.380 
yeah Marshawn Lynch the beast mode one
has<00:05:27.690> 99<00:05:28.200> trucking<00:05:29.130> so<00:05:29.730> that<00:05:30.000> is<00:05:30.150> pretty

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
has 99 trucking so that is pretty

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.010 
has 99 trucking so that is pretty
impressive<00:05:30.540> and<00:05:32.150> everything<00:05:33.150> else<00:05:33.360> his

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
impressive and everything else his

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.490 
impressive and everything else his
catcher<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:34.470> not<00:05:34.590> as<00:05:34.710> good<00:05:34.860> as<00:05:34.950> Bo<00:05:35.100> Jackson<00:05:35.550> 76

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
catcher is not as good as Bo Jackson 76

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.750 
catcher is not as good as Bo Jackson 76
but<00:05:37.500> his<00:05:38.390> caring<00:05:39.390> is<00:05:39.510> better<00:05:39.750> like<00:05:39.960> I<00:05:40.110> said<00:05:40.380> and

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
but his caring is better like I said and

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.390 
but his caring is better like I said and
then<00:05:41.760> yeah<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:42.960> that's<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.470> Bo<00:05:43.710> Jackson<00:05:44.220> or

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
then yeah so that's the Bo Jackson or

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.460 
pretty much blows it out of the water
and<00:06:14.780> unfortunately<00:06:15.780> i<00:06:15.840> don't<00:06:15.930> think<00:06:16.170> i<00:06:16.230> have

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
and unfortunately i don't think i have

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.650 
and unfortunately i don't think i have
the<00:06:16.500> base<00:06:17.100> card<00:06:17.460> Marshawn<00:06:17.880> Lynch<00:06:18.120> no<00:06:18.390> I<00:06:18.420> don't

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660

have<00:06:18.780> it<00:06:18.960> no<00:06:19.080> more<00:06:19.230> but<00:06:19.980> yeah<00:06:20.100> you<00:06:20.160> can

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
have it no more but yeah you can

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.070 
have it no more but yeah you can
obviously<00:06:20.700> know<00:06:21.060> that<00:06:21.270> this<00:06:21.450> beast<00:06:21.750> mode<00:06:21.960> is

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
obviously know that this beast mode is

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.570
