now<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.859> like<00:00:05.250> room<00:00:05.520> games<00:00:05.819> I'm<00:00:06.690> not<00:00:06.839> opposed<00:00:07.230> to

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.919 
now I like room games I'm not opposed to
room<00:00:07.680> games<00:00:07.980> but<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.490> room<00:00:09.210> game<00:00:09.480> that's<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
room games but a room game that's a

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.600 
room games but a room game that's a
simulation<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.889> don't<00:00:11.160> know<00:00:11.219> how<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.400> feel

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
games can be fun a simulation room game

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.099 
games can be fun a simulation room game
it's<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.490> gonna<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.789> too<00:00:21.060> realistic<00:00:21.720> you

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it's just gonna be too realistic you

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.570 
it's just gonna be too realistic you
know<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:23.160> want<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.369> feel<00:00:23.519> like

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
know it's like I don't want to feel like

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
elements in the room based video game

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.830 
elements in the room based video game
but<00:00:31.710> let's<00:00:31.830> try<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.809> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
but let's try this out and see this is a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.549 
but let's try this out and see this is a
good<00:00:34.200> room<00:00:34.530> simulator<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
good room simulator or not so we have a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.459 
good room simulator or not so we have a
couch<00:00:38.309> over<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.200> don't<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.350> I'm

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
couch over here I don't know if I'm

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.500 
couch over here I don't know if I'm
standing<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:41.940> walking<00:00:42.180> through

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
standing on it or if I'm walking through

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
standing on it or if I'm walking through
the<00:00:42.690> couch<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.260> I'm<00:00:43.649> stuck<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> couch

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the couch but I'm stuck in the couch

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.110 
the couch but I'm stuck in the couch
okay

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
okay

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.029 
okay
and<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:45.539> way<00:00:45.660> over<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and now way over here we have like a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
and now way over here we have like a
little<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.360> can't<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
little thing I can't see what that is

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.189 
little thing I can't see what that is
maybe<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> VHS<00:00:50.489> player<00:00:51.199> plasma

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
maybe it's like a VHS player plasma

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.229 
maybe it's like a VHS player plasma
vision<00:00:52.530> TV<00:00:52.860> pretty<00:00:53.160> big<00:00:53.399> TV<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.210> of

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
vision TV pretty big TV that's kind of

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.170 
vision TV pretty big TV that's kind of
cool<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.559> already<00:00:56.190> I'm<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.730> completely

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
cool see and already I'm I'm completely

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
cool see and already I'm I'm completely
out<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> simulation<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> was

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
out of the simulation this is what I was

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.799 
out of the simulation this is what I was
talking<00:00:59.129> about<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.090> can't<00:01:00.329> make<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> room

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
talking about like you can't make a room

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
talking about like you can't make a room
simulator<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.710> put<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> vending<00:01:02.609> machine<00:01:02.670> in

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
simulator and put a vending machine in

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.939 
simulator and put a vending machine in
the<00:01:03.270> room<00:01:03.600> where<00:01:04.110> there's<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.350> bed<00:01:04.619> where<00:01:04.860> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the room where there's a bed where you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:05.479 
the room where there's a bed where you
sleep

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
sleep

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
sleep
no<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.119> has<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> vending<00:01:06.840> machine<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.260> their

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
no one has a vending machine in their

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
no one has a vending machine in their
room<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.610> not<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.790> realistic<00:01:09.600> simulation

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
room this is not a realistic simulation

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
room this is not a realistic simulation
this<00:01:10.710> completely<00:01:11.189> takes<00:01:11.640> me<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> game

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
this completely takes me out of the game

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.560 
this completely takes me out of the game
this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.140> unnecessary<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.450> just

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
this is unnecessary it's just it's just

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
this is unnecessary it's just it's just
flash<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.159> adage<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.909> non-stop

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
flash it's like the adage just non-stop

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.420 
flash it's like the adage just non-stop
flash<00:01:18.780> into<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> game<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.189> just

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
flash into the game this this is just

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
flash into the game this this is just
like<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> Call<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.030> Duty<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.750> room<00:01:22.049> games

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
like the Call of Duty of room games

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.969 
like the Call of Duty of room games
basically<00:01:23.119> there's<00:01:24.119> no<00:01:24.390> no<00:01:24.900> reason<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
basically there's no no reason to have a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.230 
basically there's no no reason to have a
a<00:01:26.790> soft<00:01:27.750> drink<00:01:28.110> machine<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.060> room

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
a soft drink machine and now in the room

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.630 
a soft drink machine and now in the room
simulating<00:01:30.780> game<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.310> better<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
simulating game this is the better of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.830 
simulating game this is the better of
course<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.360> mean<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
course this is I mean this is the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
course this is I mean this is the
connects<00:01:34.200> thing<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.100> would<00:01:35.250> expect<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.909> room

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
connects thing I would expect in a room

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
connects thing I would expect in a room
game<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.869> bed<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:39.780> vending<00:01:40.290> machine<00:01:40.350> just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
game a bed but a vending machine just

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.179 
game a bed but a vending machine just
doesn't<00:01:41.130> work<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.759> all

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
doesn't work at all

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.029 
doesn't work at all
and<00:01:43.969> of<00:01:44.210> course<00:01:44.509> here's<00:01:45.140> up<00:01:45.409> here's<00:01:45.859> some

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
and of course here's up here's some

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.700 
and of course here's up here's some

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
the kitchen but I feel like this is like

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.440 
the kitchen but I feel like this is like
it's<00:01:58.159> like<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.399> mixture<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.149> bunch<00:01:59.179> of

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's like a mixture of a bunch of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.169 
it's like a mixture of a bunch of
different<00:01:59.600> rooms<00:02:00.079> like<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.859> should<00:02:01.250> be<00:02:01.490> the

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
different rooms like this should be the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.330 
different rooms like this should be the
living<00:02:02.390> room<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:03.020> should<00:02:03.319> be<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:03.890> dining

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
living room this should be the dining

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.130 
living room this should be the dining
room<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.729> should<00:02:04.909> be<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.149> bedroom<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.780> can't

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
room this should be the bedroom it can't

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.339 
room this should be the bedroom it can't
be<00:02:06.409> one<00:02:06.740> room<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:08.179> top<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.869> vending

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
be one room and on top of that a vending

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.949 
be one room and on top of that a vending
machine<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.340> room<00:02:10.849> it's<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:11.720> a

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
machine in the room it's just a

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.770 
machine in the room it's just a
completely<00:02:12.590> unrealistic<00:02:13.569> simulation<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.660> a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
completely unrealistic simulation of a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.830 
completely unrealistic simulation of a
room<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:16.250> only<00:02:16.430> thing<00:02:16.819> really<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.180> saves<00:02:17.599> it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
room the only thing really that saves it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.750 
room the only thing really that saves it
is<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.140> fact<00:02:18.379> that<00:02:18.560> there's<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.860> door<00:02:19.160> most

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
is the fact that there's a door most

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.690 
is the fact that there's a door most
rooms<00:02:20.120> tend<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.599> have<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> door<00:02:21.280> not<00:02:22.280> all<00:02:22.519> of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
rooms tend to have a door not all of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.580 
rooms tend to have a door not all of
them<00:02:22.849> but<00:02:23.000> I've<00:02:23.150> noticed<00:02:23.360> any<00:02:23.870> room<00:02:24.170> I've<00:02:24.319> been

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
them but I've noticed any room I've been

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.009 
them but I've noticed any room I've been
in<00:02:24.769> does<00:02:25.489> have<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> door<00:02:26.060> or<00:02:26.299> at<00:02:26.420> least<00:02:26.660> some

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
in does have a door or at least some

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.680 
in does have a door or at least some
kind<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.319> hole<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:28.190> come<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.879> out<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.329> it

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
kind of hole to come in and out of it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.500 
kind of hole to come in and out of it
see<00:02:30.319> yeah<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.769> just<00:02:31.010> um<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.239> very

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
see yeah this is just um this is a very

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.539 
see yeah this is just um this is a very
disappointing<00:02:32.989> simulation<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.069> room<00:02:34.280> I

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
disappointing simulation of a room I

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.479 
disappointing simulation of a room I
give<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.329> a<00:02:35.510> um<00:02:35.769> official<00:02:36.769> stand<00:02:37.040> burden<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
give it a um official stand burden and

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.119 
give it a um official stand burden and
rating<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.030> nine<00:02:38.720> point<00:02:39.079> three<00:02:39.200> out<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.769> ten

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
rating of a nine point three out of ten
