and weird a little bit different than

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.310 
and weird a little bit different than
normal<00:00:16.640> but<00:00:17.240> it<00:00:17.359> is<00:00:17.480> a<00:00:17.510> tech<00:00:17.779> based<00:00:17.960> video

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
normal but it is a tech based video

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.529 
normal but it is a tech based video
which<00:00:19.279> we<00:00:19.460> haven't<00:00:19.640> had<00:00:19.850> on<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.060> channel<00:00:20.360> in<00:00:20.480> a

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
which we haven't had on the channel in a

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.630 
which we haven't had on the channel in a
little<00:00:20.840> while<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:21.289> I<00:00:22.130> thought<00:00:22.430> you<00:00:22.550> guys

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
little while and I thought you guys

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.550 
little while and I thought you guys
might<00:00:22.700> be<00:00:23.030> interested<00:00:23.450> those<00:00:24.230> of<00:00:24.380> you<00:00:24.440> who

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
might be interested those of you who

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.250 
might be interested those of you who
actually<00:00:24.740> build<00:00:25.730> computers<00:00:26.180> or<00:00:26.360> have<00:00:26.869> wanted

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
actually build computers or have wanted

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.040 
actually build computers or have wanted
to<00:00:27.400> something<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:28.520> you<00:00:28.610> might<00:00:29.020> learn<00:00:30.020> from

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
to something that you might learn from

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.240 
to something that you might learn from
this<00:00:30.640> specific<00:00:31.640> video<00:00:31.970> however<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:33.250> system

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
this specific video however this system

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.720 
this specific video however this system
for<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.489> most<00:00:34.640> part<00:00:35.000> is<00:00:35.210> out<00:00:35.629> of<00:00:35.660> date<00:00:35.930> as<00:00:36.170> of

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
for the most part is out of date as of

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.870 
for the most part is out of date as of
currently<00:00:37.730> because<00:00:38.320> just<00:00:39.320> how<00:00:39.470> you<00:00:40.430> know<00:00:40.550> the

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
currently because just how you know the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.060 
currently because just how you know the
technology<00:00:41.750> is<00:00:41.870> constantly<00:00:42.050> improving<00:00:42.470> and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
technology is constantly improving and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.540 
technology is constantly improving and
things<00:00:43.610> are<00:00:44.170> are<00:00:45.170> just<00:00:45.559> overlapping<00:00:46.250> each

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
things are are just overlapping each

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.270 
things are are just overlapping each
other<00:00:46.700> rapidly<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:47.660> anyways<00:00:48.350> let's<00:00:48.680> get<00:00:48.829> into

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
other rapidly so anyways let's get into

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.790 
other rapidly so anyways let's get into
the<00:00:50.000> problem<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.510> I'm<00:00:50.750> having<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:51.649> not

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
the problem that I'm having and it's not

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.799 
the problem that I'm having and it's not
really<00:00:51.980> a<00:00:52.100> problem<00:00:52.610> that<00:00:52.940> affects<00:00:53.059> the

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
really a problem that affects the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.170 
really a problem that affects the
computer<00:00:54.579> whatsoever<00:00:55.579> it's<00:00:55.790> just<00:00:55.969> an

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
computer whatsoever it's just an

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.720 
computer whatsoever it's just an
aesthetic<00:00:57.020> thing<00:00:57.200> I've<00:00:58.190> actually<00:00:58.550> two

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
mean it's quite an eyesore this SLI

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.140 
mean it's quite an eyesore this SLI
bridge<00:01:11.390> right<00:01:11.750> here<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.100> does<00:01:13.430> not<00:01:13.670> fit

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
bridge right here it just does not fit

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.510 
bridge right here it just does not fit
in<00:01:14.420> at<00:01:14.900> all<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:15.890> build<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.280> think<00:01:16.460> it

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
in at all to this build and I think it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.640 
in at all to this build and I think it
looks<00:01:16.700> pretty<00:01:16.820> industrial<00:01:17.479> this<00:01:17.630> build<00:01:17.840> it

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
looks pretty industrial this build it

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.440 
looks pretty industrial this build it
looks<00:01:18.830> really<00:01:19.070> clean<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:19.490> nice<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.390> I'm

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
looks really clean and nice and I'm

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.609 
looks really clean and nice and I'm
really<00:01:20.600> happy<00:01:20.930> with<00:01:21.110> it

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
really happy with it

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.859 
really happy with it
it's<00:01:22.310> just<00:01:22.520> that<00:01:22.640> this<00:01:22.820> thing<00:01:22.880> just<00:01:23.570> sticks

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
it's just that this thing just sticks

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.570 
it's just that this thing just sticks
out<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.350> thought<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.590> had<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.799> solution<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.369> went

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
out so I thought I had a solution I went

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.609 
out so I thought I had a solution I went
to<00:01:25.700> Nvidia's<00:01:26.450> website<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.110> went<00:01:27.290> ahead<00:01:27.350> and

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
to Nvidia's website and I went ahead and

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.219 
to Nvidia's website and I went ahead and
ordered<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:28.130> triple<00:01:28.880> SLI<00:01:29.180> bridge<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.900> single

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
ordered a triple SLI bridge and a single

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.200 
ordered a triple SLI bridge and a single
as<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> lie<00:01:30.590> bridge<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:30.979> see<00:01:31.130> which<00:01:31.250> one<00:01:31.400> worked

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
as a lie bridge to see which one worked

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.030 
as a lie bridge to see which one worked
better<00:01:32.509> because<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.229> triple<00:01:33.710> one<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:33.920> don't

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
better because the triple one you don't

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.280 
better because the triple one you don't
need<00:01:34.280> three<00:01:34.520> cards<00:01:35.000> it<00:01:35.630> just<00:01:35.900> gives<00:01:36.049> you<00:01:36.200> that

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
need three cards it just gives you that

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.990 
need three cards it just gives you that
extra<00:01:36.409> spacing<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:37.580> I'll<00:01:37.640> show<00:01:37.790> you<00:01:37.880> what<00:01:37.970> that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
extra spacing so I'll show you what that

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.810 
extra spacing so I'll show you what that
looks<00:01:38.270> like<00:01:38.360> on<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:39.409> back<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.490> don't<00:01:40.700> even

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
looks like on the back so you don't even

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.240 
looks like on the back so you don't even
need<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.030> fill<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.750> metal<00:01:42.049> slot<00:01:42.320> or<00:01:43.100> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
need to fill the metal slot or the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.070 
need to fill the metal slot or the
bottom<00:01:43.490> slot<00:01:43.610> even<00:01:43.970> which<00:01:44.270> would<00:01:44.540> look<00:01:44.689> really

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
bottom slot even which would look really

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.240 
bottom slot even which would look really
awkward<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:45.650> it<00:01:45.799> gives<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.189> extra

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
awkward but it gives you that extra

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.010 
awkward but it gives you that extra
space<00:01:46.700> in<00:01:46.909> case<00:01:47.060> your<00:01:47.270> cards<00:01:47.479> were<00:01:47.630> spaced<00:01:47.869> out

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
space in case your cards were spaced out

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.840 
space in case your cards were spaced out
and<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.229> thought<00:01:48.350> they<00:01:48.530> were<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:49.070> didn't<00:01:49.520> even<00:01:49.640> do

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
and I thought they were I didn't even do

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.660 
and I thought they were I didn't even do
any<00:01:50.060> research<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.840> just<00:01:51.020> got<00:01:51.200> him<00:01:51.400> which<00:01:52.400> was

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
any research I just got him which was

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.850 
any research I just got him which was
really<00:01:52.970> stupid<00:01:53.270> because<00:01:53.720> neither<00:01:54.079> of<00:01:54.560> these

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
really stupid because neither of these

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.550 
really stupid because neither of these
work<00:01:55.340> with<00:01:56.060> this<00:01:56.270> motherboard<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:56.900> AK<00:01:57.049> 79

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
work with this motherboard it's AK 79

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.310 
work with this motherboard it's AK 79
saber-tooth<00:01:58.100> from<00:01:58.880> Asus<00:01:59.299> and<00:01:59.509> because<00:02:00.110> of<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
saber-tooth from Asus and because of the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.080 
saber-tooth from Asus and because of the
spacing<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:01.189> allows<00:02:01.729> for<00:02:02.409> neither<00:02:03.409> of<00:02:03.799> these

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
spacing it allows for neither of these

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.160 
spacing it allows for neither of these
bridges<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.299> work<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.659> I'll<00:02:05.750> show<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:05.960> what

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
bridges to work so I'll show you what

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.899 
bridges to work so I'll show you what
that<00:02:06.290> mean<00:02:06.439> what<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:06.860> looks<00:02:07.100> like<00:02:07.159> so<00:02:07.280> you

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
that mean what that looks like so you

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.429 
that mean what that looks like so you
can<00:02:07.939> see<00:02:08.239> that<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.810> default<00:02:09.259> one<00:02:09.409> that

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:09.439 
can see that the the default one that

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.769 
can see that the the default one that
came<00:02:09.799> with<00:02:09.829> my<00:02:10.159> motherboard<00:02:10.489> fits<00:02:10.849> fine<00:02:11.090> but

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:11.779 
came with my motherboard fits fine but

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.430 
came with my motherboard fits fine but
when<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:11.989> take<00:02:12.200> up<00:02:12.439> this<00:02:13.279> one

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
when you take up this one

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.340 
when you take up this one
you<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:15.130> put<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.520> right<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.350> it's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
you you put it right there and it's

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.440 
you you put it right there and it's
plugging<00:02:17.980> into<00:02:18.160> right<00:02:18.760> underneath<00:02:19.240> which

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
plugging into right underneath which

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.930 
plugging into right underneath which
most<00:02:19.900> motherboards<00:02:20.410> would<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.580> would<00:02:21.760> work

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
most motherboards would that would work

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.750 
most motherboards would that would work
for<00:02:22.210> especially<00:02:22.510> like<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:24.030> AZ<00:02:25.140> 97<00:02:26.140> or<00:02:26.410> Z<00:02:26.770> 98<00:02:27.730> I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
for especially like a AZ 97 or Z 98 I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.570 
for especially like a AZ 97 or Z 98 I
believe<00:02:28.150> I'm<00:02:28.780> sorry<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.860> butchered<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.460> I

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
believe I'm sorry if I butchered that I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.800 
believe I'm sorry if I butchered that I
pretty<00:02:30.970> sure<00:02:31.180> that's<00:02:31.300> where<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:31.630> at<00:02:31.780> right

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
pretty sure that's where it's at right

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.190 
pretty sure that's where it's at right
now<00:02:32.110> or<00:02:32.530> yeah<00:02:33.630> yeah<00:02:34.630> I'm<00:02:34.840> pretty<00:02:34.960> sure<00:02:35.080> that's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
now or yeah yeah I'm pretty sure that's

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.870 
now or yeah yeah I'm pretty sure that's
where<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.710> anyways<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.550> guys<00:02:36.670> totally

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
where it is anyways you guys totally

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.550 
where it is anyways you guys totally
understand<00:02:37.240> what<00:02:37.360> I'm<00:02:37.450> talking<00:02:37.540> about<00:02:37.750> most

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
understand what I'm talking about most

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.710 
understand what I'm talking about most
motherboards<00:02:38.860> have<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.820> normal<00:02:40.090> spacing

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
motherboards have that normal spacing

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.960 
motherboards have that normal spacing
and<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:40.930> that's<00:02:41.080> what<00:02:41.230> these<00:02:41.380> are<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.970> but

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
and so that's what these are for but

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.040 
and so that's what these are for but
when<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.150> get<00:02:43.240> into<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.450> enthusiast

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
when you get into the enthusiast

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.840 
when you get into the enthusiast
platform<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.620> guess<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:44.950> changes<00:02:45.490> completely

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
platform I guess that changes completely

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.870 
platform I guess that changes completely
and<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.690> didn't<00:02:46.930> know<00:02:47.080> if<00:02:47.290> they<00:02:47.440> had<00:02:47.880> as

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and I didn't know if they had as

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.370 
and I didn't know if they had as
libraries<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.540> worked<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:49.870> obviously<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
libraries that worked for obviously the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.750 
libraries that worked for obviously the
one<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.680> came<00:02:50.860> with<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.130> was<00:02:51.220> gonna<00:02:51.460> work

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
one that came with it was gonna work

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.980 
one that came with it was gonna work
because<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.240> is<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.420> only<00:02:52.690> configuration

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
because this is the only configuration

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.680 
because this is the only configuration
that<00:02:53.470> an<00:02:53.620> SLI<00:02:54.090> will<00:02:55.090> work<00:02:55.330> in<00:02:55.540> this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
that an SLI will work in this

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.790 
that an SLI will work in this
motherboard<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.140> can't<00:02:56.290> put<00:02:56.470> one<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.710> the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
motherboard you can't put one in the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.610 
motherboard you can't put one in the
bottom<00:02:56.920> 16x<00:02:57.640> slots<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.150> not<00:02:58.360> SLI<00:02:59.050> compatible

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
bottom 16x slots it's not SLI compatible

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.350 
bottom 16x slots it's not SLI compatible
so<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.100> got<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.400> weird<00:03:00.640> spacing<00:03:01.240> in<00:03:01.330> between

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
so you got this weird spacing in between

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.020 
so you got this weird spacing in between
you<00:03:02.050> could<00:03:02.350> fit<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.860> Quadro<00:03:03.430> or<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.940> know

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
you could fit like a Quadro or you know

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.900 
you could fit like a Quadro or you know
some<00:03:04.630> single<00:03:05.380> slot<00:03:06.070> card<00:03:06.340> but<00:03:06.490> these<00:03:06.580> are<00:03:06.730> dual

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
some single slot card but these are dual

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.640 
some single slot card but these are dual
slot<00:03:07.120> cards<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.600> they<00:03:07.660> don't<00:03:07.810> really<00:03:07.960> allow

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
slot cards and they don't really allow

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.550 
slot cards and they don't really allow
for<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.850> work<00:03:09.880> properly<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.410> then

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
for that to work properly so and then

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.140 
for that to work properly so and then
again<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.100> got<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.460> one<00:03:12.700> which<00:03:12.730> has<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
again you got this one which has the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.560 
again you got this one which has the
same<00:03:13.390> spacing<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:14.290> as<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.790> guy<00:03:16.000> it's<00:03:16.330> just

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
same spacing as as this guy it's just

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.960 
same spacing as as this guy it's just
extended<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.130> can<00:03:18.280> sort<00:03:18.520> of<00:03:18.640> see<00:03:18.820> what

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
extended so you can sort of see what

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.300 
extended so you can sort of see what
that<00:03:19.090> looks<00:03:19.390> like<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.709> it's<00:03:20.890> just<00:03:21.040> got<00:03:21.160> an

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
that looks like so it's just got an

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.670 
that looks like so it's just got an
extra<00:03:21.790> one<00:03:21.970> added<00:03:22.450> on<00:03:22.570> then<00:03:22.930> also<00:03:23.380> another

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
extra one added on then also another

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.740 
extra one added on then also another
layer<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.580> know<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.730> support<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.360> triple

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
layer you know to support that triple

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.930 
layer you know to support that triple
SLI<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.570> it's<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.800> same<00:03:30.040> issue<00:03:30.459> and

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
SLI and so it's it's the same issue and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.550 
SLI and so it's it's the same issue and
it<00:03:31.090> doesn't<00:03:31.390> work<00:03:31.510> at<00:03:31.690> all<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.050> end<00:03:32.260> up<00:03:32.380> with

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
it doesn't work at all you end up with

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.290 
it doesn't work at all you end up with
the<00:03:32.680> graphics<00:03:33.040> card<00:03:33.220> being<00:03:33.459> down<00:03:33.730> here<00:03:34.150> and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
the graphics card being down here and

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.720 
the graphics card being down here and
one<00:03:34.450> up<00:03:34.600> here<00:03:34.930> so<00:03:35.530> you've<00:03:35.650> got<00:03:35.800> like<00:03:36.010> two<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:36.700> a

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
one up here so you've got like two and a

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.320

half slots which is really awkward and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.630 
half slots which is really awkward and
doesn't<00:03:41.050> look<00:03:41.170> good<00:03:41.320> so<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.100> so<00:03:42.400> we've<00:03:42.520> got

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
doesn't look good so so so we've got

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.280 
doesn't look good so so so we've got
these<00:03:42.850> two<00:03:43.060> things<00:03:43.090> here<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:44.140> don't

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
these two things here and that don't

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.500 
these two things here and that don't
even<00:03:44.410> fit<00:03:44.730> right<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:45.760> it's<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.209> kind<00:03:46.450> of

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
even fit right and it's just kind of

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.880 
even fit right and it's just kind of
frustrating<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.140> was<00:03:47.260> like<00:03:47.380> ok<00:03:47.590> well<00:03:47.769> that

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
frustrating and I was like ok well that

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.259 
frustrating and I was like ok well that
sucks<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:48.370> we<00:03:48.700> got<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:48.910> get<00:03:49.000> rid<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.150> these

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
sucks so we got to get rid of these

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.790 
sucks so we got to get rid of these
eventually<00:03:49.959> because<00:03:50.440> they<00:03:50.530> don't<00:03:50.680> do

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
eventually because they don't do

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.550 
eventually because they don't do
anything<00:03:50.980> for<00:03:51.220> me<00:03:51.340> but<00:03:52.150> another<00:03:53.050> thing<00:03:53.410> is

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
anything for me but another thing is

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.530 
anything for me but another thing is
these<00:03:53.680> are<00:03:53.830> 780ti<00:03:54.550> so<00:03:54.940> if<00:03:55.000> you're<00:03:55.120> unfamiliar

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
these are 780ti so if you're unfamiliar

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.470 
these are 780ti so if you're unfamiliar
with<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.840> build<00:03:56.080> and<00:03:57.300> they're<00:03:58.300> awesome

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
with the build and they're awesome

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.850 
with the build and they're awesome
they're<00:03:58.720> absolutely<00:03:59.230> awesome<00:03:59.380> however<00:03:59.739> they

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
they're absolutely awesome however they

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.780 
they're absolutely awesome however they
don't<00:03:59.920> make<00:04:00.100> them<00:04:00.220> anymore<00:04:00.370> have<00:04:00.700> been

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
don't make them anymore have been

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.080 
don't make them anymore have been
replaced<00:04:01.320> by<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.380> 980<00:04:02.890> than<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.250> 980<00:04:03.610> I<00:04:03.820> and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
replaced by the 980 than the 980 I and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.759 
replaced by the 980 than the 980 I and
so<00:04:04.209> they<00:04:04.330> stopped<00:04:04.540> making<00:04:04.959> everything<00:04:05.560> and

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
so they stopped making everything and

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:06.570 
so they stopped making everything and
anything

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
anything

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.820 
anything
along<00:04:07.390> with<00:04:07.510> 780<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.200> bottom<00:04:08.440> one<00:04:08.470> was<00:04:08.800> a

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
along with 780 is the bottom one was a

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.620 
along with 780 is the bottom one was a
second<00:04:09.459> hand<00:04:09.640> when<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.820> had<00:04:09.970> to<00:04:10.060> get<00:04:10.180> off<00:04:10.300> eBay

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
second hand when I had to get off eBay

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.120 
second hand when I had to get off eBay
because<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.200> couldn't<00:04:11.500> literally<00:04:11.800> find

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
because that you couldn't literally find

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.790 
because that you couldn't literally find
any<00:04:12.340> seven<00:04:12.640> 80s<00:04:12.970> anywhere<00:04:13.380> luckily<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.410> got<00:04:14.500> one

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
any seven 80s anywhere luckily I got one

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.240 
any seven 80s anywhere luckily I got one
by<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.570> reliable<00:04:16.570> person<00:04:17.109> who<00:04:17.470> had<00:04:17.769> just<00:04:18.040> used

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
by a reliable person who had just used

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.440 
by a reliable person who had just used
it<00:04:18.340> for<00:04:18.459> benchmarking<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.150> couple<00:04:19.419> weeks

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
it for benchmarking for a couple weeks

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.840 
it for benchmarking for a couple weeks
and<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:20.169> know<00:04:20.260> put<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.590> in<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.709> box<00:04:20.890> so<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.549> got<00:04:21.820> a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
and you know put it in a box so I got a

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.820 
and you know put it in a box so I got a
really<00:04:22.000> good<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:23.080> know<00:04:23.110> deal<00:04:23.410> with<00:04:23.500> that

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
really good you know deal with that

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.510 
really good you know deal with that
however<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:25.360> can't<00:04:25.570> find<00:04:25.919> back<00:04:26.919> plates<00:04:27.250> for

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
however you can't find back plates for

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.040 
however you can't find back plates for
them<00:04:27.610> either

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
them either

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.450 
them either
so<00:04:28.139> I've<00:04:28.199> got<00:04:28.349> a<00:04:28.379> backplate<00:04:28.800> on<00:04:28.830> top<00:04:29.159> one<00:04:29.370> and

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
so I've got a backplate on top one and

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.790 
so I've got a backplate on top one and
not<00:04:29.580> on<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:29.759> bottom<00:04:30.000> one<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.389> if<00:04:31.379> you<00:04:31.530> were<00:04:31.680> to

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
not on the bottom one and if you were to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.080 
not on the bottom one and if you were to
find<00:04:32.009> when<00:04:32.190> there<00:04:32.310> like<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> couple<00:04:32.909> hundred

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
find when there like a couple hundred

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.909 
find when there like a couple hundred
dollars<00:04:33.240> which<00:04:33.629> is<00:04:33.780> ridiculous<00:04:34.620> because<00:04:34.740> I

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
dollars which is ridiculous because I

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.200 
dollars which is ridiculous because I
literally<00:04:35.250> got<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.610> one<00:04:35.729> for<00:04:35.879> twenty-five

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
literally got that one for twenty-five

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.770 
literally got that one for twenty-five
dollars<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.970> there's<00:04:38.970> no<00:04:39.150> way<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:39.389> would<00:04:39.629> ever

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
dollars and there's no way I would ever

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.200 
dollars and there's no way I would ever
spend<00:04:40.319> a<00:04:40.650> couple<00:04:41.340> hundred<00:04:41.610> dollars<00:04:41.759> on<00:04:42.150> a

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
spend a couple hundred dollars on a

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.230 
spend a couple hundred dollars on a
backplate<00:04:43.050> which<00:04:43.259> does<00:04:43.530> nothing<00:04:44.240> basically

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
backplate which does nothing basically

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.580 
backplate which does nothing basically
except<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.840> know<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.960> little<00:04:46.259> bit<00:04:46.349> of<00:04:46.440> heat

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
except you know a little bit of heat

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.969 
except you know a little bit of heat
spreading<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.099> some<00:04:48.139> you<00:04:49.139> know<00:04:49.259> possibly

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
spreading and some you know possibly

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.520 
spreading and some you know possibly
some<00:04:50.970> structure<00:04:51.479> to<00:04:51.659> it<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:52.139> mean<00:04:52.229> it's<00:04:52.409> not

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
some structure to it I mean it's not

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.110 
some structure to it I mean it's not
like<00:04:52.680> these<00:04:52.830> graphics<00:04:53.340> cards<00:04:53.580> are<00:04:53.669> gonna<00:04:53.819> sag

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
like these graphics cards are gonna sag

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.119 
like these graphics cards are gonna sag
this<00:04:54.389> one's<00:04:54.569> almost<00:04:54.930> sitting<00:04:55.139> on<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.560> hard

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
this one's almost sitting on the hard

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.279 
this one's almost sitting on the hard
drive<00:04:56.400> okay<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.240> anyways<00:04:57.750> those<00:04:57.990> are<00:04:58.169> just

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
drive okay so anyways those are just

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.680 
drive okay so anyways those are just
some<00:04:58.470> first<00:04:58.740> world<00:04:59.009> issues<00:04:59.610> that<00:04:59.940> I<00:05:00.210> ran<00:05:00.659> into

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
some first world issues that I ran into

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.390 
some first world issues that I ran into
and<00:05:01.259> I<00:05:01.319> thought<00:05:01.500> maybe<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:01.949> guys<00:05:02.039> would<00:05:02.099> be

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
and I thought maybe you guys would be

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.279 
and I thought maybe you guys would be
interested<00:05:02.969> in<00:05:03.060> seeing<00:05:03.629> these<00:05:03.930> kind<00:05:04.229> of

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
interested in seeing these kind of

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.879 
interested in seeing these kind of
little<00:05:04.620> problems<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:06.139> so<00:05:07.139> if<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.620> guys<00:05:07.740> have

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
little problems and so if you guys have

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.469 
little problems and so if you guys have
any<00:05:08.099> fixes<00:05:08.520> then<00:05:08.699> also<00:05:08.879> that<00:05:09.150> would<00:05:09.210> be<00:05:09.330> cool

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
any fixes then also that would be cool

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.029 
any fixes then also that would be cool
to<00:05:09.719> know<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.169> then<00:05:10.440> we<00:05:10.560> could<00:05:10.680> kind<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:10.949> go

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
to know and then we could kind of go

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.379 
to know and then we could kind of go
through<00:05:11.099> the<00:05:11.340> process<00:05:11.789> together<00:05:11.969> and<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.240> could

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
just decided to run them separately so

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.680 
just decided to run them separately so
