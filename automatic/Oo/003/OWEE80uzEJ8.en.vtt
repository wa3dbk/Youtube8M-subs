00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
this I know there's a lot of guides out

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.560 
this I know there's a lot of guides out
there<00:00:17.310> online<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.699> kind<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.210> tell<00:00:18.420> you

there online that kind of tell you
what's<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:18.990> each<00:00:19.140> chamber

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
what's in each chamber

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.650 
what's in each chamber
how<00:00:20.490> many<00:00:20.670> chests<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.150> all<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.390> kind<00:00:21.600> of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.070 
stuff but I figured it would be a lot
easier<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.029> actually<00:00:24.150> show<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.240 
easier if you actually show if I
actually<00:00:25.230> showed<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.590> where<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.890> ledges

actually showed you where the ledges
were<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.029> eliminate<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.570> time<00:00:27.900> where

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
were kind of eliminate that time where

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.210 
were kind of eliminate that time where
you<00:00:28.380> go<00:00:28.500> through<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> process<00:00:29.160> of

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you go through the process of

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.830 
you go through the process of
elimination<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.269> know<00:00:30.390> all<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.660> wonderful

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
