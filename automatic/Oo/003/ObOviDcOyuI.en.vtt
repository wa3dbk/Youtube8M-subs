00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:05.410
 the operation with Inca has made a professional edition 2 points 1 2 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.450
 it's pretty simple 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.910
 it's about opening a virtual file in this case we're going to take 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.709
 these options first 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.769
 p the files you choose are a pretty poor resolution 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.150
 that's why we're working fast, we're supposed to operate with a 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:23.960
 software 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.579
 Therefore, with a much more extensive file or at least 300 AD and 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.579
 exit 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.060
 per cent of convenient that we have previously made adjustments 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.820
 to the image of your return will be contrast brightness albeit a few percent 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.220
 and minimal controls are this program 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.460
 for example to handle contrast aspects of the original image 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.750
 cd and eventually some saturation that will always be convenient min 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.370
 work p with the file previously manipulated photoshop or similar program 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.780
 in relation to these values 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.580
 to get the best possible contrast 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.650
 that should make color in this case would not benefit us much 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.469
 cd and once we have the ejido 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.970
 between these minimum saturation options with those we have made 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 previously the other program I got that we can do is cover avoid 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.980
 for example by removing some areas 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.980
 that we find inconvenient 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.620
 add details to hand of all this vice in vietnam because there is that 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.110
 day 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.460
 also recommended 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.900
 that we did to him not in this program whose 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.900
 way of control tools that pretty rudimentary but essentially 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.780
 in more advanced programs like photoshop 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.690
 percent once debug this in this case say what we could 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.870
 work a little bit smaller but I say it's just a demonstration 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.189
 in it once concluded it would bring editing what we are going to do now 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.560
 is that you choose within the options 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.480
 of shortcuts that the program has 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 in nanas the carton option would suit 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.229
 efe would not suit us 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.609
 the sketch option 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.609
 that it would not suit us the option that both 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.519
 by effects of conversion to line image 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.519
 which is the third effect would be more appropriate in this case 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.840
 inside so that the automatic conversions with the logos adjust that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.169
 darkening money 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.639
 the image which appear more or less lethal 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.949
 fede adjust the levels of detail 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.439
 whereupon the image can dirty your boot with a background 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.189
 and soften ohno 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.709
 it's not that there was talk 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.849
 c the contours is adjusted this simply the conversion 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.340
 would not result in a fairly refined illustration of 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.589
 Ecopetrol not of course with some dirty details 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.560
 that will surely be necessary 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.709
 eliminate that we can do percent in this same program another washing it 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.369
 to a different program 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.709
 as photoshop or photo p 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.839
 read about it if Anton should be what I suggest is 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.939
 explore according to the source image 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.199
 what things could be previously worked to improve 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:28.260
 specifically in the performance of the inca machu program a professional but 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.459
 I think that the perspectives of use to obtain some image with a 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.709
 certain order of realism with tournament and drawing o and the 60 in ica 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.879
 they are here presented 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.399
