it'll business outcomes in this bar

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it'll business outcomes in this bar
right<00:01:14.250> another<00:01:15.250> six<00:01:15.580> at<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.790> time<00:01:16.500> that's<00:01:17.500> six

boards<00:01:17.950> every<00:01:18.220> five<00:01:18.400> minutes<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.840> how<00:01:20.620> many

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
boards every five minutes is how many

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.450 
boards every five minutes is how many

606<00:01:24.460> groaning<00:01:24.939> somebody

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.389 

the<00:01:30.310> solder<00:01:30.520> paste<00:01:31.380> we're<00:01:32.380> here<00:01:32.680> you<00:01:32.950> can<00:01:33.189> see

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
the solder paste we're here you can see

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.660 
the solder paste we're here you can see
I<00:01:33.430> mean<00:01:33.790> it<00:01:33.909> gets<00:01:34.090> all<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.390> lytic<00:01:34.720> place<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
I mean it gets all the lytic place and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.200 
I mean it gets all the lytic place and
then<00:01:36.820> down<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.170> reform<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.729> there's<00:01:40.000> how

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
then down to the reform and there's how

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.500 
then down to the reform and there's how
many<00:01:40.390> zones<00:01:40.570> in<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:41.369> eight<00:01:42.369> zones

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:54.220 

that<00:01:46.510> is<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:47.020> very<00:01:47.380> long<00:01:47.650> chamber<00:01:50.460> eight<00:01:51.460> zones

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.090 

and<00:01:54.800> here's<00:01:55.040> our

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
and here's our

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.850 
and here's our
like<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.400> odd

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.900 

we're<00:02:05.220> going<00:02:05.670> away

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.570 

we<00:02:09.120> use<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.620> 24

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
we use like 24

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.770 
we use like 24
where

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.819 

pretty<00:02:20.380> cool<00:02:20.560> where<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.550> going<00:02:21.700> to
