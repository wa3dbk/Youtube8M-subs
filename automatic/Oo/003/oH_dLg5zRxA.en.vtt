the<00:01:38.250> hit<00:01:38.460> stick<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:38.970> trying<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the hit stick that I'm trying and the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
the hit stick that I'm trying and the
fact<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.110> he's<00:01:40.259> trying<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> hurdle<00:01:40.920> me<00:01:41.040> you

fact that he's trying to hurdle me you

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.580 
fact that he's trying to hurdle me you
would<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.000> want<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.240> risk<00:01:42.570> reward<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.500> know

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
would you want that risk reward you know

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.899 
would you want that risk reward you know
I'm<00:01:43.649> going<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> big<00:01:44.310> hit<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> open

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I'm going for the big hit in the open

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.310 
I'm going for the big hit in the open

field he's trying to hurdle me he should

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.310 
field he's trying to hurdle me he should
actually<00:01:46.560> by<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.159> accounts<00:01:47.630> clear<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:49.170> up

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
actually by all accounts clear right up

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
actually by all accounts clear right up
over<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.649> top<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.979> me<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.280> take<00:01:50.759> off<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
over the top of me and take off up the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
over the top of me and take off up the
field<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:51.630> instead<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.770> game

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
field but instead you know the game

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.190 
field but instead you know the game
actually<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.939> shifts<00:01:54.360> us<00:01:54.509> back

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
actually just kind of shifts us back

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.929 
actually just kind of shifts us back
together<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.710> mean<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.159> see<00:01:56.340> he<00:01:56.520> really

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
together I mean you can see he really

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.539 
together I mean you can see he really
almost<00:01:57.299> tackles<00:01:58.020> himself<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:59.280> than<00:01:59.460> I

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
almost tackles himself more than I

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.100 
almost tackles himself more than I
tackling<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> players<00:02:00.689> are<00:02:00.869> kind<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
tackling because the players are kind of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.190 
tackling because the players are kind of
drawn<00:02:01.409> back<00:02:01.770> together<00:02:02.280> right<00:02:02.969> here<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.479> then

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
drawn back together right here and then

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.139 
drawn back together right here and then
he<00:02:04.380> basically<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.829> gets<00:02:05.219> thrown<00:02:05.939> up<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
he basically just gets thrown up in the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.630 
he basically just gets thrown up in the
air<00:02:06.240> lands<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.320> bowl<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.829> then<00:02:08.250> gets<00:02:08.520> up

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
air lands on the bowl and then gets up

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.219 
air lands on the bowl and then gets up
and<00:02:08.789> does<00:02:08.970> kind<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.450> real<00:02:09.660> cute<00:02:09.929> little

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
