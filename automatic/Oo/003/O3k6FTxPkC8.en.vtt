00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
some of the things that happen some of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.200 
some of the things that happen some of
the<00:01:40.829> seeds<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.159> went<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.490> kinda<00:01:42.119> were

winning<00:01:44.369> personally<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> thought<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.450> would

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
winning personally I thought that would

be<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:45.930> even<00:01:46.259> series<00:01:46.619> i<00:01:46.799> picked

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
be a really even series i picked

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.010 
be a really even series i picked
Vancouver<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.579> seven<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.180> Calgary<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.689> six

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
Vancouver in seven it was Calgary in six

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
Vancouver in seven it was Calgary in six
but<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.460> seen<00:01:50.640> Calgary<00:01:51.000> winning<00:01:51.299> in

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
but I could have seen Calgary winning in

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.910 
but I could have seen Calgary winning in
seven<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:51.930> did<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.259> six<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.619> good<00:01:52.829> on

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
seven but they did it in six so good on

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.999 
seven but they did it in six so good on
them<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.729> Rangers<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.450> sadly<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.530> saw<00:01:55.799> some

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
them the Rangers I sadly I saw some

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.410 
them the Rangers I sadly I saw some
winning<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.369> five<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> actually<00:01:57.030> got<00:01:57.270> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
winning in five and I actually got that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.420 
winning in five and I actually got that
right<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> Penguins<00:01:58.920> did<00:01:59.070> lose<00:01:59.219> three

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
right but the Penguins did lose three

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.800 
right but the Penguins did lose three
and<00:01:59.520> over<00:01:59.579> time<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.240> was<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> lot<00:02:00.540> closer

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and over time so it was a lot closer

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.380 
and over time so it was a lot closer
than<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.439> actually<00:02:01.590> showed<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.159> Winnipeg<00:02:02.969> I

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
have a good team but I think there's

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.890 
have a good team but I think there's
still<00:03:35.819> one<00:03:36.120> or<00:03:36.239> two<00:03:36.269> things<00:03:36.389> here<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.840> there

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
still one or two things here and there

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.020 
still one or two things here and there
that<00:03:37.019> they<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.500> improve<00:03:37.799> on<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.579> much

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
that they can improve on to be a much

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.569 
that they can improve on to be a much
more<00:03:39.329> elite<00:03:39.690> team<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.200> possibly<00:03:41.190> win<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.370> cup

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
more elite team and possibly win the cup

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.860 
more elite team and possibly win the cup
of<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.760> near<00:03:41.879> future<00:03:42.060> but<00:03:42.419> they<00:03:42.569> needed<00:03:42.810> that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
of the near future but they needed that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.229 
of the near future but they needed that
soon<00:03:43.199> because<00:03:43.760> some<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.790> their<00:03:44.940> players<00:03:45.090> are

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
soon because some of their players are

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.030 
soon because some of their players are
getting<00:03:45.299> older<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.410> don't<00:03:46.739> know<00:03:46.799> they<00:03:46.949> just
