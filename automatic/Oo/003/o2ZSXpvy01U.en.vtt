00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
I'm going to go we'll pick up a lot open

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:34.529 
I'm going to go we'll pick up a lot open
B<00:04:12.340> string<00:04:12.370> there<00:04:12.730> so<00:04:12.879> so<00:04:13.030> far<00:04:13.180> way<00:04:13.329> up

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.790 

all<00:04:35.539> right<00:04:35.689> so<00:04:35.899> make<00:04:36.050> sure<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:36.469> basically

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
all right so make sure it's basically

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.199 
all right so make sure it's basically
like<00:04:36.979> one<00:04:37.339> two<00:04:37.939> three<00:04:38.229> one<00:04:39.229> two<00:04:39.769> three<00:04:40.069> so<00:04:40.610> try

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:41.209 
like one two three one two three so try

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:43.299 
like one two three one two three so try
to<00:04:41.269> count<00:04:41.509> that<00:04:41.659> do<00:04:41.869> we<00:04:41.989> start<00:04:42.289> kind<00:04:42.860> of<00:04:43.039> back

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:43.309 
to count that do we start kind of back

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:55.329 
to count that do we start kind of back
with<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:45.639> same<00:04:46.639> thing<00:04:46.819> we<00:04:46.879> did<00:04:46.999> earlier<00:04:54.339> so

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:55.339 
with the same thing we did earlier so

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:56.799 
with the same thing we did earlier so
when<00:04:55.489> we<00:04:55.580> get<00:04:55.699> to<00:04:55.759> this<00:04:55.969> core<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.479> a<00:04:56.539> little

00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:56.809 
when we get to this core it's a little

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:57.399 
when we get to this core it's a little
bit<00:04:56.929> different

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
bit different

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.919 
bit different
instead<00:04:57.739> of<00:04:57.830> just<00:04:57.919> going<00:04:58.039> late<00:04:58.599> there<00:04:59.599> we<00:04:59.809> have

00:04:59.919 --> 00:04:59.929 
instead of just going late there we have

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:08.139 
instead of just going late there we have
all<00:05:04.449> right<00:05:05.449> so<00:05:06.259> that<00:05:06.379> is<00:05:06.409> that<00:05:06.769> open<00:05:07.699> a<00:05:07.819> string

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:08.149 
all right so that is that open a string

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:09.909 
all right so that is that open a string
and<00:05:08.479> then<00:05:08.719> the<00:05:08.779> first<00:05:09.139> fret<00:05:09.319> there<00:05:09.499> on<00:05:09.649> the<00:05:09.769> B

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:22.249 
the G one two and three then we have the

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.669 
the G one two and three then we have the
low<00:05:22.459> E<00:05:22.489> string<00:05:22.839> with<00:05:23.839> the<00:05:23.929> first<00:05:24.229> fret<00:05:24.469> on<00:05:24.499> the

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 
those opening sequels kind of repeats

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.960 
those opening sequels kind of repeats
the<00:07:53.440> same<00:07:53.650> things<00:07:54.070> that<00:07:54.160> we<00:07:54.370> did<00:07:54.550> in<00:07:54.670> the<00:07:54.760> first

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:54.970

a<00:08:00.580> very<00:08:00.880> slow<00:08:01.750> tempo<00:08:01.990> so<00:08:02.470> it<00:08:03.280> shouldn't<00:08:03.550> take

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:03.700 
a very slow tempo so it shouldn't take

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.340
