00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
actually very similar to normal

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
actually very similar to normal
LD<00:00:36.329> alright<00:00:36.750> consider<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
LD alright consider this is just a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.740 
LD alright consider this is just a
spider<00:00:38.160> version<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.360> obviously

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
spider version so there are obviously

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.150 
spider version so there are obviously
gonna<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.930> differences<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> main

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
gonna be differences but the main

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.530 
gonna be differences but the main
difference<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.579> obviously<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> color<00:00:42.239> but

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
difference is obviously the color but

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.600 
difference is obviously the color but
that<00:00:42.660> does<00:00:42.750> already<00:00:42.870> count<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:44.040> wheels<00:00:44.250> are

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that does already count the wheels are

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
that does already count the wheels are
slightly<00:00:44.879> different<00:00:45.030> obviously<00:00:45.989> there's<00:00:46.140> no

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
slightly different obviously there's no

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.799 
slightly different obviously there's no
roof<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.520> engine<00:00:48.059> area<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.600> slightly

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
roof and the engine area is slightly

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.959 
roof and the engine area is slightly
different<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.640> much

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
different as well but that's not much

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.250 
different as well but that's not much
but<00:00:51.270> I'm<00:00:51.390> still<00:00:51.570> gonna<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> review<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.140> it

nicely<00:01:32.040> painted<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.670> nicely<00:01:33.060> rolled<00:01:33.299> um<00:01:33.509> here

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
nicely painted and nicely rolled um here

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.569 
nicely painted and nicely rolled um here
we've<00:01:34.290> got<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> germinal<00:01:35.130> player<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:35.549> is

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
we've got the germinal player which is

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.609 
we've got the germinal player which is
kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> odd<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.990> normal<00:01:37.320> audio

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
kind of odd because the normal audio

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.740 
kind of odd because the normal audio
right<00:01:37.829> has<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.189> exact<00:01:38.850> same<00:01:39.180> number<00:01:39.360> plate<00:01:39.630> as

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

right has the exact same number plate as
this<00:01:39.930> which<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> odd<00:01:41.159> because<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.490> in

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
this which is kind of odd because in in

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.389 
this which is kind of odd because in in
real<00:01:42.720> life<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.200> wouldn't<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> same

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
real life they wouldn't have the same

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.580 
real life they wouldn't have the same
play<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.390> yeah<00:01:45.750> anyway<00:01:45.869> that's<00:01:46.170> still<00:01:46.380> pretty

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
play but yeah anyway that's still pretty

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.530 
play but yeah anyway that's still pretty
cool<00:01:46.740> nasty<00:01:47.070> sticky<00:01:47.399> dot<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:48.090> sticker<00:01:48.390> on

the<00:04:22.950> engine<00:04:23.190> inside<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.849> just<00:04:23.880> got<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.270> like

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
the engine inside you just got this like

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.870 
the engine inside you just got this like
the<00:04:26.099> hood<00:04:26.280> hood

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
the hood hood

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.180 
the hood hood
sort<00:04:27.240> of<00:04:27.330> thing<00:04:27.690> where<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.200> roof<00:04:28.740> would<00:04:28.920> go<00:04:29.100> in

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
sort of thing where the roof would go in

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.860 
sort of thing where the roof would go in
here<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.700> roof<00:04:29.820> is<00:04:29.970> probably<00:04:30.240> in<00:04:30.420> here<00:04:30.660> and

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
here so the roof is probably in here and

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
shook it open and it does come out back

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.290

really because you can't really get the
engine<00:04:45.450> there<00:04:45.690> which<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.170> pretty<00:04:46.320> bad<00:04:46.530> take<00:04:47.190> a

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
engine there which is pretty bad take a

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.430 
engine there which is pretty bad take a
look<00:04:47.400> inside<00:04:47.600> just<00:04:48.600> about<00:04:48.780> see<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.020> engine<00:04:49.350> in

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
look inside just about see the engine in

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.020 
look inside just about see the engine in
there<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.800> there's<00:04:50.370> basically<00:04:50.640> really

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
there and there's basically really

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.130 
there and there's basically really
nothing<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.480> there<00:04:51.660> it's<00:04:51.750> just<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.960> bit<00:04:52.080> of

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
nothing in there it's just a bit of

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.290 
nothing in there it's just a bit of
black<00:04:52.350> big<00:04:52.650> gray<00:04:52.950> so<00:04:53.520> that's<00:04:53.640> pretty<00:04:53.850> bad<00:04:54.060> job

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
black big gray so that's pretty bad job

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.690 
black big gray so that's pretty bad job
there<00:04:54.540> from<00:04:54.720> me<00:04:54.870> Stowe<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.380> comes<00:04:56.250> up<00:04:56.400> hardly

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700

anything and it's hardly any detail in
there<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.250> mean<00:04:59.610> it<00:04:59.700> would<00:04:59.790> be<00:04:59.820> nice<00:05:00.030> if<00:05:00.210> you

detail over it looks very realistic they

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.690 
detail over it looks very realistic they
probably<00:06:37.650> only<00:06:37.860> bad<00:06:38.070> thing<00:06:38.280> about<00:06:38.340> it<00:06:38.490> is

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
probably only bad thing about it is

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.820 
probably only bad thing about it is
probably<00:06:38.940> the<00:06:39.060> wheels<00:06:39.210> don't<00:06:39.360> turn

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
probably the wheels don't turn

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.150 
probably the wheels don't turn
but<00:06:39.920> that's<00:06:40.100> nothing<00:06:40.760> major<00:06:41.150> because<00:06:41.780> all<00:06:42.260> new

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
but that's nothing major because all new

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.850 
but that's nothing major because all new
Meister<00:06:43.520> cars<00:06:43.730> are<00:06:43.880> like<00:06:44.030> that<00:06:44.300> and<00:06:45.260> also<00:06:45.770> the
