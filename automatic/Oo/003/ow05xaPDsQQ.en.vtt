plain old white shipper just like all
the<00:01:04.420> Mattel<00:01:04.689> figures<00:01:05.490> so<00:01:06.490> pretty<00:01:06.850> bland<00:01:07.119> I

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
the Mattel figures so pretty bland I

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:08.609 
the Mattel figures so pretty bland I
would<00:01:07.479> not<00:01:07.659> recommend<00:01:07.840> you<00:01:08.170> keep<00:01:08.350> them<00:01:08.470> in

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
this but I suppose some people might

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.669 
this but I suppose some people might

the figure here he does look a little

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.340 
the figure here he does look a little
bit<00:01:30.789> a<00:01:30.819> little<00:01:30.909> bit<00:01:31.090> off<00:01:31.359> because<00:01:31.630> it's<00:01:32.109> cut

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
bit a little bit off because it's cut

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.319 
bit a little bit off because it's cut
off<00:01:32.499> so<00:01:32.740> much<00:01:32.950> down<00:01:33.159> here<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:33.670> then<00:01:34.119> he's

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
off so much down here and then he's

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.440 
off so much down here and then he's
still<00:01:34.569> centered<00:01:35.109> down<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.729> it's<00:01:37.090> messed<00:01:37.299> up

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450

still centered down and it's messed up
right<00:01:37.600> here<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:38.109> kind<00:01:38.289> of<00:01:38.350> irritates<00:01:38.799> me

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
right here so that kind of irritates me

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.410

to give it a scene but they didn't do

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.500 
to give it a scene but they didn't do
any<00:03:51.569> of<00:03:51.659> that<00:03:52.400> he<00:03:53.400> does<00:03:53.579> have<00:03:53.790> new<00:03:54.030> sculpted

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
any of that he does have new sculpted

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.960 
any of that he does have new sculpted
hands<00:03:54.750> though<00:03:54.989> with<00:03:55.560> his<00:03:55.859> little<00:03:56.250> holy

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
hands though with his little holy

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.969 
hands though with his little holy
knuckles<00:03:57.449> and<00:03:57.629> his<00:03:57.720> thumb<00:03:57.959> claw<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.650> can<00:03:58.799> see

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
knuckles and his thumb claw you can see

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.099 
knuckles and his thumb claw you can see
that<00:03:59.189> he's<00:03:59.729> got<00:03:59.909> his<00:04:00.030> ring<00:04:00.269> on<00:04:00.389> this<00:04:00.569> side<00:04:00.810> it's

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
that he's got his ring on this side it's

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.069 
that he's got his ring on this side it's
painted<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.650> sculpted<00:04:02.479> and<00:04:03.479> of<00:04:03.689> course<00:04:03.900> his

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
painted and sculpted and of course his

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.479 
painted and sculpted and of course his
head<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.560> his<00:04:04.680> shoulder<00:04:04.979> pads<00:04:05.010> our<00:04:05.370> new

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
head and his shoulder pads our new

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.249 
head and his shoulder pads our new
shoulder<00:04:06.329> pads<00:04:06.599> are<00:04:06.720> really<00:04:06.840> cool<00:04:07.109> they're

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259 
shoulder pads are really cool they're

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.530 
shoulder pads are really cool they're
nicely<00:04:07.620> done<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.759> heads<00:04:09.000> really<00:04:09.209> cool

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
nicely done and the heads really cool

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.050 
nicely done and the heads really cool
too<00:04:09.889> it's<00:04:10.889> not<00:04:11.159> a<00:04:11.220> hundred<00:04:11.519> percent<00:04:11.909> accurate

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
too it's not a hundred percent accurate

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.080 
too it's not a hundred percent accurate
to<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.449> artwork<00:04:12.900> if<00:04:13.139> you<00:04:13.319> look<00:04:13.699> at<00:04:14.699> his<00:04:14.909> head

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
to the artwork if you look at his head

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.050 
to the artwork if you look at his head
he's<00:04:15.209> got<00:04:15.419> that<00:04:15.569> kind<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.220> seam<00:04:17.220> going<00:04:17.549> on<00:04:17.849> down

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
he's got that kind of seam going on down

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.560 
he's got that kind of seam going on down
the<00:04:18.239> middle

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
the middle

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.839 
the middle
connecting<00:04:19.200> down<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.469> his<00:04:19.620> nose<00:04:19.829> he<00:04:20.549> doesn't

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
connecting down to his nose he doesn't

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.249 
connecting down to his nose he doesn't
have<00:04:21.000> that

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.230 

so<00:04:24.259> it's<00:04:24.620> not<00:04:24.740> perfect<00:04:25.220> but<00:04:25.789> it<00:04:25.940> is<00:04:26.000> still

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
so it's not perfect but it is still

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.120 
so it's not perfect but it is still
pretty<00:04:26.449> cool<00:04:26.660> there's<00:04:27.380> no<00:04:27.500> shading<00:04:27.800> on<00:04:28.009> it

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
pretty cool there's no shading on it

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.560 
pretty cool there's no shading on it
though<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.400> own<00:04:28.520> shadings<00:04:28.880> in<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.030> teeth<00:04:29.270> so

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
though the own shadings in the teeth so

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.610 
though the own shadings in the teeth so
it<00:04:29.660> really<00:04:29.960> would<00:04:30.080> have<00:04:30.139> been<00:04:30.199> nice<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.410> have

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
it really would have been nice to have

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.100 
it really would have been nice to have
some<00:04:30.800> dry<00:04:31.220> brushing<00:04:31.430> on<00:04:31.699> his<00:04:31.880> head<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.330> show

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
some dry brushing on his head to show

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.210 
some dry brushing on his head to show
off<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:34.509> sculpt<00:04:35.509> but<00:04:36.470> there<00:04:36.650> isn't<00:04:36.800> any<00:04:37.100> of

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
off the sculpt but there isn't any of

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.570 
off the sculpt but there isn't any of
that<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:39.080> shoulder<00:04:39.740> pads<00:04:39.949> apparently<00:04:40.460> are

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
that the shoulder pads apparently are

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.520 
that the shoulder pads apparently are
just<00:04:40.729> glued<00:04:40.910> on<00:04:41.120> they<00:04:41.930> could<00:04:42.080> plug<00:04:42.229> into<00:04:42.380> the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
just glued on they could plug into the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.080 
just glued on they could plug into the
back<00:04:42.710> like<00:04:42.949> you<00:04:42.979> would<00:04:43.190> expect<00:04:43.280> from<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.789> DC

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
back like you would expect from a DC

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.850 
back like you would expect from a DC
Universe<00:04:44.539> figure<00:04:44.900> but<00:04:45.440> they<00:04:45.530> just<00:04:45.710> have<00:04:45.830> a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
Universe figure but they just have a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.230 
Universe figure but they just have a
little<00:04:46.070> dab<00:04:46.310> of<00:04:46.430> glue<00:04:46.580> on<00:04:46.759> the<00:04:46.850> shoulders<00:04:47.210> and

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
little dab of glue on the shoulders and

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.390 
little dab of glue on the shoulders and
it<00:04:47.479> pops<00:04:47.660> off<00:04:47.810> real<00:04:48.080> easy<00:04:48.259> which<00:04:48.949> I<00:04:49.100> guess<00:04:49.280> is

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
it pops off real easy which I guess is

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.950 
it pops off real easy which I guess is
good<00:04:49.580> because<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:49.970> goes<00:04:50.090> back<00:04:50.240> into<00:04:50.509> place<00:04:50.720> and

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
good because it goes back into place and

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.230 
good because it goes back into place and
it<00:04:51.050> allows<00:04:51.259> you<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:52.090> articulate<00:04:53.090> them<00:04:53.180> a

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
it allows you to articulate them a

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.670 
it allows you to articulate them a
little<00:04:53.449> bit<00:04:53.539> better<00:04:53.690> so<00:04:54.020> it's<00:04:54.139> probably<00:04:54.380> okay

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
little bit better so it's probably okay

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.420 
little bit better so it's probably okay
that<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.400> glue<00:04:55.580> just<00:04:55.759> pops<00:04:55.970> off<00:04:56.180> that's<00:04:57.020> fine

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
that the glue just pops off that's fine

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.040 
that the glue just pops off that's fine
but<00:04:58.430> he's<00:04:59.060> over<00:04:59.210> always<00:04:59.509> kind<00:04:59.840> of<00:04:59.900> an

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
but he's over always kind of an

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.050 
but he's over always kind of an
unimpressive<00:05:00.949> figure<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.580> mean<00:05:01.729> there's<00:05:01.940> some

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
unimpressive figure I mean there's some

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.120 
unimpressive figure I mean there's some
good<00:05:02.090> things<00:05:02.240> obviously<00:05:02.660> like<00:05:03.139> I<00:05:03.259> said<00:05:03.500> that

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
good things obviously like I said that

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.070 
good things obviously like I said that
the<00:05:04.340> lantern<00:05:05.030> emblem<00:05:05.360> is<00:05:05.449> pretty<00:05:05.660> nice<00:05:05.840> on

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
the lantern emblem is pretty nice on

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.560 
the lantern emblem is pretty nice on
there<00:05:06.349> but<00:05:07.099> for<00:05:07.910> being<00:05:08.120> one<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:08.389> the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
there but for being one of the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.950 
there but for being one of the
collectors<00:05:09.289> exclusive<00:05:09.949> figures<00:05:10.419> only<00:05:11.419> having

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
collectors exclusive figures only having

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.089 
collectors exclusive figures only having
a<00:05:12.020> little<00:05:12.259> bit<00:05:12.349> of<00:05:12.410> sculpting<00:05:12.800> on<00:05:12.949> the

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
a little bit of sculpting on the

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.950 
a little bit of sculpting on the
forearms<00:05:13.610> for<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:13.880> gloves<00:05:14.120> in<00:05:14.389> the<00:05:14.479> hands<00:05:14.870> and

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
forearms for the gloves in the hands and

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.200 
forearms for the gloves in the hands and
then<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.199> head<00:05:15.410> it's<00:05:16.130> just<00:05:16.340> kind<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.639> kind<00:05:17.120> of

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
then the head it's just kind of kind of

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.700 
then the head it's just kind of kind of
not<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:17.509> great<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:17.750> wish<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.259> boots<00:05:18.560> were

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
not so great I wish the boots were

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.310 
not so great I wish the boots were
sculpted<00:05:19.130> for<00:05:19.310> sure<00:05:19.690> some<00:05:20.690> piping<00:05:21.080> would<00:05:21.229> have

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
sculpted for sure some piping would have

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.900 
sculpted for sure some piping would have
been<00:05:21.440> nice<00:05:21.650> or<00:05:21.860> something<00:05:22.250> for<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.550> red<00:05:22.729> on

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
been nice or something for the red on

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.170 
been nice or something for the red on
here<00:05:23.210> it's<00:05:23.900> just<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.440> flat<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:24.770> bland<00:05:25.160> but<00:05:25.909> he

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
here it's just so flat and bland but he

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.580 
here it's just so flat and bland but he
is<00:05:26.300> nice<00:05:26.510> overall<00:05:26.990> I<00:05:27.020> mean<00:05:27.080> there's<00:05:27.320> nothing

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
is nice overall I mean there's nothing

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.990 
is nice overall I mean there's nothing
really<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.919> complain<00:05:28.250> about<00:05:28.520> just<00:05:28.820> things

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
really to complain about just things

bad I don't I don't think that was a
good<00:05:54.530> choice<00:05:54.729> so<00:05:55.729> he<00:05:55.970> doesn't<00:05:56.210> not<00:05:56.300> have<00:05:56.539> the

good choice so he doesn't not have the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.100 
good choice so he doesn't not have the
hand<00:05:57.560> to<00:05:57.740> hold<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.159> lantern<00:05:58.960> what<00:05:59.960> are<00:06:00.050> you
