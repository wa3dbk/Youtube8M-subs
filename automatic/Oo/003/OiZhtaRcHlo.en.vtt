00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.250
 towards kissing you I will steal you has been 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.220
 immense and grateful to that audience that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.809
 always follow my music and I have 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.400
 great plans where I include by 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.559
 supposed to continue collaborating with your 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.390
 Buying Roberto Tapia who also like 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.390
 can see is a hopeless romantic 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.160
 and the singer does not have more than 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.140
 good things to say about Roberto Tapia 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.180
 and he has even been learning a 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.850
 step 2 to be able to dance in style 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.810
 band as every expert is also 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 teaching my own kisses to 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.020
 also in a month I think I'm fine 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.360
 Propel not yet taught not as 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.759
 in monkeys but it's a little bit no no 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.220
 monkeys in a month I teach you good them 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.289
 It consists in no longer promised us in a month 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.229
 dreamy and how do you plan to take 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.360
 Perfume clothes line I think that too 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.399
 must include a good boots design 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.800
 cool that they go with the dance do not believe the 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.069
 show was always about 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.899
 and fashion of live but to see 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.850
 that if you are well connected with your people 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.860
 Mexican women know that the first artist 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.170
 who signed on his new lion label 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.950
 breakers is precisely the Mexican 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.950
 Sofia King 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.229
 sucre 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.409
 I just signed a girl called Sofia 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.890
 kings and 18 years old mexicana sings in English 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.800
 in Spanish pop soon we're going 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.380
 to release his simple then 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.810
 definitely for me it is also 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.160
 shaking hands with people as well as measuring 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.070
 the hand to me no and I always had a dream 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.070
 to be able to have my own label 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.410
 to be able to produce music for writing 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.410
 other artists not only me and try to d 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.710
 to give more to Latin music and I think 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.620
 that in Latin music we need 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.380
 new artists different genres 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.080
 motivate your boys and girls to sing to 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.330
 write to produce to follow your dreams 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.680
 not then for me is it always to try to 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.270
 to give more to the Latino industry and 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.150
 how do not we get tired of listening to stand 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.820
 by me heart without face I am the same there 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.400
 all the others because all and I say 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.560
 they are all great they believe now 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.120
 we will have it in English and all the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.480
 gringos are that they can not of the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.480
 emotion 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.180
 I have almost three years preparing this 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.030
 disco and finally soon we are going 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.580
 to launch not simple if God wants this 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.620
 year the album next year and 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.319
 true that very happy is a record that 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.330
 I think it represents everything that I 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.150
 I heard when it was when when I was raised 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.290
 new york no bachata meringue sauce 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.470
 reggaeton hip hop and I think that despite 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.870
 that I grew up in the usa I always felt 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.670
 very latino and I think that record that's 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.890
 a function function of all that and I hope 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.720
 you like my audience I think 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.880
 well there are going to be many surprises and 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.150
 I hope you like it and good, very happy 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.220
 not to finally release this record that 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.140
 the public I know they are waiting for 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.209
 a long time that maybe roy without a doubt is 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.700
 unstoppable and is here to stay in 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.340

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.430
 full and live swearing to the right and 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.430
 sinister 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.220
