 Personal speech from youtube everything beauty here 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.699
 Professor Daniel Severino and this is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.600
 another autodesk revit video lesson 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.340
 folks 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 Today I'll be answering a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.529
 Doubt what in my friend would say meadow 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.750
 architect and the city of jacareí a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.300
 hug in the staff of jacareí 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.160
 Okay, and he's the one he sent the message to. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 for facebook because if you have not 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 access to i teacher daniel ceased 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.079
 Severino 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 let your cultivation leave the link on 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.879
 description for everyone access beauty 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.620
 he sent the following message that is 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.390
 having a hard time putting a car 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.399
 on a ramp 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.039
 when it places the component in view 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.610
 3d looks like the car is flying can not 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.309
 the line in relation to the good ramp give let's 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 There I am here with harry 2013 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 I made a correction I all law 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 Tracy actually does an accomplishment 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.830
 auto in my view ok 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.810
 only if I put another model of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.600
 car on these ramps will give problem 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.210
 this particular car is already fixed 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.369
 just an example of how it should be 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 beauty I put on three ramps there 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.479
 with different angles good 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 First I'm going back here to level 1 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.840
 and I'll delete these three 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.350
 cars 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.900
 ok no stress and I'll insert 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.409
 here a component model is wrong 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.000
 a jeep floor it is already fixed 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.680
 so I'll stay here in a non-component 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.530
 I'll save my project. 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.560
 I'm going to select here jeep wrangler ok 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.600
 when I added on that ramp 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.810
 Look what's going to happen both in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.990
 three ramps that has been inserted 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.899
 when I look at 3d cars are 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.610
 floating the first item here ramp 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.840
 actually do not get a floor if you 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.770
 look here 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 it is level, the second it seems 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.349
 a wheel went inside the concrete and the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.239
 cold form is floating the third 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.590
 This gets more aggressive. 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.959
 car chassis 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.950
 focus on the ramp and the front wheel is 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.930
 totally floating ok good first I 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.040
 I'm going back here, it's in my understanding. 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.319
 I'm going to delete this component and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.390
 this component and I will leave only one 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.580
 here on the first floor how to do or 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.190
 click on this component of this 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.790
 family in this car and click here 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.400
 notice 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.790
 the family ready he will bring the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.769
 construction of my object and notice that 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.099
 he has nothing but his own 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.799
 item that is the car is this jeep that is 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.989
 selected here in the field of 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.569
 properties there will be some 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.730
 settings I'll have to extend that is 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.650
 a bit you can see these 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.739
 options then you have here with 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.650
 basis of the work plan this option has 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:08.069
 to be marked with a click 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.310
 always vertically I disable ok 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.340
 then based on the plan enables and 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.739
 always upright and disables I go 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.600
 apply and on the component it will not 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.769
 undergo no change here in my 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 process 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.930
 Except I do here load the 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.489
 project in which the project is one that 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.019
 I'm working, whoever else is 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.209
 of two files 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.459
 it will ask you to replace the 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.319
 existing version click replace 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.750
 because otherwise corrections will not be 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.630
 made and it will change this pattern 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.849
 ready every time you put 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.040
 this component up here component 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.690
 He's going to bring her a jeep and I'll move on. 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.440
 hand on the ramp 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.700
 Look how interesting it is already going 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.410
 put on and line up with a little 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.410
 I put out closer 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.160
 I'll delete it from below and look at it 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:03.209
 How interesting when I come 3 of 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.419
 all the chips are inclined are 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.430
 according to the huoc floor both the jeep number 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:12.060
 2 he was more aggressive to 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.840
 floating is exactly in accordance with 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.639
 ramp 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.440
 Then you 'll ask why it has 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.560
 this ramp that I did not put any 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.380
 car first these first three here 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.690
 are built with a floor which I 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.970
 be the flower component and 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.400
 I did the southern element modification as 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.860
 so by clicking on any floor 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.700
 done with the floor command with the command 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.670
 floor 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.040
 you have to modify upload elements and 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.900
 then you can drag up or down 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.000
 low and if your twitter I will download one 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.940
 little here I'm going to put less half 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.860
 meter of outrage and if your weight suffers 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.050
 an operation or even I'll go 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.000
 put another meter and eighty here 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.040
 it brings an indication that the thickness 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.460
 It has been changed, no problem, but 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.580
 he created my ramp esc install 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.650
 My car is tilted down this ramp. 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.380
 fourth ramp that was not created with 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.300
 the circulation system, or the 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.030
 own command ramp 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.170
 so if you run that ramp you will not 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.170
 it will work 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.740
 Look at the level, I'll bring it here. 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.660
 component I'm going to select the jeep and I'm going 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.770
 stay up here he does not accept this 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.780
 surface 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.390
 he says he can not find 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.260
 host or ends up being a 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.910
 problem 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.300
 every time you create a ramp for 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.610
 put a car create by floor command 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.520
 ie that our command that the floor 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.340
 architecture and make the southern modification 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.400
 element beauty then just open the block 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.570
 put it on the plan and take the 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.850
 vertical systems 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.050
 a quick simple tip that will help 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.970
 many people 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.550
 so this is it folks if you 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.830
 like to let your comments enjoy 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.690
 share spread the word as much as you 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.730
 because I can so dedicate it 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.290
 more time on youtube youtube 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.000
 so that's it , I hope you 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.520
 has like or leave a big hug
