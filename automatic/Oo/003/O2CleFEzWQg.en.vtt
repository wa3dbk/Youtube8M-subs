00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay I sort of figured out how to take

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.440 
okay I sort of figured out how to take
it<00:00:04.140> off<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.710> lot<00:00:04.980> faster<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.700> upper<00:00:06.000> I'm<00:00:06.240> gonna

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
it off a lot faster the upper I'm gonna

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.810 
it off a lot faster the upper I'm gonna
face<00:00:06.660> ball<00:00:06.899> so<00:00:07.890> right<00:00:08.160> now<00:00:08.400> we're<00:00:08.610> gonna<00:00:08.700> be

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
face ball so right now we're gonna be

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:18.230 
face ball so right now we're gonna be

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
yeah we launched a long string launcher

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.690 
yeah we launched a long string launcher
which<00:03:19.470> I'll<00:03:19.920> be<00:03:20.220> using<00:03:20.250> from<00:03:22.220> Pegasus<00:03:23.220> cuz<00:03:23.579> I

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
which I'll be using from Pegasus cuz I

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
this thingy the instruction manuals this

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.500 
this thingy the instruction manuals this
is<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.790> ripcord

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
is the ripcord

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:02.119 
is the ripcord
okay<00:03:54.510> record<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:59.579> right<00:04:00.269> spend<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:01.049> bunch<00:04:01.889> of

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
string much I don't know if I got how to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:16.089 
string much I don't know if I got how to
save<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:05.690> then<00:04:06.690> came<00:04:07.400> with<00:04:09.560> dart<00:04:10.560> boom<00:04:13.729> night

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
save and then came with dart boom night

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.949 
save and then came with dart boom night
alright<00:04:17.099> forgot<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.729> show<00:04:17.909> you<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.599> in<00:04:18.870> my

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
alright forgot to show you this in my

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:37.210 
alright forgot to show you this in my
last<00:04:19.199> video<00:04:25.909> it<00:04:26.909> is<00:04:27.110> Aquarius<00:04:28.639> and<00:04:30.620> its<00:04:31.620> parts

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.790 

okay<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:38.280> let's<00:04:39.000> start<00:04:39.300> building<00:04:39.660> up<00:04:40.020> in<00:04:40.440> case

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
okay so let's start building up in case

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.860 
okay so let's start building up in case
they<00:04:41.130> played<00:04:41.400> dark<00:04:42.300> ball

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.800 

so<00:04:48.870> what<00:04:49.319> we<00:04:49.440> do<00:04:49.620> here<00:04:49.650> is<00:04:50.069> that<00:04:50.099> we<00:04:50.340> get<00:04:50.490> this

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
so what we do here is that we get this

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.089 
so what we do here is that we get this
and<00:04:51.810> we<00:04:52.280> call<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.400> right<00:04:53.610> here<00:04:54.979> there's<00:04:55.979> a

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
and we call you right here there's a

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.159 
and we call you right here there's a
circle<00:04:56.880> part<00:04:57.150> right<00:04:57.360> here<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:57.840> then<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.139> just

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
circle part right here and then you just

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.760 
circle part right here and then you just
attach<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:59.360> you<00:05:00.360> turn<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.169> right

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
attach and you turn to the right

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.980 
attach and you turn to the right
or<00:05:01.979> is<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.460> left<00:05:02.699> yeah<00:05:03.479> I<00:05:03.509> think<00:05:03.569> right<00:05:05.990> then

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
or is it left yeah I think right then

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.219 
or is it left yeah I think right then
you<00:05:07.080> get<00:05:07.259> the<00:05:07.530> fusion<00:05:07.770> wheel<00:05:08.930> it's<00:05:09.930> actually

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
you get the fusion wheel it's actually

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:20.300 
you get the fusion wheel it's actually
pretty<00:05:10.500> easily<00:05:10.860> easy<00:05:11.460> to<00:05:12.000> build<00:05:18.259> this<00:05:19.259> is<00:05:19.740> one

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
pretty easily easy to build this is one

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.029 
pretty easily easy to build this is one
oh<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.970> on<00:05:21.240> for<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.900> face<00:05:22.110> bolt<00:05:22.380> it's<00:05:22.740> like<00:05:23.009> a

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
oh and on for the face bolt it's like a

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.270 
oh and on for the face bolt it's like a
semi<00:05:23.490> circle<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.960> it's<00:05:25.229> like<00:05:25.500> half<00:05:25.800> circle

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
semi circle that it's like half circle

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.059 
semi circle that it's like half circle
half<00:05:28.940> so<00:05:29.940> it's<00:05:30.330> like<00:05:30.630> a<00:05:30.659> half<00:05:31.050> circle<00:05:31.080> half

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
half so it's like a half circle half

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:38.300 
half so it's like a half circle half
wearing<00:05:32.789> away<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:35.389> there<00:05:36.389> is<00:05:36.509> dark<00:05:36.870> ball<00:05:37.310> sort

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
wearing away and there is dark ball sort

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.659 
wearing away and there is dark ball sort

yeah<00:06:54.340> sharp<00:06:54.700> mode<00:06:54.940> cuz<00:06:55.630> I<00:06:55.750> still<00:06:55.960> have<00:06:56.080> a

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
yeah sharp mode cuz I still have a

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:02.300 
yeah sharp mode cuz I still have a
figured<00:06:56.530> out<00:06:56.710> that<00:06:57.520> it<00:06:59.550> so<00:07:00.550> it's<00:07:01.150> pretty<00:07:01.330> good

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:22.860 

wait<00:07:14.560> sort<00:07:15.190> of<00:07:20.670> okay<00:07:21.700> yeah<00:07:22.060> now<00:07:22.420> it's<00:07:22.600> going<00:07:22.780> to

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
wait sort of okay yeah now it's going to

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.710 
wait sort of okay yeah now it's going to
be<00:07:22.930> sharp<00:07:23.170> mode

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 
be sharp mode

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.030 
be sharp mode
hopefully<00:07:25.720> sharp<00:07:26.050> mold<00:07:26.350> is<00:07:26.590> gonna<00:07:26.800> be<00:07:26.890> a<00:07:26.920> lot

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.040 
hopefully sharp mold is gonna be a lot

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:35.240 
hopefully sharp mold is gonna be a lot
faster<00:07:31.080> 3<00:07:32.080> 2<00:07:32.350> 1<00:07:32.650> let<00:07:32.920> it<00:07:32.950> rip
