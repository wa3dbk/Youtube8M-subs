00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.700
 well hd friends magazine motors thanks 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.139
 a honda who had the chance to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.880
 try the new one for a couple of days 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.590
 honda jazz that in Italy a bit 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.780
 workhorse since 2002 they have 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.430
 sold 75 thousand units 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.949
 here in version 6 the sportier one is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.880
 recognizes from specific alloy wheels 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.980
 the bumper is also 16-inch 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.039
 front and customized with 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.399
 fake air vents for the brakes they give 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.640
 more aggressiveness at the front 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.700
 however, all the versatility remains for which 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.550
 jazz is famous first of all the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.809
 possibility of overturning a lot 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.610
 detail of the seats here I already have 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.430
 raised the seat 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.309
 look at that smart system for 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 increase the load capacity yes 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.850
 manages to take advantage of the whole 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.579
 cockpit 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.399
 obviously the possibility remains 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.340
 classic fold the seat in 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.570
 traditional mode this goes to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.650
 expand the trunk we are now going to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.439
 see trunk that already contains 400 of it 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 liters because it is very clever because also 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.520
 some wells below that you can 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.840
 store items so as not to make them 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.049
 drive around the car is a car you of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.430
 price list is just under 17 thousand euros 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.960
 also behind we have some 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.920
 sports customizations 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.150
 like these air intakes on the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.579
 bumper 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.880
 but now let's see how it goes 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.190
 Street 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.290
 here we are with this guide 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:47.010
 honda jazz model 2012 and version s 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 hence the sportiest in the range 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:56.170
 motorization 1400 fu tech the engine a 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.030
 100 horses weighing about 1,100 kg vi 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.680
 I immediately say that the benefits are a 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.010
 little below dimensioned for the frame 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.080
 no one trying to do a year 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:09.140
 long 0 100 is covered 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.650
 11.4 seconds so not a king time 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.430
 it is not a car for tempons, but one 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.040
 car suitable for everyday use and one 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.260
 segment of a car for all 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.800
 days but with that sporty look 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.270
 more given by more rigid calibration of the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.900
 suspension of a harsher nature than 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.880
 power assistance and I speak to you now about steering 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.330
 of everything in the street or a roundabout 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.090
 let's try to do it or cheerful 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.720
 really really very good lateral 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.290
 I got to test this one 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.400
 jazz for about 300 kilometers between 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.920
 hills of the dl of the Monferrato hills 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.569
 of the langhe and I must say that 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.750
 we have never had problems with sealing 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.060
 road on these on these roads 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.000
 however tortuous regarding the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.430
 comfort on board is very high I do not 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.860
 I was waiting for a comfort like this 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.560
 segment b really good suspension 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.850
 they absorb all the state spirits 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.970
 we got to try the 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.220
 version s that the version ap ap people 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.040
 pil with softer suspension calibration 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.300
 and also a softer steering then 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.819
 it absorbed the bumps of lovers better 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.180
 this is what i'm driving in this 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.840
 moment he has an excellent suspension department 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.370
 does not roll too much does not pitch but i 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.090
 bumps I just took come 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.860
 well absorbed the braking spaces 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.860
 braked really reduced but above all me 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.519
 liked the readiness of the brake 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.730
 as soon as we have the pedal the car will 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.760
 feels that the asphalt is dead and brakes 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.959
 This really small spaces 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.480
 according to this first impressions 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.410
 obviously it was a two days with 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.989
 jazz 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.799
 then when we do the test it completes the test 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.810
 we will tell you more or surely 10 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.049
 talk a little about interior interiors that 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.620
 the plastics are not well done 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:18.859
 sense of poverty or flying chip is 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.900
 very nice covered in leather with born 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.120
 of commands to the right the commands for the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.570
 cruise control left the commands for 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.460
 the infotainment and the controls for below 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.729
 who the board computer compiled board 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:37.180
 which tells us we have averaged out 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.340
 6.5 liters every 100 km a consumption really 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.490
 good because I assure you that in these 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.180
 test driver spot then a couple of 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.580
 days made these streets of the 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.400
 campaign and the machines from us the testers 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.470
 they are pressed a lot and a consumption of 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.770
 6.5 liters 100 km 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.120
 I must say that 1400 is very good 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.400
 from this point of view it involves a lot 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.960
 fine climate control we got to 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.340
 to try this morning as it is 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.460
 fast bring up temperature 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.610
 the cockpit was about 10 degrees outside 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.320
 very wet and the auteur films 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.139
 automatic which is standard on this 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.900
 version really brought 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.970
 the cabin the temperature in a little 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.370
 little time the air conditioner that is 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.250
 particular because it is placed here at 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.539
 right of the steering wheel the automatism 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.970
 obviously it works well 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:31.690
 exclude the compressor of the 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.340
 air conditioner and of course recycling and the 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.120
 the lenders usually work anyway 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.280
 there is no separate adjustment 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.099
 pilot passenger with regard to the 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.590
 nice particular instrumentation we have 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.950
 tachometer we have indicator speedometer 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.960
 gasoline a nice dashboard goes 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.470
 also taught the bridge with the part 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.150
 car radio slightly turned towards 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.790
 pilot 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.850
 and done well with regards to the 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.980
 gearbox department the change is great is me 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.680
 absolutely loved it has dry grafts 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.340
 not rubber boats and above all it's a lot 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.470
 silent you can only hear the stop but 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.630
 nice mechanic what makes you feel 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.990
 that entered well the gear does not sit 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.480
 there are no other noises or others 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.660
 problems using this unit 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.150
 in short, a car to the 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.470
 segment b but very large you have seen 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.150
 of the introduction as well as seats 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.450
 rear can be folded into 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.940
 smart way then a car 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.820
 that sure but we will definitely try the 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.160
 network strive more in depth but that for 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.350
 this first contact 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.060
 really convinces a lot even about 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.060
 better than the andrea galeazzi engines
