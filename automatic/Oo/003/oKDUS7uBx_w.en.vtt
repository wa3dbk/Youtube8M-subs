 Anatomy short and sweet today goes the knee joint 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.109
 the knee joint 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.230
 Datacert's cool action game had to be its biggest and heaviest luggage 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.239

 the tibia the tibia 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.900

 Winner side to see the biggest sesame leg of the human 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 body 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.210
 the kneecap or parts divisions 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.660
 the topic of work certificate which belongs to bones projection on Vonn 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.350
 the articular cartilage clock 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.040
 they are also considered as 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 and lies »in Kunduz Lotter Wales and the customer 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.310
 Mediators 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.770
 I do not care what I'm like 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.140
 that's backed up by a lot of ban structures though that is 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.390
 prevent the cooks elements 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.140
 of the knee joint too strong 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.220
 against each other 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 move 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.670
 the kneecap itself embedded it for example in a scene that is 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.289
 The soul of the Musculus Quadriceps demo he is from above, so to speak 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.940
 over the kneecap in the way 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.510
 the Kieler pulls 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.120
 almost embedded in this tendon 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 because of course I am also addressed 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.940
 the left becomes 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.430
 even the other railway structures 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340
 stabilized 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.830
 on the one hand, it's the Bender pages 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.270
 I was here 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.920
 and see here 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.000
 and then inside the knee 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.600
 so could cruciate ligaments 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.459
 which one sees here and here look at these bands Mainz just once 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 Lotería is one you can see here at Harvard in Bavaria 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.640
 runs and here medial 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600
 corresponding characters one also this is sidewall 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.170
 as leader mentors 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.310
 Collateral r Lather Allah 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.350
 that of the opposite side as the ladies of Collateral he 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.019
 like all of them 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.769
 These Bender pages stabilize the knee over the trade name and 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.099
 because you're stressing it so Bush simply strays into cradles 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.459
 Loads in the horizontal plane 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.609
 Kimura and Tibia are coming so you can see that the band prevented the knee from being there 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.949
 on the medial lateral unfolds 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.479
 according to bangkok tours 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.619
 This is also thanks to the finish to find that the knee is hinged that it 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.130
 soon no longer its function 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.069
 Fulfills 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.169
 other important benders are located inside the knee joint 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.209
 to that I believe »Kniegelenk Male 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.370
 You travel a bit to make us better visible 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.810
 the senses two of the national anterior cruciate ligament it ladies 2 koci 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.959
 atomic terry 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.959
 incomprehensible that the application Koci Atom Poster Reuss 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.289
 These two countries stabilize the knee joint 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.939
 opposite to different Leone Tebbe year in the 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.369
 since Italy so done in this inside 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.769
 you can see that fakes 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.769
 as if the anterior cruciate ligament would prevent 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.490
 the tibia 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.309
 after and here you was over the February 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:14.679
 is moved 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.589
 Conversely, the posterior cruciate prevents the tibia 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.399
 after post-areal clock 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.709
 is postponed to February 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.499
 she comes with a certain is accordingly finish to zoom 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:29.859
 Drawers phenomenon, for example, the rest of the anterior cruciate ligament itself 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.260
 Pull pet holder towards the front 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.490
 Primor denote what woman from drawers phenomenon reports like us 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.749
 almost like a drawer 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.089
 can pull out of the joint 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.659
 When we look at the client from the inside, they also have two important ones 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.539
 Structures and the 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.539
 from Rostock still an existing one are the so-called Minis can 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.709
 on the one hand who sees the outer meniscus the meniscus Lotter Wales 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.720
 and here on the medial side of the knee 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.869
 the meniscus mediales 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.869
 in him Minis kiss 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.239
 with the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.099
 Sanis hid in the band 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.719
 These ministers have a very important function 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.060
 and that is the same as seven competitions 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.060
 unlike what happens between the articular surfaces 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.790
 of the femur 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.539
 and the tebbe out 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.959
 and also make for a better power distribution mky 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.889
 we do not completely see the first articular surfaces between team years four times 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:21.739
 Competition are 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.740
 and the ministers are in principle the same one could say salmon Ruhr oil with the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.710
 between the two 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.050
 Bones are created simply by filling them 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.509
 because the knee joint is so not so un-complex structured steered 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.720
 Structures exist more to the knee joint they experience in Dock Shack 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:39.289
 can change
