 mistake here and as good as usual 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.660
 in the channel now we are going to have a 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.260
 new review of a gaming product in 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.199
 this case is about a mouse and it is the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.550
 mouse of mars gaming mm5 as it is 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.190
 custom also from now 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.890
 we will do the mouse draw among all 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.089
 the comments that are in this video 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.220
 all of you who have commented between 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.440
 they choose a random person to the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.170
 which I will contact via youtube after 7 days 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.089
 exactly and by a private courier 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.600
 from youtube or google plus which is the same 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:02.660
 and then we will have the mouse draw in 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.030
 Any case kids the mouse dmm 5 of 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.179
 Mars Gaming is one of the best 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.560
 mice that I have seen quality-price os 

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:12.619
 I say one of the best but 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.140
 personally it what it is 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.210
 of mice that I have tried 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.880
 try on hand is undoubtedly the best 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.619
 mouse that I could prove is going to 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.539
 It seems an exaggeration but it is not 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.360
 It is not that I have tried a quantity 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.550
 huge of mice but between 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.520
 about 50 or so I could have 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.800
 try in my life this mouse takes the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.229
 palm in fact is infinitely better 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.530
 that the mouse that I'm using myself so 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.030
 Well it hurt me to spoil it but what 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.739
 we're going to draw so it's not very 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.220
 expensive the mouse and that is another of the 

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:48.289
 advantages what are the characteristics 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.649
 of this mouse that is the main thing that 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.629
 you have to study it to see what 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.640
 base us to buy or not this kind of 

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:59.010
 good mouse the mouse this one has a 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.510
 laser sensor called down vale 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.940
 has a capacity to reach 16 thousand 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.010
 400 pp and is a fool for you 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.370
 make an idea the mouse that is a mouse 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.790
 gamer of milk reaches 6400 dp and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.940
 this reaches 16,400 has 30 genes of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.150
 acceleration and thousands of deaths this for 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.850
 the most technical people the mouse if what 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.930
 you put to the maximum sensitivity is 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.450
 incredibly fast and incredibly 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.040
 obviously most of the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.740
 people will not be able to handle those 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.750
 sensibilities and how to handle 'aces' to a 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.540
 lower sensitivity me for example what 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.069
 handling to 3500 of countries and the experience 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.599
 the truth has been wonderful 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.700
 to make the most of it 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.680
 I recommend a good mat because 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.810
 The truth is that he has problems 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.540
 mouse if you see it on a surface not 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.290
 flat as it happens to most of 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.819
 Optical or laser mice 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.159
 so I recommend a good 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.719
 mat if you want the precision more 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.549
 absolute but we will achieve greater 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.230
 precision degree that I've seen so far 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.420
 with a mouse 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.879
 then the mouse this is a mouse 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.340
 designed for video games is very comfortable 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.110
 the two clicks we have one thing that to me 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.330
 it bothers me a lot the mice is that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.819
 clicks are not comfortable to do much 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.709
 noise that are hard and so on this mouse 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.769
 it has some very smooth clicks and also 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.580
 It has a lot of buttons 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.980
 Configurable has 13 mechanical buttons 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.079
 customizable, you can 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.780
 customize from the interface that comes 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.720
 when installing the mouse in which is hyper 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.370
 simple to operate and good to the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.100
 that you like to customize your mouse 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.980
 to have 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.950
 things shortcuts in the mouse itself because os 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.780
 the mouse will be extremely useful 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.180
 has one thing that I've loved 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.750
 which is the bottom is metal 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.060
 ok and that allows a glide 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.070
 absolutely light the new sun goes to 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.200
 that is not going to mess up the truth is that 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.600
 used it enough to prove it and the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.950
 mouse has been without problems 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.050
 completely clean the others the others 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.760
 Yes mice that I tend to foul the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.800
 metal surface allows to move 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.380
 very gently in 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.170
 in hair mats with which 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.840
 moves very well when moving with him 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.120
 and also in the lower part has a 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.160
 plate that you can open and you can take out 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.170
 weight or put weight on the people who 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.000
 like light mice you can 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.560
 remove weight the mouse and the people who 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.800
 like the heavy mice like this is 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.450
 case you can add weight the mouse 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.970
 It also has a cover surface 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.400
 with a layer like the ozone mouse 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.430
 that I teach you is even softer is how 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.930
 velvety and you can not escape 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.610
 hand is not impossible mouse 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.950
 supports absolutely even when the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.220
 hands sweat from the heat and so on 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.930
 The mouse does not slide absolutely, so 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.780
 you can always have a perfect grip 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.280
 when it comes to playing video games 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.810
 then what is the price of this mouse 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.520
 because what is probably what 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.260
 more you are interested then look at the mouse 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.920
 right now in amazon is the price of 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.110
 39 with 93 euros which for a mouse 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.870
 gamer and in addition to very high category 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.850
 how is this is absolutely laughable 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.760
 It is very cheap for a mouse gamer 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.419
 whenever we go a high mouse 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.700
 quality 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.680
 let's count the 60 euros have this 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.480
 mouse for 40 euros and sometimes I have seen 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.240
 at least I've come to see it by 32 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.770
 euros in online stores is absolutely 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.320
 fantastic or that people who want 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.990
 a mouse without any doubt I recommend them 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.060
 this later has some pija dlas more 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.560
 as for example what is the cable the 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.890
 cable has a twisted cable with 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.570
 protector with which it is almost impossible 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.500
 what excess break you have to give a lot 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.910
 cane sensitivity has adjustment 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.530
 automatic in the mouse itself in the 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.780
 buttons that are also customizable 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.000
 you can assign another function that are 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.120
 the sides of the center of the wheel 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.409
 mouse has some sensors a 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.849
 luminous identifier in function 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.559
 if you give it up it increases the 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.419
 sensitivity and if you give it down 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:00.809
 decreased sensitivity you can 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:03.689
 customize this also from the 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:06.629
 user interface that comes in the 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.849
 Installation CDs only drawback 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:11.039
 of this good mouse an icon there are two 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.349
 disadvantages of this mouse in the first 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.780
 place that for lefties this mouse is not worth 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:18.030
 It has the typical peculiarity 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.950
 many mice inert next 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.500
 with very elaborate forms is a way 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.060
 very peculiar mouse and the truth is 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.860
 very comfortable what happens is that for the 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.389
 people who want to handle it with their hands 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.720
 left is practically impossible 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.850
 grab that is if you want if you are 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.110
 left-handed if you want a mouse gamer this is 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.210
 it's going to make it complicated because in the 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.490
 right side besides the mouse does not have 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.730
 buttons with which you can not 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.950
 grab and then the other stick that has 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.480
 is the lighting the lighting will be 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.870
 you can customize you can change the 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.850
 mars gaming logo and put the one 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.340
 absolute quantity a huge amount of 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.140
 colors green blue red whatever you want 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.600
 the problem is that the mouse wheel and 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.980
 the line of speed sensors does not 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.450
 change they will always be in red already 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.669
 I like that both the game 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.290
 logo as the other part with which this 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.600
 here you can not customize it if any 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.479
 people burgos will annoy you as much as 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.800
 bother I do not think but surely I 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.710
 leave the lighting in red too 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.229
 you can activate the lighting so the 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.750
 degree of customization is pretty 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.040
 high then those kids this is all 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.260
 that I had to comment on this 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.580
 I recommend you to all 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
 find a mouse I recommend it 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.490
 absolutely for me it is the king and ya 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.170
 I say the best mouse I've tried until 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.150
 now what are the pros of this mouse 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.500
 on the one hand the user interface 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.690
 absolutely customizable 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.090
 configurable the quality of the mouse has 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.470
 an excellent manufacturing quality as well 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.330
 as I told you that the keyboard of mars 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.000
 gaming did not have the best quality of 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.920
 manufacture that could be given or ordered to 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.650
 a keyboard in this case the mouse the 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.960
 quality is incredible I find it very good 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.610
 and I can not believe it's the price 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.130
 that is the third positive point its 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.740
 price and then in negative points the 

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:58.980
 lighting and the one that can not be you 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.570
 used by left-handed people with the 

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.950
 same community of comfort that what 

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.000
 could use a distro so 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.920
 hoping that you liked this 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.570
 analysis likes is like that in the description
