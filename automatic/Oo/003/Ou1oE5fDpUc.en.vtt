so that's the one you're used to the one
we've<00:00:17.760> been<00:00:17.940> seeing<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.869> product<00:00:19.199> photon

the 400 series and these ones are the
new<00:00:26.760> 401<00:00:27.480> series<00:00:29.000> we'll<00:00:30.000> do<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> comparison<00:00:30.750> in

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
new 401 series we'll do a comparison in

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.720

just a second this is the gray handle
when<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> believe<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.719> blades<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.050> little<00:00:34.079> bit

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
when I believe the blades a little bit

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.630 
when I believe the blades a little bit
different<00:00:34.649> we'll<00:00:34.739> compare<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> second

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.180 
different we'll compare that in a second
and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.239> also<00:00:36.390> comes<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.190> bronzed

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and then it also comes with the bronzed

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.240 
and then it also comes with the bronzed
blade<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:40.260> think<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> main<00:00:40.980> main

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260 
can see on the newer model the finish is
a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.440> bit<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.680> uniform<00:00:50.059> there's<00:00:51.059> not

knife out so well so we'll go ahead and
check<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> detent<00:01:58.350> again<00:01:58.619> pushing<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.520> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
check the detent again pushing it in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.690 
check the detent again pushing it in
slowly<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:01.009> popping<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.100> back<00:02:02.130> into<00:02:02.430> place

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
slowly and popping it back into place

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.929 
slowly and popping it back into place
that<00:02:03.270> resistance<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.829> ikbs<00:02:05.340> system<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
that resistance and the ikbs system is

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.580 
that resistance and the ikbs system is
what<00:02:06.090> gives<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.450> such<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> smooth<00:02:07.229> smooth

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
what gives it such a smooth smooth

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
what gives it such a smooth smooth
opening<00:02:08.280> action<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.060> there<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.619> 401

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
opening action so there is the 401

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.699 
opening action so there is the 401
series

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
series

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.729 
series
and<00:02:12.799> onion<00:02:13.040> ripple<00:02:13.340> -<00:02:13.959> there's<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.109> zoom<00:02:15.469> in<00:02:15.680> of

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
and onion ripple - there's a zoom in of

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.459 
and onion ripple - there's a zoom in of
the<00:02:16.219> bronzed<00:02:16.670> colored<00:02:17.030> one<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:18.170> I'd<00:02:18.290> love<00:02:18.409> to

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
the bronzed colored one so I'd love to

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.750 
the bronzed colored one so I'd love to
know<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.709> guys<00:02:18.829> have<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.099> say<00:02:19.250> about<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.609> new
