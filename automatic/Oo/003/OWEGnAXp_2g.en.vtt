now I'm gonna bring this into the review
just<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> simple<00:00:46.739> fact<00:00:46.770> they're<00:00:47.100> so

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
just for the simple fact they're so

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100 
just for the simple fact they're so
similar<00:00:47.700> they're<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> same<00:00:48.360> price<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
similar they're the same price and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
similar they're the same price and
they're<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:50.760> four<00:00:51.059> carriers<00:00:51.449> here

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
they're on to the top four carriers here

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990 
they're on to the top four carriers here
in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> state<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.620> know<00:00:53.280> there's<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.760> few

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
in the state so you know there's a few

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 
in the state so you know there's a few
things<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.390> separate<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.460> first<00:00:56.460> time<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
things that separate them first time I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.160 
things that separate them first time I
talked<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> Sprint<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:57.660> first<00:00:57.960> off

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
talked about the Sprint one first off

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.130 
talked about the Sprint one first off
it's<00:00:58.770> got<00:00:59.010> Google<00:00:59.399> Wallet<00:00:59.550> in<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
it's got Google Wallet in here and it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.709 
it's got Google Wallet in here and it
also<00:01:01.350> takes<00:01:01.920> advantage<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.489> Google<00:01:02.820> Voice<00:01:03.000> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
also takes advantage of Google Voice so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.210 
also takes advantage of Google Voice so
what<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.140> about<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> want<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> use

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
what I like about is if you want to use

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.600 
what I like about is if you want to use
your<00:01:05.369> Google<00:01:05.580> Voice<00:01:05.939> number<00:01:07.280> completely<00:01:08.280> be

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
your Google Voice number completely be

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.690 
your Google Voice number completely be
it<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.240> your<00:01:09.390> text<00:01:09.720> messages<00:01:10.700> from

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it you can get your text messages from

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
it you can get your text messages from
Google<00:01:12.150> Voice<00:01:12.299> directly<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.140> phone<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
Google Voice directly to your phone so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.469 
Google Voice directly to your phone so
you<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:13.950> your<00:01:13.979> Google<00:01:14.130> Voice<00:01:14.549> number<00:01:14.880> if

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you can use your Google Voice number if

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.020 
you can use your Google Voice number if
somebody<00:01:15.930> calls<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:17.490> ring<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
somebody calls that it will ring this

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
somebody calls that it will ring this
phone<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.590> doing<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
phone but it's not like it's doing the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920 
phone but it's not like it's doing the
forward<00:01:20.670> thing<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.330> even<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> make<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
forward thing and even if you make a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.550 
forward thing and even if you make a
call<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.860> integration<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:24.259> tighter<00:01:25.259> on

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
call the integration is tighter on

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960 
call the integration is tighter on
Sprint<00:01:25.979> than<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> isn't<00:01:26.430> any<00:01:26.580> other<00:01:26.670> carrier

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
Sprint than it isn't any other carrier

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.569 
Sprint than it isn't any other carrier
so<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.270> gives<00:01:27.570> them<00:01:27.720> big<00:01:28.009> kudos<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
so that gives them big kudos to that and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.330 
so that gives them big kudos to that and
then<00:01:30.180> another<00:01:30.299> thing<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.380> even

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
then another thing with this is even

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.859 
then another thing with this is even
with<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.759> said<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> text<00:01:33.360> message<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
with like I said the text message is the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.109 
with like I said the text message is the
same<00:01:34.110> thing<00:01:34.409> even<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> send<00:01:35.250> MMS<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:36.000> will

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
same thing even if you send MMS it will

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.719 
same thing even if you send MMS it will
show<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.740> same<00:01:38.009> feed<00:01:38.400> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
show up in the right in the same feed of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.760 
show up in the right in the same feed of
the<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.240> text<00:01:39.540> messages<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.110> that's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the the text messages so that's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.910 
the the text messages so that's
definitely<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.340> good<00:01:41.520> thing<00:01:42.110> as<00:01:43.110> far<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.500> speed

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
definitely a good thing as far as speed

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.340 
definitely a good thing as far as speed
on<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.340> we're<00:01:44.549> gonna<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.119> their<00:01:45.329> 3G<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
on here we're gonna be on their 3G and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.090 
on here we're gonna be on their 3G and
let's<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:48.320> let's<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> detect

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
let's just go to let's go to detect

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:59.260 
let's just go to let's go to detect
snobs<00:01:50.520> real<00:01:51.450> quick

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.030 

see<00:01:59.840> how<00:01:59.960> fast<00:02:00.229> that<00:02:00.560> loads<00:02:00.830> up<00:02:01.070> on<00:02:01.280> here

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
see how fast that loads up on here

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.190 
see how fast that loads up on here
honestly<00:02:04.040> even<00:02:04.549> though<00:02:04.760> it<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.119> 3G<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.080> is

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
honestly even though it is 3G and it is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.600 
honestly even though it is 3G and it is
rather<00:02:06.560> slow<00:02:08.020> it's<00:02:09.020> honestly<00:02:09.619> not<00:02:10.009> all<00:02:10.340> that

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
rather slow it's honestly not all that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.120 
rather slow it's honestly not all that

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
the most part you know I don't really

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.210 
the most part you know I don't really
you<00:02:15.470> don't<00:02:15.890> notice<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.580> as<00:02:16.790> much<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:18.470> mainly

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
you don't notice it as much it mainly

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.830 
you don't notice it as much it mainly
obviously<00:02:19.670> when<00:02:19.819> you're<00:02:19.940> downloading<00:02:20.239> an<00:02:20.660> app

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
obviously when you're downloading an app

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.530 
obviously when you're downloading an app

like you know I downloaded Chrome over

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.479 
like you know I downloaded Chrome over
3G<00:02:24.020> which<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.319> like<00:02:24.440> 19<00:02:24.890> Meg's<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.340> just

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
3G which is like 19 Meg's and it just

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.250 
3G which is like 19 Meg's and it just
took<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.910> took<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:26.480> long<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.780> just<00:02:26.810> ended<00:02:27.170> up

took it took so long I just ended up

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.750 
took it took so long I just ended up
throwing<00:02:27.470> in<00:02:27.650> my<00:02:27.680> bag<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:28.100> didn't<00:02:28.250> even<00:02:28.400> you

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
throwing in my bag I didn't even you

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.160 
throwing in my bag I didn't even you
know<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.090> don't<00:02:29.390> even<00:02:29.510> know<00:02:29.660> when<00:02:29.810> offense<00:02:30.080> you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
know I don't even know when offense you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.530 
know I don't even know when offense you
just<00:02:30.350> took<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.680> long<00:02:30.860> now<00:02:32.709> comparing<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.830> to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
just took so long now comparing that to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.720 
just took so long now comparing that to
you<00:02:35.540> know<00:02:35.660> LTE<00:02:36.110> now<00:02:36.410> obviously<00:02:37.040> if<00:02:37.340> you're<00:02:37.519> on

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
you know LTE now obviously if you're on

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.460 
you know LTE now obviously if you're on
Sprint<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.450> you're<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.810> one<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.080> 15

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
Sprint and you're on one of the 15

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.120 
Sprint and you're on one of the 15
markets<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.010> LTE<00:02:40.340> right<00:02:40.850> now<00:02:42.130> you're

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
markets that have LTE right now you're

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.830 
markets that have LTE right now you're
gonna<00:02:43.250> be<00:02:43.400> happy<00:02:43.730> because<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:44.690> just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
gonna be happy because it's just

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.560 
gonna be happy because it's just
basically<00:02:45.350> at<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.709> point<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.820> have<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.300> you

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
basically at this point you have the you

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.080 
basically at this point you have the you
have<00:02:47.989> unlimited<00:02:48.320> speed<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.400> LTE<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.030> you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
have unlimited speed and it's LTE so you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.860 
have unlimited speed and it's LTE so you
really<00:02:50.420> can't

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
really can't

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.229 
really can't
you<00:02:51.380> really<00:02:51.560> can't<00:02:51.769> hate<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:53.209> I

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
you really can't hate on that but I

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.840 
you really can't hate on that but I
honestly<00:02:53.750> say<00:02:53.989> if<00:02:54.350> most<00:02:55.010> people<00:02:55.160> aren't<00:02:55.580> and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
honestly say if most people aren't and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.360 
honestly say if most people aren't and
they<00:02:56.090> won't<00:02:56.330> be<00:02:56.390> for<00:02:56.630> some<00:02:56.810> time<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:58.250> know

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
they won't be for some time and you know

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.340 
they won't be for some time and you know
just<00:02:58.610> jumping<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.660> know<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> different<00:03:00.200> web

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
just jumping you know the different web

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.490 
just jumping you know the different web
pages<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:02.030> definitely<00:03:02.510> makes<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.350> know<00:03:03.380> a

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
pages it definitely makes it you know a

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.860 
pages it definitely makes it you know a
challenge<00:03:04.190> when<00:03:04.610> you're<00:03:04.730> not<00:03:04.940> using<00:03:05.239> LTE<00:03:05.720> now

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
challenge when you're not using LTE now

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.110 
challenge when you're not using LTE now
that<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.530> right<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:06.980> seem<00:03:07.430> very<00:03:07.700> similar

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
that that right there seem very similar

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.420 
that that right there seem very similar

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
then you know without LTE or with LTE

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.199 
then you know without LTE or with LTE
you<00:03:27.140> won't<00:03:27.350> notice<00:03:27.560> sometimes<00:03:28.430> not<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.910> lot<00:03:29.090> of

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
you won't notice sometimes not a lot of

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.900 
you won't notice sometimes not a lot of
graphics<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.720> doesn't<00:03:30.019> matter<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.310> can

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
graphics it doesn't matter but I can

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.310 
graphics it doesn't matter but I can
honestly<00:03:32.090> it's<00:03:32.600> better<00:03:32.840> than<00:03:32.989> not<00:03:33.079> what<00:03:33.290> I

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
honestly it's better than not what I

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.920 
honestly it's better than not what I
thought<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.739> would<00:03:33.860> be<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:35.600> know<00:03:35.690> for<00:03:35.870> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
thought it would be you know for the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.259 
thought it would be you know for the
most<00:03:36.110> part<00:03:36.380> is<00:03:36.530> actually<00:03:37.340> pretty<00:03:37.549> fast<00:03:37.880> you

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
most part is actually pretty fast you

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.180 
most part is actually pretty fast you
know<00:03:38.780> for<00:03:39.049> surfing<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.440> web<00:03:39.560> now<00:03:39.829> like<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.040> said

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190

you<00:04:04.609> know<00:04:04.640> I'm<00:04:05.060> probably<00:04:05.329> looking<00:04:05.720> for<00:04:05.750> the

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
you know I'm probably looking for the

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.289 
you know I'm probably looking for the
LTE<00:04:06.440> but<00:04:06.769> honestly<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.400> think<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:08.060> build

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
LTE but honestly I think the build

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.420 
LTE but honestly I think the build
quality<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:09.139> there's<00:04:09.799> something<00:04:10.100> about<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
quality and there's something about the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.340 
quality and there's something about the
Sprint<00:04:10.730> when<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:10.970> just

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
Sprint when I just

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.700 
Sprint when I just
like<00:04:11.440> more<00:04:12.180> just<00:04:13.180> overall<00:04:13.630> I<00:04:13.780> just<00:04:13.990> like<00:04:14.140> yes<00:04:14.470> I

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
like more just overall I just like yes I

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.800 
like more just overall I just like yes I
just<00:04:15.040> like<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.340> more<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.850> think<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.360> runs<00:04:16.630> a

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
just like it more and I think it runs a

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
just like it more and I think it runs a
tad<00:04:17.290> bit<00:04:17.560> faster<00:04:18.420> and<00:04:19.420> just<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.050> design<00:04:20.410> of<00:04:20.680> it

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
tad bit faster and just the design of it

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.280 
tad bit faster and just the design of it
just<00:04:21.250> appeals<00:04:21.610> to<00:04:21.760> me<00:04:21.880> personally<00:04:22.390> more<00:04:22.600> but

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
just appeals to me personally more but

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.440 
just appeals to me personally more but
once<00:04:23.890> again<00:04:24.160> since<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.610> doesn't<00:04:24.820> have<00:04:24.940> LT<00:04:25.270> in

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
once again since it doesn't have LT in

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.840 
once again since it doesn't have LT in
my<00:04:25.600> area<00:04:25.960> yet<00:04:26.230> I<00:04:26.410> can't<00:04:26.770> fully<00:04:27.040> recommend<00:04:27.490> it

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
my area yet I can't fully recommend it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.670 
my area yet I can't fully recommend it
unless<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.630> have<00:04:28.900> no<00:04:29.110> choice<00:04:29.320> but<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.590> use

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
unless you have no choice but to use

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.190 
unless you have no choice but to use
Sprint<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.630> therefore<00:04:31.630> would<00:04:31.810> be<00:04:31.930> between

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
Sprint and therefore would be between
