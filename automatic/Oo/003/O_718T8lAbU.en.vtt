00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello to all this number 41 we 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:11.460
 offer a fairly simple delivery of the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.340
 indoor heating system not 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:20.000
 less than his order so a priori nothing 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.289
 of well complicated to do except that 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.210
 as usual with Altai ah it's not 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.619
 necessarily numbers that deliver more 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.740
 of parts that are the most complicated to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 go up and there I once again had to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.559
 pester against my big hands as much 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.680
 to stick the sticker that's good 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.489
 that was fortunately but then for 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.700
 position the small joystick 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.260
 good there are many hole loans but 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.910
 obviously they are too big so he 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.760
 need a little bit and burrs and the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.199
 joysticks but you can imagine that the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.480
 pieces being very fine it's not done 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.770
 easily 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.629
 finally there it was a beautiful a beautiful 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.160
 part in grip I even broke this 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.030
 manna is here but finally it's good 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.790
 do not see it is not seen at the editing but 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.680
 even taking precautions it's 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.420
 was not easy so thank you the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.700
 his next invite came to fix this 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 bathroom control ventilation block 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.150
 where there is no peace no problem 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.970
 a cc the usual screws ah good 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.750
 went very well 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.780
 finally there was no reason for that 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.409
 is going on otherwise the stéphane card 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.729
 larouche the positionne 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:40.560
 here we are definitely talking about it the most 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.689
 for this heating commands bug 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.499
 then we were given davis ip for 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:51.250
 attach the apron to the floor and 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:54.459
 lives ahead except that these lives that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.759
 they are way too big so 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:00.039
 finally I have what I did 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.539
 as I keep all the screws I 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.280
 found that lévis fp with the same 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.250
 length and a diameter a tiny 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.129
 little inferior to ip vices and so I 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.290
 fixed my apron with his vices fp of 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.840
 reference and it went well 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.670
 because levis is possible this is 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.879
 way too big in my opinion the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.019
 plastic would have melted or a good point f 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.530
 it was much easier to do with 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.620
 dfb and so here is the tabbee is mounted 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.750
 on the floor so it starts to 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.629
 take a lot of space it takes 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.920
 turn too but we start to see 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:38.079
 assembly words and so we on 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.280
 really starts to realize the 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.599
 volumetry of the bns 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.950
 it's going to be a nice machine then 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.420
 why did they give us this conduit 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.700
 in this number especially as he 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.870
 will not have to climb in number 42 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.190
 is rather slow 43 to see so the most 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.569
 is dressed who continue to dress 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.230
 months heating control parts 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.060
 very fragile and half would be inappropriate 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.209
 otherwise everything is fine soon subscribe 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.209
 you
