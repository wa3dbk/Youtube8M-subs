00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
have a real pancake yeah you get the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.460 
have a real pancake yeah you get the
idea<00:03:50.600> we<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.720> gonna<00:03:50.930> make<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.140> pancakes

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
idea we just gonna make the pancakes

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.050 
idea we just gonna make the pancakes
right<00:03:52.010> here<00:03:52.250> we<00:03:52.310> go<00:03:52.430> then<00:03:52.640> I'm<00:03:52.790> just<00:03:52.970> gonna

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
right here we go then I'm just gonna

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.460 
right here we go then I'm just gonna
speed<00:03:53.390> on<00:03:53.540> some<00:03:53.810> butter

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
speed on some butter

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.310 
speed on some butter
what<00:03:54.830> about<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.490> ladle<00:03:56.180> spoons<00:03:56.450> full<00:03:56.840> for<00:03:57.290> a

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
what about to ladle spoons full for a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.480 
what about to ladle spoons full for a
big<00:03:57.680> pancake

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
big pancake

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.400 
big pancake
so<00:03:58.940> get<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.270> there<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.690> then<00:03:59.990> pick<00:04:00.170> your<00:04:00.200> pan

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
so get on there and then pick your pan

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.170 
so get on there and then pick your pan
up<00:04:00.560> squirt<00:04:00.890> all<00:04:01.100> around<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.730> edges<00:04:01.850> like<00:04:02.000> this

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
up squirt all around the edges like this

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.970 
up squirt all around the edges like this
while<00:04:02.570> it's<00:04:02.720> all<00:04:02.840> nice<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.200> loose<00:04:03.320> just<00:04:03.800> take

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
while it's all nice and loose just take

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.560 
while it's all nice and loose just take
about<00:04:04.070> 90<00:04:04.400> seconds<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:04.910> reckon<00:04:05.180> maybe<00:04:05.360> even

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
about 90 seconds I reckon maybe even

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.510 
about 90 seconds I reckon maybe even
less<00:04:05.750> than<00:04:05.840> that<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.170> what<00:04:06.620> your<00:04:06.740> pan<00:04:06.920> is<00:04:06.950> and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
less than that and what your pan is and

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.750 
less than that and what your pan is and
then<00:04:07.700> we<00:04:07.790> toss<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:10.130> what<00:04:10.250> you'll<00:04:10.370> find<00:04:10.489> is

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
then we toss it so what you'll find is

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.310 
then we toss it so what you'll find is
the<00:04:10.790> edges<00:04:11.180> will<00:04:11.330> start<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.630> cook<00:04:11.780> first<00:04:12.020> even

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
the edges will start to cook first even

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.420 
the edges will start to cook first even
so<00:04:12.410> I'll<00:04:12.500> just<00:04:12.650> hack<00:04:12.800> away<00:04:12.950> at<00:04:13.040> them<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.340> push

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
so I'll just hack away at them and push

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.620 
so I'll just hack away at them and push
them<00:04:13.459> in<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.150> middle<00:04:14.360> will<00:04:14.450> take<00:04:14.600> a

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
them in but the middle will take a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.210 
them in but the middle will take a
longer<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:15.050> set<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.650> can<00:04:15.770> use<00:04:15.890> like<00:04:16.040> one<00:04:16.130> of

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
longer to set so you can use like one of

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.530 
longer to set so you can use like one of
these<00:04:16.310> palette<00:04:16.609> knives<00:04:16.760> I'm<00:04:17.060> using<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.330> fish

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
these palette knives I'm using a fish

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.670 
these palette knives I'm using a fish
slice<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:17.989> can<00:04:18.109> actually<00:04:18.200> get<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.470> bit

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
slice so you can actually get a bit

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.560 
slice so you can actually get a bit
easier<00:04:19.070> under<00:04:19.250> there<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.729> won't<00:04:19.910> cut<00:04:20.239> into<00:04:20.479> the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
easier under there it won't cut into the

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.030 
easier under there it won't cut into the
pancake<00:04:20.960> and<00:04:21.140> you<00:04:21.200> can<00:04:21.320> have<00:04:21.410> a<00:04:21.470> look<00:04:21.590> when

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
pancake and you can have a look when

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.590 
pancake and you can have a look when
it's<00:04:22.160> browning<00:04:22.370> underneath<00:04:22.760> when<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.360> start

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
it's browning underneath when you start

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.089 
it's browning underneath when you start
to<00:04:23.660> see<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.840> browning<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.440> loosen

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
to see it browning and that loosen

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.110 
to see it browning and that loosen
then<00:04:25.610> we<00:04:26.330> toss<00:04:27.580> okay<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:28.639> it's<00:04:28.789> been<00:04:28.909> 90

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
then we toss okay so it's been 90

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.760 
then we toss okay so it's been 90
seconds<00:04:29.509> look<00:04:29.750> how<00:04:29.900> easy<00:04:30.139> that<00:04:30.319> is<00:04:30.379> moving

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
seconds look how easy that is moving

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.409 
seconds look how easy that is moving
about<00:04:30.889> in<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.069> pan<00:04:31.280> mash<00:04:31.580> that's<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.180> first

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
about in the pan mash that's the first

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.939 
about in the pan mash that's the first
time<00:04:32.539> ever<00:04:32.750> on<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:32.960> video<00:04:33.199> about<00:04:33.349> a<00:04:33.409> year<00:04:33.560> and
