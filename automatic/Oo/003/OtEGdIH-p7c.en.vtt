score<00:00:25.769> five<00:00:26.010> against<00:00:26.279> blackpool<00:00:26.699> as<00:00:26.820> well<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
score five against blackpool as well I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.080 
score five against blackpool as well I
just<00:00:27.960> feel<00:00:28.109> today<00:00:28.380> probably<00:00:28.980> certainly<00:00:29.880> match

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
though was not for me probably just

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.940 
though was not for me probably just
edged<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.099> because<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:33.180> know<00:00:33.800> wolves<00:00:34.800> are

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
edged it because you know wolves are

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.830

me is greatly score five goals but the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
me is greatly score five goals but the
shape<00:01:15.479> without<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.110> board's<00:01:16.320> day<00:01:16.650> was<00:01:17.040> much

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
shape without the board's day was much

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.649 
shape without the board's day was much
much<00:01:17.640> better<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.210> saw<00:01:18.390> against

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
much better than we saw against

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.820 
much better than we saw against
huddersfield<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> other<00:01:19.470> night<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
huddersfield the other night and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.429 
huddersfield the other night and
certainly<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.340> Brentford<00:01:20.939> last<00:01:21.720> weekend<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
certainly at Brentford last weekend I

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.200 
certainly at Brentford last weekend I
thought<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> shape<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.520> excellent<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
thought the shape was excellent and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
thought the shape was excellent and
that's<00:01:24.479> where<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.810> control<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.590> game<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
that's where you control the game is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
that's where you control the game is
from<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.460> shape<00:01:26.790> without<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.240> ball<00:01:27.450> then

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
from your shape without the ball then

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
from your shape without the ball then
Darby<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.040> play<00:01:29.100> football<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
Darby can go on and play football and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.550 
Darby can go on and play football and
score<00:01:30.119> goals<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.720> they<00:01:30.780> proved<00:01:31.049> they<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.409> do

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
score goals and they proved they can do

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.950 
score goals and they proved they can do
that<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> thought<00:01:32.579> all<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.909> all<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.360> was<00:01:33.479> next

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that so I thought all in all it was next

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
that so I thought all in all it was next
and<00:01:34.170> performance<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> say<00:01:35.460> Steve

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and performance and as I say Steve

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.130 
and performance and as I say Steve
McClaren<00:01:36.509> could<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.750> right<00:01:36.930> about<00:01:37.259> it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
McClaren could be right about it

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.000 
McClaren could be right about it
who<00:01:39.130> stood<00:01:39.400> out<00:01:39.580> for<00:01:39.790> you<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:39.970> particular<00:01:41.010> well

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
who stood out for you in particular well

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.320 
who stood out for you in particular well
I<00:01:42.040> mean<00:01:42.310> it's<00:01:42.490> always<00:01:42.640> difficult<00:01:42.909> isn't<00:01:43.210> it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
I mean it's always difficult isn't it

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330 
I mean it's always difficult isn't it

Siddhartha's<00:02:55.209> goal<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.630> thought<00:02:55.840> today<00:02:56.140> was

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
Siddhartha's goal I thought today was

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.340 
Siddhartha's goal I thought today was
his<00:02:57.130> best<00:02:57.310> performance<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.030> Derbyshire<00:02:58.630> he

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
his best performance in Derbyshire he

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.500

very<00:03:01.750> good<00:03:02.019> he<00:03:02.650> got<00:03:02.860> on<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.130> ball<00:03:03.340> but<00:03:03.610> he<00:03:04.030> also

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
very good he got on the ball but he also

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.539 
very good he got on the ball but he also
did<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.720> defensive<00:03:05.350> side<00:03:05.590> well<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.100> kept<00:03:06.400> a

is<00:04:18.489> consistency<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.080> think<00:04:20.320> today<00:04:20.470> that

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
is consistency and I think today that

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.320 
is consistency and I think today that
say<00:04:21.070> they've<00:04:21.280> shown<00:04:21.609> what<00:04:21.880> they<00:04:22.030> are<00:04:22.150> capable

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
say they've shown what they are capable

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.540 
say they've shown what they are capable
of<00:04:22.750> they'll<00:04:23.500> be<00:04:23.620> pleasing<00:04:24.010> themselves<00:04:24.130> going

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550

of they'll be pleasing themselves going
into<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.910> break<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.900> good<00:04:26.050> time<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.380> off

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
into the break is it good time to off

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.500 
into the break is it good time to off
the<00:04:26.560> brake<00:04:26.800> well<00:04:27.310> when<00:04:27.490> you<00:04:27.610> win<00:04:27.790> five<00:04:28.150> nearly

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
the brake well when you win five nearly

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.300 
the brake well when you win five nearly
problem<00:04:28.810> saying<00:04:29.050> no<00:04:29.140> but<00:04:29.470> about<00:04:29.770> seven<00:04:30.100> games

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
problem saying no but about seven games

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.700 
problem saying no but about seven games
in<00:04:30.460> 20<00:04:30.760> days<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.419> think<00:04:32.080> now<00:04:32.260> they<00:04:32.470> probably

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
in 20 days I think now they probably

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.610 
in 20 days I think now they probably
need<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.040> breather<00:04:33.510> regroup<00:04:34.510> maybe<00:04:35.290> get<00:04:35.470> more

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
need a breather regroup maybe get more

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.080 
need a breather regroup maybe get more
to<00:04:35.800> injured<00:04:36.190> players<00:04:36.430> but<00:04:36.700> people<00:04:37.030> like

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
to injured players but people like

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.460 
to injured players but people like
create<00:04:37.419> bryson<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.720> good<00:04:40.870> time<00:04:41.200> for<00:04:41.230> a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
create bryson so it's a good time for a

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.500 
create bryson so it's a good time for a
break<00:04:41.740> I<00:04:41.950> feel<00:04:42.250> because<00:04:42.520> II<00:04:42.730> I<00:04:42.850> say<00:04:43.120> they<00:04:43.240> go<00:04:43.360> in

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510

with<00:04:43.660> good<00:04:43.810> heart<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.380> they'll<00:04:44.590> already<00:04:44.740> be
