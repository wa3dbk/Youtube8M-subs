00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
it's just a box top from an old box that
I<00:01:03.780> had<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> used<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> my<00:01:04.799> bowls<00:01:05.250> set<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.850> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
I had I used one of my bowls set it in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
I had I used one of my bowls set it in
the<00:01:06.060> center<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.570> I'd<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> nice<00:01:07.049> circle

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the center so I'd have a nice circle

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.090

traced<00:01:08.640> around<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.240> cut<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.290> then<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
traced around it cut that out and then I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.179
