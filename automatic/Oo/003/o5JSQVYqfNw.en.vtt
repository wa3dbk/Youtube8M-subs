00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.040
 Today I talk about origami 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.330
 You know what a mistake I have. 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 Absolutely yes 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.110
 It was in that little boat that you made the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.250
 airplane that until today you do then 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.529
 entered miami 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.900
 usually only the deception he and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.760
 worked with the role 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 today we are going to work I teach the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.710
 you as a worker and range and with 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.400
 non-woven fabric it needs to be 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 prepared to be able to do the double jury 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.880
 win how we prepare say several 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.850
 revenue 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.329
 one of the recipes is made with a friend of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.670
 corn cassava starch and in this case 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:48.170
 here we will use two measures of glue 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.170
 for a measure of water is very easy 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.469
 there is also another recipe that I've heard 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.829
 talk is made with gelatin 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.539
 I just tried several recipes and I 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.600
 I thought that with glue 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.339
 you have a better and better result 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.540
 still if you can work with the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.189
 brush because it gives a better performance and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.360
 another advantage of working with the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.170
 I know that glue is very fast then 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.650
 You can go to work practically in the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.390
 same day making the play play only if 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.530
 you work on a surface 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.930
 lisa 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.210
 for example plastic if you do not put 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:42.509
 to dry you also use is like the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:45.540
 ceramics or other marbling occurred 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.149
 something that is beauty for later 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.250
 of the cup does not stick to being for example 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.229
 It's a fabric I've already taken, it's a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.909
 fabric that has been hard to work with 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.759
 If you noticed he does not have a trim 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.700
 it is a tightly woven fabric 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.130
 cotton fabrics are already better 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.239
 banana that's easy enough we 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.519
 start raising tip 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.519
 in this case the side with side 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.500
 in the back we will mark the other direction 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:25.280
 central line well marks 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:30.470
 Let's go around in the fabric with 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.390
 the speck opens 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.489
 we did this to mark the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.920
 square the same way in the same way 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.470
 we'll make the other side tip 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.079
 with the dot 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.989
 this time if you realize that your 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.870
 square before the mayor takes advantage of 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:53.260
 give a little squeeze he cuts what is 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.260
 left over because this is going to show up here 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.760
 open we will not form the preliminary basis 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.160
 how do you do you notice that 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.480
 there is a square here in the corner and this 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.870
 square it is formed by two folds 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.160
 mountain that are works that have relief 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:25.750
 So we'll put together all the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:29.120
 Stitches here sinking this side 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.739
 to form the preliminary base does not 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:38.299
 as was the movement on the other side 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:42.709
 do it now we 'll tip with 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:47.989
 point at the back and do the same thing 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:50.900
 across open leads that point to the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.650
 brand that we made fold over it 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.519
 same 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:59.480
 so turn around and do the same thing 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.269
 Furthermore the bridge had to the line and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.040
 fold over itself 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.040
 now we're going to put these two tips together 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.870
 It's the same thing on the other side. 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.970
 these two tips 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.760
 Let this side book up to 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.090
 work on this surface 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.490
 We'll fine tune this tip 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:30.100
 this side to the small screen in the center of this 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:30.100
 form all lateral to the center line 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.340
 now this boot to the other end and this 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.130
 part we're going to hide first 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.480
 we put this tip to the line that 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:54.290
 line that forms here as a reference and 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:58.190
 this part we're going to hide and lock 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.900
 what a mark will be on the back we will do 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.270
 the same thing on the other side as after all 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.110
 this end taking this side to the 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.110
 center line 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.410
 the other side to the little screen of the center here 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.550
 notes that you will form like a cone 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.630
 of ice cream 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:24.010
 this work known as cone ice cream 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:27.740
 this tip to this that the other end 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:31.670
 brand well and now we're going to double that 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.490
 point to that alignment here mark 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:40.000
 well and let's hide all this part 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.000
 here to stay close 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:50.320
 We'll open the box by pushing the 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:56.300
 sides out 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:06:00.890
 marking the bottom of the carton and a carton 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.700
 easy to do simple but very 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.490
 beautiful 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.760
 The cool thing is that it 's different because it 's made 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.280
 in fabric and very interesting to 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.930
 possibility of disassembling the box 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.790
 For then he will keep who knows in the year that 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.700
 Come to a party, can you do it? 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.560
 It 's only in the box here, there's a 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:25.150
 ready piece you can do in several 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:29.120
 sizes and various different prints 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:35.240
 Good that you found origami, that's it. 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.890
 people are invention and creativity is to go to 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.320
 The legal issue is very interesting to me. 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.170
 is to be useful so I always try to do 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.360
 parts that have activity within 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.700
 home and you're going to use twitter 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.440
 even at work I think you cool 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.610
 take to work and to put the 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.360
 world line to ask very cool 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.360
 until the next champions
