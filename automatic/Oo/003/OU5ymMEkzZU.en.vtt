00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.149
 the users have a hobby and that is 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.270
 is to scrub exclusive games 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.220
 to the users of the competition so 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.670
 to say it is worth we are going to speak clearly 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.950
 XBOX fanboys scrub at the 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.320
 fanboys of song and the fact that titan 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.730
 fall is a saga that starts in xbox 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.440
 one but that will not be in 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.050
 playstation 4 good as this could 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.869
 finish because attention to what we 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.990
 They count on electronic arts and that is 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.030
 do not rule out a sequel that also 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.890
 can appear on playstation 4 between 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.810
 other systems that is really that the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.850
 Titan saga fall is not exclusive 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.890
 only from microsoft in the case of the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.649
 first part yes that starts with certain 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.149
 exclusivity but ojito because the 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.750
 second part that I think really 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.219
 would be the good game of titan fold because 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.079
 for me this first titan fall is a 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.780
 little experimental is worth a game 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.950
 only multiplayer I do not know I think 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.340
 who are experimenting to see how 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.809
 this works but of course we create 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.540
 with that message that is not going to be 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.700
 totally exclusive to microsoft in a 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.390
 future, at least those who have said 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.729
 of the game 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.590
 and so Paul already know that he is one of the 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.650
 Exclusive Microsoft consoles 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.080
 that attract players when 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.020
 to choose xbox one versus playstation 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.530
 4 is the title exclusively 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.610
 multiplayer a system that little we are 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.470
 accustomed to having in the world of 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.590
 videogames titles that do not have 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.880
 individual campaign well this game 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 bet on it bet on it and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.159
 Attentive because it's news again 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.590
 titan paul because electronic arts trusts 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.940
 in which there will be sequels the titans fault and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.850
 could also reach several 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.340
 platforms blake jÃ¸rgensen executive 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.500
 electronic arts has made it very clear that 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.479
 at least from his point of view he is very 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.759
 viable that titan pool has 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.280
 sequels and that can reach several 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.840
 platforms attentive to your words says 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.179
 I'm sure there will be futures 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.090
 samples at some time that could 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.670
 reach multiple platforms I do not know is 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.009
 thing of the teams that are working 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.500
 right now but in the end what matters 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.320
 is that we are very excited about this 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.420
 titan fold and we think it will be a great 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.790
 great game for xbox one 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.670
 that's what Mr. Blake claimed 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.000
 jorgensen executive of electronic arts 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.730
 also vince zampella is one of the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.560
 founders of respawn entertainment 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.840
 studios responsible for titan folk affirmed 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.000
 some time ago on twitter that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.880
 will develop games for playstation 4 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.540
 except for the first titan fold, that is, 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.180
 that playstation 4 users who do not 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.880
 be scared that maybe the same 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.150
 first titan paul not receive it but a 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.040
 fully improved sequel can reach 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.090
 to playstation 4 so they are good 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.090
 news of course
