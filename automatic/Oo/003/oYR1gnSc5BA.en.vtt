00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.060
 How to increase your dot muscle mass

 do not forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.670
 how to achieve muscle growth 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.770
 we all know that to increase the mass 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.290
 muscle we have to exercise 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 but what else can we do if the 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.200
 exercise is not enough or good 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.849
 we want to achieve it faster the increase 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.400
 of muscle mass is directly 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.990
 related to food that's why 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.270
 in the event that two people 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.370
 did exactly the same exercise 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.320
 but his feeding was different 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.739
 both would have different growth 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.080
 muscle therefore the key question 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.750
 is that it requires our body to 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.030
 climb muscle mass 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.850
 the answer is nutrients and especially 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 proteins this can be done through 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.650
 of foods with high content in 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.840
 proteins like for example meat the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.750
 chicken the egg and also in some 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.630
 vegetables in the same way we also have 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.369
 Protein powder supplements 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.619
 flavors for smoothies or simply 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.040
 pills of both animal origin and 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.259
 vegetable these are ideal in the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 cases where some allergy manifests 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.930
 with the intake of natural foods 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.480
 porn 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.700
 with the egg or also if the person 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.770
 outside vegetarian and therefore the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.750
 alternative to obtain proteins by 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.990
 medium of meat is not an option 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.360
 viable if this is your case you can well 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.040
 use these supplements to get the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.260
 amounts necessary for 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.470
 growth of your muscle mass but have 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.600
 consider using them in moderation the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.580
 growth of muscle mass too 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.860
 can be achieved using another type of 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.650
 supplements and not just protein as 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.660
 main base there is a great variety 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.149
 of supplements that will help you 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.050
 increase in your muscle mass 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.119
 especially through the fact of 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.729
 allow the body to be more 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.920
 healthy and ready for exercise achieving 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.930
 well the necessary conditions for 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.240
 the muscle grows easily but 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.460
 Be careful with this, I do not mean what 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.280
 absolute to the asteroids and the like 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.709
 I speak specifically of creatine 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.230
 this organic acid helps the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.360
 rapid contractions of the muscles and 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.420
 to perform the exercise with much greater 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.850
 ease will allow you to make a greater 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.180
 effort while decreasing the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.300
 feeling of tiredness thus will increase your 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.200
 muscle mass more safely 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.330
 elements to increase muscle mass 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.860
 another great element is glutamine is 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.860
 found within the group of 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.750
 amino acids is a substance that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.900
 will help in the elimination of the acid 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.060
 lactic acid this largely allows 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.540
 the feeling of pain after doing 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.300
 short-term exercise for example of 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.880
 one day to another on the other hand we have 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.860
 nitrous oxide this helps the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.230
 blood has the muscles with the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.060
 nutrients and the oxygen it requires from 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.459
 fastest way 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.650
 we also have the alanine that prevents 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.720
 muscle fatigue the creation of acid 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.290
 lactic acid and increases the contraction of 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.959
 muscles during exercise 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.180
 in general there is a lot of 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.540
 supplements that can be taken to 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.129
 quickly increase muscle mass 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.769
 The vast majority of these can be 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.319
 get from natural foods without 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.540
 However, many times these quantities do not 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.579
 they are sufficient especially in 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.409
 people with an exercise regimen 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.750
 strong or in people who for more 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:36.019
 exercise they do not see growth 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.060
 muscle as it should be to increase the 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.340
 muscle mass although it seemed like something 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.930
 naturally this process may sometimes be 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.689
 blocked by bad nutrition 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.819
 for example the body does not process well 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.030
 the nutrients or the proteins as is 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.010
 For elderly 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.540
 it could also be that simply not 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.120
 you have the necessary physical condition 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.239
 to exercise that increases the 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.459
 muscles when combining exercise and 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.530
 some dietary supplements with their 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.750
 due precautions we can achieve 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.200
 rise in muscle mass faster and
