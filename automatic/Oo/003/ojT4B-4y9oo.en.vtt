within<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> team<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:35.460> if<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.970> move<00:01:36.180> on

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
within the team and then if we move on

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.179 
within the team and then if we move on
to<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> final<00:01:36.900> slide<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:37.920> got

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to the final slide here is actually got

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
to the final slide here is actually got
one<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.640> relatives<00:01:38.790> attacks<00:01:39.329> being<00:01:39.570> used

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
one of your relatives attacks being used

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
one of your relatives attacks being used
which<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.320> called<00:01:40.500> phantom<00:01:40.979> fours<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
which is called phantom fours and it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.609 
which is called phantom fours and it
says<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.090> use<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.299> vanishes<00:01:42.869> somewhere<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
says the use of vanishes somewhere and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.410 
says the use of vanishes somewhere and
structures<00:01:44.070> at<00:01:44.159> argonne<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> next<00:01:44.820> turn<00:01:45.030> this

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
structures at argonne the next turn this

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.999 
structures at argonne the next turn this
move<00:01:45.659> hits<00:01:45.899> even<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> target<00:01:46.649> protects

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
move hits even if the target protects

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.280 
move hits even if the target protects
itself<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.509> insane<00:01:48.990> move

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
itself so that is just an insane move

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.460 
itself so that is just an insane move
because<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.100> definitely<00:01:50.549> hit<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
because they can just definitely hit the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.350 
because they can just definitely hit the
victim<00:01:52.470> even<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.399> detect<00:01:53.880> will<00:01:54.030> protect

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
victim even if these detect will protect

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.209 
victim even if these detect will protect
and<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.990> almost<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.380> shadow<00:01:55.740> fall's<00:01:56.070> I

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
and this is almost like shadow fall's I

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.770
