00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.129
 well and as you can see here is the clock 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.540
 to not lie to you this 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.559
 being ripped off and this is the color rgb 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.559
 that we have used 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.980
 there are such people on youtube welcome 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.440
 to a new good video in this video 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.680
 we will learn how to change the color of 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.840
 clock 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.570
 well what we should do is have the 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.120
 android crowd you first installed 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.300
 I will leave the description description of 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.300
 video 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.050
 a little table landro crowd 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.590
 get the files the two frameworks 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.140
 frameworks and frameworks hw xt and the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.790
 file that we want to compile in this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.280
 case is going to be a wii system for 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.400
 change the clock can be another file 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.339
 if the contact of each one you want 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.710
 modify in this case so that 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.710
 modify the styles or an xml 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.550
 now we proceed to run the antrum and 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.489
 crowd 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.130
 and where it says here in this middle part 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.860
 says install framework is where we should 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.500
 install the framework first let's 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.369
 install this beanie apk point and you 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.920
 We give to install well already installed we go 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.740
 to accept and the next install is the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.130
 frame erase is h w x we're going to 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.130
 install 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.400
 well already installed the two framework and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.470
 the following the next step is of 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 compile of the freckle as I told you 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.850
 it can be the system and the counterpoint 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
 cope here until the same play death that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.440
 what was to compile but in this case 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 let's use the system 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.500
 and we simply put of compay 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.289
 well once finished 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.090
 we go to the folder and we say 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.710
 sandro crowd from the compay folder 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.929
 the pickup exists very in network and enters 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.270
 huawei mdp and you already know 50 all 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:07.880
 images and you can change it 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.729
 and in the me we are going to modify 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.459
 the status vaart status team file for 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.160
 thousands play points this is the file 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.400
 that we are going to modify and we will focus 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.739
 in this line look in android set 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.060
 system and status farc what would come to 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.510
 be the watch 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.510
 Y 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.260
 then we go to this line we follow now 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.970
 same day 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.660
 android text colors that would be the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.280
 text color 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.360
 what we have to change in the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.360
 last six digits 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.960
 the last six digits 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.510
 these first two digits we leave it and 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.190
 we search we put internet colors 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.130
 you know what 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.170
 to the touch I have a page of colors 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.440
 rice and we simply select them 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.260
 let's copy 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.299
 Y 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.900
 we copy 6 digits of the color that 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.230
 we want 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.810
 and we keep the changes and well there already 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.140
 it would be 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.650
 we close this and we go to android 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.650
 crowd 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.270
 and the next step is to compile again 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.190
 in the freckle so he is not in 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.160
 holder if you do not put a student pk 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.100
 and we're going to be where it says android 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.560
 multitude of how he dances sin and 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.830
 we select exist 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.050
 we put batteries 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.440
 well, once this is done, this will come out 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.500
 message that says finished 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.660
 he stays for the mistakes and does not tell us 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.300
 what is the next step that we copy 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.360
 the android manifest xml and the goal and ene 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.650
 efe the goal folder and ee efe of your 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.660
 old pk to the new apk let's say that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.880
 accept changes that we do not have a 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.180
 mistake and we're going here 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.349
 we can through back 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:16.139
 and we put emphasis there is very this is the 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:18.900
 old eye and we can open tablets 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.209
 well already open let's make it up to 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.630
 a side 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.180
 and let's open now he 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.220
 we go to this folder to buy the apk and 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.130
 this would be the new one that we have the one 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.050
 we have changed the color to the clock 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.440
 we can also open compressed we 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.450
 we put for this side and follow the 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.090
 steps that he told us to copy the goal and 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.580
 efe and the android manifest and simply 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.810
 we drag it for the new one because as 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.010
 you will see they have no metal and net 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.050
 and so we have already changed the color of 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.520
 clock 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.830
 we would simply have this file 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.750
 put an extra sd and replace it with 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.580
 his captors when I now pause the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.569
 video and I'll show you how it has 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.849
 changed the clock 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.530
 well and as you can see behind is the 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.940
 watch to not lie to you this 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.240
 being ripped off and this is the color rgb 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.430
 that we have used 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.190
 Well I hope you served this 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.410
