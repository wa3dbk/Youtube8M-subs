00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:07.491
 &gt;&gt; What did you disappoint you at the festival? 

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:10.267
 I'm here only since yesterday, so ... 

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:13.233
 I am full of the atmosphere, which is still the same 

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.317
 like during those 6 years. 

00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:16.832
 I love it here. 

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.144
 I'm a bit bit disappointed by the choice of films 

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.088
 till now I've seen really depressive ones. 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.680
 The only positive one was by Sam Mendes 

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.763
 Away We Go. 

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:31.064
 There was not much I didn't like. 

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.963
 The thing I liked was a lot. 

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:37.635
 I know it's a very small festival 

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:44.618
 but thanks to the good movies and the great people who came, 

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:45.746
 it is a very big festival. 

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.963
 I've been to many festivals 

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.859
 but Karlovy Vary is exceptional. 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.710
 That's because I can only see East European movies here. 

00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:05.633
 Films from Georgia, Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, all these countries, 

00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:08.489
 which I can't see at any other festival. 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.321
 And certainly not in my country. 

00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:15.033
 I am here for the first time now and I must say that I liked it very much, 

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:16.410
 it was new to me. 

00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.914
 What I didn't like is the weather. 

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:22.592
 It was cold and raining 

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:27.863
 but still it was great, we talked. Good movies. 

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:31.230
 This is the first time I've seen a lot of good movies 

00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:36.644
 like those of Sam Mendes or Pedro Almodovar, 

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:39.466
 which are really great. 

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.600
 I also liked the whole organization, everything is great. 

00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:46.379
 The only thing I didn't like is the weather, but nothing more. 

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:48.665
 I've been here very shortly 

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:52.078
 I liked the Georgian movie The Other Bank 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.678
 and we were very pleased. 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.069
 Very nice movie. 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.540
 &gt;&gt; What was the disappointment? 

00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:57.488
 The weather. 

00:01:57.656 --> 00:02:00.260
 I'm disappointed that Spa I. (Baths I.) don't work 

00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:07.928
 and I like nothing has changed except this. 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.614
 I was delight by parties 

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:12.833
 I'm disappointed I haven't seen any movie. 

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:14.098
 It was sold out. 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.380
 We do not really like that films were similar, 

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:23.964
 with lot of violence and no spiritual overlap 

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:26.645
 but I don't want to generalize, one can see 30 films. 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.872
 I was really impressed by Antichrist from Lars Von Trier. 

00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:34.966
 Although there was a lot of violence too, I appreciate the courage. 

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:37.728
 Yesterday I saw La Tigra, Chaco 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.848
 and that was great, because one of the main actress, 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.889
 who participated in the discussion 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.681
 has parents who come from Morava 

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.591
 she is all of sudden sang in czech language 

00:02:47.592 --> 00:02:50.694
 and during the discussion she spoke to us in Czech 

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:51.708
 what was amazing. 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.972
 I came yesterday and until now nothing disappointed me. 

00:02:55.973 --> 00:02:57.012
 And I hope it will stay like this. 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.449
 The biggest pleasure was for the American clasic 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.688
 The Cover Girl. 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.588
 I enjoyed the big hall 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:18.516
 because such an old movie on such a big screen 

00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:20.822
 I can see only in Karlovy Vary. 

00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:27.218
 In the competition was the best cold souls according to me 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.479
 for many reasons which I have to explain. 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.137
 Especially, but not only because of the performance of Paul Giamatti. 

00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:42.486
 Disappointment? I don't have any disappointment. 

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:46.749
 Maybe only the weather, which was very changeable. 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.310
 And The White Ribbon 

00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:54.417
 that won in Cannes and I saw it first time only today 

00:03:55.482 --> 00:03:57.072
 and I enjoyed it 

00:03:57.073 --> 00:03:59.025
 I was terribly cold in the cinema hall.
