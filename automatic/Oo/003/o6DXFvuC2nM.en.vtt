people drill you can already walk

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.679 
people drill you can already walk
through<00:01:42.210> that's<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:45.229> that's<00:01:47.689> what

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
through that's so that's so that's what

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.630 
through that's so that's so that's what
happens<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.229> there's<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.530> giant<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> supply<00:01:50.610> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
happens that there's a giant a supply of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.940 
happens that there's a giant a supply of
energy<00:01:50.850> crystals<00:01:51.649> very<00:01:52.649> close<00:01:52.920> by

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950

right next to each other I don't know I

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.140 
right next to each other I don't know I
never<00:02:22.130> really<00:02:22.340> got<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.850> later<00:02:23.030> missions

setting us VISS see that giant ass ring
see<00:06:18.760> how<00:06:18.940> it<00:06:19.169> completely<00:06:20.169> gives<00:06:20.650> me<00:06:20.860> the

layout of pretty much the entire cavern

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.159 
layout of pretty much the entire cavern
that's<00:06:27.190> what<00:06:27.340> it<00:06:27.370> does<00:06:27.550> to<00:06:29.190> geological<00:06:30.190> center

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
that's what it does to geological center

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.650 
that's what it does to geological center
and<00:06:32.400> if<00:06:33.400> I<00:06:33.520> trade<00:06:33.850> a<00:06:34.000> rock<00:06:34.390> Raider<00:06:34.660> which<00:06:35.080> I<00:06:35.410> am

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
and if I trade a rock Raider which I am

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:48.750 
and if I trade a rock Raider which I am
trying<00:06:37.660> to<00:06:38.050> do<00:06:38.820> you<00:06:40.800> know<00:06:47.190> now<00:06:48.190> and<00:06:48.430> then<00:06:48.550> we'll

will<00:06:55.660> basically<00:06:55.930> tell<00:06:56.560> me<00:06:58.919> the<00:06:59.919> same<00:07:00.100> thing<00:07:00.160> is

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
will basically tell me the same thing is

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.230 
will basically tell me the same thing is
a<00:07:00.490> geological<00:07:01.180> set<00:07:01.690> of<00:07:01.810> us<00:07:02.020> only<00:07:02.669> much<00:07:03.669> much

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
a geological set of us only much much

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:22.490 
a geological set of us only much much
much<00:07:04.930> smaller<00:07:05.560> scale<00:07:15.270> fast<00:07:20.910> train<00:07:21.910> already

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
much smaller scale fast train already

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.870 
much smaller scale fast train already
geez<00:07:26.130> yes<00:07:27.130> that's<00:07:27.310> a<00:07:27.370> good<00:07:27.580> thing<00:07:27.820> though<00:07:29.880> so

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 
geez yes that's a good thing though so

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.250 
geez yes that's a good thing though so
this<00:07:31.180> missions<00:07:31.510> basically<00:07:31.840> just<00:07:31.960> to<00:07:32.080> be<00:07:32.229> a

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.260 
this missions basically just to be a
