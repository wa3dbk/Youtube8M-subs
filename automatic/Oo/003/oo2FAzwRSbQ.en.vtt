there are many methods to learn your

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.020 
there are many methods to learn your
scales<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.770> method<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.309> learned<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
scales but the method that I learned and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
scales but the method that I learned and
the<00:00:36.149> method<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.570> teach<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:36.809> students<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the method that I teach my students I

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360 
the method that I teach my students I
think<00:00:38.579> simplifies<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:39.930> much<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> can

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
think simplifies it as much as you can

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.470 
think simplifies it as much as you can
as<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.360> possibly<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:43.700> it<00:00:44.700> also<00:00:44.879> helps<00:00:45.390> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
as you can possibly do it also helps you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.090 
as you can possibly do it also helps you
learn<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> notes<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.920> fretboard

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
learn all the notes on the fretboard

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.439 
learn all the notes on the fretboard
which<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.149> very<00:00:48.360> important<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:51.210> easily

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
which is very important and it's easily

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.150 
which is very important and it's easily
you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:51.989> move<00:00:52.289> these<00:00:52.500> around<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.949> different

you can move these around to different

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.970 
you can move these around to different
keys<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.850> they're<00:00:53.969> easily<00:00:54.590> adapted<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.770> other

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
keys and they're easily adapted to other

keys and they're easily adapted to other
types<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> scales<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.270> melodic<00:00:57.660> minor<00:00:57.809> modes

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
types of scales like melodic minor modes

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
gonna play all seven of these scales for

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.270 
gonna play all seven of these scales for
you<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.780> how<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:34.920> work<00:01:35.130> on

you so you can see how how they work on

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
you so you can see how how they work on
the<00:01:35.369> guitar<00:01:36.049> there<00:01:37.049> are<00:01:37.140> seven<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.530> them

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the guitar there are seven of them

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.310 
the guitar there are seven of them
because<00:01:38.130> there<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.610> seven<00:01:39.540> notes<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.110> major

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
because there are seven notes in a major

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.480 
because there are seven notes in a major
scale<00:01:42.439> we're<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> use<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.979> key<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.280> F

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
scale we're going to use the key of F

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.999 
scale we're going to use the key of F
because<00:01:45.060> F<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> lowest<00:01:46.500> note<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.829> can

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
because F is the lowest note you can

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.090 
because F is the lowest note you can
play<00:01:47.780> without<00:01:48.780> having<00:01:49.170> an<00:01:49.229> open<00:01:49.500> string<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.969 

every<00:01:53.100> scale<00:01:53.490> position<00:01:54.060> starts<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.560> next

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
every scale position starts on the next

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.810 
every scale position starts on the next
note<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:57.299> F<00:01:57.420> major<00:01:57.689> scale<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.340> example

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
note in an F major scale so for example

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.410 
note in an F major scale so for example
the<00:02:00.509> first<00:02:00.689> one's<00:02:00.960> gonna<00:02:01.079> start<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:03.180> next

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the first one's gonna start on the next

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.149 
the first one's gonna start on the next
one<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.689> G

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
one on G

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.690 
one on G
a<00:02:05.329> B<00:02:06.329> flat<00:02:06.539> C<00:02:06.859> D<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:09.149> E<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.440> then<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.489> play

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a B flat C D and E and then you can play

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.759 
a B flat C D and E and then you can play
you<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.180> start<00:02:12.390> over<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.110> same<00:02:13.379> pattern

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
you just start over the same pattern

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:14.990 
you just start over the same pattern
that<00:02:13.920> you've<00:02:14.040> played<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> plan

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that you've played on that if you plan

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.589 
that you've played on that if you plan
on<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.269> G<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.360> becomes

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
on this G a and so on so it just becomes

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.130 
on this G a and so on so it just becomes
a<00:02:18.720> circle<00:02:18.930> right<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.680> seven<00:02:20.129> scales<00:02:21.140> and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
a circle right but it's seven scales and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.400 
a circle right but it's seven scales and
then<00:02:22.470> if<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.769> were<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.160> key<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.400> A<00:02:24.410> or

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
then if we were in the key of A or

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.920 
then if we were in the key of A or
something<00:02:26.099> like<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.510> pattern

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
something like that this the pattern

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.410 
something like that this the pattern
that<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:28.319> start<00:02:28.620> down<00:02:28.830> here<00:02:29.069> on<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:30.239> just

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
that we start down here on that we just

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.990 
that we start down here on that we just
start<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.709> then<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> pattern<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.730> start

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
start on a and then the pattern we start

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.910 
start on a and then the pattern we start
on<00:02:33.180> G<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:33.959> would<00:02:34.080> start<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.470> beat<00:02:34.680> because

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
on G we would start on beat because

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.259 
on G we would start on beat because
we're<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.250> moving<00:02:35.549> everything<00:02:36.150> we're<00:02:36.239> just

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
we're just moving everything we're just

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.390 
we're just moving everything we're just
moving<00:02:36.480> these<00:02:36.690> patterns<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.340> neck<00:02:39.079> so<00:02:40.400> I'm

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
moving these patterns up the neck so I'm

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.569 
moving these patterns up the neck so I'm
going<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.640> play<00:02:41.819> all<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.480> these<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.019> app<00:02:43.650> slowly

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
going to play all of these in app slowly

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.729 
going to play all of these in app slowly
so<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.480> play<00:02:45.750> along<00:02:46.049> if<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.410> download

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
so you can play along if you download

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.550 
so you can play along if you download
the<00:02:46.860> PDF<00:02:47.190> for<00:02:47.370> my<00:02:47.459> website<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.410> see

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
the PDF for my website and you can see

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.110 
the PDF for my website and you can see
what<00:02:49.680> fingers<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.190> use<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:50.940> how<00:02:51.090> I

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
what fingers I use you can see how I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.839 
what fingers I use you can see how I
play<00:02:51.480> them<00:02:52.099> hopefully<00:02:53.099> this<00:02:53.340> will<00:02:53.459> help<00:02:53.700> it

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
play them hopefully this will help it

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.059 
play them hopefully this will help it
make<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:54.629> lot<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.840> sense<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.379> I'm<00:02:55.620> gonna<00:02:55.739> so

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
make a lot of sense to you I'm gonna so

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.660 
make a lot of sense to you I'm gonna so
I<00:02:56.099> don't<00:02:56.340> rush<00:02:56.609> I'm<00:02:56.849> gonna<00:02:57.000> use<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> metronome

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
I don't rush I'm gonna use a metronome

00:02:58.670 --> 00:05:35.260 
I don't rush I'm gonna use a metronome
set<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.849> hundred

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.390 

all<00:05:36.270> right<00:05:36.420> so<00:05:36.990> those<00:05:37.560> are<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:37.800> seven<00:05:37.980> scales

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
all right so those are the seven scales

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.750 
all right so those are the seven scales
the<00:05:38.970> seven<00:05:39.300> positions<00:05:40.310> practice<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.400> Maliki

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
the seven positions practice the Maliki

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.330 
the seven positions practice the Maliki
about<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:42.330> then<00:05:43.260> practice<00:05:43.530> them<00:05:43.950> and<00:05:43.980> like

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
about and then practice them and like

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.700 
about and then practice them and like
the<00:05:44.460> key<00:05:44.640> of<00:05:44.760> b-flat<00:05:44.940> or<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.810> key<00:05:45.990> of<00:05:46.110> C<00:05:46.320> or<00:05:46.620> the

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
the key of b-flat or the key of C or the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.780 
the key of b-flat or the key of C or the
key<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:46.980> D<00:05:48.530> there's<00:05:49.530> also<00:05:49.710> some<00:05:50.010> pattern<00:05:50.430> so<00:05:50.580> if

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
key of D there's also some pattern so if

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.060 
key of D there's also some pattern so if
you<00:05:50.880> download<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.300> PDF<00:05:51.660> on<00:05:51.810> my<00:05:51.900> website<00:05:52.380> there

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
you download the PDF on my website there

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.770 
you download the PDF on my website there
are<00:05:53.160> also<00:05:53.280> some<00:05:53.700> patterns<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.390> can<00:05:54.570> use

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
are also some patterns that you can use

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.840 
are also some patterns that you can use
I'll<00:05:55.080> play<00:05:55.500> those<00:05:55.710> for<00:05:56.010> you<00:05:56.100> real<00:05:56.310> quick<00:05:56.340> we

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
I'll play those for you real quick we

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.790 
I'll play those for you real quick we
just<00:05:57.030> did<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.360> just<00:05:57.750> a<00:05:57.810> regular<00:05:58.110> quarter<00:05:58.650> note

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
just did the just a regular quarter note

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.950 
just did the just a regular quarter note
pattern<00:05:59.360> and<00:06:00.360> there<00:06:00.600> are<00:06:00.690> three<00:06:00.870> other

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
pattern and there are three other

00:06:00.960 --> 00:07:23.740 
pattern and there are three other
patterns<00:06:01.440> like<00:06:01.650> this

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:23.750 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.990 

so<00:07:24.750> if<00:07:24.840> you<00:07:24.930> can<00:07:25.080> do<00:07:25.169> all<00:07:25.320> of<00:07:25.349> those<00:07:25.699> in<00:07:26.699> every

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
so if you can do all of those in every

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.570 
so if you can do all of those in every
position<00:07:29.150> perhaps<00:07:30.150> the<00:07:30.479> metronome

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 
position perhaps the metronome

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.640 
position perhaps the metronome
you<00:07:33.030> know<00:07:33.150> you'll<00:07:34.139> learn<00:07:34.260> your<00:07:34.409> way<00:07:34.530> around

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
you know you'll learn your way around

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.740 
you know you'll learn your way around
the<00:07:34.830> neck<00:07:34.979> pretty<00:07:35.280> well<00:07:35.430> and<00:07:35.970> of<00:07:36.240> course<00:07:36.479> while

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:36.750 
the neck pretty well and of course while

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.629 
the neck pretty well and of course while
you're<00:07:36.780> doing<00:07:37.169> these<00:07:37.320> think<00:07:38.039> about<00:07:38.280> what<00:07:38.460> note

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 
you're doing these think about what note

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:42.950 
you're doing these think about what note
you're<00:07:38.820> playing

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.890 

mm-hmm<00:07:43.500> and<00:07:44.009> so<00:07:44.280> on<00:07:44.460> so<00:07:45.330> that<00:07:45.449> you<00:07:45.509> start<00:07:45.750> to

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 
mm-hmm and so on so that you start to

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.999 
mm-hmm and so on so that you start to
remember<00:07:46.530> what<00:07:46.919> notes<00:07:47.250> are<00:07:48.060> in<00:07:48.350> you<00:07:49.350> know<00:07:49.380> what

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:50.009 
remember what notes are in you know what

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:53.510 
remember what notes are in you know what
place<00:07:50.280> on<00:07:50.520> the<00:07:50.610> neck<00:07:51.530> all<00:07:52.530> right<00:07:52.770> finally<00:07:53.340> so

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 
place on the neck all right finally so

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.460 
place on the neck all right finally so
