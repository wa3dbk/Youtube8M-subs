00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
like big lumps and I'm thinking head and

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.620

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
was paralleling me this is the first

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.370 
was paralleling me this is the first
time<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.350> talked<00:04:32.800> while<00:04:33.130> I'm<00:04:33.280> filming

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
time I talked while I'm filming

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.150 
time I talked while I'm filming
and<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:36.220> think<00:04:36.820> I've<00:04:37.530> just<00:04:38.530> spotted<00:04:38.740> something

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
and I think I've just spotted something

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.280 
and I think I've just spotted something
of<00:04:39.370> dark<00:04:39.580> object<00:04:43.020> moving<00:04:44.020> through<00:04:44.080> the

of dark object moving through the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.550

borscht<00:04:46.920> it's<00:04:47.920> my<00:04:48.130> left<00:04:49.440> hopefully<00:04:50.440> it's

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
borscht it's my left hopefully it's

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.700 
borscht it's my left hopefully it's
nothing<00:04:50.710> because<00:04:51.010> I<00:04:51.310> don't<00:04:51.490> really<00:04:51.730> want<00:04:51.910> to

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
nothing because I don't really want to

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:23.960 
nothing because I don't really want to
meet<00:04:53.710> anything

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.030 

don't<00:05:24.600> really<00:05:24.750> like<00:05:24.810> being<00:05:25.290> out<00:05:25.470> here<00:05:25.500> alone
