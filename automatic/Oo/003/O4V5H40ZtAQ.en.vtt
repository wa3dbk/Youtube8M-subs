been following along in my ferret
training<00:00:09.780> series<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.590> will<00:00:10.950> know<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.160> I

training series you will know that I

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.450 
training series you will know that I
clicker<00:00:11.759> train<00:00:12.410> so<00:00:13.410> hopefully<00:00:13.799> by<00:00:13.980> now<00:00:14.219> if

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
clicker train so hopefully by now if

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.000 
clicker train so hopefully by now if
you've<00:00:14.639> been<00:00:14.790> practicing<00:00:15.170> you've<00:00:16.170> been<00:00:16.410> doing

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
you've been practicing you've been doing

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.490 
you've been practicing you've been doing
giving<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.730> click<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.240> then<00:00:18.900> giving<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> treat

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
giving a click and then giving a treat

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.980 
giving a click and then giving a treat
right<00:00:19.680> away<00:00:20.010> your<00:00:20.520> ferret<00:00:20.910> has<00:00:21.060> learned<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
right away your ferret has learned that

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.929 
right away your ferret has learned that
this<00:00:22.170> noise<00:00:22.410> means<00:00:22.980> you're<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> follow

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
this noise means you're going to follow

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.390 
this noise means you're going to follow
up<00:00:24.210> with<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> treat<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:25.859> when<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
up with a treat it's just a way when you

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.130 
up with a treat it's just a way when you
click<00:00:26.760> you're<00:00:26.939> marking<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> behavior<00:00:27.960> he's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
click you're marking the behavior he's

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.830 
click you're marking the behavior he's
doing<00:00:28.439> right<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.920> moment<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.840> telling

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
doing right at that moment and telling

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.479 
doing right at that moment and telling
him<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.710> want<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.250> then

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
him that that's what you want and then

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.610 
him that that's what you want and then
he'll<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> treat<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:33.930> just<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.170> timing

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
he'll get a treat so it's just a timing

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.880 
he'll get a treat so it's just a timing
thing<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.250> way<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.730> sure<00:00:35.760> he<00:00:36.149> knows

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
thing it's a way to make sure he knows

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.310 
thing it's a way to make sure he knows
exactly<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.879> he's<00:00:39.239> doing<00:00:39.420> what<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.809> want

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
exactly when he's doing what you want

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.670 
exactly when he's doing what you want
so<00:00:41.070> oh<00:00:41.600> squirt<00:00:42.600> me<00:00:42.780> OK<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:45.170> own<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.440> also

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
so oh squirt me OK so I own I also

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.229 
so oh squirt me OK so I own I also
wanted<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> let<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.460> know<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.969> always

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
wanted to let you know that I always

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.619 
wanted to let you know that I always
train<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.739> same<00:00:49.980> room<00:00:50.370> especially<00:00:51.059> when

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
train in the same room especially when

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.389 
train in the same room especially when
they're<00:00:51.989> learning<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> first<00:00:53.100> time

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
they're learning for the first time

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.939 
they're learning for the first time
because<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:54.510> won't<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:55.020> distracted

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
because they won't get as distracted

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.270 
because they won't get as distracted
we<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.670> how<00:00:56.820> ferrets<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> would

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
we know how ferrets are so I would

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.459 
we know how ferrets are so I would
advise<00:00:59.579> teaching<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> same<00:01:00.539> place<00:01:00.989> cuz<00:01:01.350> if

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
advise teaching in the same place cuz if

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.280 
advise teaching in the same place cuz if
I<00:01:01.590> take<00:01:01.859> him<00:01:02.270> somewhere<00:01:03.270> else<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
I take him somewhere else like in this I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
I take him somewhere else like in this I
have<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> guest<00:01:04.739> room<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.040> he's<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.400> allowed

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
have a guest room that he's not allowed

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.450 
have a guest room that he's not allowed
in<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.240> take<00:01:06.479> him<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:06.960> he<00:01:07.229> doesn't<00:01:08.189> do

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
in if I take him in there he doesn't do

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
in if I take him in there he doesn't do
as<00:01:08.640> well<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.150> harder<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.020> make<00:01:10.590> sure

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
as well it's just harder so make sure

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
as well it's just harder so make sure
that<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.070> training<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.360> same<00:01:12.570> place

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that you're training in the same place

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.320 
that you're training in the same place
and<00:01:13.439> also<00:01:14.310> make<00:01:14.520> sure<00:01:14.549> you're<00:01:14.850> using<00:01:15.060> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and also make sure you're using a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
and also make sure you're using a
healthy<00:01:15.780> treat<00:01:16.110> I've<00:01:16.290> gotten<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:16.710> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
healthy treat I've gotten a lot of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.940 
healthy treat I've gotten a lot of
questions<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.490> treats<00:01:18.560> sometimes<00:01:19.560> ferrets

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
questions on treats sometimes ferrets

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.380 
questions on treats sometimes ferrets
are<00:01:20.100> finicky<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.729> takes<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.180> while<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
are finicky and it takes a while to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.990 
are finicky and it takes a while to
learn<00:01:21.840> what<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.850> takes

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
learn what they like so it just takes

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.910 
learn what they like so it just takes
some<00:01:24.240> time<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.960> you're<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.110> sure<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
some time if you're not sure what to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
some time if you're not sure what to
give<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.189> ferret<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.790> ask<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.270> vet

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
give your ferret you can ask your vet

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
give your ferret you can ask your vet
just<00:01:27.840> try<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> pick<00:01:28.710> something<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.220> is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
just try to pick something that is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
just try to pick something that is
healthy<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> something<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.110> break

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
healthy and something you can break

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.219 
healthy and something you can break
apart<00:01:31.710> into<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.549> pieces<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.540> won't<00:01:33.720> make

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
apart into little pieces that won't make

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.219 
apart into little pieces that won't make
a<00:01:34.259> big<00:01:34.500> mess<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> let's<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.509> started<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.020> how

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
a big mess so let's get started on how

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.490 
a big mess so let's get started on how
to<00:01:37.259> roll<00:01:37.530> over<00:01:37.890> let<00:01:38.100> me<00:01:38.130> adjust<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.610> camera<00:01:39.500> ok
