way to regard for king fish we need a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.570 
way to regard for king fish we need a
little<00:00:12.000> bit<00:00:12.090> heavier<00:00:12.330> line<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:13.519> so<00:00:14.519> I'm

moving to some 35 pound cause kingfish
love<00:00:22.320> structure<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.340> obviously<00:00:23.939> you've<00:00:24.060> got

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
love structure and obviously you've got

love structure and obviously you've got
to<00:00:24.240> fish<00:00:24.359> around<00:00:24.480> structure<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.650> if<00:00:25.710> you're

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
to fish around structure so if you're

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.310 
to fish around structure so if you're
not<00:00:25.890> fishing<00:00:26.070> heavy<00:00:26.550> enough<00:00:27.170> they're<00:00:28.170> going

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
not fishing heavy enough they're going

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.650

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to find their way back to structure and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
to find their way back to structure and
cut<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> off<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.170> quick<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.489> we

presentation now over the last couple of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.490 
presentation now over the last couple of
years<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.190> been<00:01:02.220> using<00:01:02.430> circle<00:01:02.880> hooks<00:01:03.500> I've

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
years have been using circle hooks I've

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.780 
years have been using circle hooks I've
found<00:01:04.770> these<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.130> effective<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
found these really effective because a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.070 
found these really effective because a
lot<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.120> king<00:01:06.300> fish<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.600> catch<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.960> our

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
lot of the king fish we catch in our

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.410 
lot of the king fish we catch in our
waterways<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.830> undersized<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.940> size<00:01:09.150> limit

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
waterways are undersized the size limit

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.330 
waterways are undersized the size limit
for<00:01:09.450> king<00:01:09.690> fish<00:01:09.870> is<00:01:09.990> 65<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> moment<00:01:11.010> but

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
for king fish is 65 at the moment but

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.370 
for king fish is 65 at the moment but
checking<00:01:11.550> each<00:01:11.760> state<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> may<00:01:12.270> change<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
checking each state it may change or it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.580 
checking each state it may change or it
might<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.590> different<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:15.320> in<00:01:16.320> New<00:01:16.410> South

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
might be different but in New South

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.690 
might be different but in New South
Wales<00:01:16.650> at<00:01:17.070> 65<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:19.040> most<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.190> our<00:01:20.310> king<00:01:20.520> fish

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
Wales at 65 and most of our king fish

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.190 
Wales at 65 and most of our king fish
that<00:01:20.850> come<00:01:21.000> into<00:01:21.119> our<00:01:21.210> s3<00:01:21.630> systems<00:01:22.020> are

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that come into our s3 systems are

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.280 
that come into our s3 systems are
somewhere<00:01:22.470> between<00:01:22.850> 50<00:01:23.850> centimeters<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.540> 70

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
somewhere between 50 centimeters and 70

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
somewhere between 50 centimeters and 70
centimeters<00:01:25.800> with<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> few<00:01:26.369> better<00:01:26.790> fish<00:01:27.000> mixed

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
centimeters with a few better fish mixed

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
centimeters with a few better fish mixed
in<00:01:27.650> okay<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.920> circle<00:01:29.220> hooks<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.490> really

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
in okay so the circle hooks are really

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.969 
in okay so the circle hooks are really
good<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> fish<00:01:30.270> takes<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.600> bait

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
good because the fish takes the bait

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.560 
good because the fish takes the bait
sets<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> hook<00:01:32.250> finds<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> corner<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.450> its

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
sets the hook finds the corner of its

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
sets the hook finds the corner of its
mouth<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.530> easy<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.950> release<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.250> smaller

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
mouth and it's easy to release a smaller

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
mouth and it's easy to release a smaller
fish<00:01:35.880> rather<00:01:36.150> than<00:01:36.300> having<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> hook<00:01:36.780> down

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
fish rather than having the hook down

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.469 
fish rather than having the hook down
deep<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.619> their<00:01:37.740> throat<00:01:38.119> okay<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.180> we've<00:01:39.450> got

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
deep in their throat okay so we've got

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
deep in their throat okay so we've got
again<00:01:40.020> our<00:01:40.560> little<00:01:40.830> circle<00:01:41.040> hook<00:01:41.310> probably

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
again our little circle hook probably

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.320 
again our little circle hook probably
about<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> 4<00:01:42.119> Oh

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
about a 4 Oh

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.370 
about a 4 Oh
up<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> 6<00:01:43.800> a<00:01:43.979> nice<00:01:44.759> long<00:01:45.360> trace<00:01:45.750> around<00:01:46.020> about

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
up to a 6 a nice long trace around about

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
up to a 6 a nice long trace around about
a<00:01:46.440> meter<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.890> half<00:01:46.920> or<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> body<00:01:47.580> length<00:01:47.759> like

a meter and a half or a body length like
I<00:01:48.179> I<00:01:48.330> said<00:01:49.280> ok<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.720> tie<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.289> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I I said ok and to that we tie that to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:06.649 
I I said ok and to that we tie that to
our<00:01:53.039> main<00:01:53.280> line<00:01:53.550> that<00:01:53.759> goes<00:01:53.910> back<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.179> our<00:01:54.390> rod

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.979 

okay<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.840> we<00:02:07.899> need<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> nice<00:02:08.560> heavy<00:02:09.190> sinker<00:02:09.989> now

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
okay and we need a nice heavy sinker now

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.949 
okay and we need a nice heavy sinker now
the<00:02:11.080> heavy<00:02:11.260> sinker<00:02:13.830> prevents<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.950> yellowtail

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
the heavy sinker prevents the yellowtail

from swimming too far from the boat when
you<00:02:18.610> drop<00:02:18.819> this<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.209> bottom<00:02:19.390> now<00:02:19.599> we<00:02:19.690> drop

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
you drop this to the bottom now we drop

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.940 
you drop this to the bottom now we drop
those<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.260> bottom<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.620> lift<00:02:20.680> them<00:02:20.860> up

those to the bottom and lift them up

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.259 
those to the bottom and lift them up
about<00:02:21.129> a<00:02:21.190> metre<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.580> half<00:02:21.610> two<00:02:21.910> meters<00:02:22.150> off
