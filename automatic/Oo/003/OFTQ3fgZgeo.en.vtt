00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
we we are trying to make such that all

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.709 
we we are trying to make such that all
the<00:02:42.280> aspects<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.459> medieval<00:02:44.030> siege<00:02:44.389> warfare

the aspects of medieval siege warfare
work<00:02:45.499> in<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.829> game<00:02:46.299> so

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
work in the game so

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.000 
work in the game so
it's<00:02:48.250> really<00:02:48.940> interesting<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.920> for<00:02:50.920> example

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
it's really interesting so for example

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.320 
it's really interesting so for example
in<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.120> castle<00:02:52.630> there<00:02:53.260> are<00:02:54.330> different

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
in the in the castle there are different

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.980 
in the in the castle there are different
flanking<00:02:56.230> towers<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:58.090> are<00:02:58.270> used<00:02:58.510> which

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
flanking towers that that are used which

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.130 
flanking towers that that are used which
are<00:02:59.200> you<00:03:00.360> which<00:03:01.410> are<00:03:02.410> based<00:03:02.740> on<00:03:03.010> really

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
are you which are based on really

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.130 
are you which are based on really
historical<00:03:05.140> actual<00:03:08.670> architectural<00:03:09.670> details

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
historical actual architectural details

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.580 
historical actual architectural details
and<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.500> have<00:03:11.710> loops<00:03:12.340> for<00:03:12.660> archers<00:03:13.660> where<00:03:14.380> you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
and you have loops for archers where you

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.920 
and you have loops for archers where you
can<00:03:14.830> pick<00:03:15.100> at<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.580> attackers<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.360> take

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
can pick at the attackers and take

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.960 
can pick at the attackers and take
snapshots<00:03:17.440> at<00:03:17.590> them<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:17.980> we<00:03:18.220> are<00:03:18.250> trying<00:03:18.760> to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
snapshots at them and we are trying to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.680 
snapshots at them and we are trying to
make<00:03:19.120> sure<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.710> there<00:03:20.710> are<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.540> castles<00:03:22.540> are

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
make sure that there are the castles are

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.780 
make sure that there are the castles are
really<00:03:22.990> sophisticated<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.010> things<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.580> you

can<00:03:26.340> play<00:03:27.340> with<00:03:27.550> for<00:03:27.790> example<00:03:27.880> there's<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:28.360> gate

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
can play with for example there's a gate

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.840 
can play with for example there's a gate
house<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.230> there's<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.620> mechanism<00:03:30.430> for

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
house and there's a mechanism for

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.420 
house and there's a mechanism for
opening<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.450> gates<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:32.740> can<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.160> sneak

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
opening the gates and you can just sneak

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.290 
opening the gates and you can just sneak
into<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.970> castle<00:03:34.780> if<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.980> can<00:03:36.160> just

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
find your way to the gatehouse and of

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.790 
find your way to the gatehouse and of
operated<00:03:40.630> system<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:41.170> open<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> gate<00:03:41.770> for

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
operated system and open the gate for

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.700 
operated system and open the gate for
your<00:03:42.070> friends<00:03:42.490> to<00:03:42.520> rush<00:03:42.880> in<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.590> things<00:03:44.590> like

your friends to rush in and things like
that<00:03:44.770> so<00:03:44.950> it's<00:03:45.400> really<00:03:45.610> playful<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:47.430> make

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
that so it's really playful and make

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.300 
that so it's really playful and make
makes<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.940> castle<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.660> come<00:03:50.650> alive<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.190> this

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
makes the castle and come alive and this

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.880 
makes the castle and come alive and this
is<00:03:51.490> a<00:03:51.610> very<00:03:51.730> popular<00:03:51.970> mode<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.630> we<00:03:53.560> think<00:03:53.770> it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
is a very popular mode and we think it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.810 
is a very popular mode and we think it
is<00:03:54.070> it's<00:03:54.910> going<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.240> be<00:03:55.390> very<00:03:56.790> interesting<00:03:57.790> for

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
is it's going to be very interesting for

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.290 
is it's going to be very interesting for
players<00:03:58.420> one<00:03:59.110> very<00:03:59.350> interesting<00:03:59.620> feature

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
players one very interesting feature

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.830 
players one very interesting feature
that<00:04:01.300> we<00:04:01.450> are<00:04:01.540> working<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:03.840> biggie

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
that we are working on is biggie

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.770 
that we are working on is biggie
commander<00:04:05.350> in<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.830> multiplayer<00:04:06.220> game<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:07.570> we

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
commander in the multiplayer game so we

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.220 
commander in the multiplayer game so we
thought<00:04:07.990> that<00:04:08.790> ok<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:10.420> multiplayer<00:04:10.810> game<00:04:11.050> is

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
thought that ok the multiplayer game is

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.460 
thought that ok the multiplayer game is
great<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.970> sometimes<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:15.250> really<00:04:15.490> play<00:04:15.880> with

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
great but sometimes you really play with

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.060 
great but sometimes you really play with
very<00:04:17.470> few<00:04:17.650> people<00:04:18.989> for<00:04:19.989> one<00:04:20.320> reason<00:04:20.560> or<00:04:20.739> endure

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
very few people for one reason or endure

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.130 
very few people for one reason or endure
so<00:04:21.670> we<00:04:21.880> thought<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.600> mean<00:04:23.170> one<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.410> them

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
so we thought that I mean one of them

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.540 
so we thought that I mean one of them
defining<00:04:26.140> features<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.500> mount<00:04:26.920> and<00:04:27.130> blade<00:04:27.340> is

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
defining features of mount and blade is

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.570 
defining features of mount and blade is
being<00:04:28.060> able<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.660> comment<00:04:29.020> soldiers<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.220> fight

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
being able to comment soldiers and fight

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.150 
being able to comment soldiers and fight
a<00:04:30.610> long<00:04:30.910> time<00:04:31.210> at<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.990> same<00:04:32.140> time<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.620> why<00:04:32.980> not

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
a long time at the same time so why not

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.630 
a long time at the same time so why not
scary<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.790> idea<00:04:34.180> over<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.630> multiplayer<00:04:36.090> so

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
scary that idea over to multiplayer so

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.970 
scary that idea over to multiplayer so
what<00:04:39.640> we<00:04:39.940> came<00:04:40.150> up<00:04:40.210> is<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.200> we<00:04:41.710> have<00:04:41.830> this

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
what we came up is that we have this

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.700 
what we came up is that we have this
system<00:04:42.460> where<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.450> can<00:04:43.660> add<00:04:43.870> post<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.530> the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
system where you can add post to the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.100 
system where you can add post to the
game<00:04:44.890> and<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.310> will<00:04:45.490> distribute<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:46.150> bots<00:04:46.390> to

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
game and it will distribute to bots to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.160 
game and it will distribute to bots to
the<00:04:47.260> players<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:49.540> can<00:04:49.870> mix<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.290> match

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
the players and you can mix and match
