are<00:02:41.380> encouraged<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:42.099> AR<00:02:42.610> what<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:43.959> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
are encouraged you AR what is like a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.020 
are encouraged you AR what is like a
good<00:02:44.380> point<00:02:44.739> level<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.640> think<00:02:45.849> could

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
good point level that you think could

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.650 
good point level that you think could
lead<00:02:46.060> them<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.660> success<00:02:47.730> there<00:02:48.730> isn't<00:02:49.480> really

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
lead them to success there isn't really

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.229 
lead them to success there isn't really
like<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:50.170> single<00:02:50.769> point<00:02:50.980> though<00:02:51.130> I<00:02:51.430> would<00:02:52.000> say

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
like a single point though I would say

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.809 
like a single point though I would say
what<00:02:53.079> teachers<00:02:53.500> are<00:02:53.620> always<00:02:53.739> looking<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.190> is

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
what teachers are always looking for is

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.350 
what teachers are always looking for is
growth<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.349> we<00:02:56.410> use<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.980> star<00:02:57.280> test<00:02:57.610> where

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
growth so we use the star test where

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.020 
growth so we use the star test where
they<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.040> can<00:03:00.220> take<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.430> lot<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.850> tests

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
they are and you can take a lot of tests

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.140 
they are and you can take a lot of tests
with<00:03:01.239> that<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:03.010> try<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.250> figure<00:03:03.400> out<00:03:03.910> exactly

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
with that to try to figure out exactly

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.509 
with that to try to figure out exactly
where<00:03:04.750> their<00:03:05.079> reading<00:03:05.410> level<00:03:05.709> might<00:03:05.890> be<00:03:05.920> on<00:03:06.459> a

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
where their reading level might be on a

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.300 
where their reading level might be on a
grade<00:03:06.760> range<00:03:07.060> but<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.680> doesn't<00:03:08.920> matter<00:03:09.130> where

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
grade range but it doesn't matter where

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.650 
grade range but it doesn't matter where
they<00:03:09.459> are<00:03:09.609> I<00:03:09.640> could<00:03:09.790> have<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.090> fourth<00:03:10.390> grader

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
they are I could have a fourth grader

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.530 
they are I could have a fourth grader
who<00:03:10.959> reads<00:03:11.260> at<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.650> star<00:03:12.400> level<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.180> sixth

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
who reads at a star level of a sixth

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.680 
who reads at a star level of a sixth
grader<00:03:13.920> but<00:03:14.920> what<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:15.819> want<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.239> see<00:03:16.389> is<00:03:16.510> by<00:03:16.630> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
grader but what I want to see is by the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.479 
grader but what I want to see is by the
end<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.049> year<00:03:17.260> he's<00:03:17.590> reading<00:03:17.920> above<00:03:18.280> that

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
end of the year he's reading above that

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.610 
end of the year he's reading above that
sixth<00:03:18.880> grade<00:03:19.060> level<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.630> he<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:20.019> continues

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
sixth grade level so he just continues

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.379 
sixth grade level so he just continues
to<00:03:20.650> grow<00:03:20.950> from<00:03:21.340> where<00:03:21.519> he<00:03:21.609> starts<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.180> school

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
to grow from where he starts the school

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.039 
to grow from where he starts the school
year<00:03:22.859> it's<00:03:23.859> not<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.250> much<00:03:24.660> they<00:03:25.660> need<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.959> be

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
year it's not so much they need to be

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.370 
year it's not so much they need to be
here<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:27.160> pass<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.940> grade<00:03:28.180> it's<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.230> they

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
here to pass the grade it's that they

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.319 
here to pass the grade it's that they
need<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.799> show<00:03:30.010> growth<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.639> they<00:03:31.030> have<00:03:31.150> to

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
need to show growth and they have to

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.059 
need to show growth and they have to
keep<00:03:31.540> learning<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.139> trying<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.829> improve

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.380 
them and what teachers don't like to do
is<00:04:25.980> use<00:04:26.730> class<00:04:27.270> time<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:29.820> kids<00:04:30.120> memorize

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
is use class time to have kids memorize

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.710 
is use class time to have kids memorize
things<00:04:31.040> because<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:32.940> it's<00:04:33.270> they<00:04:33.660> have

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
things because it is just it's they have

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.600 
things because it is just it's they have
to<00:04:33.810> sit<00:04:34.110> there<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.380> just<00:04:34.710> go<00:04:34.950> through<00:04:35.100> them

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
to sit there and just go through them

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.090 
to sit there and just go through them
and<00:04:35.850> it's<00:04:36.390> something<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.290> can<00:04:37.500> do<00:04:37.680> like<00:04:37.950> I

if it's the show they're not really into

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.920 
if it's the show they're not really into
maybe<00:05:02.070> they'll<00:05:02.310> do<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.580> I<00:05:03.000> tell<00:05:03.480> my<00:05:03.600> students

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
maybe they'll do it I tell my students

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.410 
maybe they'll do it I tell my students

that's what it takes

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.620 
that's what it takes
it's<00:05:18.210> that<00:05:18.710> memorization<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:20.360> once<00:05:21.360> they

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
it's that memorization and once they

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.470 
it's that memorization and once they
have<00:05:21.840> those<00:05:22.050> down<00:05:22.580> then<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:23.790> can<00:05:23.970> explore<00:05:24.330> all

fall should prepare themselves um
biggest<00:05:46.580> thing<00:05:46.790> I<00:05:47.060> would<00:05:47.120> say<00:05:47.419> is<00:05:47.750> it<00:05:48.290> is<00:05:49.600> it

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
biggest thing I would say is it is it

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.689 
biggest thing I would say is it is it
all<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:51.110> all<00:05:51.260> comes<00:05:51.500> down<00:05:51.590> to<00:05:51.710> effort<00:05:52.130> it<00:05:52.550> all

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
all it all comes down to effort it all

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.300 
all it all comes down to effort it all
comes<00:05:52.970> down<00:05:53.060> to<00:05:53.180> how<00:05:53.479> hard<00:05:53.750> you<00:05:53.870> try<00:05:54.110> one<00:05:55.070> thing

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
comes down to how hard you try one thing

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.890 
comes down to how hard you try one thing
and<00:05:55.699> I<00:05:55.970> think<00:05:56.180> older<00:05:56.600> kids<00:05:56.900> I<00:05:58.750> understand<00:05:59.750> this

and I think older kids I understand this

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.150 
and I think older kids I understand this
a<00:05:59.960> little<00:06:00.139> bit<00:06:00.350> more<00:06:00.590> but<00:06:00.830> when<00:06:00.979> you're

come very easy for you at some point in
school<00:06:38.870> the<00:06:39.139> problem<00:06:39.500> is<00:06:39.680> that<00:06:39.860> it<00:06:40.310> won't<00:06:40.610> be

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
school the problem is that it won't be

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.830 
school the problem is that it won't be
easy<00:06:41.000> anymore

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
easy anymore

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.719 
easy anymore
and<00:06:42.139> if<00:06:42.440> you<00:06:42.620> don't<00:06:42.800> know<00:06:42.919> how<00:06:43.160> to<00:06:43.220> work<00:06:43.520> hard

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
and if you don't know how to work hard

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:45.969 
and if you don't know how to work hard
and<00:06:44.120> push<00:06:44.360> yourself<00:06:44.840> and<00:06:45.080> give<00:06:45.620> that<00:06:45.800> extra

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 
and push yourself and give that extra

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:49.300 
and push yourself and give that extra
effort<00:06:46.570> then<00:06:47.570> your<00:06:48.200> brain<00:06:48.889> gets<00:06:49.160> all

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
effort then your brain gets all

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.670 
effort then your brain gets all
scrambled<00:06:49.849> and<00:06:50.120> it's<00:06:50.720> really<00:06:51.080> hard<00:06:51.349> to<00:06:51.440> deal

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
scrambled and it's really hard to deal

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.129 
scrambled and it's really hard to deal
with<00:06:51.950> because<00:06:52.190> you<00:06:52.910> don't<00:06:53.120> know<00:06:53.389> how<00:06:53.780> to<00:06:53.840> apply
