00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 one of the stars that we say in the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.410
 today he was talking about adding 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.990
 waterworld where the let's say announced 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.639
 the next ubuntu operating system and 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.740
 where will you be targeted next 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.560
 operating system towards mobile 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.350
 towards the smartphone and it's going to be called 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.830
 ubuntu when that is not was was something 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.350
 classic and do not confuse because if 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.390
 we remember a little while ago marx had 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 talked about ubuntu for android not ubuntu 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.840
 out android is a system is not a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 operating system is a stage that you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.610
 puts the android operating system and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.469
 well we have a you running when 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.510
 we connect to a docking towards a 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.070
 television with hdmi connector what are we going 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 to have is an operating system of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.930
 desk directly based on that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.820
 country to that layer that is entered into 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.399
 Android not with what we need this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 team a great power output hdmi and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.629
 a lot of things 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.690
 specifically ubuntu font or that's the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.239
 native ubuntu operating system tucked 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.980
 on a specific phone or is it still 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.539
 no agreement do not ask yet not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.309
 there is agreement with manufacturers this is very 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.439
 nuevito recent very well 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.170
 no more that has been announced on the day of 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.060
 today and well this the truth that we say 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.939
 this one of the ideas he had that had 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.960
 marc just try to make 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.280
 manufacturers starting the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.470
 internalization on the subject that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.060
 let's say if you are interested in being able to do this 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.549
 some kind of agreement and that way 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.229
 be able to launch teams in the year that 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.420
 it comes at the end of 2013 or 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.429
 early 2014 costs me because as 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.679
 changed my year, it 's like, 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.360
 it costs that but do not have patience 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.579
 because they are a few days until I 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.280
 I used to be in 2003 and not 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.950
 in 2012 good then this is going to be 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.299
 advanced at the beginning of 2014 and good and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.979
 there will be some this some 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.959
 movements in everything that will be behind in 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.580
 the entire conference and 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.069
 everything I talk about more in this one that was 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.840
 initially pointing to all 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.000
 achievements that had a whole during both 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.770
 time as you have facilitated the desk 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.630
 for these the people who can 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.280
 use or in say linux not because 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.049
 just about that along with the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.149
 most popular pop distribution that there is in 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.039
 the world and that is is has launched this 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.170
 distribution is like that it massified and 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.000
 everyone knows what their point for 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.520
 more than use it does not look at any time 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.830
 you will have seen it work 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.090
 in the case of the operating system 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.980
 mobile is going to be an operating system 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.890
 based completely on it 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.660
 architecture and will have this 22 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.310
 very important bridges as to what 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.520
 which is the inch development we're going to 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.950
 have the apps based on html5 but 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.840
 as he said that the html5 also 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.250
 has some limitations then like 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.170
 It has some limitations too 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.970
 they are going to release a sdk so that they can 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.550
 develop applications natively 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.870
 that is, the fan is very large 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.730
 is a new operating system that is going to 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.220
 enter the in let's say everything that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.110
 is the system let's say systems 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.480
 operatives that we normally have in the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.000
 street is another new we have them now 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.560
 will come out what is this blackberry u 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.330
 s10 but hey this will also be 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.980
 next year are several systems 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.160
 operational several players that are going to 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.710
 to be spinning I think it will bring 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.990
 a little bit of enthusiasm at the level of 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.610
 all you are going to sandro users 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.440
 have to somehow go out to 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.330
 compete very hard because if ubuntu would 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.860
 put the whole file as you put it in 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.320
 the desk I think this is going to be very 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.590
 strong and let's go it's going to be difficult we see 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.510
 this play is not equally android 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.310
 several years good so many no but good 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.050
 has got some years already stuck in 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.390
 the market and let's say a very adaptation 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.099
 great in everything in the whole system but 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.510
 good ubuntu when I entered will go in from 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.819
 a very strong way besides having a 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.920
 desk as I said love in the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.959
 pocket we go to the ubuntu desk 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.330
 in your pocket is not the same as having 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.620
 android there are not certain things but of 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.810
 any way we will see how it goes 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.099
 advancing the living forward the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.959
 people from google with their system 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.489
 operative android that good that the wta 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.930
 he brings them no, that is, they are two systems 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.670
 different operatives that's why you have to 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.769
 make clear the two are based on 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.060
 linux and unix as you want to say the 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.750
 linux kernel 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.430
 either of the two both a buffoon or that or 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.049
 what is this android is based on 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.420
 linux after the layers that have 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.739
 up let's say everything with one day 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.019
 must what it understands and everything that 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.150
 makes us say the team works if 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.860
 a smartphone or a tablet them what 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.090
 they want to make people from ubuntu what 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.650
 I want to do what canonical 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.000
 Do you have the same system 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.069
 operative on a tablet in a 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.140
 smartphone a pc this is a bit what 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.090
 is pointed and not to leave aside the 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.070
 ubuntu project by android which is this 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.239
 or another leg also for the one who has 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.009
 android wants 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.900
 run this point directly something that 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.400
 I think it's great depending on the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.169
 equipment that you have and the hardware that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.520
 the team also have this 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.349
 we will be talking more with juan 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.720
 let's talk a little bit is all 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.569
 this something that something that I forgot not 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.949
 forget to tell them is that a tube is not 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.750
 is going to run so much in 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.300
 AMD microprocessors like what they are 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.190
 the x86 lines say is going to run in 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.599
 all the classic microprocessors that 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.610
 we have not thus not go 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.800
 problem and you're going to need a ram giga 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.139
 will be being launched in that is how 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.610
 I said good sea ​​also spoke invito 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.710
 all manufacturers and all 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.270
 enthusiasts and enthusiasts and all the 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.669
 who want to know more about the system 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.409
 operative go anses and that good 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.970
 that they know that they use it and good 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.340
 that they can also talk to them for 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.289
 to see how how how they can help and 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.639
 how can they be behind all this 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.919
 so, good to me, I thought it was excellent 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.229
 Some have asked me via satellite 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.520
 twitter to me or to anyone the best without 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.319
 who what seemed to me that it is also 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.659
 it seemed very very good all this is a 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.919
 while more players have on the street 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.360
 turning around it seems to me that it is better not 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.520
 because if it's not like that's a 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.320
 monopoly of mobile operating systems 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.520
 and about the whole ecosystem starts 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.610
 to complicate while 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.560
 to them while this iphone and while 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.569
 a lot of buzz around apple 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.460
 with the mobile operating system follow 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.949
 messing and keep getting into more 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.919
 messes and let's continue to say diversifying and 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.750
 we have been fragmenting more with 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.400
 All the iphone and control system 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.520
 operative and keep sending more desire 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.500
 with what is this maps good this 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.060
 makes the players come out and let's say 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.470
 face the whole situation of a 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.030
 way much better to me the truth that I 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.030
 it seems better and I think this goes 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.310
 directly from that which is related 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.509
 directly against the users and I think 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.979
 that users are always going to 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.419
 benefit from this kind of thing so 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.419
 for me it seems excellent
