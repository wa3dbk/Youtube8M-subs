 Not 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.360
 Tonight during a Mass 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.649
 now considerably 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:13.429
 what luthiers from Germany I would like to share with you here because we 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:14.569
 instruments 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:17.569
 because they are up to 2000 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 seven page 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
 with 28 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.359
 currently something against it 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.269
 Diallo UGT detoxifies painted 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.269
 Hajduk pickups and Portugal 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.630
 the next one fit 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.630
 has four side 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 in the midfield 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490
 6 11 euros 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.010
 it was never affected 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 my opinion 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 Trevo system 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.970
 that is quite interesting instrument that is one 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.750
 at 32 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.640
 in the jazz cellar to one 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 by 32 1 million anyway Wars 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.530
 Siemens very nice task force ZOB two factories 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.470
 in stores way 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 because here 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.230
 maybe that proves that the grain 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.920
 that comes from 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 Prototype should 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.420
 that will happen 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.340
 and last but not least, Iran 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.079
 the light of up to 12 2 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.389
