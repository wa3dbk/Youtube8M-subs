opening for the chimney and a connection
and<00:01:03.800> here's<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.190> chimney<00:01:04.580> connection<00:01:05.440> like

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
and here's a chimney connection like

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.390 
and here's a chimney connection like
this<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.460> will<00:01:07.520> put<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.060> here<00:01:09.010> through<00:01:10.010> this

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
this and I will put it here through this

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.240 
this and I will put it here through this
hole

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
hole

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.560 
hole
okay<00:01:13.250> now<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.520> chimney<00:01:14.000> connection<00:01:14.450> is

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
okay now the chimney connection is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:28.970 
okay now the chimney connection is
fitted<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.530> top<00:01:15.740> plate<00:01:16.450> like<00:01:17.450> this

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.240 

okay<00:01:29.980> I'm<00:01:30.160> let<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.490> make<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.670> chimney<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:33.040> is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
okay I'm let you make a chimney this is

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.150 
okay I'm let you make a chimney this is
how<00:01:33.400> you<00:01:33.460> bend<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.540> plate<00:01:35.290> so<00:01:35.620> you<00:01:35.680> can<00:01:35.950> make<00:01:36.130> a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
how you bend a plate so you can make a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.430 
how you bend a plate so you can make a
joint<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.880> one<00:01:40.090> way<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.420> bending<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:41.260> so

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
joint this is one way of bending it so

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.400 
joint this is one way of bending it so
you<00:01:41.500> put<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:42.180> pipe<00:01:44.070> something<00:01:45.070> round

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
you put a pipe something round

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.930 
you put a pipe something round
underneath<00:01:47.410> it<00:01:47.620> then<00:01:47.800> I<00:01:47.890> start<00:01:48.160> bending<00:01:48.490> and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
underneath it then I start bending and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.310 
underneath it then I start bending and
then<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.690> move<00:01:49.900> it<00:01:50.190> now<00:01:51.190> I<00:01:51.220> bent<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.610> chimney

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
then you move it now I bent the chimney

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.710 
then you move it now I bent the chimney
it<00:01:53.320> doesn't<00:01:53.650> look<00:01:53.710> round<00:01:54.100> yet<00:01:54.550> but<00:01:55.510> I<00:01:55.540> will

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
it doesn't look round yet but I will

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.480 
it doesn't look round yet but I will
start<00:01:56.110> hitting<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.040> iron<00:02:00.280> bar

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
start hitting it you with the iron bar

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.660 
start hitting it you with the iron bar
inside<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.360> chimneys<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.440> then<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:03.369> start

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
inside the chimneys and then you start

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.600 
inside the chimneys and then you start
hitting<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.380> wooden<00:02:05.710> hammer<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.310> metal

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
hitting with a wooden hammer and a metal

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.499 
hitting with a wooden hammer and a metal
hammer<00:02:07.170> okay<00:02:08.170> now<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.410> think<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.910> round

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
hammer okay now I think it's round

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.850 
hammer okay now I think it's round
enough<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:13.180> get<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> chimney<00:02:14.050> pipe<00:02:14.290> into<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
enough to get the chimney pipe into the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.790 
enough to get the chimney pipe into the
chimney<00:02:15.130> connection<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:17.080> may<00:02:17.320> have<00:02:17.620> to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
chimney connection you may have to

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.000 
chimney connection you may have to
squeeze<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.730> little<00:02:18.760> bit<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.890> there<00:02:20.890> is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
squeeze it a little bit so there is

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.110 
squeeze it a little bit so there is
chance<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:22.060> adjust<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:23.760> when<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.880> was<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
chance to adjust it when it was the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.589 
chance to adjust it when it was the
chimney<00:02:25.540> okay<00:02:26.470> there<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.130> nice<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:28.300> tight

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.149 

it's<00:02:33.599> funny<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.349> rocket<00:02:34.769> stove<00:02:35.129> that

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
it's funny with this rocket stove that

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.429 
it's funny with this rocket stove that
there's<00:02:35.579> a<00:02:35.670> fire<00:02:35.999> burning<00:02:36.920> very<00:02:37.920> nicely<00:02:39.439> no

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
there's a fire burning very nicely no

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.780 
there's a fire burning very nicely no

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.509 

this<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.769> surprisingly<00:02:53.489> effective<00:02:53.909> cooks

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
this is surprisingly effective cooks

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.360 
this is surprisingly effective cooks

mighty waters almost boiling you don't

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.670 
mighty waters almost boiling you don't
need<00:03:02.549> long<00:03:03.389> a<00:03:03.419> chimney<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.989> get<00:03:04.139> a<00:03:04.169> good<00:03:04.379> draft

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
need long a chimney to get a good draft

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.030 
need long a chimney to get a good draft
but<00:03:05.010> for<00:03:05.549> health<00:03:05.939> reasons<00:03:06.719> it<00:03:07.379> should<00:03:07.409> be

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
but for health reasons it should be

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.530 
but for health reasons it should be
twice<00:03:08.959> three<00:03:09.959> times<00:03:09.989> longer
