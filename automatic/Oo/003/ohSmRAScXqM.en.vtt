00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.070 

yeah<00:00:17.030> we<00:00:17.210> probably<00:00:17.630> should<00:00:17.870> have<00:00:17.900> won<00:00:18.050> that

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
yeah we probably should have won that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.290 
yeah we probably should have won that
going<00:00:18.350> to<00:00:18.470> be<00:00:18.560> fair<00:00:18.770> we<00:00:19.520> let<00:00:19.910> ourselves<00:00:20.030> down

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
going to be fair we let ourselves down

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.850 
going to be fair we let ourselves down
with<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.660> bat<00:00:20.870> more<00:00:21.110> so<00:00:21.290> than<00:00:21.440> anything<00:00:21.620> it<00:00:21.830> was

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
with a bat more so than anything it was

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.769 
with a bat more so than anything it was
a<00:00:21.980> really<00:00:22.160> good<00:00:22.250> track<00:00:22.520> and<00:00:22.730> I<00:00:22.910> thought<00:00:23.630> we

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
a really good track and I thought we

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.929 
a really good track and I thought we
made<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.440> good<00:00:24.619> fist<00:00:24.860> of<00:00:24.980> it<00:00:25.100> at<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.460> end

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
made a good fist of it at the end

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.019 
made a good fist of it at the end
PK<00:00:26.750> batted<00:00:27.170> really<00:00:27.410> well<00:00:27.560> but<00:00:27.800> we<00:00:28.760> probably

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
PK batted really well but we probably

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.160 
PK batted really well but we probably
should<00:00:29.300> have<00:00:29.330> ended<00:00:29.570> up<00:00:29.630> getting<00:00:29.869> across<00:00:30.050> the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
should have ended up getting across the

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.720 
should have ended up getting across the
line<00:00:30.350> so<00:00:30.560> we<00:00:30.710> get<00:00:30.860> some<00:00:31.039> confidence<00:00:31.310> out<00:00:31.550> of<00:00:31.670> it

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
line so we get some confidence out of it

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.560 
line so we get some confidence out of it
yes

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
yes

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.299 
yes

obviously we coming here to Chennai over
very<00:00:34.520> good<00:00:34.670> sight<00:00:36.550> it's<00:00:37.550> always<00:00:37.790> tough<00:00:38.059> when

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
very good sight it's always tough when

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.970

I suppose Mumbai the same with Ricky
Ponting<00:00:41.920> etc<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.100> it's<00:00:43.280> always<00:00:43.400> tough<00:00:43.730> but

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
Ponting etc so it's always tough but

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.750 
Ponting etc so it's always tough but

the advantage of having you know so many

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.520 
the advantage of having you know so many
international<00:01:19.760> Indian<00:01:20.390> players<00:01:20.690> helps<00:01:21.409> them

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
together pretty much for the the six

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.649 
together pretty much for the the six
years<00:01:25.490> as<00:01:25.729> such<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.150> only<00:01:26.299> a<00:01:26.360> couple<00:01:26.479> of

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
years as such and only a couple of

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.660 
years as such and only a couple of
change<00:01:26.900> overs<00:01:27.260> so<00:01:27.409> they<00:01:28.100> did<00:01:28.280> really<00:01:28.460> well

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
change overs so they did really well

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.820 
change overs so they did really well
first<00:01:29.390> year<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:29.750> had<00:01:29.840> some<00:01:30.020> good<00:01:30.140> signings<00:01:30.590> so

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
first year and had some good signings so

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
that that's their advantage there their

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.010 
that that's their advantage there their
continuity<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:33.799> their<00:01:34.070> side<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.340> suppose

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
continuity of their side I suppose

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.810 
continuity of their side I suppose

think<00:02:02.780> that's<00:02:03.020> happened<00:02:03.290> once<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.710> couple

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
think that's happened once a couple

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.999 
think that's happened once a couple
games<00:02:04.130> ago<00:02:04.310> in<00:02:04.520> um<00:02:04.670> 445<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:05.710> that's<00:02:06.710> about<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
games ago in um 445 so that's about the

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.979 
games ago in um 445 so that's about the
only<00:02:07.040> time<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.490> we'd<00:02:07.640> like<00:02:07.759> better<00:02:08.149> starts<00:02:08.750> but

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
only time so we'd like better starts but

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.810 
only time so we'd like better starts but
having<00:02:09.320> said<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.860> boys<00:02:10.280> are<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:10.729> know

having said that the boys are you know

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.340 
having said that the boys are you know
they're<00:02:11.030> not<00:02:11.120> meaning<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:11.630> out<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.260> just

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
they're not meaning to get out it's just

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.289 
they're not meaning to get out it's just
the<00:02:12.470> way<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:12.799> gone<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.310> they're<00:02:14.030> playing

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
the way it's gone so they're playing

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.610 
the way it's gone so they're playing
positive<00:02:14.810> being<00:02:14.989> a<00:02:15.049> cretin

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
positive being a cretin

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.470 
positive being a cretin
you<00:02:16.040> know<00:02:16.130> we'll<00:02:16.459> tinker<00:02:16.820> around<00:02:16.850> until<00:02:17.420> we

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
you know we'll tinker around until we

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.449 
you know we'll tinker around until we
get<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> right<00:02:17.810> combination<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:19.100> not<00:02:19.250> easy

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
get the right combination it's not easy

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.220 
get the right combination it's not easy
when<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.880> do<00:02:20.390> chopping<00:02:20.750> change<00:02:20.989> but

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
when you do chopping change but

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.659 
when you do chopping change but
sometimes<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.769> just<00:02:21.799> have<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.340> try<00:02:22.489> and

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:22.669 
sometimes you just have to to try and

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.759 
sometimes you just have to to try and
formulate<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.329> best<00:02:23.540> plan<00:02:23.750> against<00:02:24.230> against

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
formulate the best plan against against

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.900 
formulate the best plan against against
the<00:02:24.889> side<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:25.280> Chennai

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.130 

but<00:02:28.910> he's<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> quality<00:02:29.540> player<00:02:29.810> isn't<00:02:30.050> he<00:02:30.110> I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
but he's a quality player isn't he I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.809 
but he's a quality player isn't he I
mean<00:02:30.200> he<00:02:30.350> takes<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.770> game<00:02:30.920> away<00:02:31.250> from<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:31.610> and

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
mean he takes the game away from you and

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.040 
mean he takes the game away from you and
he<00:02:31.880> had<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.060> look<00:02:32.180> last<00:02:32.450> night<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.810> way<00:02:32.930> he

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
he had to look last night the way he

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.840 
he had to look last night the way he
played<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.620> we'll<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.490> come<00:02:34.640> up<00:02:34.760> with

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
played so we'll have to come up with

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.340 
played so we'll have to come up with
some<00:02:35.000> good<00:02:35.120> plans<00:02:35.390> which<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:35.930> think<00:02:36.110> we<00:02:36.200> have

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
some good plans which I think we have

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.070 
some good plans which I think we have
but<00:02:37.160> again<00:02:37.280> if<00:02:38.150> he<00:02:38.330> hits<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.600> ball<00:02:38.810> was<00:02:38.930> going

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
but again if he hits the ball was going

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.110 
but again if he hits the ball was going
for<00:02:39.230> six<00:02:39.440> as<00:02:39.709> simple<00:02:40.100> as<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.640> he's<00:02:40.910> such<00:02:41.090> a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
for six as simple as that so he's such a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.180 
for six as simple as that so he's such a
powerful<00:02:41.569> player<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.050> great<00:02:42.709> player<00:02:42.980> in

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
powerful player and a great player in

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.250 
powerful player and a great player in
this<00:02:43.400> format<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.910> game<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.420> we've<00:02:45.230> just

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
this format of the game so we've just

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.309 
this format of the game so we've just
got<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> limited<00:02:45.950> his<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:47.480> know<00:02:47.510> scoring

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
got to limited his you know scoring

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.780 
got to limited his you know scoring
opportunities<00:02:48.830> if<00:02:48.950> he<00:02:49.069> possibly<00:02:49.280> can

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
opportunities if he possibly can

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.550 
opportunities if he possibly can
and<00:02:49.880> hopefully<00:02:50.150> pick<00:02:50.420> him<00:02:50.600> up<00:02:50.660> early<00:02:51.020> but<00:02:51.230> you

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
and hopefully pick him up early but you

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.630 
and hopefully pick him up early but you
know<00:02:52.190> he<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.580> quality<00:02:53.000> player

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.700
