00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.890
 let's start step by step the first 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.460
 career 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:20.710
 I have here mounted 14 points those 14 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.710
 points are the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 one edge on each side + 2 4 6 8 10 12 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.810
 points that I need for this sample 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.830
 they always have to ride evil 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:39.239
 points multiples of 2 the ideal is that the 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.400
 which they use is a number more than 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.180
 recommended by the manufacturer of wool 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.040
 so that you can see very well appreciate 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.460
 it is pointed we make of account that 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.559
 we just assembled these 14 points 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.230
 we started the race number 1 the first 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.000
 point 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.510
 the edge we do it in a right 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.300
 and here we start the stitch which is a 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.980
 Loop a right point 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.500
 we passed the loop 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.500
 on the right point like this 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:22.580
 that was again loop point right 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.160
 step the thrown over the right point and 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.000
 Loose 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:34.130
 right step the loop over the point 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.880
 right and loose that's the whole stitch 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.210
 laced 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.810
 a right 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.230
 step the loop over the right point 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.710
 and I loose the room right point step 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.680
 the point the loops on the point 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.990
 right laced 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:03.990
 in fact it happened and loose loop 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 straight 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.450
 I loop the loop over the woven right and 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.800
 loose loop a right point step the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.140
 loop over the right point and up the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.340
 saga 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.340
 a right 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.959
 he passed it over loose and the last 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.579
 edge point in race number one 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.519
 is in a right point let's go to the 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:37.090
 race number two is done all in one 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.700
 point reverse from beginning to end step 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.400
 strand above the needle I introduce 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.480
 the uba 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.989
 step the strand took the strand with the tip 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.280
 of the needle and loose the entire career of 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.400
 beginning to end 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.980
 they are made exactly the same when there 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.620
 finished the two races repeated those 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.110
 two races all the time you need 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.200
 until you get the desired length of the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.780
 stitch if you have any doubt about this 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.060
