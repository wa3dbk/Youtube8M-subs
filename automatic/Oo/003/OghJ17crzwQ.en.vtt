00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello youtube friends like they've been 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.109
 a lot has happened since the last loquendo 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.969
 that I went up I'm very happy to be able 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.099
 climb again more we and good friends 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.199
 let's continue with the video today I bring you 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.600
 a comparison of two large series 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.910
 that are from the famous cartoon network channel 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.010
 obviously these are the only good 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.930
 series that are in the channel because if not 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.470
 were this channel would be the shit 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.470
 total xd ok we will start the story 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.750
 I'll start by hour of adventure hour of 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.540
 adventure is a series or mode that goes to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.940
 be a movie 'I donate' xd xd xd must 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.710
 then this series is based on a world 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 supernatural so to speak and the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.940
 protagonists will be the dear end and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 jake our characters fight against 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.920
 the evil they inhabit in the holy land of 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.170
 what name for more good x 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.899
 we will continue now with the series of my life 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.870
 x of a show plus one more show is based on 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.609
 our best friends mordecai richler 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 both work in the park together to their 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.229
 I tell other friends and then 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 well they always get in trouble and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.780
 then they always solve them in a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.510
 crazy way 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.720
 xd clear not all times are messes 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.060
 but sometimes personal problems 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 it's okay to move on to the second case that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 the characters would be the characters that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.570
 I will say after adventure time 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.149
 they will not be all but they gave a few 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.600
 to reference ok then they are 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.759
 end jake marcelin sweet princess 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.450
 princess fuck forgiveness I say flame x 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.360
 reye side we saw etcetera let's proceed with 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.759
 those of one more show are mordecai righi 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.490
 for muscular palette fantasmi no 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.860
 ghost is not kitsch come are daisy 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.960
 aylin and the subnormal asshole that I do not 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.470
 agreement is that it was new it entered the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.630
 fourth season x of ok we go to the third 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.509
 case in which the effects will be or 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.240
 animations for me I think that in more 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.490
 effects animations and others win a show 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.860
 more since if you have not seen the chapters 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.319
 they will know what I mean there's always 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.240
 thunderstorms lightning explosions 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.850
 landslides etc but of course 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.040
 now adventure is not far behind but 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.380
 by equating it in that will be something not so 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.620
 impossible but meanwhile one 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.680
 more wins this phase fourth case the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
 new episodes the episodes are the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.660
 truly fundamental to be able 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.670
 move forward to these series by the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.010
 case of adventure time does not surprise me 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.410
 nothing the truth if I tell them my opinion 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.080
 it would be practically shit apologize 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.970
 for that but it's true I have not seen 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.800
 no single chapter that calls me the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.740
 Real attention, they are all one 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.750
 foolishness for the case of a show more me 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.180
 have surprised sometimes and other times 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.100
 I see them as always or equal for 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.590
 example in the meat chapter of 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.710
 amadeus that chapter left me with a face 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.660
 host 'aa' to 'aa-' to 'a' that chapter 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.580
 of the milk and then I saw the chapter 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.680
 next to that and the truth I relaxed already 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.930
 I saw what happened, look for it 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.090
 it's a very good chapter I will not tell you 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.140
 nothing so you do not lose that sense xd 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.820
 xd xDDDDD fifth case we have what 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.710
 would be which series is dumbest and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.920
 fun or what's more for 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.780
 children and for young people in my case I think 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.150
 what time of adventure is much more to 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.770
 children since it does not contain so many censors 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.780
 as a show more but in 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.910
 and now adventure is much more 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.180
 mysterious and it gives us a lot to think about 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.010
 hahaha hahaha xd a show more so 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.230
 general contains a little more drama 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.830
 stories of the super-brain and sometimes 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.960
 contains censorship of crazy things xd 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.820
 good friends, we have reached the end if 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.830
 you tell yourself who would let you win 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.080
 Well the truth to my taste would be a show 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.210
 more but of course there are people who 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.490
 like adventure time so I'll do 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.290
 this will make it clear to you that for me 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.060
 it is better to show more but for the 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.690
 public that says which one is best for 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.730
 everyone 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.130
 well the truth is that both of them 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.740
 are in some ways different they are 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.080
 very similar in many aspects but 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.420
 equal each one will make this decision as 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.730
 Yes or no, it does not matter what matters 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.360
 is to know that you have a cool taste xd 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.640
 and ok do not forget to subscribe score and 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.800
