glitch<00:00:09.730> showcase<00:00:10.240> on<00:00:10.809> the<00:00:11.020> last<00:00:11.230> video<00:00:11.620> we

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
glitch showcase on the last video we

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.799 
glitch showcase on the last video we
learned<00:00:12.130> how<00:00:12.370> to<00:00:12.400> do<00:00:12.670> the<00:00:12.820> super<00:00:13.090> bounce<00:00:13.420> and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
learned how to do the super bounce and

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.109 
learned how to do the super bounce and
this<00:00:14.500> time<00:00:14.769> we'll<00:00:14.980> be<00:00:15.009> using<00:00:15.490> it<00:00:15.610> to<00:00:15.730> get<00:00:15.880> into

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
a stage you're not even supposed to this

a stage you're not even supposed to this
glitch<00:00:19.509> in<00:00:19.750> particular<00:00:20.109> is<00:00:20.560> on<00:00:20.590> the<00:00:20.980> stage

crazy<00:00:21.939> gadget<00:00:22.600> now<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.230> way<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.560> do<00:00:23.859> this<00:00:24.039> is<00:00:24.279> a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
crazy gadget now the way to do this is a

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.220 
crazy gadget now the way to do this is a
lot<00:00:24.580> more<00:00:24.609> difficult<00:00:25.330> than<00:00:25.390> just<00:00:25.750> knowing<00:00:26.080> the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
lot more difficult than just knowing the

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.230 
lot more difficult than just knowing the
super<00:00:26.560> bounce<00:00:26.769> there<00:00:27.430> is<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.580> lot<00:00:27.789> of<00:00:27.910> crazy

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
super bounce there is a lot of crazy

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.540 
super bounce there is a lot of crazy
timing<00:00:28.689> you<00:00:28.960> need<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.289> have<00:00:29.470> for<00:00:29.800> it<00:00:29.920> but

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
timing you need to have for it but

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.369 
timing you need to have for it but
hopefully<00:00:31.029> with<00:00:31.179> my<00:00:31.359> instructions<00:00:31.990> you'll<00:00:32.260> be

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
hopefully with my instructions you'll be

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.590 
hopefully with my instructions you'll be
able<00:00:32.500> to<00:00:32.619> do<00:00:32.800> it<00:00:32.890> yourself<00:00:33.280> in<00:00:33.400> no<00:00:33.580> time<00:00:33.879> but<00:00:34.449> as

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
able to do it yourself in no time but as

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.090 
able to do it yourself in no time but as
we're<00:00:34.870> running<00:00:34.989> through<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.470> stage<00:00:35.739> I<00:00:35.979> want

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
we're running through the stage I want

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.640 
we're running through the stage I want
to<00:00:36.220> explain<00:00:36.699> the<00:00:36.909> process<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.629> its<00:00:38.049> raw<00:00:38.320> form

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
to explain the process in its raw form

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.610 
to explain the process in its raw form
and<00:00:39.190> see<00:00:39.670> how<00:00:39.790> confusing<00:00:40.239> it<00:00:40.420> sounds<00:00:40.839> we<00:00:41.470> need

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
and see how confusing it sounds we need

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.250 
and see how confusing it sounds we need
to<00:00:41.769> get<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.100> checkpoint<00:00:42.519> near<00:00:42.909> a<00:00:43.120> chowky<00:00:43.750> to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
to get a checkpoint near a chowky to

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.259 
to get a checkpoint near a chowky to
then<00:00:44.440> miss<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.949> next<00:00:45.250> checkpoint<00:00:45.489> because<00:00:46.120> we

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
then miss the next checkpoint because we

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.450 
then miss the next checkpoint because we
need<00:00:46.449> to<00:00:46.600> get<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.900> Chokey<00:00:47.440> as<00:00:47.620> we<00:00:47.860> die<00:00:48.129> and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
need to get that Chokey as we die and

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.399 
need to get that Chokey as we die and
complete<00:00:49.119> the<00:00:49.299> level<00:00:49.659> while<00:00:49.839> getting<00:00:50.199> the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
complete the level while getting the

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.530 
complete the level while getting the
goal<00:00:50.650> ring<00:00:50.920> upside<00:00:51.129> down<00:00:51.699> using<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.210> super

goal ring upside down using a super

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
bounce and a gravity field something

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.060 
bounce and a gravity field something
like<00:00:55.479> that<00:00:55.720> but<00:00:56.320> there<00:00:56.530> isn't<00:00:56.680> really<00:00:56.830> much

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
like that but there isn't really much

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.560 
like that but there isn't really much
I'm<00:00:57.430> going<00:00:57.580> to<00:00:57.640> be<00:00:57.760> able<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:58.000> show<00:00:58.269> you<00:00:58.330> without

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
I'm going to be able to show you without

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.570 
I'm going to be able to show you without
being<00:00:58.989> at<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.260> area<00:00:59.530> we<00:00:59.710> need<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.040> be<00:01:00.159> so<00:01:00.460> I'm

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
being at the area we need to be so I'm

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.880 
being at the area we need to be so I'm
just<00:01:00.729> going<00:01:00.909> to<00:01:00.940> skip<00:01:01.180> ahead<00:01:01.350> okay<00:01:02.350> so<00:01:02.680> this

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
just going to skip ahead okay so this

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.670 
just going to skip ahead okay so this
checkpoint<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.729> this<00:01:04.030> Chao<00:01:04.540> box<00:01:04.869> here<00:01:05.199> are

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
checkpoint and this Chao box here are

checkpoint and this Chao box here are
the<00:01:05.890> important<00:01:06.400> things<00:01:06.460> we<00:01:06.909> need<00:01:07.060> for<00:01:07.479> this

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
the important things we need for this

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.140 
the important things we need for this
glitch<00:01:07.930> we<00:01:08.680> need<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:08.950> leave<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.400> Chao<00:01:09.640> box<00:01:09.910> as

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150

continue on with the stage as normal you

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.350 
continue on with the stage as normal you
will<00:01:14.320> come<00:01:14.800> across<00:01:14.920> one<00:01:15.490> more<00:01:15.700> checkpoint

will come across one more checkpoint

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.500 
will come across one more checkpoint

normally<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.310> would<00:01:33.430> adjust<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.880> gravity<00:01:34.330> and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
normally you would adjust a gravity and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
where the ring is what we need to do is

explaining this isn't going to be

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720 
explaining this isn't going to be
easy<00:02:13.080> I'm<00:02:13.320> just<00:02:13.590> gonna<00:02:13.710> do<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.310> let<00:02:14.580> you

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
easy I'm just gonna do it and let you

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.290 
easy I'm just gonna do it and let you
watch<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.350> do<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:17.280> die<00:02:17.880> and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
watch what you have to do is die and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.730 
watch what you have to do is die and
then<00:02:18.870> complete<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.470> stage<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> hell<00:02:22.530> let

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
then complete the stage and the hell let

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.920 
then complete the stage and the hell let
me<00:02:22.770> explain<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.300> did<00:02:24.540> as

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
me explain what the I just did as

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.140 
me explain what the I just did as
you<00:02:25.380> get<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.800> platform<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.460> just<00:02:26.880> jump

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
you get on this platform you just jump

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.210 
you get on this platform you just jump
over<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.750> edge<00:02:27.900> there<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.650> then<00:02:28.890> work<00:02:29.190> your

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
over the edge there and then work your

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.120 
over the edge there and then work your
way<00:02:29.610> back<00:02:29.940> before<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.570> fall<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.020> die<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.710> done

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
way back before you fall and die if done

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.190 
way back before you fall and die if done
correctly<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.610> should<00:02:32.970> hear<00:02:33.150> sonic<00:02:33.540> die<00:02:33.810> in

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
correctly you should hear sonic die in

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.990 
correctly you should hear sonic die in
the<00:02:34.590> same<00:02:34.830> way<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.190> would<00:02:35.310> die<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:35.700> he<00:02:35.820> fell

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the same way you would die if he fell

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.240 
the same way you would die if he fell
off<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> platform<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.930> into<00:02:37.140> space<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:38.190> you

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
off a platform and into space but you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.650 
off a platform and into space but you
don't<00:02:38.460> die<00:02:38.670> right<00:02:38.970> there<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.300> then<00:02:39.480> you're

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
don't die right there and then you're

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.060 
don't die right there and then you're
still<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.020> control<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.560> him<00:02:40.680> then<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:40.980> will

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
still in control of him then it will

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.890 
still in control of him then it will
fade<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> black<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.910> bring<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.480> back<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
fade to black and bring you back to the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.810 
fade to black and bring you back to the
previous<00:02:43.140> checkpoint<00:02:43.950> once<00:02:44.430> you've<00:02:44.640> then

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
previous checkpoint once you've then

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.180 
previous checkpoint once you've then
mastered<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.930> ability<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.590> jumping<00:02:47.010> off

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
mastered the ability of jumping off

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.130 
mastered the ability of jumping off
hearing<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.790> sound<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.360> then<00:02:48.450> jumping<00:02:48.900> back

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
hearing that sound and then jumping back

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.410 
hearing that sound and then jumping back
again<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:50.040> need<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:50.490> jump<00:02:50.730> off<00:02:50.910> again<00:02:51.240> in

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
again you need to then jump off again in

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.110 
again you need to then jump off again in
a<00:02:51.480> very<00:02:51.510> specific<00:02:52.110> angle<00:02:52.890> but<00:02:53.310> hopefully<00:02:53.880> if

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
a very specific angle but hopefully if

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.970 
a very specific angle but hopefully if
you<00:02:54.330> do<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.600> correctly<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.470> should<00:02:55.950> see

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
you do it correctly you should see

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.670 
you do it correctly you should see
almost<00:02:56.520> fade<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.330> white<00:02:57.360> what<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.500> has

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
almost fade to white what this has

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.950 
almost fade to white what this has
essentially<00:02:59.100> done<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.270> game<00:03:00.450> has<00:03:00.690> thought

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
essentially done is the game has thought

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.090 
essentially done is the game has thought
you've<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.500> died

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
you've just died

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.860 
you've just died
so<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.370> reset<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.330> last<00:03:03.540> checkpoint

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
so it's reset you to the last checkpoint

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.980 
so it's reset you to the last checkpoint
but<00:03:04.650> you've<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:04.830> beaten<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.610> stage<00:03:06.000> but

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
but you've just beaten the stage but

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.810 
but you've just beaten the stage but
this<00:03:07.170> isn't<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.740> glitch<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.520> glitch

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
this isn't the glitch the glitch

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.330 
this isn't the glitch the glitch

level<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.360> have<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.750> do<00:03:27.930> some<00:03:28.170> pretty

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
level so you have to do some pretty

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.070 
level so you have to do some pretty
silly<00:03:28.890> stuff<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.640> get<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.880> here<00:03:30.240> and<00:03:30.480> there's

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
silly stuff to get to here and there's

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.200 
silly stuff to get to here and there's
not<00:03:31.320> really<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.770> whole<00:03:32.040> lot<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.340> show<00:03:32.790> off<00:03:33.000> in

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
not really a whole lot to show off in

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.180 
not really a whole lot to show off in
here<00:03:33.450> either<00:03:33.660> it's<00:03:34.320> just<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.740> cool<00:03:35.010> little

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
here either it's just a cool little

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.790 
here either it's just a cool little
thing<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:36.000> do<00:03:36.300> if<00:03:36.600> you<00:03:37.140> want<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.410> show<00:03:37.620> off

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
thing you can do if you want to show off

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.070 
thing you can do if you want to show off
to<00:03:37.830> your<00:03:38.070> friends<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.630> cool<00:03:39.960> little

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
to your friends and it is a cool little

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.230 
to your friends and it is a cool little
area<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.770> explore<00:03:41.190> just<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.730> see<00:03:41.940> what<00:03:42.150> it

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
area to explore just to see what it

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.540 
area to explore just to see what it
looks<00:03:42.480> like<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:43.380> all<00:03:43.470> very<00:03:43.770> colorful<00:03:44.370> with

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
looks like it's all very colorful with

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.490 
looks like it's all very colorful with
random<00:03:45.000> numbers<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.510> as<00:03:45.960> you<00:03:46.080> can<00:03:46.260> see

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
random numbers and as you can see

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.310 
random numbers and as you can see
different<00:03:46.740> slope<00:03:47.340> angles<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.180> such<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.840> it's

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
different slope angles and such and it's

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.290 
different slope angles and such and it's
very<00:03:49.590> interesting<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.280> see<00:03:50.640> how<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.030> left

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
very interesting to see how they left

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.810 
very interesting to see how they left
this<00:03:51.600> within<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.200> code<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.710> game

this within the code of the game
obviously<00:03:53.820> expecting<00:03:54.390> no<00:03:54.630> one<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.020> find<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.680> I

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
obviously expecting no one to find it I

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.520 
obviously expecting no one to find it I
imagine<00:03:56.400> again<00:03:57.210> I<00:03:57.240> can<00:03:57.570> take<00:03:57.780> no<00:03:58.020> credit<00:03:58.350> for

imagine again I can take no credit for
finding<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.310> as<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.640> was<00:03:59.760> following<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.510> very

finding this as I was following the very

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
brief instructions of a video that I

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.000 
brief instructions of a video that I
will<00:04:03.030> link<00:04:03.210> in<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.690> description<00:04:04.320> it<00:04:04.800> is<00:04:04.860> a

will link in the description it is a

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.950 
will link in the description it is a

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
video where he just does it rather than

explains<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.860> although<00:04:08.370> he<00:04:08.580> does<00:04:08.730> explain<00:04:09.120> it

explains it although he does explain it

explains it although he does explain it
a<00:04:09.330> little<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:10.170> there's<00:04:10.350> no<00:04:10.470> voice<00:04:10.680> involved

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
a little but there's no voice involved

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.290 
a little but there's no voice involved
so<00:04:11.520> I<00:04:11.550> thought<00:04:11.820> I'd<00:04:11.970> give<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.180> the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
so I thought I'd give you the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.000 
so I thought I'd give you the
play-by-play<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:13.050> hopefully<00:04:13.560> allow<00:04:13.650> you<00:04:13.800> to

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
play-by-play to hopefully allow you to

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.400 
play-by-play to hopefully allow you to
do<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.310> yourself<00:04:14.600> again<00:04:15.600> I'm<00:04:15.840> using<00:04:16.049> the

do this yourself again I'm using the

available to do on the original I just

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.460 
available to do on the original I just
don't<00:04:24.240> have<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.600> original<00:04:24.720> copy

don't have the original copy

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.310 
don't have the original copy
prove<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.920> but<00:04:26.460> just<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.150> recap<00:04:27.420> so<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.020> know

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
prove it but just to recap so you know

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.710 
prove it but just to recap so you know
what<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.040> hell<00:04:29.250> was<00:04:29.430> going<00:04:29.490> on<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.510> need<00:04:30.690> to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
what the hell was going on you need to

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.870 
what the hell was going on you need to
grab<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.290> checkpoint<00:04:31.860> which<00:04:32.040> is<00:04:32.250> just<00:04:32.610> next

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
grab the checkpoint which is just next

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.840 
grab the checkpoint which is just next
to<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.300> chow<00:04:33.570> box<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.230> then<00:04:34.740> ignore<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.490> next

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
to the chow box and then ignore the next

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.640 
to the chow box and then ignore the next
checkpoint<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.420> come<00:04:36.690> across<00:04:36.930> it's<00:04:37.320> very

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
checkpoint you come across it's very

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.980 
checkpoint you come across it's very
important<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.190> do<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.670> using<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.630> super

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
important you do that using the super

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.660 
important you do that using the super
bounce<00:04:40.200> technique<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:40.950> explained<00:04:41.460> in<00:04:41.640> the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
bounce technique I explained in the

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.420 
bounce technique I explained in the
previous<00:04:41.760> video<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.840> then<00:04:43.290> super<00:04:43.830> bounce<00:04:44.040> on

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
previous video you then super bounce on

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.210 
previous video you then super bounce on
top<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.630> purple<00:04:45.900> platform<00:04:46.620> as<00:04:46.830> you're

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
top of the purple platform as you're

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.460 
top of the purple platform as you're
upside<00:04:47.580> down<00:04:47.850> on<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.660> suppose<00:04:48.990> technically

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
upside down on it so suppose technically

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.920 
upside down on it so suppose technically
on<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.680> bottom<00:04:50.250> of<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.670> platform<00:04:51.180> from<00:04:51.660> there

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
on the bottom of the platform from there

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.200 
on the bottom of the platform from there
you<00:04:52.080> jump<00:04:52.350> over<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.980> grey<00:04:53.340> ledge<00:04:53.670> you<00:04:53.910> see

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
you jump over to the grey ledge you see

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.900 
you jump over to the grey ledge you see
you<00:04:54.870> then<00:04:55.080> jump<00:04:55.440> off<00:04:55.620> partially<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:56.520> hear<00:04:56.730> the

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
you then jump off partially to hear the

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.630 
you then jump off partially to hear the
Deaf<00:04:57.150> sound<00:04:57.540> of<00:04:57.780> sonic<00:04:58.110> jump<00:04:58.710> off<00:04:58.890> again<00:04:59.310> to

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
Deaf sound of sonic jump off again to

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.930 
Deaf sound of sonic jump off again to
hopefully<00:05:00.210> catch<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.810> ring<00:05:01.050> in<00:05:01.350> flight<00:05:01.940> die

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
hopefully catch the ring in flight die

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.470 
hopefully catch the ring in flight die
and<00:05:03.470> then<00:05:04.470> complete<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.890> stage<00:05:05.340> from<00:05:06.240> there

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
and then complete the stage from there

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.050 
and then complete the stage from there
you<00:05:06.660> need<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.840> get<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.470> key<00:05:07.770> just<00:05:08.460> as<00:05:08.640> the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
to enter the test level I don't know how

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.520 
to enter the test level I don't know how
it<00:05:15.990> works<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.919> just<00:05:16.950> does<00:05:17.669> and<00:05:18.169> there<00:05:19.169> you<00:05:19.320> go

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
it works it just does and there you go

that<00:05:20.070> is<00:05:20.100> one<00:05:20.880> of<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.090> biggest<00:05:21.300> glitches<00:05:21.900> I've

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
that is one of the biggest glitches I've

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.950 
that is one of the biggest glitches I've
ever<00:05:22.290> seen<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.890> Sonic<00:05:23.610> Adventure<00:05:23.850> -<00:05:24.300> at<00:05:24.750> least

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
ever seen in Sonic Adventure - at least

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.440 
ever seen in Sonic Adventure - at least
one<00:05:25.200> of<00:05:25.320> them<00:05:25.500> apparently<00:05:26.310> knuckles<00:05:27.030> has<00:05:27.240> an

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
one of them apparently knuckles has an

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.600 
one of them apparently knuckles has an
easier<00:05:27.960> way<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.260> get<00:05:28.620> into<00:05:28.800> this<00:05:28.950> test<00:05:29.250> level

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
easier way to get into this test level

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.190 
easier way to get into this test level
but<00:05:29.790> it<00:05:29.880> doesn't<00:05:30.150> look<00:05:30.270> as<00:05:30.450> cool<00:05:30.720> as<00:05:31.020> when

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
but it doesn't look as cool as when

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.470 
but it doesn't look as cool as when
you're<00:05:31.320> in<00:05:31.440> this<00:05:31.560> level<00:05:31.800> with<00:05:32.040> Sonic<00:05:32.430> but<00:05:33.270> I've

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
you're in this level with Sonic but I've

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.330 
you're in this level with Sonic but I've
never<00:05:33.660> tried<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.050> do<00:05:34.410> it<00:05:34.530> with<00:05:34.560> knuckles<00:05:35.070> so<00:05:35.310> I

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
never tried to do it with knuckles so I

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.850 
never tried to do it with knuckles so I
can't<00:05:35.730> give<00:05:35.910> you<00:05:35.940> a<00:05:36.060> demonstration<00:05:36.680> but<00:05:37.680> those

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
can't give you a demonstration but those

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.530 
can't give you a demonstration but those
were<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.160> two<00:05:38.310> little<00:05:38.610> tricks<00:05:38.970> that<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.240> knew

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
were the two little tricks that I knew

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.380 
were the two little tricks that I knew
for<00:05:39.810> Sonic<00:05:40.080> Adventure<00:05:40.320> 2<00:05:40.550> also<00:05:41.550> no<00:05:41.850> one<00:05:42.090> for
