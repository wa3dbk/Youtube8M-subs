here is the dragon which is in the sky

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.760 
here is the dragon which is in the sky
and<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.899> f1<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.409> kind<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.680> way

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and if we're going f1 this kind of way

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.649 
and if we're going f1 this kind of way
looks<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.159> from<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> upper<00:01:51.149> night<00:01:51.360> sky<00:01:51.600> view

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
looks like from the upper night sky view

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.660 
looks like from the upper night sky view
it's<00:01:52.350> pretty<00:01:52.530> nice<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.640> it

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it's pretty nice I really do like it

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940 
it's pretty nice I really do like it
myself<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.899> person<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.259> created<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.770> has

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
myself the person that created this has

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.920 
myself the person that created this has
done<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.369> custom<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.600> quite<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.780> nice

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
done that custom so that's quite a nice

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.060 
done that custom so that's quite a nice
little<00:01:58.200> feature<00:01:58.350> he's<00:01:58.590> added<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.950> is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
little feature he's added that is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.160 
little feature he's added that is
basically<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.090> don't<00:02:00.479> all<00:02:00.540> those<00:02:00.659> because

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
basically the I don't all those because

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.109 
basically the I don't all those because
that's<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.469> moon<00:02:01.649> I'm<00:02:01.920> guessing<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that's the moon I'm guessing that is the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
that's the moon I'm guessing that is the
original<00:02:03.630> moon<00:02:03.780> however<00:02:04.320> that's<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.770> part

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
original moon however that's just part

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
original moon however that's just part
of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> texture<00:02:05.460> pack<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> yeah<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.509> go<00:02:06.630> one

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
of the texture pack and yeah we go one

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.779 
of the texture pack and yeah we go one
more<00:02:06.930> quite<00:02:07.200> far<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.099> that's<00:02:08.489> pretty<00:02:08.700> much

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
more quite far up so that's pretty much

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.369 
more quite far up so that's pretty much
this<00:02:09.209> area<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> blocks<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
this area this is like the blocks I

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.470 
this area this is like the blocks I
guess<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> water<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.940> instance<00:02:12.239> here's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
guess is the water for instance here's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.070 
guess is the water for instance here's
the<00:02:12.599> love<00:02:12.750> run

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
