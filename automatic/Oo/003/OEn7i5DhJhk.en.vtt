 m 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.960
 mathis bagdad walsh and 10 km 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.830
 hello everyone is marc leroy on 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.380
 is found today for a whole 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.930
 new video on destiny then 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.050
 today I propose a small 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.820
 pretty special video and so actually this 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.250
 will be a video in which you 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.970
 may have more or less content 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.739
 exclusive so in fact it's all okay 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.530
 this will happen in the first place 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.050
 on on mendy so on the website 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.560
 from bangui so become bungie.net I you 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.600
 will put the link in the description is 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.190
 so in fact the interest it will be to go 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.750
 on the website those to return from 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.850
 codes I'm going to give you the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.590
 description that I want to put you in 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.720
 screen in the middle of the screen in 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.610
 the video is festive with its codes 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.840
 there you will unlock cards from 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.280
 grimoire emblems and coatings 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.700
 so yielded actually the interest it will be by 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.380
 example 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.540
 as I put you in the miniature 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.310
 of this video I put you the map 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.530
 of grimoire of the gala adorns the card 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.110
 grimoire of ancient russia and the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.640
 red death memory card 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.140
 so in fact the interest is precisely 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.270
 to be able to have the black card of 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.039
 tears for example without having the remet 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.720
 necessarily is so it's going to be 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.520
 to pass over several things it's not going to happen 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.740
 place on several 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.420
 I sleep several weapons that must also be 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.460
 spend on equipment that was going on 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.829
 also on titan hunters is organizing this 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.140
 summer and so feast with all that is going 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.149
 to be able to give you a few points of 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.619
 that grimoire body and as I have you 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.259
 also says at the beginning it's going to give you 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.140
 so it seems to me it's five or six 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.209
 emblem and coatings so a 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.340
 all-gold coating a coating all 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.780
 blue so they are eight years old they are not 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.959
 too bad so after that it will be up to you to 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.629
 you to make your choice and so for 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.980
 the coup I could not record the 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.110
 manipulation on pc but I will you 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.470
 do a little a little following of this 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.450
 crime 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.640
 so what are you going to do them in a 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.400
 first time so it would be to go on 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.690
 bungie.net so when when are you 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.549
 happened came planet you arrive 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.620
 on a page like this one which well 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.269
 obviously log in to your account 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.829
 so at the very top there is bad vision 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.750
 why but here normally it will be 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.430
 writes connected and so it's up to you to 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.870
 connect 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.579
 when you connected then 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.290
 in this screen change you have 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.980
 you click on the small arrow next to it 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.470
 your nickname 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 the cap profile parameters activates a code 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.190
 and on my sessions so there as you 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.670
 can see it if you click on 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.980
 activate a code and then you go 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.200
 to be redirected to a page is there all 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.670
 stupidly it's all explaining them so 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.290
 there at the level of the small of there is between 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.940
 your code so you have a small 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.190
 as a kind of search bar 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.239
 so here is you entering the codes that 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.850
 I would have put you in the description 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.960
 or that 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.450
 you will have put in the middle of 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.100
 the screen plus enter one by one and so 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.380
 you will have a little message that will say 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.740
 your code has been entered or something 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.320
 like that 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.790
 and so that's it for this 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.070
 little video i hope she will you 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.550

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.080
 take advantage of these different coatings 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.570
 emblem team in small politics 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.610
 memory cards do not hesitate to like 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.810
 to share this video for others 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.850
 people can enjoy it 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.150
 that's all for me I'm not telling you anymore 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.150
 the world 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.090
