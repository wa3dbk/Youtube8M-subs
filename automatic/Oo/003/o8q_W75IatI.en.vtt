00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.440 
important to get going but our goal for
the<00:02:52.860> future<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.610> keep<00:02:53.760> growing<00:02:54.030> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
the future is to just keep growing and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.900 
the future is to just keep growing and
make<00:02:54.840> sure<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:55.140> keep<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.530> good<00:02:55.770> solid<00:02:56.580> program

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
make sure we keep a good solid program

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.410 
make sure we keep a good solid program
going<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:59.070> hopefully<00:02:59.520> we<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.910> outgrow

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
going and then hopefully we can outgrow

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.270 
going and then hopefully we can outgrow
this<00:03:00.660> base<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.200> continue<00:03:01.740> moving<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.100> to

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
this base and continue moving on to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.580 
this base and continue moving on to
offer<00:03:02.430> quality<00:03:03.060> programs<00:03:03.480> for<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.720> area<00:03:03.960> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
offer quality programs for the area and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.650 
offer quality programs for the area and
I<00:03:05.040> think<00:03:05.100> what's<00:03:05.460> very<00:03:05.520> important<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.330> that

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
I think what's very important is that

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.020 
I think what's very important is that
you're<00:03:07.140> all<00:03:07.320> trained<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.400> tell<00:03:08.850> us<00:03:08.970> a

raised in a very strict gym as a gymnast

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.180 
raised in a very strict gym as a gymnast
and<00:03:27.620> they<00:03:28.620> were<00:03:28.680> very<00:03:28.800> very<00:03:30.740> reinforcing<00:03:31.740> of

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
and they were very very reinforcing of

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.100 
and they were very very reinforcing of
basics<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.790> safety<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.420> conditioning<00:03:33.900> and

basics and safety and conditioning and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.710 
basics and safety and conditioning and
structure<00:03:34.890> so<00:03:35.700> if<00:03:35.790> my<00:03:35.910> teachers<00:03:36.240> have<00:03:36.480> kids

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
structure so if my teachers have kids

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.030 
structure so if my teachers have kids
standing<00:03:37.020> around<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.320> lot<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.650> generally<00:03:37.860> get

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
standing around a lot you generally get

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.350 
standing around a lot you generally get
in<00:03:38.130> trouble<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.610> structure<00:03:38.850> goes<00:03:39.030> away<00:03:39.209> so

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
in trouble in the structure goes away so

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.390 
in trouble in the structure goes away so
we<00:03:40.320> like<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.620> make<00:03:40.740> sure<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> students<00:03:41.310> are
