00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
what's the rhythm notation is in this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.199 
what's the rhythm notation is in this
type<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.830> music<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.250> starts<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.760> sound<00:02:38.940> kind<00:02:39.150> of

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
type of music it starts to sound kind of

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.780 
type of music it starts to sound kind of
flat<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.720> way<00:02:42.470> 1-5<00:02:43.470> bring<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.310> pinkie<00:02:44.670> all

the<00:03:13.739> page<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.130> same<00:03:14.430> thing<00:03:16.250> here's<00:03:17.250> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the page is the same thing here's a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.400 
the page is the same thing here's a
different<00:03:17.549> way<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:17.880> think<00:03:18.150> about<00:03:18.269> this<00:03:18.569> which

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
different way to think about this which

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.880 
different way to think about this which
I<00:03:19.620> find<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.400> lot<00:03:20.519> easier<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:22.230> not<00:03:22.470> getting<00:03:22.650> hung

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
I find a lot easier is not getting hung

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.979 
I find a lot easier is not getting hung
up<00:03:23.040> with<00:03:23.190> these<00:03:23.310> finger<00:03:24.239> numbers<00:03:24.660> because<00:03:24.870> it

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
up with these finger numbers because it

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.380 
up with these finger numbers because it
really<00:03:25.200> doesn't<00:03:25.350> matter<00:03:25.560> which<00:03:26.280> key<00:03:26.519> which

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
really doesn't matter which key which

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.479 
really doesn't matter which key which
finger<00:03:27.660> used<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.900> hit<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.080> key<00:03:31.370> sounds<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
finger used to hit the key sounds the

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.770 
finger used to hit the key sounds the
same<00:03:32.670> doesn't<00:03:32.880> matter<00:03:33.120> which<00:03:33.269> finger<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.570> used

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
same doesn't matter which finger I used

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.630 
same doesn't matter which finger I used
to<00:03:33.900> play<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.230> look<00:03:34.890> at<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.100> numbers<00:03:35.400> instead

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
to play it look at the numbers instead

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.390 
to play it look at the numbers instead
along<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.120> bottom<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> staff<00:03:37.320> those<00:03:38.220> are

the<00:03:38.579> intervals<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.299> plus<00:03:39.840> means<00:03:40.170> up<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.920> this

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
the intervals a plus means up going this

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.190 
the intervals a plus means up going this
way<00:03:41.280> how<00:03:41.670> many<00:03:41.910> fingers<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.660> minus<00:03:43.019> sign

way how many fingers and a minus sign

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.140 
way how many fingers and a minus sign
means<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.980> interval<00:03:44.430> between<00:03:44.459> two<00:03:44.820> notes

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
four fingers up then a third is that

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.440 
four fingers up then a third is that
much

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.200 

down<00:06:03.140> five<00:06:03.410> okay<00:06:04.280> put<00:06:04.610> the<00:06:04.760> pinkie<00:06:05.030> there

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.450 

down<00:06:15.530> the<00:06:15.710> third

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.940 

five

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.400 

I<00:06:22.390> find<00:06:23.390> out<00:06:23.480> a<00:06:23.510> lot<00:06:23.690> easier<00:06:23.960> by<00:06:24.080> reading<00:06:24.320> the

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 
I find out a lot easier by reading the

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.470 
I find out a lot easier by reading the
intervals<00:06:24.860> instead<00:06:25.040> of<00:06:25.370> worrying<00:06:26.030> about<00:06:26.150> the

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
intervals instead of worrying about the

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.870 
intervals instead of worrying about the
finger<00:06:26.870> numbers<00:06:27.260> in<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:27.530> hand<00:06:27.920> position<00:06:28.580> D

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
finger numbers in the hand position D

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.160 
finger numbers in the hand position D
position<00:06:29.540> F<00:06:29.750> and<00:06:30.230> all<00:06:30.290> of<00:06:30.470> that<00:06:31.150> it<00:06:32.150> just<00:06:32.720> goes

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
position F and all of that it just goes

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.050 
position F and all of that it just goes
a<00:06:33.200> lot<00:06:33.320> more<00:06:33.500> smoothly<00:06:33.770> the<00:06:34.490> chords<00:06:34.790> are<00:06:34.910> very
