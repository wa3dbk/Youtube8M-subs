 hi friends android sis in the 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.559
 next video tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.700
 teach how to optimize the maximum 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.470
 samsung terminal gps family 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.610
 galaxy and good in general is valid for 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.050
 all samsung terminals 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.720
 the rom that you have and the version of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.720
 android that you have, I will do it in 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.630
 the latest version of android on jelly 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.630
 beans was version 4.1.1 but it's worth 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.170
 for the cs 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.550
 and to jailbreak or roll the first thing that 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.240
 we will have to do will be install 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.580
 gri gps and the faster fix are two 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.190
 applications that we will attach here in the 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:01:01.340
 video and in the post of the android blog 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.900
 sis first we will open once 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.089
 downloaded the two applications and the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.500
 we will install and the first thing we will do in 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.500
 open in faster mix 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.979
 once opened faster six here 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.160
 we will configure the default server 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.159
 that we are going to use to catch the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.219
 data from satellites 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.429
 that we want in the little arrow and we will choose 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.680
 the one that suits us best in our areas 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.060
 in my case it will be 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.840
 the one in europe 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.720
 we click on go 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.320
 and as we see it has changed to europe 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.580
 we can go backwards like that one thing 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.850
 that told us that you have to have the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.680
 Alum terminal rotate if we will not be worth in 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.900
 three applications now that it's going to be 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.180
 before s 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.180
 and click on settings 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.120
 here it comes by default we have to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 click on general settings here we will see 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 which by default comes in stand alone and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.780
 we will change it to ms bass 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.760
 now we go back twice 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.760
 we apply in delete gps 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.799
 / efe test click on start 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.799
 and we wait for him to take satellites 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.290
 I started to get satellites 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.440
 this first time it takes a little longer than the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.440
 account 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.830
 but then he chooses it very quickly 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.720
 we already have it now we would give through 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.750
 it would already be configured perfectly 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.450
 heads if we open any application 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.930
 I need gps like the maps we'll see 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.930
 as 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.030
 connects often and then we 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.810
 give the position 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.810
 there is 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.040
 this is all I hope has served you 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.250
 help and see you in a next video 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.250
 tutorial 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.750
 see you later 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.989
 ah
