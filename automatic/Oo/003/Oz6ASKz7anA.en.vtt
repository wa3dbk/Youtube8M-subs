it's<00:00:56.830> important<00:00:57.370> when<00:00:57.520> playing<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:58.060> you

when<00:01:02.110> sitting<00:01:02.620> this<00:01:03.070> will<00:01:03.280> prevent<00:01:03.580> unequal

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
when sitting this will prevent unequal

when sitting this will prevent unequal

but<00:01:07.570> next<00:01:07.810> we<00:01:08.080> do<00:01:08.320> see<00:01:08.680> equal<00:01:09.070> weight<00:01:09.250> through

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
but next we do see equal weight through

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.360 
but next we do see equal weight through

the resulting forward head posture when

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.600 
the resulting forward head posture when
corrected<00:01:23.440> we<00:01:23.710> see<00:01:23.980> that<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.370> knees<00:01:24.580> are

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
corrected we see that the knees are

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
on top of the shoulders this is what we

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.120 
on top of the shoulders this is what we
call<00:01:33.159> a<00:01:33.400> neutral<00:01:33.640> spine<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.920> position<00:01:35.920> when

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
call a neutral spine a position when

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.000 
call a neutral spine a position when
there's<00:01:36.340> least<00:01:37.090> likely<00:01:38.010> asymmetrical

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
stresses on the spine leading to less

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.010 
stresses on the spine leading to less
overuse<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.280> pain

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.410 

next<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> violinist<00:01:47.850> who<00:01:48.000> does<00:01:48.210> have

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
next we have a violinist who does have

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060 
next we have a violinist who does have
equal<00:01:48.750> weight<00:01:48.780> through<00:01:49.140> both<00:01:49.290> feet<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.740> is

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
equal weight through both feet and is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.760 
equal weight through both feet and is
elongated<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> back<00:01:51.000> vertically<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.470> we

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
elongated in the back vertically but we

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.170 
elongated in the back vertically but we
see<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> violin<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> little<00:01:54.000> too<00:01:54.149> far

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
see that the violin is a little too far

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
see that the violin is a little too far
to<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.600> left<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.290> choose<00:01:55.710> no<00:01:55.860> longer<00:01:56.220> in
