00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.480
 hi everyone in this smokey eye too 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.429
 toriel i'm gonna show you how i do 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.480
 this budget smokey eye on myself and 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.639
 applied 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.070
 I made this with the w7 palette and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.660
 then the in the knight variant a palette i 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.250
 not used super for a while 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.710
 a shame because this is just really bad 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 beautiful and very pigmented and this one 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.650
 maybe look video for a party 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 for a night out or maybe before 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.189
 you just for daytime but allowed 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.019
 you are also curious about this budget smokey 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.930
 eye that we applied ourselves look then 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.310
 cozy with it 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.850
 as always I start with them 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.850
 eyeshadow base 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.780
 this rust brown color wonderland 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.340
 hot it applies in a swipe 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.320
 in my arcade arch and the mine outer 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.060
 eye corner this ensures that 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.470
 I can easily blend now 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.730
 also what the color very beautiful of dark 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.379
 goes to light 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.790
 and here I am already all run so 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.970
 that the hard lines are no longer visible 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.970
 to be 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.400
 after this I take these purple shades this one 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.870
 the lady is nice and live in one 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.030
 slowing movement on my entire 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.300
 moving eyelid and also whole songs 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.300
 my arcade arch 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.470
 then I take this must green shade 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.030
 gatecrash and this strange to it 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.380
 in the middle of my eyelid 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.070
 this immediately ensures that they are whole 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.070
 color gradient 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.229
 and now I will continue with the color nora oh 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.910
 that is a brownish purple hue and pointed 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.290
 can handle 13 movement in the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.670
 outer corner of the eye and also in my 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.500
 inner corner of the eye 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.300
 and dinner connect them to each other via 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.710
 my arcade arch and I actually draw 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.490
 a line of passions from left to 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.490
 right in my arcade arch 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 I grab the moss and the team again 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.260
 also brings it back to the moving 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.640
 eyelid exactly with center because a disk 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.500
 just asked him something and then 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.729
 I just put the arcade line 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.729
 I always repeat one more time 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.070
 then I had the blind custom blind 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.510
 I really put all the hard lines both on the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.220
 outside but also on my eyelid 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.020
 Sultan colors completely together 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.580
 run over 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.590
 then I pick up a gold tent and this 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.270
 it will be a different palette and a pity 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.890
 that thea w7 in the knight that he no 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.509
 gold has this little finger on them 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.670
 inner corner of the eye and this is mine 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.630
 on top of Lemmerkade arch and on this one 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.630
 applies under my eyes 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.050
 I prefer the color long ind francs 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.370
 under my eyes and outer corner of my eye 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.570
 I do this in one swipe I 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.570
 about to become one 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.320
 And also the moss green color that suit it 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.390
 one more time and that yields just like 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.710
 the moving eyelid really only yes 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.880
 in the middle but below mine 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.440
 eye and with a festive smokey eye 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.390
 I also always find a wind eyeliner 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.070
 are very beautiful and I exchange with 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.990
 eye liner but you can use any 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.430
 just use eyeliner for this 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.860
 and I apply the extra large wing 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.570
 for a very chic effect and next 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.880
 step is mascara and this is the maybelline 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.380
 volume express and apply some thick ones 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.190
 lay on my lower and upper 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.190
 eyelashes 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.480
 to top it all off, buy 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.980
 false eyelashes and this is of course whole 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.450
 optional but I like that 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.980
 false eyelashes with a festive look 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.280
 and then strip it 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.280
 end result 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.080
 unfortunately ax again at the end of this 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.580
 smokey eye tutorial 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.620
 of course I really liked this look 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.790
 very nice and I have the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.680
 lately a number of times the question 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.330
 got kelly live even more already 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.070
 part of a movie during a tutorial 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.050
 That's because I'm actually a species 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.190
 of standard or basic routines even though 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.380
 filmed like mine 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.940
 foundation or the bronzer blush and 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.340
 highlighter in my eyebrows 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.510
 so you were allowed one of these three tutorials 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.280
