00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.790
 Hello to you language and then 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.310
 today's video we finally finish 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.190
 surveys for light tanks of level 8 and 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.200
 analyze this type of t-54 lightened 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.770
 pretty interesting car made 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.330
 the prototype is more accurate in m-54 but 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.880
 lightweight booking to 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.370
 use and on some in some 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.079
 situations when using the usual 54 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.850
 impracticability was assumed 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.860
 pretty recently introduced to the game 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.880
 let's take a look at the pros and cons 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.620
 this machine 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.800
 one of the main disadvantages of this car 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.539
 its review is 390 meters in contrast 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.570
 from all other light tanks of level 8 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.239
 of which 400 meters of visibility we possess on 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.000
 10 meters is a little better. 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.730
 but unlike other tanks we don't have 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.980
 cars we made from more precisely to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.320
 54 in the same furnace at the same 54 in the top 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.080
 picking 390 meters of view exactly 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.820
 therefore we cannot exceed it also 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.940
 we possess talents of type means us 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.600
 gun rate of 8 shots 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.400
 minutes 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.680
 you can close your eyes to this 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.070
 good information 22 can also be closed 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.290
 eyes but scatter 038 guys this is pretty 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.299
 still a bad scatter but in principle with him 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.070
 you can live if you have no mouth 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:28.750
 millimeter gun d-10t 23 945 year 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.340
 standard armor penetration 175 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.110
 millimeters it's only 5 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.090
 millimeters more than ninety 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.720
 3 millimeters more than you have for 130 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.670
 20 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.039
 alternate in quotes of eighty 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.200
 five millimeter cannon and armor penetration 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.940
 gold one hundred thirty five millimeters well 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.409
 what can I say average 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.950
 armor penetration though 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.960
 one of the worst naturally also 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.039
 unlike age 32 we have no one 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.220
 flying on and armor piercing 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.880
 shells that a little bit better and helps 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.009
 us in battles 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.860
 but with 10 levels to fight all the same 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.960
 pretty complicated so now you can 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.940
 go to pluses pluses is ours 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.250
 dynamic even though our 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.240
 mass thirty three tons we can 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.910
 keep the maximum speed 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.880
 sixty nine kilometers ahead and 20 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.170
 kilometers back thanks to the 700 engine 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 Horse power 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.640
 also top chassis with us 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.510
 has a turning speed of 50 degrees 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.850
 a second which is pretty good but 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.380
 another distinctive one more 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.390
 a distinctive feature of this machine 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.140
 is its booking 80 millimeters 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.900
 in the forehead of the hull what to tank level 10 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.850
 9 8 we fail but some 7 and 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.070
 stock 8 we can not forget 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.510
 what a multi tank and again if 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.450
 you decide to go on it even from 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.890
 towers 160 mm booking not 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.520
 should forget about such a game as 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.350
 kerchief guys 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.300
 what is a tower is a separate word 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.520
 unfortunately the replay I wanted 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.440
 you show is not reproduced and there 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.600
 it was there that I spent three minutes 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.790
 detained enemy isa 7 with 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.220
 his tower went full artillery 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.000
 let's show this guy how to completely 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.360
 need to pass 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.220
 this game and now let's go to 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.350
 my personal opinion about this car is about 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.360
 how should you use it for 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.980
 my machine is very good I him 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.930
 I put myself in a hangar suitable for both 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.670
 team fights on the head 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.650
 unlike the surplus which can 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.510
 ride there on it was still barrels and 2 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.370
 random battles should be played mostly 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.290
 in platoon because all the same breaking through 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.460
 We are weak shpa on the patterns would be 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.620
 Itself also we can a little bit 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.840
 to tank and in the results of the battle that I 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.150
 I will insert after this video and after 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.290
 the results of this fight because 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.310
 video for some reason I do not 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.590
 reproduced and gives some errors 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.320
 you will see that 50 foursome confession 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.850
 of the business card knowledge and considering 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.180
 small dimensions can still 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.560
 pretty good shine but let's 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.740
 continue to say and what we should 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.360
 do randomly at 54 to go with an average 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.220
 and light tanks in no case with 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.900
 you still have heavy armor penetration 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.670
 standard tool does not allow us 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.860
 even on 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.300
 the more against the tenths level where you 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.060
 will play most fights 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.770
 It should also be mentioned that 54 difference 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.260
 from other at-8 good to farm 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.910
 really go away at 10 20 thousand plus 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.050
 which is pretty good on this one 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.720
 the car went into minus 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.609
 I counted only five times 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.190
 Petra you all this time that I'm on her 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.200
 meizu this should not be 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.780
 happen on lt 8 but still a car 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.639
 Duvan did farm I would advise her 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.550
 leave in your hangar just for the sake of 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.160
 fan and farm because unlike 69 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.130
 we can also tank us 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.620
 we can pretty well understand 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.060
 with a clt of the seventh level , we generally do not with 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.300
 old from any problems 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.919
 unless you 're 71 with his breakthrough since 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.200
 he has standard sub-caliber shells 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.830
 and perhaps the bulldog sometimes make us 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.540
 Problems, but the car data I decided everything 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.300
 I also keep in my hangar 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.940
 redeem the rush panther and perhaps 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.360
 devyanostika well and for the fun of course you 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.280
 I'll buy myself t 49 in and for the LCD too, I think 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.460
 redeem because for team fighting 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.260
 she is good and without water at the same 100 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.130
 millimeter gun at the same level in 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.720
 250 units well then you were languages ​​about 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.030
 one subscribe to my channel 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.070
 We both like to tell friends 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.600
 sorry for such a short video on 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.410
 I have not refused right now 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.910
 many fights 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.120
 after you bought it back q 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.800
 and the fight that I really wanted 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.720
 insert in this load unfortunately with 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.600
 defeat did not work for me 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.060
 reproduce it gives you an error of luck 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.080
 in battles and don't forget to subscribe to 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.080

 also as you may have noticed at the beginning 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.090
 I have a thumbnail of my video 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.800
 that's why i want to express 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.490

 thank you very dear friend
