my fingers fitting into and that is what

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.360 
my fingers fitting into and that is what
helps<00:03:44.700> keep<00:03:45.090> this<00:03:45.330> cool<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.200> reduces<00:03:47.160> the

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
helps keep this cool it reduces the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.060 
helps keep this cool it reduces the

installations to be able to pass code

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.830 
installations to be able to pass code
it's<00:04:04.920> just<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.190> safety<00:04:05.540> value<00:04:06.540> there<00:04:06.810> that

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
it's just a safety value there that

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.300 
it's just a safety value there that
you're<00:04:07.080> going<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.260> get<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.860> double<00:04:08.160> wall

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
you're going to get the double wall

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.970 
you're going to get the double wall
stovepipe<00:04:08.910> actually<00:04:09.900> heats<00:04:10.170> up<00:04:10.380> faster

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
stovepipe actually heats up faster

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.470 
stovepipe actually heats up faster
because<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.640> stainless<00:04:11.910> steel<00:04:12.090> inner

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
because of the stainless steel inner

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.840 
because of the stainless steel inner
wall<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.080> because<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:13.860> airspace<00:04:14.580> in

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
wall and because of that airspace in

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.479 
wall and because of that airspace in
there<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.540> will<00:04:15.900> keep<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.500> outer<00:04:16.709> portion<00:04:17.400> of

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
there it will keep the outer portion of

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.849 
there it will keep the outer portion of
this<00:04:17.640> pipe<00:04:17.850> considerably<00:04:18.540> cooler<00:04:18.840> than<00:04:19.680> if

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
this pipe considerably cooler than if

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.190 
this pipe considerably cooler than if
you<00:04:19.980> were<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.190> use<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> single<00:04:20.760> wall<00:04:20.910> pipe

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
you were to use a single wall pipe

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.840 
you were to use a single wall pipe
because<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.350> heats<00:04:22.530> up<00:04:22.710> faster<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.340> also<00:04:23.490> helps

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
because it heats up faster it also helps

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.460 
because it heats up faster it also helps
to<00:04:23.910> improve<00:04:24.030> draught<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.050> all<00:04:25.140> sorts<00:04:25.380> of

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
to improve draught and all sorts of

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.840 
to improve draught and all sorts of
things<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:25.740> there's<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.950> lot<00:04:26.070> of<00:04:26.100> benefits<00:04:26.669> with

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
things so there's a lot of benefits with

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.680 
things so there's a lot of benefits with
a<00:04:26.880> double<00:04:27.270> wall

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
a double wall
