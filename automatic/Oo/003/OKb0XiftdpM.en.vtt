time to start listing your items is on
Sunday<00:04:57.500> night<00:04:57.710> because<00:04:58.040> that's<00:04:58.160> when<00:04:58.370> most

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
Sunday night because that's when most

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.400 
Sunday night because that's when most
people<00:04:58.639> are<00:04:58.970> surfing<00:04:59.419> the<00:04:59.540> web<00:04:59.720> I<00:05:00.050> usually

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
people are surfing the web I usually

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.440 
people are surfing the web I usually
start<00:05:00.620> my<00:05:00.740> listings<00:05:01.190> around<00:05:01.460> 9<00:05:01.729> p.m.<00:05:02.000> or<00:05:02.270> so

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
start my listings around 9 p.m. or so

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.360 
start my listings around 9 p.m. or so
because<00:05:03.139> I<00:05:03.169> find<00:05:03.560> that<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.800> brings<00:05:03.950> the<00:05:04.100> most

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
because I find that it brings the most

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.280 
because I find that it brings the most
traffic<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.030> then<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.479> listing<00:05:05.900> usually

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
traffic and then the listing usually

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.560 
traffic and then the listing usually
ends<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.710> week<00:05:06.919> later<00:05:07.220> at<00:05:07.400> 9:00<00:05:07.580> p.m.<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:08.450> it

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
ends a week later at 9:00 p.m. so it

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.540 
ends a week later at 9:00 p.m. so it
starts<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.260> ends<00:05:09.590> right<00:05:09.830> when<00:05:10.010> people<00:05:10.310> tend

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
starts and ends right when people tend

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.100 
starts and ends right when people tend
