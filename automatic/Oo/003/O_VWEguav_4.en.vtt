the point of there so you can see as I

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.670 
the point of there so you can see as I
move<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.320> over<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.710> key<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.010> goes<00:00:56.219> green<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.680> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
move it over a key it goes green and it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.599 
move it over a key it goes green and it
shows<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.250> which<00:00:59.370> key<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.260> as<00:01:01.260> well

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
shows you which key it is there as well

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.760 
shows you which key it is there as well
so<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.910> click<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:06.530> all<00:01:07.530> these

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so if I click on that then all these

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
so if I click on that then all these
down<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.490> green<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.180> before<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.570> clicked

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
down here go green so before I clicked

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.789 
down here go green so before I clicked
on<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.290> were<00:01:11.360> ok<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.470> green

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
on it they were ok but they go green

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.560 
on it they were ok but they go green
which<00:01:14.100> means<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.460> become<00:01:14.729> customizable<00:01:17.570> so

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
which means they become customizable so

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.170 
which means they become customizable so
I<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.869> set<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.320> any<00:01:20.130> key<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> keyboard<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I can set up any key on the keyboard to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
I can set up any key on the keyboard to
be<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.630> profile<00:01:22.200> switch<00:01:22.500> all<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.159> program<00:01:24.979> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
be a profile switch all to program that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.100 
be a profile switch all to program that
the<00:01:26.310> fault<00:01:26.580> p<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.030> puts<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> back<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the fault p just puts it back to what it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.880 
the fault p just puts it back to what it
was<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:29.009> default<00:01:29.700> moline<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.560> set<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.829> up

was the default moline you can set it up

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
was the default moline you can set it up
to<00:01:31.950> act<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.579> another<00:01:32.880> key<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.479> set<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.020> up<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
to act as another key and set it up to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
to act as another key and set it up to
initiate<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> macro<00:01:36.710> okay<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.770> I've<00:01:38.340> set<00:01:38.729> up

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.300 
macros at all so I haven't played around
with<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.319> at<00:02:31.500> all<00:02:31.560> yet<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.129> obviously

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
with this at all yet but obviously

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.550 
with this at all yet but obviously
highly<00:02:35.310> configurable<00:02:36.950> lots<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.129> options<00:02:38.310> here

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
highly configurable lots of options here

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.160 
highly configurable lots of options here
I'll<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:43.879> go<00:02:44.879> over<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.269> here<00:02:45.480> slowly<00:02:45.810> for

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
I'll just go over it here slowly for

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.550 
I'll just go over it here slowly for
people<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.560> were<00:02:46.650> interested<00:02:48.379> so<00:02:49.379> that's

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
people that were interested so that's

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.349 
people that were interested so that's
where<00:02:49.769> your<00:02:49.890> list<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.190> macros<00:02:50.579> will<00:02:50.760> come<00:02:50.910> up

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.729 

yeah<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:54.480> think<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:55.019> really<00:02:55.109> see<00:02:55.470> those

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
yeah I think you can really see those

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.170 
yeah I think you can really see those
but<00:02:56.480> from<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.599> left<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.019> right<00:02:58.079> there's<00:02:58.680> a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
but from the left to the right there's a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.940 
but from the left to the right there's a
rewind<00:03:00.180> button<00:03:00.329> record<00:03:01.230> button<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:01.709> play

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
rewind button record button would play

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.510 
rewind button record button would play

during<00:03:22.400> recording<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.240> can<00:03:23.720> take<00:03:23.930> that

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
during recording you can take that

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.340 
during recording you can take that

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
insert default delay which is 50

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.530 
insert default delay which is 50
milliseconds<00:03:29.710> so<00:03:30.710> that's<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.330> that's<00:03:32.330> your

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
milliseconds so that's it that's your

that<00:03:38.300> takes<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.050> young<00:03:39.320> where<00:03:39.890> I<00:03:39.920> just

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
that takes you to the young where I just

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.440 
that takes you to the young where I just
clicked<00:03:40.400> up<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.880> top<00:03:41.030> right-hand<00:03:41.240> corner

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
clicked up the top right-hand corner

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.570 
clicked up the top right-hand corner
they<00:03:41.750> take<00:03:41.990> you<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> website<00:03:42.920> we<00:03:43.430> can

they take you to a website we can

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.700 
they take you to a website we can
download<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.030> drivers<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.720> support<00:03:45.110> site

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.960 

then<00:03:48.710> you've<00:03:48.860> got<00:03:49.040> your<00:03:49.070> drive<00:03:49.430> version

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
then you've got your drive version

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.690 
then you've got your drive version
firmware<00:03:50.270> version<00:03:50.840> down<00:03:50.990> above<00:03:51.230> there<00:03:51.700> yeah

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
firmware version down above there yeah

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.900 
firmware version down above there yeah
so<00:03:52.910> it's<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.150> same<00:03:53.360> for<00:03:53.660> both<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:55.730> would

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
so it's the same for both the like would

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.140 
so it's the same for both the like would
I<00:03:55.970> ultimate<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.810> standard<00:03:57.230> black<00:03:57.380> widow

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
I ultimate and the standard black widow

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150 
I ultimate and the standard black widow
okay
