00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.140 

I<00:02:50.319> think<00:02:50.890> we<00:02:50.980> should<00:02:51.159> skate<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.549> JV<00:02:51.790> around

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
I think we should skate the JV around

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.630 
I think we should skate the JV around
but<00:02:52.480> get<00:02:52.659> up<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:55.060> up<00:02:55.090> Bobby<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:59.680> thinking

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
but get up get up Bobby go thinking

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.949 
but get up get up Bobby go thinking
about<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.000> would<00:03:01.060> definitely<00:03:01.510> want<00:03:01.810> to

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
about it I would definitely want to

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.630 
about it I would definitely want to
skate<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.409> Roxton<00:03:03.150> on<00:03:04.150> route<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:06.280> such

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
skate you Roxton on route and it's such

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.160 
skate you Roxton on route and it's such
a<00:03:06.670> powerful<00:03:06.940> piece<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.450> music<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.900> I've<00:03:07.989> heard

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
a powerful piece of music and I've heard

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.430 
a powerful piece of music and I've heard
people<00:03:08.200> do<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.739> with<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.310> know<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.579> classical

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
people do it with you know the classical

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.869 
people do it with you know the classical
classical<00:03:11.440> instruments<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.459> think<00:03:12.700> with

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
classical instruments and I think with

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.270 
classical instruments and I think with
the<00:03:13.030> words<00:03:13.180> it's<00:03:13.390> just<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.810> powerful<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.590> you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
the words it's just so powerful and you

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.530 
the words it's just so powerful and you
really<00:03:15.640> bring<00:03:15.790> something<00:03:16.030> different<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
really bring something different to the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.750 
really bring something different to the
table
