helps you to create custom shatters

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.929 
helps you to create custom shatters
shattered<00:00:23.730> shapes<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.930> your<00:00:24.960> simulations<00:00:25.939> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
shattered shapes for your simulations so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.990 
shattered shapes for your simulations so
first<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.570> start<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:28.580> 3ds<00:00:29.580> Max<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
first of all you start your 3ds Max and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.740 
first of all you start your 3ds Max and
then<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:30.449> into<00:00:30.890> your<00:00:32.059> geometry<00:00:33.059> layout

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
then you go into your geometry layout

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.569 
then you go into your geometry layout
and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> bottom<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.860> find<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.280> fire

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and then in the bottom you find a fire

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.729 
and then in the bottom you find a fire
and<00:00:35.880> there<00:00:36.059> you've<00:00:36.180> got<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> shooting<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and there you've got the shooting the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.910 
and there you've got the shooting the
trace<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.430> Ray<00:00:38.670> fire<00:00:38.969> tool<00:00:39.710> for<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:40.860> we

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
trace and the Ray fire tool for now we

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.130 
trace and the Ray fire tool for now we
will<00:00:41.190> only<00:00:41.430> open<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> trace<00:00:42.329> option<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
will only open up the trace option I

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.799 
will only open up the trace option I
will<00:00:43.469> expand<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> menu<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
will expand the menu here and then you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.490 
will expand the menu here and then you
have<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.550> drag<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:49.100> plane<00:00:51.079> just<00:00:52.079> click<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
have to drag out a plane just click and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.910 
have to drag out a plane just click and
drag<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> plane<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.430> created<00:00:54.920> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
drag and then the plane is created and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.170 
drag and then the plane is created and
then<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> create<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.969> custom

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
then if you want to create a custom

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.950 
then if you want to create a custom
shuttle<00:00:58.730> shuttle<00:00:59.730> layout<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.600> got<00:01:00.780> your

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
shuttle shuttle layout you just got your

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.200 
shuttle shuttle layout you just got your
bitmap<00:01:01.289> choose<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.370> image<00:01:02.460> I've<00:01:02.820> got<00:01:03.030> one

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
bitmap choose your image I've got one

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.440 
bitmap choose your image I've got one
from<00:01:03.539> Ray<00:01:03.989> fire<00:01:04.549> it's<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.150> correct

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
from Ray fire it's just some correct

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.020 
from Ray fire it's just some correct
floor<00:01:06.960> grounds<00:01:07.530> double<00:01:08.040> click<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
floor grounds double click and then it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.210 
floor grounds double click and then it
takes<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.420> while<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.890> added

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
takes a while and then it will be added

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.140 
takes a while and then it will be added
to<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:12.299> ground<00:01:13.140> plane<00:01:16.549> there<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to your ground plane there we go now you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
to your ground plane there we go now you
can<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.630> my<00:01:19.020> president<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.500> four<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.159> show<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
can see my president of four to show the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.499 
can see my president of four to show the
wireframe<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> shapes

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
wireframe you can see the the shapes

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.710 
wireframe you can see the the shapes
from<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> image<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:26.490> image<00:01:26.520> looks<00:01:27.060> something

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
from the image the image looks something

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.469 
from the image the image looks something
like<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:30.799> so<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> image<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.180> this

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
like this so this is the image and this

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719 
like this so this is the image and this
is<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> traced<00:01:34.020> image<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.619> looks<00:01:35.369> exactly

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
is the traced image so it looks exactly

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.749 
is the traced image so it looks exactly
the<00:01:35.939> same<00:01:36.619> you've<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:37.979> some<00:01:38.189> parameters

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the same you've got here some parameters

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.179 
the same you've got here some parameters
to<00:01:38.909> change<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.630> display<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:41.009> how<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
to change the display or how the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.840 
to change the display or how the
generation<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.979> image<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> being<00:01:44.579> traced

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
generation of the image is being traced

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.050 
generation of the image is being traced
this<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.320> value<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.040> always<00:01:47.430> use

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
this is just a value so always use

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.850 
this is just a value so always use
black-and-white<00:01:48.630> images<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.649> best

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
black-and-white images for the best

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.850 
black-and-white images for the best
output<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.170> change<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> value

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
output and you can change the value

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
output and you can change the value
which<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:54.180> will<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.899> just

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
which will which will actually just

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
which will which will actually just
increase<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> contrast<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> image<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
increase the contrast of the image and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.560 
increase the contrast of the image and
you<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:57.869> defined<00:01:58.259> shapes<00:01:59.240> the<00:02:00.240> relaxed

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you get more defined shapes the relaxed

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.870 
you get more defined shapes the relaxed
edges<00:02:00.990> will<00:02:01.469> smooth<00:02:01.829> ins<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.520> edges

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
edges will smooth ins out your edges

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.609 
edges will smooth ins out your edges
which<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.060> pretty<00:02:03.390> straight<00:02:03.689> straightforward

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
which is pretty straight straightforward

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.999 
which is pretty straight straightforward
and<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.750> come<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.200> exciting<00:02:07.619> part<00:02:07.649> you

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and now we come to the exciting part you

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.010 
and now we come to the exciting part you
can<00:02:08.190> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.330> shut

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
can if you like you can shut

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.010 
can if you like you can shut
the<00:02:10.350> inner<00:02:10.920> parts<00:02:11.340> by<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.240> hitting<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the inner parts by just hitting the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.260 
the inner parts by just hitting the
fracture<00:02:13.380> then<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.650> will<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:13.920> shattered<00:02:14.340> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
fracture then it will be shattered and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.210 
fracture then it will be shattered and
you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:17.150> extrude<00:02:18.150> them<00:02:18.680> which<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.800> also<00:02:20.040> very

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
you can extrude them which is also very

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.250 
you can extrude them which is also very
nice<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.730> also<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.360> also<00:02:21.510> use<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.960> for

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
nice it's also you can also use that for

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.950 
nice it's also you can also use that for
a<00:02:22.290> super<00:02:23.070> modeling<00:02:23.490> tool<00:02:23.730> instead<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.600> using<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
a super modeling tool instead of using a

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.930 
a super modeling tool instead of using a
spacer<00:02:25.230> maps<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.680> use<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.130> with<00:02:26.310> Wi-Fi<00:02:26.880> to

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
spacer maps you can use it with Wi-Fi to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.240 
spacer maps you can use it with Wi-Fi to
model<00:02:27.480> some<00:02:27.660> nice-looking<00:02:27.930> walls<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:29.010> ground

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
model some nice-looking walls of ground

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.300 
model some nice-looking walls of ground
floors<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.780> would<00:02:31.050> go<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.290> Shell<00:02:32.280> and

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
floors so you would go to Shell and

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.390 
floors so you would go to Shell and
click<00:02:33.150> interior<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.930> exterior<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.680> now<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
click interior and exterior and now you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.870 
click interior and exterior and now you
can<00:02:35.670> define<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:37.040> thickness<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.310> if<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.520> want<00:02:38.730> it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
can define a thickness so if you want it

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.930 
can define a thickness so if you want it
to<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.150> three<00:02:39.390> centimeters<00:02:40.050> thick<00:02:40.850> then<00:02:41.850> it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
to be three centimeters thick then it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.190 
to be three centimeters thick then it
would<00:02:42.090> look<00:02:42.240> something<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:42.690> this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
would look something like this

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.350 
would look something like this
you<00:02:43.920> think<00:02:44.160> wow<00:02:44.250> that's<00:02:44.400> something<00:02:44.640> nothing

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
you think wow that's something nothing

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.720 
you think wow that's something nothing
special<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.730> also<00:02:48.330> make<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
special but now you can also make a

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.980 
special but now you can also make a
variation<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.570> can<00:02:51.780> offset

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
variation of that so you can offset

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.230 
variation of that so you can offset
let's<00:02:52.830> say<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.160> exterior<00:02:53.460> or<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> big<00:02:54.030> tile

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
let's say the exterior or the big tile

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.440 
let's say the exterior or the big tile
so<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.600> want<00:02:54.930> them<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.380> offset<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.180> now<00:02:57.390> you

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
so I want them to be offset so now you

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.990 
so I want them to be offset so now you
can<00:02:57.780> extrude<00:02:58.260> them<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.250> see<00:02:59.490> here<00:02:59.790> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
can extrude them as you can see here and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.420 
can extrude them as you can see here and
if<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.690> want<00:03:00.900> some<00:03:01.140> more<00:03:01.380> variations<00:03:02.310> you'll

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
if you want some more variations you'll

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.240 
if you want some more variations you'll
add<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.820> add<00:03:03.000> some<00:03:03.800> variation<00:03:04.800> here

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
add you can add some variation here

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.500 
add you can add some variation here
that's<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.300> 0.5<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.730> probably<00:03:09.090> too<00:03:09.300> much

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
that's a 0.5 and it's probably too much

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.350 
that's a 0.5 and it's probably too much
and<00:03:10.460> now<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:11.610> can<00:03:11.910> see<00:03:14.000> you've<00:03:15.000> got<00:03:15.060> some

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
and now you can see you've got some

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.640 
and now you can see you've got some
nice-looking<00:03:17.480> ground<00:03:18.480> planes<00:03:18.840> or<00:03:19.080> floors<00:03:19.410> or

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
nice-looking ground planes or floors or

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.760 
nice-looking ground planes or floors or
whatever<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.690> could<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.380> be<00:03:22.530> used

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
whatever and this you could can be used

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.710 
whatever and this you could can be used
for<00:03:23.040> modeling<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.670> can<00:03:23.730> movie<00:03:24.150> tech<00:03:24.570> if

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
for modeling you can movie tech if

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.600 
for modeling you can movie tech if
you<00:03:24.840> like<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.200> budget<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.950> one<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.280> also<00:03:26.400> be

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
you like to budget this one can also be

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.970 
you like to budget this one can also be
used<00:03:26.850> for<00:03:26.970> shattering<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.440> if<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:28.770> back

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
used for shattering so if you go back

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.790 
used for shattering so if you go back
into<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.460> settings<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.240> my<00:03:30.270> traced<00:03:30.990> ground

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
into the settings of my traced ground

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.570 
into the settings of my traced ground
plane<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:33.180> have<00:03:33.300> no<00:03:33.450> other<00:03:33.540> option<00:03:33.960> -<00:03:34.580> first

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
plane you have no other option - first

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.510 
plane you have no other option - first
of<00:03:35.730> all<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.120> shatter<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.690> interior<00:03:37.140> pieces

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
of all to shatter the interior pieces

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.180 
of all to shatter the interior pieces
you<00:03:38.520> would<00:03:38.610> do<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.940> by<00:03:39.000> hitting<00:03:39.570> fracture<00:03:40.230> it

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
you would do that by hitting fracture it

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.850 
you would do that by hitting fracture it
takes<00:03:41.430> our<00:03:41.640> while<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:44.060> think<00:03:45.060> yeah<00:03:45.860> spinning

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
takes our while I think yeah spinning

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.350 
takes our while I think yeah spinning
wheel

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.210 

so<00:03:52.360> now<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:53.440> inner<00:03:53.680> pieces<00:03:53.890> are<00:03:54.099> also

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
so now the inner pieces are also

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.740 
so now the inner pieces are also
fractured<00:03:54.790> as<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.180> see<00:03:55.360> they've<00:03:55.540> got

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
fractured as you can see they've got

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.010 
fractured as you can see they've got
nice<00:03:55.959> pieces<00:03:56.560> here<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.569> now<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:58.630> can<00:03:58.870> work

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
nice pieces here and now you can work

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.839 
nice pieces here and now you can work
with<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.560> ray<00:03:59.709> fire<00:04:00.010> if<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.400> liked<00:04:00.640> you

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
with that in ray fire if you liked you

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.809 
with that in ray fire if you liked you
so<00:04:01.330> you<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.470> use<00:04:02.650> that<00:04:02.830> as<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.069> ground<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.610> just

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
so you can use that as a ground and just

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.300 
so you can use that as a ground and just
you<00:04:03.940> can<00:04:04.120> use<00:04:04.300> that<00:04:04.660> for<00:04:05.020> whatever<00:04:05.680> for<00:04:06.160> your

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
you can use that for whatever for your

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.860 
you can use that for whatever for your
rendering<00:04:06.730> but<00:04:07.239> then<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.510> would<00:04:07.690> recommend

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
rendering but then I would recommend

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.070 
rendering but then I would recommend
shattering<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.680> interior<00:04:09.099> pieces<00:04:09.630> but<00:04:10.630> now

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
shattering the interior pieces but now

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.949 
shattering the interior pieces but now
you<00:04:11.140> could<00:04:11.560> use<00:04:12.099> it<00:04:12.760> in<00:04:12.849> Ray<00:04:13.060> fire<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.720> let's

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
you could use it in Ray fire so let's

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.670 
you could use it in Ray fire so let's
start<00:04:14.440> an<00:04:14.620> open<00:04:15.160> red<00:04:15.580> fire<00:04:19.290> there<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.350> go<00:04:20.470> so

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
start an open red fire there you go so

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.620 
start an open red fire there you go so
rare<00:04:20.859> fires<00:04:21.100> open<00:04:21.459> if<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.639> now<00:04:21.910> would<00:04:22.180> like<00:04:22.210> to

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
rare fires open if you now would like to

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.890 
rare fires open if you now would like to
shatter<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.860> floor<00:04:24.610> plan<00:04:24.639> all<00:04:25.479> you<00:04:25.630> have<00:04:25.780> to

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
shatter this floor plan all you have to

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.280 
shatter this floor plan all you have to
do<00:04:26.050> is<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:26.530> go<00:04:27.280> into<00:04:27.430> option<00:04:28.240> I'll<00:04:28.450> go<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.900> tools

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
do is I go into option I'll go to tools

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.070 
do is I go into option I'll go to tools
and<00:04:29.470> detach<00:04:30.130> my<00:04:30.400> elements<00:04:30.880> selected<00:04:31.000> now<00:04:31.900> it

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
and detach my elements selected now it

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.290 
and detach my elements selected now it
will<00:04:32.229> create<00:04:32.470> shatter<00:04:33.220> pieces<00:04:33.760> from<00:04:34.090> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
will create shatter pieces from the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.690 
will create shatter pieces from the
floor<00:04:34.660> so<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:38.530> takes<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.950> time<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.190> fracture

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
floor so it takes the time to fracture

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.280 
floor so it takes the time to fracture
but<00:04:39.850> now<00:04:40.000> it's<00:04:40.150> finally<00:04:40.389> done<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:41.110> can

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
but now it's finally done and you can

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.090 
but now it's finally done and you can
see<00:04:41.320> in<00:04:41.620> your<00:04:42.630> lane<00:04:43.630> pane<00:04:44.290> here<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.620> can<00:04:44.860> see

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
see in your lane pane here you can see

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.560 
see in your lane pane here you can see
you've<00:04:45.280> got<00:04:45.310> two<00:04:45.850> thousand<00:04:46.300> four<00:04:46.510> hundred

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
you've got two thousand four hundred

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.110 
you've got two thousand four hundred
fractured<00:04:47.169> objects<00:04:47.710> so<00:04:48.700> it's<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:50.050> bit

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
fractured objects so it's a bit

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.600 
fractured objects so it's a bit
performance<00:04:52.120> heavy<00:04:52.479> but<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.380> also<00:04:53.560> set<00:04:54.370> the

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
performance heavy but I also set the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.000 
performance heavy but I also set the
fracture<00:04:54.970> pieces<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.419> very<00:04:55.600> small<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:56.229> you<00:04:56.830> get

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
fracture pieces to very small so you get

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.969 
fracture pieces to very small so you get
nice<00:04:57.220> detail<00:04:57.640> when<00:04:57.820> fracturing<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.830> what

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
nice detail when fracturing it so what

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.909 
nice detail when fracturing it so what
you<00:05:00.010> could<00:05:00.250> do<00:05:00.460> now<00:05:00.640> is<00:05:01.360> add<00:05:02.229> your<00:05:02.260> pieces<00:05:02.680> to

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
you could do now is add your pieces to

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.360 
you could do now is add your pieces to
refine<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.460> use<00:05:03.610> them<00:05:03.789> in<00:05:03.910> your<00:05:03.940> simulation

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
refine and use them in your simulation

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.510 
refine and use them in your simulation
actually<00:05:06.370> I<00:05:06.430> will<00:05:06.610> do<00:05:07.710> another<00:05:08.710> tutorial<00:05:09.010> for

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
actually I will do another tutorial for

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.310 
actually I will do another tutorial for
that<00:05:09.669> but<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.270> just<00:05:10.630> quickly<00:05:10.810> go<00:05:11.050> through<00:05:11.080> I

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
that but I just quickly go through I

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.290 
that but I just quickly go through I
will<00:05:11.530> add<00:05:11.740> my<00:05:11.919> objects<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.760> here<00:05:12.940> so<00:05:13.150> they<00:05:13.270> are

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
will add my objects to here so they are

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.680 
will add my objects to here so they are
all<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:15.520> dynamic<00:05:15.910> objects<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.479> then<00:05:16.600> I

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
all and the dynamic objects and then I

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.779 
all and the dynamic objects and then I
just<00:05:16.900> create<00:05:17.200> for<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.919> scripted<00:05:18.400> world's

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
just create for the scripted world's

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.430 
just create for the scripted world's

bomb<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:26.080> this<00:05:26.500> one<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:26.710> will<00:05:26.860> place<00:05:27.160> a<00:05:27.190> bit

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
bomb and this one I will place a bit

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.950 
bomb and this one I will place a bit
below<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:29.400> add<00:05:30.400> this<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:31.030> my<00:05:31.060> simulation

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
below and add this to my simulation

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.659 
below and add this to my simulation
properties<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:34.240> now<00:05:34.560> also<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.800> deactivate

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
properties so now also a deactivate

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.790 
properties so now also a deactivate
setting<00:05:37.060> dynamic<00:05:37.630> objects<00:05:38.139> and<00:05:38.350> activate

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
setting dynamic objects and activate

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.969 
setting dynamic objects and activate
them<00:05:38.979> by<00:05:39.100> force<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.820> I<00:05:40.780> want<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.200> use<00:05:41.380> home

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
them by force and I want to use home

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.960 
them by force and I want to use home
good<00:05:42.250> electron<00:05:42.850> plan<00:05:44.190> so<00:05:45.190> now<00:05:45.340> I<00:05:45.370> will<00:05:45.669> exit

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
good electron plan so now I will exit

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.240 
good electron plan so now I will exit
simulate<00:05:46.479> and<00:05:46.810> I'll<00:05:47.260> be<00:05:47.440> back<00:05:47.620> just<00:05:48.010> in<00:05:48.130> a

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
simulate and I'll be back just in a

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.670 
simulate and I'll be back just in a
minute<00:05:48.690> okay<00:05:49.690> now<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:49.930> simulation<00:05:50.560> is<00:05:50.620> done

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
minute okay now the simulation is done

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.810 
minute okay now the simulation is done
and<00:05:51.960> you<00:05:52.960> can<00:05:53.169> see<00:05:53.200> that<00:05:53.710> my<00:05:53.860> form<00:05:54.130> I<00:05:54.310> just<00:05:54.669> made

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
and you can see that my form I just made

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.909 
and you can see that my form I just made
it<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.270> bit<00:05:55.630> bigger<00:05:55.900> but<00:05:57.930> because<00:05:58.930> I<00:05:59.289> using<00:05:59.800> a

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
it a bit bigger but because I using a

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.550 
it a bit bigger but because I using a
demo<00:06:00.130> version<00:06:00.430> of<00:06:00.640> the<00:06:00.700> ref<00:06:01.000> I<00:06:01.180> -<00:06:01.240> I<00:06:01.419> think<00:06:01.630> it

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
demo version of the ref I - I think it

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.690 
demo version of the ref I - I think it
won't<00:06:02.830> affect<00:06:03.310> Oh

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
won't affect Oh

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.060 
won't affect Oh
my<00:06:03.790> fragment<00:06:04.330> pieces<00:06:05.020> because<00:06:05.380> it's<00:06:05.920> a

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
my fragment pieces because it's a

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:12.030 
my fragment pieces because it's a
time-limited<00:06:06.790> demo<00:06:07.000> version<00:06:10.770> but<00:06:11.770> you<00:06:11.890> can

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
time-limited demo version but you can

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.870 
time-limited demo version but you can
see<00:06:12.220> now<00:06:12.370> is<00:06:12.670> the<00:06:14.010> ground<00:06:15.010> is<00:06:15.250> being<00:06:15.430> shattered

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
see now is the ground is being shattered

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.480 
see now is the ground is being shattered
and<00:06:16.120> exported<00:06:16.600> it's<00:06:16.810> because<00:06:17.470> of<00:06:17.650> the<00:06:17.740> bomb<00:06:17.980> so

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
and exported it's because of the bomb so

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.110 
and exported it's because of the bomb so
you<00:06:19.120> can<00:06:19.300> see<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:20.530> pieces<00:06:20.770> are<00:06:21.070> nicely<00:06:21.550> broken

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
you can see the pieces are nicely broken

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.500 
you can see the pieces are nicely broken
up

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
up

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.170 
up
they<00:06:22.720> are<00:06:22.870> moving<00:06:23.110> perfectly<00:06:23.920> and<00:06:24.180> they

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
they are moving perfectly and they

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.720 
they are moving perfectly and they
always<00:06:25.420> have<00:06:25.660> fly<00:06:25.900> nice<00:06:26.200> and<00:06:26.530> the<00:06:26.730> virtual

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
always have fly nice and the virtual

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.550 
always have fly nice and the virtual
world<00:06:28.590> as<00:06:29.910> I<00:06:30.910> just<00:06:31.060> said<00:06:31.240> in<00:06:31.690> actually<00:06:32.350> the

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
world as I just said in actually the

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.800 
world as I just said in actually the
radius<00:06:33.070> of<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.400> bomb<00:06:33.610> was<00:06:33.820> way<00:06:34.210> bigger<00:06:34.450> but<00:06:34.780> I

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
radius of the bomb was way bigger but I

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.810 
radius of the bomb was way bigger but I
think<00:06:35.110> it's<00:06:35.230> limited<00:06:35.680> in<00:06:35.980> this<00:06:36.250> demo<00:06:36.550> version

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
think it's limited in this demo version

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.730 
think it's limited in this demo version
even<00:06:37.390> that<00:06:37.600> only<00:06:37.780> a<00:06:37.900> certain<00:06:38.290> part<00:06:38.650> of

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
even that only a certain part of

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.370 
even that only a certain part of
elements<00:06:39.190> can<00:06:39.220> be<00:06:39.550> simulated<00:06:40.360> but<00:06:40.930> this<00:06:41.230> is

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
elements can be simulated but this is

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.880 
elements can be simulated but this is
how<00:06:41.770> it<00:06:41.950> works<00:06:42.220> and<00:06:42.930> it's<00:06:43.930> pretty<00:06:44.200> easy<00:06:44.470> you

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
how it works and it's pretty easy you

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.560 
how it works and it's pretty easy you
can<00:06:45.670> also<00:06:45.880> create<00:06:46.300> or<00:06:47.200> your<00:06:47.620> custom<00:06:48.100> shattered

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
can also create or your custom shattered

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.820 
can also create or your custom shattered
traces<00:06:49.570> you<00:06:49.720> can<00:06:49.900> go<00:06:50.080> and<00:06:50.200> Photoshop<00:06:50.710> or

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
traces you can go and Photoshop or

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.710 
traces you can go and Photoshop or
whatever<00:06:51.190> and<00:06:51.430> paint<00:06:51.700> some<00:06:51.850> fracture<00:06:52.420> paths

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
whatever and paint some fracture paths

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.110 
whatever and paint some fracture paths
and<00:06:53.140> trace<00:06:53.950> them<00:06:54.160> and<00:06:54.280> use<00:06:54.430> them<00:06:54.580> as<00:06:54.730> fracture

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
and trace them and use them as fracture

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.680 
and trace them and use them as fracture
objects<00:06:55.570> so<00:06:56.190> it's<00:06:57.190> very<00:06:57.490> interactive<00:06:58.240> and

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
objects so it's very interactive and

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.270 
objects so it's very interactive and
very<00:06:58.900> convenient<00:06:59.500> to<00:06:59.650> use<00:07:00.360> so<00:07:01.360> now<00:07:02.040> I'm<00:07:03.040> done

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
very convenient to use so now I'm done

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.100 
very convenient to use so now I'm done
with<00:07:03.460> this<00:07:03.610> tutorial<00:07:04.030> I<00:07:04.120> just<00:07:04.150> wanted<00:07:04.750> to<00:07:04.900> show

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
with this tutorial I just wanted to show

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.990 
with this tutorial I just wanted to show
you<00:07:05.140> how<00:07:05.470> this<00:07:05.710> image<00:07:05.920> tracing<00:07:06.490> works<00:07:06.700> and<00:07:06.880> how

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
you how this image tracing works and how

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.400 
you how this image tracing works and how
you<00:07:07.030> can<00:07:07.150> use<00:07:07.510> that<00:07:07.540> in<00:07:07.930> a<00:07:08.260> fire<00:07:09.010> as<00:07:09.310> your

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
you can use that in a fire as your

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.500 
you can use that in a fire as your
simulation<00:07:11.700> so<00:07:12.700> thank<00:07:13.030> you<00:07:13.150> guys<00:07:13.300> for

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
simulation so thank you guys for

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.080 
simulation so thank you guys for
watching<00:07:13.660> and<00:07:14.080> stay<00:07:14.680> true<00:07:15.010> for<00:07:15.280> my<00:07:15.370> next<00:07:15.580> rifle

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
watching and stay true for my next rifle

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.320 
watching and stay true for my next rifle
oil<00:07:16.600> which<00:07:17.500> will<00:07:17.770> be<00:07:18.070> a<00:07:18.430> bit<00:07:18.790> more<00:07:18.940> in-depth

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
oil which will be a bit more in-depth

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.160 
oil which will be a bit more in-depth
and<00:07:19.630> it<00:07:19.900> will<00:07:20.080> consist<00:07:20.530> of<00:07:21.510> creating<00:07:22.510> custom

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.170 
and it will consist of creating custom

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.940 
and it will consist of creating custom
shatter<00:07:23.680> pieces<00:07:24.250> and<00:07:24.960> using<00:07:25.960> activate<00:07:26.770> by

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:26.950 
shatter pieces and using activate by

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.400 
shatter pieces and using activate by
geometry<00:07:27.280> to<00:07:27.700> get<00:07:27.910> a<00:07:28.180> more<00:07:28.660> realistic<00:07:28.990> feeling

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:29.410 
geometry to get a more realistic feeling

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.090 
geometry to get a more realistic feeling
to<00:07:29.680> it<00:07:29.830> and<00:07:30.060> in<00:07:31.060> the<00:07:31.300> end<00:07:31.480> I<00:07:31.630> will<00:07:31.770> export<00:07:32.770> my

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
to it and in the end I will export my

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.760 
to it and in the end I will export my
shattered<00:07:34.000> pieces<00:07:34.270> to<00:07:34.630> Maya<00:07:34.960> and<00:07:35.350> will<00:07:35.500> render

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.770 
shattered pieces to Maya and will render

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.280 
shattered pieces to Maya and will render
it<00:07:35.980> there<00:07:36.280> I'm<00:07:36.550> just<00:07:37.480> more<00:07:37.690> familiar<00:07:37.840> with

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.290 
it there I'm just more familiar with

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.620 
it there I'm just more familiar with
Maya<00:07:38.620> and<00:07:38.800> rendering<00:07:39.370> so<00:07:39.640> I<00:07:39.670> will<00:07:40.030> use<00:07:40.180> v-ray

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:40.630 
Maya and rendering so I will use v-ray

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.580 
Maya and rendering so I will use v-ray
for<00:07:40.930> Maya<00:07:41.170> and<00:07:41.880> I<00:07:42.880> will<00:07:43.630> show<00:07:44.230> you<00:07:44.260> the<00:07:44.560> end

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:44.590 
for Maya and I will show you the end

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.280 
for Maya and I will show you the end
result<00:07:44.970> so<00:07:45.970> thank<00:07:46.330> you<00:07:46.450> guys<00:07:46.480> I<00:07:46.990> hope<00:07:47.140> you

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290 
result so thank you guys I hope you
