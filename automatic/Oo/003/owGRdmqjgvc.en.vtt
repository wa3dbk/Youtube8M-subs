the secret behind the new nuclear weapon

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.660 
the secret behind the new nuclear weapon
just<00:02:47.359> as<00:02:47.569> I<00:02:47.719> thought<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.530> nuclear<00:02:48.920> warhead<00:02:49.370> is

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
just as I thought the nuclear warhead is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.640 
just as I thought the nuclear warhead is
designed<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.299> be<00:02:50.420> fired<00:02:50.659> from<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.230> railgun

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
designed to be fired from the railgun

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.330 
designed to be fired from the railgun
like<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> projectile<00:02:52.689> it<00:02:53.689> doesn't<00:02:54.109> use<00:02:54.319> fuel<00:02:54.769> so

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
like a projectile it doesn't use fuel so

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.190 
like a projectile it doesn't use fuel so
it<00:02:55.459> isn't<00:02:55.790> considered<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.329> missing<00:02:56.659> that<00:02:57.049> way

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
it isn't considered a missing that way

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.449 
it isn't considered a missing that way
it<00:02:57.379> can<00:02:57.500> get<00:02:57.680> around<00:02:57.859> all<00:02:58.129> sorts<00:02:58.400> of

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
it can get around all sorts of

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.899 
it can get around all sorts of
international<00:02:59.209> treaties<00:02:59.689> pretty<00:03:00.650> see<00:03:00.919> yes

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.059 
but effective and that's not even the
scariest<00:03:04.819> thing<00:03:05.030> about<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.450> weapon<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.069> can't

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
scariest thing about this weapon I can't

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.990 
scariest thing about this weapon I can't
wait<00:03:07.159> to<00:03:07.370> hear<00:03:07.489> this<00:03:07.819> it's<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.750> stealth<00:03:09.290> weapon

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
wait to hear this it's a stealth weapon

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.490 
wait to hear this it's a stealth weapon
you<00:03:11.000> mean<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.269> won't<00:03:11.389> show<00:03:11.689> up<00:03:11.840> on<00:03:11.959> radar<00:03:12.040> yeah

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
you mean it won't show up on radar yeah

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.470 
you mean it won't show up on radar yeah
the<00:03:14.070> truth<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.490> they've<00:03:14.790> been<00:03:14.910> working<00:03:15.120> on<00:03:15.420> a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the truth is they've been working on a

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.960 
the truth is they've been working on a
stealth<00:03:15.810> missed<00:03:16.140> since<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.590> late<00:03:16.770> 70s<00:03:17.010> why

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
stealth missed since the late 70s why

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.760 
stealth missed since the late 70s why
were<00:03:18.180> they<00:03:18.420> able<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.660> develop<00:03:19.110> one<00:03:19.290> until<00:03:19.590> now

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
were they able to develop one until now

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.950 
were they able to develop one until now
because<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.790> missile<00:03:21.150> rocket<00:03:21.540> propulsion

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960

excuses snake listen to me this new
nuclear<00:04:29.340> weapon<00:04:29.760> it's<00:04:30.330> never<00:04:30.720> actually<00:04:31.050> been

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.090 
nuclear weapon it's never actually been
tested<00:04:32.130> only<00:04:32.750> simulated<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:34.530> mean<00:04:34.740> they<00:04:34.890> ran

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
tested only simulated you mean they ran

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.090 
tested only simulated you mean they ran
a<00:04:35.130> computer<00:04:35.700> model<00:04:35.910> yeah<00:04:36.720> that's<00:04:37.590> why<00:04:37.890> they

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
a computer model yeah that's why they

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.070 
a computer model yeah that's why they
were<00:04:38.160> conducting<00:04:38.730> this<00:04:38.850> exercise<00:04:39.480> they

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
were conducting this exercise they

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.320 
were conducting this exercise they
needed<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.620> get<00:04:40.800> actual<00:04:41.250> experimental<00:04:41.760> data

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
needed to get actual experimental data

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.960 
needed to get actual experimental data
to<00:04:42.630> back<00:04:42.900> up<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.290> simulation<00:04:43.980> what<00:04:44.670> were<00:04:44.820> the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
to back up the simulation what were the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.480 
to back up the simulation what were the
results<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.600> exercise<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.860> looks<00:04:47.130> like<00:04:47.250> it

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
results of the exercise it looks like it

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.730 
results of the exercise it looks like it
went<00:04:47.670> better<00:04:47.880> than<00:04:48.000> they<00:04:48.300> hoped<00:04:48.480> for<00:04:48.960> but<00:04:49.440> I

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
went better than they hoped for but I

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.250 
went better than they hoped for but I
can't<00:04:50.460> find<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.970> data<00:04:51.240> anywhere<00:04:51.900> on<00:04:52.110> this

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
can't find the data anywhere on this

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.030 
can't find the data anywhere on this

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
dummy warhead with a real warhead once

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.790 
dummy warhead with a real warhead once
they<00:05:12.790> input<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.360> detonation<00:05:14.020> codes<00:05:14.290> they

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
they input the detonation codes they

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.890 
they input the detonation codes they
should<00:05:15.010> be<00:05:15.160> ready<00:05:15.340> to<00:05:15.520> launch<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:16.780> think

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
should be ready to launch so you think

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.530 
should be ready to launch so you think
they<00:05:17.260> can<00:05:17.440> do<00:05:17.620> it<00:05:17.800> well<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.820> dummy<00:05:19.150> warhead

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
they can do it well the dummy warhead

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.210 
they can do it well the dummy warhead
was<00:05:19.750> designed<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.170> be<00:05:20.260> identical<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.100> real

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
was designed to be identical to the real

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.850 
was designed to be identical to the real
things<00:05:21.610> might<00:05:21.760> think<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:22.510> did<00:05:23.230> you<00:05:23.350> find<00:05:23.650> out

about the override system yet but I

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.969 
about the override system yet but I
found<00:06:03.160> Baker's<00:06:03.669> ulterior<00:06:04.270> motive<00:06:04.740> he's<00:06:05.740> just

looking to get rich as they arms tech is
in<00:06:08.680> much<00:06:08.860> worse<00:06:09.129> financial<00:06:09.400> trouble<00:06:10.090> than<00:06:10.210> I

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
in much worse financial trouble than I

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.390 
in much worse financial trouble than I
thought<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.900> know<00:06:11.379> they<00:06:11.680> lost<00:06:11.919> their<00:06:12.129> bid<00:06:12.370> to

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
thought I know they lost their bid to

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.070 
thought I know they lost their bid to
make<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.819> next<00:06:12.970> generation<00:06:13.509> fighter<00:06:13.780> jet

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
make the next generation fighter jet

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.529 
make the next generation fighter jet
that<00:06:14.620> plus<00:06:14.979> the<00:06:15.009> reduction<00:06:15.520> in<00:06:15.580> SD<00:06:15.879> i<00:06:15.909> spending

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
that plus the reduction in SD i spending

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.210 
that plus the reduction in SD i spending
it<00:06:16.960> looks<00:06:17.139> like<00:06:17.319> there<00:06:17.470> was<00:06:17.560> even<00:06:17.860> some<00:06:17.889> talk

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
it looks like there was even some talk

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.059 
it looks like there was even some talk
of<00:06:18.400> a<00:06:18.729> hostile<00:06:19.240> takeover<00:06:19.919> everything<00:06:20.919> was

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
of a hostile takeover everything was

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.430 
of a hostile takeover everything was
riding<00:06:21.490> on<00:06:21.580> this<00:06:21.729> project<00:06:22.030> I<00:06:22.360> guess<00:06:22.569> it<00:06:23.409> looks

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
riding on this project I guess it looks

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.559 
riding on this project I guess it looks
like<00:06:23.770> we<00:06:23.979> were<00:06:24.129> paying<00:06:24.370> a<00:06:24.550> lot<00:06:24.819> of<00:06:24.849> bribe<00:06:25.240> money

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
like we were paying a lot of bribe money

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.040 
like we were paying a lot of bribe money

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
to the dye regime bride Maria yeah and

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.469 
to the dye regime bride Maria yeah and
Baker<00:06:29.740> was<00:06:30.009> a<00:06:30.039> big<00:06:30.280> proponent<00:06:30.520> of<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.060> nuclear

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
Baker was a big proponent of the nuclear

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.279 
Baker was a big proponent of the nuclear
deterrent<00:06:32.050> theory<00:06:32.349> I<00:06:32.710> say<00:06:33.300> so<00:06:34.300> anyway<00:06:34.720> what

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
deterrent theory I say so anyway what

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.499 
deterrent theory I say so anyway what
about<00:06:35.319> the<00:06:35.650> override<00:06:36.130> just<00:06:36.940> give<00:06:37.150> me<00:06:37.270> a<00:06:37.300> little
