00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.990
 hello yesterday it was like a wildfire 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.790
 through the internet hardware in windows 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.020
 10 not even on the market and 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.480
 you already have a keylogger 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.760
 So captured what is it about the 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.830
 history 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.840
 Windows 10 is currently in the sun 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.640
 mentioned technical preview appeared 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.110
 let developers look at it 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.820
 can if there are any 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.400
 There may be difficulties then 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.860
 to customize your own program 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.930
 that's what makes microsoft last forever 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.000
 microsoft also knows that the new one 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.010
 windows loaded from end users down 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.300
 will just want to look 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.070
 just want to test 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.350
 so far it is understandable that 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.930
 microsoft itself wants to learn too 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.239
 to make the program better in the end 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.230
 The question is now how far does it go? 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.000
 Microsoft 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.160
 now who downloads windows 10 down 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.530
 takes loud microsoft at the so-called 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.700
 insider program part link of course also 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.110
 again in the description I have 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.840
 already called here and get there 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.580
 here is the information windows insider 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.590
 there is a program in this program 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.770
 basically several programs but 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.960
 also windows 10 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.479
 and what information microsoft 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.920
 our use wins if one experiences 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.390
 we scroll down a bit 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.610
 if you go here on the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.530
 privacy policy clicks the link 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.299
 may be a bit hidden now 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.680
 no idea if that should be the intention 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.910
 here 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.460
 in our privacy policy 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.440
 Learn how we get information about you 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
 your installation and so on for the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.110
 preview for improvements and so on 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.190
 use 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.380
 So just click on it 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.790
 and looked purely here you get 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.860
 first, of course, again 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.200
 obvious purpose and explained 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.530
 Although it is about what information 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.140
 we send to microsoft or microsoft 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.650
 then get read from our plate 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.760
 We will then capture data here 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.650
 when you purchase the program 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.900
 install and use collects 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.870
 microsoft informations about you her 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.880
 appliances applications and networks as well 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.620
 about your use of these devices 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.470
 applications and networks 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.540
 Examples of collected data name 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.480
 e-mail address settings and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.380
 interests browser search and file 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.800
 History data to call and sms devices 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.370
 configuration and sensor data and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.440
 application usage 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.480
 then four examples follow that 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.980
 quite well illustrate the first one 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.440
 I skip right because that is 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.700
 not very meaningful it continues 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.920
 with second example if you 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.290
 for example, language input features 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.420
 How to collect text to use language 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.310
 Microsoft might talk 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.810
 information and uses this under 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.710
 to improve the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.660
 speech processing 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.430
 For example, if you have a file 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.250
 Open collects microsoft information 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.410
 to open this file 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.140
 file applications used as well as 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.240
 duration of the opening process and uses 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.480
 Among other things, to improve the 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.670
 performance or when, for example 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.920
 typing a text captures microsoft 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.600
 possibly entered characters and 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.300
 uses them among other things to improve 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.310
 from features like auto complete 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.620
 and the spelling checker 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.630
 and that's not enough 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.270
 below learn who the program contains 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.340
 features enabled for the internet 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.810
 performance and usage information 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.670
 microsoft broadcast 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.739
 to the performance and usage data 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.510
 cells information on performance and 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.940
 reliability of the program 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.830
 for example, the reaction time of 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.709
 programs when clicking on a 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.000
 button or to the number of im 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.069
 connection with the program 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.140
 occurring problems and performance 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.690
 usage data includes moreover 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.970
 information on your use of the 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.580
 programs such as those of them on 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.580
 commonly used features and the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.650
 Frequency with which you start programs 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.239
 performance and usage data can with 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.040
 Help with cookies or similar 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.110
 technologies and so on 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.180
 on and on 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.100
 that means summarized so 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.200
 windows can capture the language 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.960
 windows can handle any keypad 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.850
 capture and also mouse click each 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.400
 we can do that somehow 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.139
 switch off as we read below 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.900
 many feature the data to microsoft 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.340
 Submit will be activated automatically 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.020
 they may not have the 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.000
 possibility of data transfer for 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.820
 certain features in the program too 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.710
 disable the transfer of all 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.720
 you have to quit the program 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.160
 on all devices completely 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.900
 uninstall 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.990
 possibly the operating system needs to be 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.450
 your device will be reinstalled 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.580
 So rather a no if we have one 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.200
 single application as an insider test 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.570
 we may even need ours 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.460
 completely reinstall windows because 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.320
 This may not be the case with the version 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.390
 In any case, switch off properly 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.330
 assumes no guarantee for Microsoft 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.370
 So there's a keylogger in there 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.320
 is probably more of a loose in it all 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.810
 not only keyboard but also the mouse 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.950
 and the language the whole pack as 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.500
 the wet dream of everyone 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.950
 interior minister in germany we come 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.900
 to the question if the whole is allowed 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.910
 Well, the question is probably more likely 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.890
 the question at all because what uses 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.020
 if it is not allowed microsoft 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.030
 But it still makes you good 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.380
 assume that the user the 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.720
 corresponding data protection regulations 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.430
 Read the practice, however, rather 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.980
 shown that the whole hardly anyone 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.810
 by reading 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.760
 so far in Germany is more likely the 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.650
 principle that such regulation at all 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.630
 only valid if they receive the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.180
 User also I say right now 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.760
 were made known and so that 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.260
 he just saw her a little 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.480
 hidden link does not fall now 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.580
 but underneath it but what good is it on 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.320
 The end is a reproach to microsoft 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.120
 Another question is 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.540
 understandable that microsoft know 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.130
 wants to work like the operating system 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.990
 but if you want a keylogger 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.030
 must use my possibly 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.680
 passwords with intervenes when I do 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.350
 for example, an e-mail application 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.110
 start or my emails in the firefox 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.540
 check well microsoft said that one 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.440
 Windows 10 not in productive environment 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.690
 should use 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.460
 This automatically means that you can 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.710
 should not do because you just watched 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.460
 will be good question on which we do not 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.440
 To get an answer 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.080
 thus, only one question remains 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.729
 open and thus actually only one 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.889
 great hope 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.659
 if microsoft gives itself such a hardship 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.819
 to equip an operating system such that 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.020
 every mouse click and every keystroke 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.639
 can be overheard 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.770
 You can only hope for that 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.139
 that the functions at delivery of 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.150
 All windows 10 are turned off and on 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.069
 can not be turned on again 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.469
 but we all know something about that 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.879
 hope happens now you know now 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.889
 in any case, and can 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.509
 Make sure you have windows 10 only 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.880
 to use for testing and not necessarily 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:55.420
 enter your passwords there 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.420
 OK
