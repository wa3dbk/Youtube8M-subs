00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hi everyone, I decided to record this audio 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.530
 here to help students of the course 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.410
 ueder cederj computing to understand 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.940
 in class 11 of introduction to computer science 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 This class talks about addressing 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:24.330
 cash in my opinion the explanation of the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.269
 teacher is really very running it 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.310
 Go through the numbers and you'll see 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.630
 without understanding where he got the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 number 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.590
 so what I'll do I believe 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.460
 until the 30th minute the student can 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.290
 understand the class with certain ease 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.200
 when it comes to the examples of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 mapping is that the thing then complicates 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.199
 I'll get the first one's power and I'll go 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.010
 try to explain where you got that thing there 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:59.340
 he places an example on harakat with 256 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.350
 Bates block 32 kbps 8K lines 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.879
 32- bit address bus 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.880
 direct mapping 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.320
 this information is sequential without 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.320
 a more adequate explanation 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 the following 286 happens the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 first number simply the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 total cash memory capacity 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.119
 if you think of it as a block 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.220
 Sorry if you think of her as a 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.830
 table 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.509
 you can imagine the total sum of memory 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.799
 of all rows by column of this 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.939
 table are going to be 216 right, and down there 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:40.680
 he actually breaks apart is this 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.850
 maximum cash currency capacity of 56 in 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.990
 line capacity of each line and the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.369
 number of lines 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:56.130
 but that he does not speak then every line 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:58.710
 in 32 neighborhoods per block understand block 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.399
 line simply so each line has 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:09.060
 30 debate that we have eight lines 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:12.990
 note that 32-bit instead eight ministers and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:17.580
 multiply will give just 256 kb 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.330
 the total capacity of incredible memory 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.930
 huh 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.510
 the teacher did not give this explanation 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.310
 the 32-bit address bar and is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.360
 referring to word processor 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.290
 punter 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:43.110
 it has 32 bit wide addressing 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:47.250
 then he follows the example and you 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.640
 provides a hexadecimal number for you 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.320
 translate that number as that 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.920
 name be interpreted in terms of 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:01.040
 release this memory wants then 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.470
 Let's see how this address 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.760
 hexadecimal will be interpreted in the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.240
 do the addressing in this memory 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.240
 cache 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.160
 we have 8 thousand lines and in each 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.520
 line 32 neighborhoods as I already said then we 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.970
 we need to know what line it will be 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:23.820
 chosen to be enrolled and it is in this 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.010
 line that was chosen which of the south 32 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.000
 bits will be written 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.730
 so if we have 32 bytes to 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.540
 choose one of these 32 neighborhoods 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.500
 we have 32 different possibilities 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:45.090
 of choice on the same line 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:49.610
 ok how much the bits 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.170
 we need to have 32 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.180
 different possibilities 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.380
 if you calculate it predicts that five bikes 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.130
 cane and 2 high 5 is equal to 32 per 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.840
 that's what he put there that 5 bits 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:09.930
 because with five bits 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:13.380
 he can book these five bits 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.650
 to tell which of the neighborhoods on the 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:24.240
 will be chosen then the five chosen 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.030
 are the five bits to the right of the address 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.710
 provided 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:33.400
 then the first five bits will be 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.330
 reserved to tell us which bike 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.419
 who will be entered on the rock line 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.410
 now let's find out which line we 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.960
 let's write 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.530
 we have eight thousand lines so we 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.090
 we have eight thousand possibilities when 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:55.870
 beats we need to 8 thousand 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.680
 possibilities again if the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.550
 calculation 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.470
 you will see that 13 bits enough 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.730
 so he puts there two high 13 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.300
 is equal to 8 k 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.250
 then as soon as the five bishops are finished 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.490
 that we have already set aside to choose which 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.470
 bike will be written you need the 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:20.470
 other 13 bits to choose from with the line 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.850
 look at what I 'm not going to analyze here 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.790
 now with you 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.750
 I just want to try to bring a 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.419
 understanding of the 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:38.470
 Memory Mapping Addressing 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:44.289
 cache is perhaps after understanding this 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:48.330
 mechanism you ask of logic 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:51.729
 creation of this binary addressing 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:57.400
 so that it automatically 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:59.410
 find the hit on the line and the correct line 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.690
 so this is an interesting thing that 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:05.380
 the costing understood understood only really 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:08.830
 with the help of veterans 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.650
 by the group that if you analyze a 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.100
 binary number 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:21.780
 you will see that the first five hits 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:28.510
 they are in a kind of loop is day 01 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:32.140
 32 05 they get 100 00 and they go up 0 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:38.460
 1 0 0 0 after 1000 at last they will 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:38.460
 being filled in so 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.430
 shape of lupi lace shape that is 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.630
 repeats every 32 first two five 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.660
 bits 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:54.500
 they get a repetitive cycle 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.870
 every thirty-two possibilities 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:01.009
 so they can be quietly 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:05.470
 reserved to select sun beats and 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:09.530
 from the sixth bits select the line 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.110
 Good hope that with this audio has been 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.479
 some light for you to go there and 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:18.770
 lesson and now seek an understanding 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:20.570
 and because I myself could only understand the 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.699
 from that time when I understood that 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.229
 concept that I passed to you now 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:26.229
 good luck good studies
