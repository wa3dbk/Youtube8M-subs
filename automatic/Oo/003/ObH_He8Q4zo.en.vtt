00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.309
 of the best video game trailers

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.550
 this is a personal ranking too 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.610
 if I tried to follow yours 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.560

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.580
 well said this let's not lose any more 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.530
 time and let's start 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.930
 fifth place for the bioshock trailer 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 endless showing in all his 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.600
 Columbia splendor a built city 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.309
 however, the sky is completely on the sky 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.200
 point of view is that of a man who 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.330
 it's happening downstairs it seems the end 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.430
 for him until a girl with 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.150
 of the coat of arms powers decides to save it 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.680
 but a robotic hand just the girl 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.410
 dropping the victim again 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.720
 in a vacuum and that's the trailer right here 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.000
 it ends leaving us with breath 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.950
 suspended after seeing this trailer 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 I could not wait to move to the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.900
 fantastic city and discover its own 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.910
 secrets 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.820
 fourth place for the trailer of arzo 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.800
 board the soldier marcus fenix moves 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.320
 a city now destroyed and desolate 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.700
 until to avoid the robust ones there 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 takes refuge inside a building 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.649
 But inside are huge creature 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.180
 marcos is nothing but shooting 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.040
 crazed to try to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.960
 survive a trailer really 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.299
 dramatic accompanied by the song 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 mad world that does nothing but 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.260
 strengthen the sense of loneliness of the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.280
 character in a world now 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.280
 abandoned to himself 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 on the third step of the podium we find the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.180
 the elder scrolls skyrim trailer that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.400
 shows us many areas that tells us 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.010
 an ancient prophecy that speaks of return 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.680
 Dragons and although no one seems 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.540
 want to believe it until these don't 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.880
 they really appear 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.030
 despite everything, however, there is a person 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.789
 what dragons fear or do bathing 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.619
 dragon blood what to say just guys 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.810
 saw this trailer I was looking forward to 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.900
 impersonate the post keane and go to 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.390
 prisons passages for the lands tanks that me 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.250
 I would have found the whole thing 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.770
 naturally seasoned with a column 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.770
 literally epic sound 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.210
 second place for the dead trailer 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.850
 island 2 a man is doing his 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.860
 morning run is no harm here 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.960
 however behind him they begin to 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.570
 happen a little strange things without that 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.280
 he notices no people who do 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.920
 turn zombies into helicopters 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.930
 but he also falls because of a 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.640
 bite turns into a zombie but 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.860
 despite this it continues to run 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.470
 until it is overwhelmed by a 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.290
 surviving van who appropriate themselves 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.390
 also of his shoes is that to say a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.310
 exaggerated nice trailer that knows 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.420
 entertain and at the same time come 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.270
 want to affect first place days 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.160
 goes to the cinema trailer of the division la 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.780
 New York City is very different from 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.580
 the one we know 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.940
 an epidemic has indeed affected the whole 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.430
 population houses streets are now deserted 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.310
 except for the few survivors 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.870
 however, all is not lost if indeed 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.209
 a special team called the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.629
 division that the task of reporting the 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.519
 stability within the city 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.379
 really exciting trailer that succeeds 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.030
 to fully convey the sense of 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.909
 destruction and desolation 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.250
 but that shows the strength of the capable man 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.680
 to adapt to every situation too 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.290
 when there seems to be no way to 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.030
 good for you guys 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.650

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.269
 video games
