00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:03.143
 The Prophet is like Moses (p) in (Deuteronomy 18-18) 

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:07.468
 Prophecy of the Prophet Muhammad (AS) is mentioned in many world religious writings 

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.749
 Includes the Christian Bible. 

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:14.803
 If you read Deuteronomy, chapter 18, verse 18 

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:16.382
 Says this 

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:20.324
 18 I will raise up for them a prophet from the midst of their brethren. 

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:21.587
 same to you 

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.974
 And I will put my words in his mouth 

00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:26.616
 And he will speak to them all that I have commanded him 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.419
 In fact, if analyzed, this prophecy in Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse 18 

00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:34.899
 No one deserves it 

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.704
 The last messengers and the last Prophet Muhammad (AS). 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.028
 Many people will say that the prophecies in Deuteronomy 18 refer to Muhammad (p) 

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.994
 But this is simply not possible. 

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.445
 Let us read the prophecy to see what you say: 

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:52.287
 The Lord your God will establish for you among your people a prophet like me 

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:59.065
 Now, this verse says that the Lord God will reside for you (the Israelites) 

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.280
 Prophet like me (Moses) 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.276
 Among your brothers: the Israelis. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.756
 This is not possible to apply to Muhammad (p). 

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:07.925
 For two reasons. 

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.915
 One, the verse says, for you. 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.423
 The verse has been read to the Israeli, 

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:15.688
 This prophecy was given to the Israelites, 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.297
 Therefore Muhammad (p) can not be qualified as the prophet who will come for them - he did not, 

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.450
 He came for the Ismailis, 

00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:23.764
 In a very distant country, 

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:25.149
 In a very distant place, 

00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:27.153
 In a language that is entirely different, 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.752
 For people who are totally different 

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:30.144
 After hundreds of years. 

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.935
 It is not this people. 

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.713
 If it does not match the part that says, for you. 

00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:38.907
 Muhammad (p) also does not match the part that says, among your brothers. 

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:42.318
 I see, the phrase between your brethren refers to other Israelites, 

00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:45.366
 Does not apply to Ismailis, does not apply to anyone else. 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.876
 This is what the phrase means between your brothers when you speak to the Israelis. 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.294
 We appreciate that we know this because of some of the previous few verses, 

00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:55.662
 The same word is used to define them as Israelis. 

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:57.068
 He says in verse 15, 

00:01:57.134 --> 00:02:00.670
 Be sure that your majesty is the king chosen by the Lord your God, 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.432
 You must be among your brothers. 

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:05.818
 Do not be strange to you, 

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:08.580
 The person who is not an Israeli brother. 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.118
 Very clear, known through the word brotherhood as an Israeli brother, 

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:15.506
 Thus has always been used in the Holy Book. 

00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:21.001
 Thus, to say that Muhammad (p) qualifies to be like the Prophet in Deuteronomy 18 

00:02:21.123 --> 00:02:26.645
 Clearly oppose the speech for you and your brothers. 

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:30.060
 Therefore, Muhammad (p) can not be foretold in Deuteronomy 18.
