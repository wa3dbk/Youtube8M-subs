out<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.050> hives<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> same<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.280> dogs

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
out in hives and it's the same for dogs

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.479 
out in hives and it's the same for dogs
and<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.719> normal<00:01:01.379> treatment<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.280> just

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and the normal treatment is just

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
and the normal treatment is just
allowing<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.210> dog<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.750> work<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.379> out

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
themselves and in a sense the allergen

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.719 
themselves and in a sense the allergen
will<00:01:09.180> run<00:01:09.330> its<00:01:09.510> course<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.229> dog's<00:01:11.100> immune

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
obviously kicking in and it's sometimes

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
obviously kicking in and it's sometimes
overreact<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.390> why<00:01:18.570> face<00:01:19.110> gets

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
overreact and that's why face gets

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.950

things could have happened here to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.280 
things could have happened here to
trigger<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.299> we<00:01:48.299> bought<00:01:48.509> her<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> Nylabone

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
trigger this we bought her a Nylabone

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.499 
trigger this we bought her a Nylabone
last<00:01:50.070> night<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.640> she<00:01:50.700> had<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> brand<00:01:51.329> new

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
last night so she had a brand new

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.550 
last night so she had a brand new
Nylabone<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:53.060> examining<00:01:54.170> their<00:01:55.170> site

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
Nylabone and I was examining their site

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
Nylabone and I was examining their site
and<00:01:55.860> Natta<00:01:56.399> bones<00:01:56.670> are<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.659> made<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.229> like

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and Natta bones are not made of like

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.550 
and Natta bones are not made of like
organic<00:01:59.189> materials<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.930> since<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> has

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
organic materials so since it has

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.810 
organic materials so since it has
chemicals<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.460> stuff<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.030> can

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
chemicals and stuff like that that can

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.370 
chemicals and stuff like that that can
definitely<00:02:05.820> add<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.630> could<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> bone

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
definitely add to it could be the bone

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.290 
definitely add to it could be the bone
