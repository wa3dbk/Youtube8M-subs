00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
taught me out so all I had to do was

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.970 
taught me out so all I had to do was
step<00:02:29.360> up<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.660> dispatch<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.560> panel<00:02:30.830> is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
step up and dispatch the panel is

gonna take his right foot and the way he

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.750 
gonna take his right foot and the way he
just<00:02:48.380> hasn't<00:02:48.560> he's<00:02:48.890> got<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.100> nice<00:02:49.250> curse<00:02:49.550> we

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
just hasn't he's got a nice curse we

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.100 
just hasn't he's got a nice curse we
just<00:02:49.940> adds<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.270> nice<00:02:50.420> little<00:02:50.690> curve<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.050> he

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
just adds a nice little curve and he

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.870 
just adds a nice little curve and he
drifts<00:02:51.410> in<00:02:51.560> Prague<00:02:52.250> straight<00:02:52.610> on<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
drifts in Prague straight on the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.240 
drifts in Prague straight on the
attackers<00:02:53.330> or<00:02:53.510> maybe<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.990> defenders<00:02:54.440> had<00:02:54.650> to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
attackers or maybe the defenders had to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.250 
attackers or maybe the defenders had to
put<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.520> in<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:55.820> that's<00:02:55.940> what<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.210> can<00:02:56.450> do<00:02:56.660> and

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
put it in but that's what you can do and

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.830 
put it in but that's what you can do and
his<00:02:57.470> corners<00:02:57.920> were<00:02:58.070> very<00:02:58.490> nice<00:02:58.730> but<00:02:59.510> obviously

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
his corners were very nice but obviously

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.650 
his corners were very nice but obviously
you're<00:03:00.200> paying<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.800> price<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.330> what<00:03:02.330> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
you're paying for the price of what the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.720 
you're paying for the price of what the
card<00:03:02.960> is<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.470> on<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.590> left<00:03:03.800> it's<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.190> cam<00:03:04.460> out

on<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.030> left<00:03:05.270> mid<00:03:05.510> obviously<00:03:05.990> you<00:03:06.050> can<00:03:06.170> use

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
on the left mid obviously you can use

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.630 
on the left mid obviously you can use
him<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.560> forward<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.920> free<00:03:07.100> one<00:03:07.250> like<00:03:07.400> I've

from<00:03:28.130> but<00:03:28.700> yeah<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.540> put<00:03:29.750> him<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:29.960> a<00:03:30.020> 4<00:03:30.290> 12<00:03:30.530> 12

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
from but yeah you put him in a 4 12 12

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.760 
from but yeah you put him in a 4 12 12
and<00:03:31.130> i<00:03:31.520> find<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.970> quite<00:03:32.150> now<00:03:32.300> anyway<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.440> being

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
and i find a quite now anyway so being

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.140 
and i find a quite now anyway so being
caught<00:03:33.950> be<00:03:34.070> good<00:03:34.220> an<00:03:34.310> axe<00:03:34.490> it<00:03:34.640> gets<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:34.970> closer

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
caught be good an axe it gets in closer

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.720 
caught be good an axe it gets in closer
to<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.480> center<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.870> pitch<00:03:36.080> or<00:03:36.920> if<00:03:37.610> you

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
to the center of the pitch or if you

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.190 
to the center of the pitch or if you
want<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:37.940> cut<00:03:38.330> left<00:03:38.510> forward<00:03:38.750> but<00:03:38.840> i<00:03:38.870> wouldn't

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
want to cut left forward but i wouldn't

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.680 
want to cut left forward but i wouldn't
really<00:03:39.350> say<00:03:39.650> he's<00:03:39.830> an<00:03:39.950> attack<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.510> should

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
really say he's an attack and you should

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.150 
really say he's an attack and you should
be<00:03:41.720> that<00:03:41.990> far<00:03:42.230> of<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.380> pitch<00:03:42.650> for<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:42.890> left<00:03:43.040> for

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
be that far of the pitch for a left for

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.000 
be that far of the pitch for a left for
so<00:03:43.400> i'd<00:03:43.940> probably<00:03:44.210> for<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.570> 4<00:03:44.810> 10<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:45.200> 20<00:03:45.410> or<00:03:45.590> 40

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
so i'd probably for a 4 10 and 20 or 40

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.560 
so i'd probably for a 4 10 and 20 or 40
free<00:03:46.310> one<00:03:46.520> with<00:03:46.670> him<00:03:46.790> obviously<00:03:46.910> it's<00:03:47.240> a<00:03:47.300> shame

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
free one with him obviously it's a shame

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.480 
free one with him obviously it's a shame
is<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.960> left<00:03:48.260> knee<00:03:48.320> because<00:03:48.530> if<00:03:48.830> his<00:03:49.250> car

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
is a left knee because if his car

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.730 
is a left knee because if his car
it'd<00:03:49.700> been<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.880> camp<00:03:50.120> guard<00:03:50.330> who<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:51.530> would

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
it'd been a camp guard who that would

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.200 
it'd been a camp guard who that would
have<00:03:51.860> been<00:03:52.160> what<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.670> would've<00:03:52.790> been<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:53.000> same

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
have been what it would've been the same

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.940 
have been what it would've been the same
card<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:54.200> would<00:03:54.410> have<00:03:54.440> been<00:03:54.530> better<00:03:54.800> for

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
card it just would have been better for

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.030 
card it just would have been better for
the<00:03:55.450> squad<00:03:56.450> building<00:03:56.750> basically<00:03:57.200> drops<00:03:57.890> on

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
the squad building basically drops on

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.560 
the squad building basically drops on
the<00:03:58.070> left<00:03:58.310> you've<00:03:58.490> already<00:03:58.670> got<00:03:58.850> do<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.390> want

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
the left you've already got do you want

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.600 
the left you've already got do you want
the<00:03:59.690> extra<00:03:59.960> pay<00:04:00.140> gfs<00:04:00.680> van<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.220> if<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.430> want

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
the extra pay gfs van and if you want

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.980 
the extra pay gfs van and if you want
the<00:04:01.640> four<00:04:01.850> saw<00:04:02.000> skills<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:02.420> gave<00:04:02.570> illinois

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
the four saw skills you gave illinois

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.530 
the four saw skills you gave illinois
see<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.070> that's<00:04:04.370> how<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.030> I'm<00:04:05.180> giving<00:04:05.420> him

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
see so that's how is so I'm giving him

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.870 
see so that's how is so I'm giving him
an<00:04:05.660> ar-10<00:04:06.050> because<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:07.160> only<00:04:07.340> thing<00:04:07.550> letting

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
an ar-10 because the only thing letting

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.550 
an ar-10 because the only thing letting
down<00:04:08.090> is<00:04:08.270> not<00:04:08.450> being<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.690> come<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.050> that<00:04:09.320> is<00:04:09.500> a

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560
