00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
that i guess i can you can call my test

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:46.360 
that i guess i can you can call my test
bench<00:00:14.370> but<00:00:14.880> here's<00:00:15.599> steamos

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.750 

on<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.289> just<00:00:48.289> remember<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.129> honest<00:00:49.430> also<00:00:49.670> you

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
on a just remember that honest also you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.479 
on a just remember that honest also you
drive<00:00:49.910> it'd<00:00:50.090> be<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.270> lot<00:00:50.420> faster<00:00:50.660> it'd<00:00:50.989> be<00:00:51.199> just

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
drive it'd be a lot faster it'd be just

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.360 
drive it'd be a lot faster it'd be just
a<00:00:52.489> few<00:00:52.879> four<00:00:53.180> or<00:00:53.239> five<00:00:53.360> seconds<00:00:54.040> this<00:00:55.040> is<00:00:55.219> on<00:00:55.340> a

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
a few four or five seconds this is on a

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.819 
a few four or five seconds this is on a
regular<00:00:55.640> old<00:00:56.089> generation<00:00:57.019> hard<00:00:57.379> drive<00:00:57.589> so

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
regular old generation hard drive so

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.860 
regular old generation hard drive so
it's<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.070> little<00:00:58.160> bit<00:00:58.250> slow

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.070 

there<00:01:03.469> you<00:01:03.559> go<00:01:04.000> that's<00:01:05.000> steamos<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:05.900> boots

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
there you go that's steamos and it boots

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.060 
there you go that's steamos and it boots
up<00:01:06.229> like<00:01:06.799> that<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:09.200> when<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:09.560> login<00:01:09.770> it's

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
up like that and when you login it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.490 
up like that and when you login it's
just<00:01:10.250> like<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.490> steam<00:01:10.729> overlay<00:01:14.229> well<00:01:15.229> I'm

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
go back to the let's go to the desktop

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.880 
go back to the let's go to the desktop
now<00:02:03.340> now<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.750> steam<00:02:05.200> OS<00:02:05.619> desktop<00:02:09.119> and

now now this is the steam OS desktop and
I<00:02:11.890> guess<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.610> going<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.810> should<00:02:14.020> be

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
I guess this is going to it should be

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.090 
I guess this is going to it should be
geared<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.489> replace<00:02:15.820> windows<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:17.320> right<00:02:18.070> now

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
geared to replace windows so right now

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.860 
geared to replace windows so right now
it's<00:02:18.370> not<00:02:18.459> really<00:02:18.760> supported<00:02:19.239> with<00:02:19.540> anything

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
it's not really supported with anything

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's not really supported with anything
but<00:02:20.320> it's<00:02:21.250> just<00:02:21.700> like<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.690> know<00:02:22.720> how<00:02:22.930> linux<00:02:23.170> is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
but it's just like you know how linux is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.500
