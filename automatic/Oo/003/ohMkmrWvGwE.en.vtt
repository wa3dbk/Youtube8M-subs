I<00:03:17.989> said<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.700> 34<00:03:20.269> in<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:21.140> 65<00:03:21.859> 34<00:03:22.340> means

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
I said and the 34 in the 65 34 means

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.460 
I said and the 34 in the 65 34 means
el34<00:03:23.420> so<00:03:23.629> we're<00:03:23.750> going<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.900> switch<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.290> over

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
el34 so we're going to switch this over

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.949 
el34 so we're going to switch this over
hill<00:03:24.829> and<00:03:25.069> then<00:03:25.940> I'm<00:03:26.239> going<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.389> push<00:03:26.569> my<00:03:26.599> bias

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
hill and then I'm going to push my bias

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.520 
hill and then I'm going to push my bias
up<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.500> little<00:03:27.950> bit<00:03:28.190> ah<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.870> then<00:03:30.019> push<00:03:30.319> my

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
up a little bit ah and then push my

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.020 
up a little bit ah and then push my
resonance<00:03:31.340> oh<00:03:32.049> most<00:03:33.049> all<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.379> way<00:03:33.500> up<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.030> now

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
resonance oh most all the way up and now

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:43.300 
resonance oh most all the way up and now
what<00:03:35.329> do<00:03:35.389> we<00:03:35.480> got<00:03:41.109> not<00:03:42.109> bad<00:03:42.379> actually<00:03:42.980> this

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
what do we got not bad actually this

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.009 
what do we got not bad actually this
could<00:03:43.459> probably<00:03:43.700> use<00:03:43.940> just<00:03:44.359> a<00:03:44.510> hair<00:03:44.750> more

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
could probably use just a hair more

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.119 
could probably use just a hair more
again<00:03:45.319> just<00:03:45.799> give<00:03:46.069> it<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.280> little<00:03:46.519> bit<00:03:46.819> more

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
again just give it a little bit more

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.900 
again just give it a little bit more
cool<00:03:49.129> alright<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:51.230> since<00:03:52.069> we're<00:03:52.280> amp<00:03:52.489> matching

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
cool alright so since we're amp matching

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.710 
cool alright so since we're amp matching
I'm<00:03:53.180> going<00:03:53.419> to<00:03:53.480> turn<00:03:53.660> off<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.959> cab<00:03:54.669> and<00:03:55.669> I<00:03:56.269> used

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
I'm going to turn off the cab and I used

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.610 
I'm going to turn off the cab and I used
a<00:03:57.079> use<00:03:58.069> an<00:03:58.250> avatar<00:03:58.699> cab<00:03:58.970> for<00:03:59.480> recording<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.109> 65

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
a use an avatar cab for recording the 65

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.170 
a use an avatar cab for recording the 65
34<00:04:01.510> within<00:04:02.510> sm58<00:04:03.379> that<00:04:03.919> I<00:04:03.949> pulled<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.609> wind

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
34 within sm58 that I pulled the wind

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.970 
34 within sm58 that I pulled the wind
filter<00:04:05.419> off<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:06.169> because<00:04:06.379> it<00:04:06.560> essentially

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
filter off of because it essentially

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.289 
filter off of because it essentially
ends<00:04:07.280> up<00:04:07.400> like<00:04:07.879> very<00:04:08.120> close<00:04:08.389> to<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> SM<00:04:09.260> 57<00:04:10.269> but<00:04:11.269> a

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
ends up like very close to a SM 57 but a

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.180 
ends up like very close to a SM 57 but a
little<00:04:11.510> more<00:04:11.690> presence<00:04:12.079> II<00:04:12.230> from<00:04:12.769> live<00:04:12.949> hood

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
little more presence II from live hood

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.580 
little more presence II from live hood
so<00:04:13.879> all<00:04:14.510> right<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.989> first<00:04:15.169> thing<00:04:15.379> we're<00:04:15.500> going

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
so all right the first thing we're going

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.029 
so all right the first thing we're going
to<00:04:15.650> do<00:04:15.829> is<00:04:16.039> we<00:04:16.519> are<00:04:16.639> going<00:04:16.849> to<00:04:17.410> we<00:04:18.410> dropped<00:04:18.829> our

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
to do is we are going to we dropped our

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.979 
to do is we are going to we dropped our
amp<00:04:19.280> match<00:04:19.519> block<00:04:19.880> into<00:04:20.359> this<00:04:20.479> little<00:04:20.690> chain

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
amp match block into this little chain

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.050 
amp match block into this little chain
here<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:21.949> bypassed<00:04:22.430> our<00:04:22.580> cab<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:25.669> so<00:04:25.970> now

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
here and we bypassed our cab and so now

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.710 
here and we bypassed our cab and so now
we're<00:04:26.150> going<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.300> hit<00:04:26.419> sample<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:28.510> sample<00:04:29.510> our

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
we're going to hit sample and sample our

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.850 
we're going to hit sample and sample our
metals<00:04:30.169> in<00:04:30.380> under<00:04:30.680> sounding<00:04:31.220> Tablas<00:04:32.030> and

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
metals in under sounding Tablas and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.600 
metals in under sounding Tablas and
listen<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.950> all<00:04:34.980> that<00:04:35.220> cheesy<00:04:35.910> goodness

alright<00:04:48.060> samplings<00:04:48.690> done<00:04:49.400> stop<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.550> sample

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
alright samplings done stop the sample

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.080 
alright samplings done stop the sample
and<00:04:51.180> now<00:04:51.270> I'm<00:04:51.360> going<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.570> jump<00:04:51.750> over<00:04:52.140> here<00:04:52.560> and

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
and now I'm going to jump over here and

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.710 
and now I'm going to jump over here and
drag<00:04:54.090> it<00:04:54.270> out<00:04:54.360> of<00:04:54.480> there

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
drag it out of there

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.780 
drag it out of there
and<00:04:54.870> now<00:04:55.200> I'm<00:04:55.260> going<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.410> pull<00:04:55.590> out<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.830> 65<00:04:56.190> 34

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
and now I'm going to pull out of 65 34

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.580 
and now I'm going to pull out of 65 34
up<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:57.420> throw<00:04:58.260> it<00:04:58.380> into<00:04:58.940> the<00:05:00.050> folder<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.290> has

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
up and throw it into the folder that has

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.100 
up and throw it into the folder that has
bias<00:05:01.950> on<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:02.400> now<00:05:03.390> I'm<00:05:03.450> going<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.630> hit<00:05:03.690> target

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
bias on it now I'm going to hit target

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.130 
bias on it now I'm going to hit target
so<00:05:04.890> I<00:05:05.220> do<00:05:05.550> have<00:05:05.820> just<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.120> little<00:05:06.390> bit<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.570> EQ<00:05:06.690> on

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
so I do have just a little bit of EQ on

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.120 
so I do have just a little bit of EQ on
the<00:05:07.620> on<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.310> target<00:05:08.700> I<00:05:09.170> pulled<00:05:10.170> out<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.620> pulled

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
the on the target I pulled out I pulled

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
the on the target I pulled out I pulled
out<00:05:11.220> some<00:05:12.350> 4/5<00:05:13.350> K<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.920> mostly<00:05:14.250> 5k<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:15.030> then

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
out some 4/5 K like mostly 5k and then

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.690 
out some 4/5 K like mostly 5k and then
boost<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.600> a<00:05:15.690> little<00:05:15.870> bit<00:05:16.050> of<00:05:16.170> the<00:05:16.700> general

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
boost it a little bit of the general

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.450 
boost it a little bit of the general
mids<00:05:18.440> just<00:05:19.440> because<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.890> ended<00:05:20.130> up<00:05:20.280> really

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
mids just because it ended up really

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.240 
mids just because it ended up really
presidency<00:05:21.060> but<00:05:21.780> you<00:05:21.990> generally<00:05:22.380> sort<00:05:23.160> of

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
presidency but you generally sort of

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.730 
presidency but you generally sort of
have<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.550> do<00:05:23.670> that<00:05:23.850> in<00:05:24.240> most<00:05:24.780> cabs<00:05:25.110> because

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
have to do that in most cabs because

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.470 
have to do that in most cabs because
that's<00:05:25.920> where<00:05:26.130> like<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.490> spike<00:05:26.760> is<00:05:27.000> for<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.360> V

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
that's where like the spike is for the V

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.100 
that's where like the spike is for the V
30s<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.020> stuff<00:05:28.230> all<00:05:28.500> right<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:29.130> now<00:05:30.120> we<00:05:30.180> sample

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
30s and stuff all right so now we sample

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:53.670 
30s and stuff all right so now we sample
our<00:05:31.350> target<00:05:32.070> tone

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.760
