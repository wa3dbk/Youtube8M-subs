that I could create some significant
issues<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:03.210> users<00:01:03.690> especially<00:01:04.260> when<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
issues for users especially when it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.140 
issues for users especially when it
comes<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.979> security<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.030> was

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
comes to security because what it was

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.660 
comes to security because what it was
doing<00:01:06.330> was<00:01:06.710> basically<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> sitting<00:01:08.490> in

have a secure connection and what
superfish<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.180> doing<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.630> basically

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
superfish was doing was basically

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.620

there<00:05:12.610> I'm<00:05:12.910> hoping<00:05:13.210> this<00:05:13.600> issue<00:05:13.900> will<00:05:14.290> bring

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
there I'm hoping this issue will bring

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.890 
there I'm hoping this issue will bring
to<00:05:14.890> light<00:05:15.100> some<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:15.850> this<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.360> now<00:05:16.630> we're

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
to light some of this this now we're

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.960 
to light some of this this now we're
junk<00:05:17.260> we're<00:05:17.440> stuff<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:18.100> maybe<00:05:18.760> give

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
junk we're stuff and maybe give

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.730 
junk we're stuff and maybe give
manufacturers<00:05:19.510> some<00:05:19.960> pause<00:05:20.200> as<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.560> whether

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
manufacturers some pause as to whether

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.200 
manufacturers some pause as to whether
or<00:05:20.830> not<00:05:20.950> they<00:05:21.190> should<00:05:21.430> be<00:05:21.520> putting<00:05:21.880> this<00:05:21.970> stuff

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
or not they should be putting this stuff

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.970 
or not they should be putting this stuff
on<00:05:22.390> computers<00:05:23.050> because<00:05:23.320> really<00:05:23.530> it's<00:05:23.800> not

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
on computers because really it's not

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.070 
on computers because really it's not
good<00:05:24.250> for<00:05:24.430> consumers<00:05:24.610> at<00:05:25.090> all<00:05:25.270> especially

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
good for consumers at all especially

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.050 
good for consumers at all especially
when<00:05:26.530> your<00:05:26.770> security<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.370> privacy<00:05:27.730> is

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
when your security and privacy is

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.120 
when your security and privacy is
getting<00:05:28.330> violated<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.200> the<00:05:29.530> user<00:05:29.740> is<00:05:29.980> being

getting violated and the user is being

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.409 
getting violated and the user is being
tricked<00:05:30.490> into<00:05:30.580> thinking<00:05:30.730> that<00:05:31.120> there's

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
tricked into thinking that there's

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.740 
tricked into thinking that there's
nothing<00:05:31.840> wrong<00:05:32.140> and<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.560> is<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:32.830> really

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
nothing wrong and that is a really

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.970 
nothing wrong and that is a really
significant<00:05:34.750> violation<00:05:35.290> of<00:05:35.440> trust<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.919> I'm

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
significant violation of trust and I'm

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.370 
significant violation of trust and I'm
hoping<00:05:36.280> that<00:05:36.520> we<00:05:37.300> won't<00:05:37.510> see<00:05:37.720> this<00:05:37.930> again<00:05:38.230> I'm

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
hoping that we won't see this again I'm

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.409 
hoping that we won't see this again I'm
doubtful<00:05:39.040> that<00:05:39.280> statement<00:05:39.820> is<00:05:39.940> correct<00:05:40.270> of

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
doubtful that statement is correct of

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.690 
doubtful that statement is correct of
course<00:05:40.480> I'm<00:05:40.810> sure<00:05:40.840> we<00:05:41.169> will<00:05:41.380> see<00:05:41.410> it<00:05:41.650> again<00:05:41.950> but

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
course I'm sure we will see it again but

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.640 
course I'm sure we will see it again but
good<00:05:43.060> to<00:05:43.180> know<00:05:43.210> that<00:05:43.510> you<00:05:43.570> can<00:05:43.750> go<00:05:43.870> out<00:05:43.900> get<00:05:44.590> a

harder step of downloading that

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.300 
harder step of downloading that
installation<00:05:50.229> media<00:05:50.770> downloading<00:05:51.250> the

installation media downloading the
drivers<00:05:51.760> and<00:05:51.910> you<00:05:52.510> know<00:05:52.600> basically

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
drivers and you know basically

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.600 
drivers and you know basically
formatting<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.710> computer<00:05:54.040> yourself<00:05:54.430> and

formatting the computer yourself and

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.520 
formatting the computer yourself and
starting<00:05:54.970> from<00:05:55.090> scratch<00:05:55.360> so<00:05:55.810> that's<00:05:56.350> the

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
starting from scratch so that's the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.440 
starting from scratch so that's the
current<00:05:56.830> state<00:05:56.919> of<00:05:57.280> bloatware<00:05:57.610> on<00:05:57.970> Windows

current state of bloatware on Windows
hopefully<00:05:59.290> we<00:05:59.350> won't<00:05:59.500> see<00:05:59.710> this<00:05:59.860> again<00:06:00.190> but

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
hopefully we won't see this again but

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.490 
hopefully we won't see this again but
I'm<00:06:00.550> not<00:06:00.729> too<00:06:01.390> hopeful<00:06:01.780> he'll<00:06:01.930> be<00:06:02.169> the<00:06:02.320> case

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
I'm not too hopeful he'll be the case

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:10.020 
I'm not too hopeful he'll be the case
