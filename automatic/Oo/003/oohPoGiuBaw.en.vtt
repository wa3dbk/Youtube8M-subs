that i said i would have show up in a
video<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.340> i<00:00:59.399> don't<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.609> i<00:00:59.760> ever<00:00:59.789> did<00:01:00.149> so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
video and i don't think i ever did so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
video and i don't think i ever did so
i'm<00:01:01.050> gonna<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> end<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.859> well<00:01:01.980> and

spoiler<00:01:02.910> there<00:01:03.270> might<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.420> any<00:01:04.229> X<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.680> one

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
spoiler there might be any X on that one

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.350

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so it's probably gonna be pretty high if

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.580 
so it's probably gonna be pretty high if

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
pack or something so very cool oh we got

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.240 
pack or something so very cool oh we got
a<00:04:43.240> card<00:04:43.480> upside<00:04:43.630> down<00:04:43.870> here<00:04:44.110> let's<00:04:44.980> flip<00:04:45.100> it

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
a card upside down here let's flip it

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.220 
a card upside down here let's flip it
around<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.910> much<00:04:46.060> are<00:04:46.300> no<00:04:46.420> reverse<00:04:46.780> holo<00:04:46.990> from

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
around so much are no reverse holo from

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.830 
around so much are no reverse holo from
the<00:04:47.350> black<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.740> white<00:04:48.010> set<00:04:48.340> of<00:04:48.580> EV<00:04:49.480> that's

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
the black and white set of EV that's

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.720 
the black and white set of EV that's
from<00:04:50.110> plasma<00:04:50.830> freeze<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.220> think<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.610> looks

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
from plasma freeze I think so it looks

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.190 
from plasma freeze I think so it looks
like<00:04:51.850> some<00:04:52.000> gen5<00:04:52.360> stuff<00:04:52.660> some<00:04:52.870> black<00:04:53.020> and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
like some gen5 stuff some black and

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.350 
like some gen5 stuff some black and
white<00:04:53.320> base<00:04:53.560> set<00:04:53.800> energy<00:04:54.160> another<00:04:55.030> energy

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
white base set energy another energy

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.630 
white base set energy another energy
