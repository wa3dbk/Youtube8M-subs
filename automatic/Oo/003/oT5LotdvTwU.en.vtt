do<00:00:00.900> you<00:00:00.989> ever<00:00:01.079> see<00:00:01.350> your<00:00:01.530> cat<00:00:01.800> or<00:00:01.829> dog<00:00:02.010> staring

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
do you ever see your cat or dog staring

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.610 
do you ever see your cat or dog staring
at<00:00:02.970> something<00:00:03.270> invisible<00:00:03.570> it's<00:00:04.319> pretty

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
at something invisible it's pretty

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.920 
at something invisible it's pretty
creepy<00:00:05.250> but<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.670> made<00:00:05.850> me<00:00:06.000> wonder<00:00:06.180> if<00:00:06.600> animals

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
creepy but it made me wonder if animals

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:16.930 
creepy but it made me wonder if animals
can<00:00:07.379> actually<00:00:07.830> see<00:00:08.069> things<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.790> can't

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.490 

first<00:00:17.940> let's<00:00:18.270> talk<00:00:18.420> about<00:00:18.480> how<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.960> see

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
first let's talk about how we see

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.590 
first let's talk about how we see
remember<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> color<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.880> light<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
remember that the color of light is

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.170 
remember that the color of light is
determined<00:00:22.199> by<00:00:22.320> its<00:00:22.380> wavelength<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:23.880> two

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.390 
determined by its wavelength we have two
types<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.689> receptor<00:00:25.199> cells<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.710> our<00:00:25.800> eyes<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
types of receptor cells in our eyes to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.150 
types of receptor cells in our eyes to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
how bright the light is and cone cells

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.080 
how bright the light is and cone cells
which<00:00:31.529> detects<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> color<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.579> light<00:00:32.790> by
