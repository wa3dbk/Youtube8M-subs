00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.070
 in very good youtube wanted that commenting 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 some guys and nuclear-minded and 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.370
 well here we continue in white two 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.990
 public games and you know maybe it's 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.430
 try to get a nuclear analyzing 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.140
 heading and talking about a topic in 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.550
 concrete that this time what are you 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.080
 you in the comments and I think 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.699
 quite adequate because I do not know if any 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.839
 Once she's going to talk about it and it's very 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.039
 important to see if I remember everything 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.589
 what I have to say because 6 that I 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210
 1 percent of my videos are with 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.769
 that is to say I almost never use script and in 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.149
 this case well more the same so 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.009
 he talked on the fly and if how do I go 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.060
 agreeing then there are these different 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.890
 videos one of them very important 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.660
 about the vanguards a gameplay of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 multicolor made of advance warfare by 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.219
 part of black so I recommend you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.440
 you also have to upload a gameplay of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.699
 zombies 2.0 with synapses so also 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.500
 I recommend that you go through the third 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.989
 part of our personal series 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 miniseries so to speak and also 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.289
 good only from the gameplay of the most 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 beautiful girls endorsed that spaces because 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.379
 apart from that video is both the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.820
 simple others that I have uploaded by itself 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.980
 I wanted to take a look through I lost 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.570
 vital and also talked about a lot of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 things that you can surely have doubts 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.809
 and that surely is answer in addition to 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.989
 that Ghana includes a new way of 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.830
 game in the warfare phase that is going to be 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.480
 taking away the decision suits and 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.310
 little jumps or anything of those things 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.990
 so well there is tonalized 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.730
 seeing that you pass and well we are in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 the map of the carrier with the suat with this 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.020
 peephole m / m or millimeter scanner that 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.730
 well some say it 's a peephole 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.140
 which is for campear but it really is 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.210
 an anti-country measure because only 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 detects people who are still 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.750
 him if I'm not wrong and also he does not 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.760
 up to 25 meters there that is a measure 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.930
 very good for then for weapons like 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.970
 example the suat that requires a lot 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.710
 accuracy and to check spots and such 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.630
 so good is a game that is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.510
 quite slow because I think the bases 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.120
 in the worst gun for approaching 17 minutes 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.430
 up close with the suat I think 90% 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.980
 You're dead, but do not fail and good 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.420
 tell you that this game as I say 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.890
 pretty game about sure is to say 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.360
 he tried to kill people from afar that is the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.740
 strong point of the rise has very good 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.050
 very good precision very good daini 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.670
 reach with which by far it kills from a 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.250
 or two bursts if it's Latinas okay 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.840
 Of course if you give it well and good as you have 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.610
 I was able to appreciate I have also picked up a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.290
 mp7 of the floor with silencer that is going 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.940
 help then to change a little bit between 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.140
 shawn and spawn and then at the end of 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.930
 print will help me complete my 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.399
 nuclear and good is a nuclear pretty 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.869
 quite lens but quite safe 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.670
 it's a game style that not only does 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.460
 much I do not usually do so 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.260
 stopped because 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.970
 They are also rather unemployed attempt 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.410
 from time to time as in this case give 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.550
 the back in the back to change a bit 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.350
 the site of the game that we 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.030
 you get bored all the time in the same place 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.350
 but I already tell you that luck is a weapon 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.600
 that I think is good but that is 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.710
 quite limited and that is a weapon 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.850
 pretty good for this map in 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.070
 concrete and the peephole is going 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.690
 pretty cool the nascent precision well 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.700
 which is a pretty pretty low class 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.800
 we go there with the theme of sound is a 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.390
 topic that may seem silly but is 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.890
 a very important subject many me 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.620
 you ask about the helmets 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.090
 the sound is quite important and good 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 I do not know much about helmets I 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.070
 I have to play on xbox 360 use the 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.930
 stars to 50 and to play in teams one 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.850
 he used the turtle bits he made in a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.340
 boxing and the telbise draw and the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.160
 X or seven and the truth that they work 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.720
 very good then helmets then I 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.310
 I recommend helmets from one hundred euros 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.480
 to be able to be between quotation marks 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.950
 good ones that already have a sound 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.110
 surround so you can listen well 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.520
 the steps still cheap helmets I know 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.620
 that there are cheap helmets or communication 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.210
 helmets and mixup that apart from the helmets 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.300
 or headphones for those who are not from 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.160
 Spain because the headphones are the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.560
 pronouns the sound and the mix amp would be 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.910
 like the sound card that makes 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.680
 so hear the helmets not 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.940
 there are cases that do not have it but if 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.290
 they have is much better because they have 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.030
 much better quality audio and sound 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.290
 surround maybe so let's go 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.610
 there after talking about helmets 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.600
 and such although you can also play by 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.920
 the TV that is how I play 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.870
 formerly but I do not recommend it 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.910
 because you are going to lose many of the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.100
 sounds to the minimum that helmets do not 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.510
 they are moderately a little good even 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.890
 cheaper than a hundred euros you already see 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.780
 be able to appreciate many sounds in the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.520
 game that you can not appreciate playing 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.020
 maybe with music that I never play with 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.760
 music absolutely never play with 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.350
 music and once still talking about this 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.820
 first gameplay stick that there's only 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.130
 two in this pretty quiet example 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.350
 once as we are in a rifle or in a 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.760
 I duel one against one in the distance my weapon 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.770
 has a little preference but as 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.600
 It leaves me quite touched what I do 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.160
 to kill him even though I kill him is to jump 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.960
 towards coverage ie put a 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.340
 small jump to the right and 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.570
 while I'm shooting him I hide and 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.980
 then you will see how he fled because I think 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.200
 he had a preference to kill me and not 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.050
 you wanted me, I did not want to play because 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.910
 I was a bullet and I was not so good as 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.530
 I said I never play music always 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.790
 game with helmets and the game in a 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.870
 monitor that does not have audio so I have 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.239
 have to play with one who is obligated but 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.010
 formerly he played with the 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.750
 volume of the TV and I tell you that note 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.130
 very much and that you will appreciate a lot 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.930
 better the sounds 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.790
 with the types of sounds in the first place 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.370
 there are the steps as you all know and 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.080
 well the steps we simply have as 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.460
 several types no steps serve to 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.780
 know if we have someone around this 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.180
 we can enhance it with the advantage of 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.410
 consciousness and we can prevent them from hearing 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.870
 our steps with the advantage of 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.000
 deadly silence then in this game 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.010
 specifically in the Gallic Duty Black ops 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.900
 2 we hear too much the steps is not 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.700
 something very important deadly silence but 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.530
 in games like golf games like good 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.900
 definitive especially modern warfare2 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.970
 move warfare 1 modern warfare 3 are 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.930
 the steps are many and all the 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.490
 children of the game so you have to have 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.170
 pretty careful with the steps then 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.240
 the steps serve as I said to you 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.590
 know if someone close to you apart 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.450
 with helmets with surround sound 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.490
 we can know more or less exactly in 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.930
 what direction comes to us and good last 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.740
 stop before continuing with the issue of 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.810
 Steps 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.910
 here you see how he had seen an enemy 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.470
 moving towards him toward the harrier towards 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.640
 the top and here it seems that 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.100
 some nonsense but it's pretty 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.870
 important will also measure by the rectum 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.550
 what I do turn to the right put me 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.110
 in coverage and so if I have a 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.550
 face- to-face encounter with him I have 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.110
 more advantage because I'm in netflix not 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.060
 I'm in a position that can only be seen 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.620
 the head with which here you see that turned 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.000
 to the right pointing and I get 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.470
 here behind that good in this case I do not 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.630
 shoot but you would have something my life if 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.240
 I would have shot because I'm not with 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.920
 the whole body but I 'm with 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.320
 half hidden body we will not say it 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.760
 well and well I tell you the steps apart 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.650
 also that of the sound 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.540
 surrounding because there are different types of 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.550
 steps are not the same planes in cement 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.320
 are not the same steps in wood is not 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.700
 in steps equal to sheet metal and that we 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.050
 can help to know in what area more 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.370
 amen are enemies is in the plant 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.050
 upper of the lower floor if 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.060
 we have for the left right is 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.560
 say the steps are very important but 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.970
 also these important sounds like 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.950
 for example listening to weapons with 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.530
 silencer that can help us 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.640
 identify where there is an enemy not 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.080
 for example, weapons with silencers 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.820
 in the minimap but we can 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.230
 listen where they are seeing the 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.850
 shots of a weapon with silencer and 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.200
 we can identify an enemy that they take out 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.360
 to the minimap this seems silly 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.740
 also but it's important then 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.380
 we also have other types of sounds 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.240
 as for example when an enemy 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.280
 collects ammunition from the ground that then 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.570
 we can hear perfectly too 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.760
 if it will be close enough with 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.800
 helmets we can also listen when 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.110
 the enemy escalates something when the enemy 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.450
 scale something is a kind of sound 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.920
 and as of crunch similar to that of the 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.120
 fall but it makes a kind of 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.410
 sliding not like the sound 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.000
 sliding then also 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.680
 obviously the falls with a friend 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.690
 which it is a height as selogie 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.070
 bones like they creak a little and then 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.860
 we can know if an enemy makes us 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.940
 jumps 12 capital that more also the 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.530
 I do not know if I said about the 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.180
 grenades when a pomegranate is uncorked 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.740
 or when a grenade falls you can also hear 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.140
 especially when it is uncorked it is very 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.760
 important and also the recharge of 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.200
 players when an enemy charged 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.480
 with us we recharge we make a noise 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.970
 that you can not stop with silence 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.280
 deadly so it's important the subject of 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.690
 be attentive to the sounds of recharging 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.610
 and finally also here the 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.260
 enemies if we do not carry deadly silence 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.150
 our arak player poplar to the game 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.380
 that is, it will say in the middle and it is us 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.970
 we can hear that it has not been a 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.650
 member of the team but almost an enemy 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.940
 and that we have it close to us this can 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.320
 give also identify it as well 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.970

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.440
