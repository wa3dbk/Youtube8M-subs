00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.610 
to get into a topic for you all to help
with<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:30.920> cycles<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.070> d-ball<00:00:32.719> aka<00:00:33.719> Dianabol

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
with your cycles of d-ball aka Dianabol

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.310 
with your cycles of d-ball aka Dianabol
so<00:00:35.250> basically<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> want<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.719> today<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
so basically what I want to do today is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.270 
so basically what I want to do today is
explain<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.329> different<00:00:40.040> types<00:00:41.040> of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
explain to you the different types of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
explain to you the different types of
cycles<00:00:41.820> where<00:00:41.969> you're<00:00:42.120> most<00:00:42.360> commonly<00:00:42.870> going

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
cycles where you're most commonly going

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.160 
cycles where you're most commonly going
to<00:00:43.140> see<00:00:43.260> d-ball<00:00:43.710> used<00:00:44.329> I<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> separate

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to see d-ball used I have a separate

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
to see d-ball used I have a separate
video<00:00:46.320> setup<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.160> explain<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.360> dosing

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
video setup to explain the dosing

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
video setup to explain the dosing
protocols<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> want<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
protocols so I just kind of want to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.810 
protocols so I just kind of want to
explain<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.360> where<00:00:51.600> d-ball<00:00:52.079> sort<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.820> fits

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
explain to you where d-ball sort of fits

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.569 
explain to you where d-ball sort of fits
in<00:00:54.090> more<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.590> ran<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> variety<00:00:56.219> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
in more it can be ran in a variety of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.330 
in more it can be ran in a variety of
ways<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:58.010> effectively<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.250> efficiently

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
ways but effectively and efficiently

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.240 
ways but effectively and efficiently
there<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.210> certain<00:01:00.539> methods<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.129> using<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there are certain methods of using it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.889 
there are certain methods of using it
that<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.520> far<00:01:02.789> more<00:01:02.820> better<00:01:03.270> than<00:01:03.480> others

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
that are far more better than others

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.560 
that are far more better than others
just<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:05.100> anything<00:01:05.460> else<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.090> life

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
just as with anything else we do in life

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.399 
just as with anything else we do in life
so<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.549> most<00:01:08.760> common<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.229> don't

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
so I think the most common well I don't

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.859 
so I think the most common well I don't
think<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.830> know<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.060> most<00:01:12.240> commonly<00:01:12.750> used

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
think I know that the most commonly used

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.890 
think I know that the most commonly used
way<00:01:14.330> d-ball<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.630> ran<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.640> kickstart<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
way d-ball is ran is as a kickstart to a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.580 
way d-ball is ran is as a kickstart to a
cycle<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.920> let's<00:01:20.220> say<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.549> instance<00:01:21.590> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
cycle so let's say for instance you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.980 
cycle so let's say for instance you
decide<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.400> want<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> run<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.119> 12-week

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
decide that you want to run a 12-week

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.550 
decide that you want to run a 12-week
cycle<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.820> testosterone<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.390> you're<00:01:28.229> looking

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
cycle of testosterone and you're looking

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.210 
cycle of testosterone and you're looking
to<00:01:28.799> put<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.560> fairly<00:01:31.560> large<00:01:32.009> amount

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to put on you know a fairly large amount

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.560 
to put on you know a fairly large amount
of<00:01:32.610> size<00:01:32.820> or<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.900> kickstart<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:34.740> cycle

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
of size or really kickstart your cycle

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.690 
of size or really kickstart your cycle
to<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.600> highest<00:01:37.140> extent<00:01:37.520> because<00:01:38.520> when

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to the highest extent because when

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
to the highest extent because when
you're<00:01:38.820> running<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.210> longer<00:01:39.720> ester<00:01:40.590> form<00:01:40.860> of

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
you're running a longer ester form of

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.270 
you're running a longer ester form of
testosterone<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:42.299> takes<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.049> while<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.250> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
testosterone it takes a while for you to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.929 
testosterone it takes a while for you to
start<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:45.299> feeling<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.399> first<00:01:47.579> few

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
start really feeling it so the first few

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.300 
start really feeling it so the first few
weeks<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.509> cycle<00:01:49.140> people<00:01:49.829> tend<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
weeks of that cycle people tend to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.800 
weeks of that cycle people tend to
wonder<00:01:50.640> what's<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.600> they're

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
wonder what's going on because they're

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.660 
wonder what's going on because they're
not<00:01:51.840> feeling<00:01:52.229> too<00:01:52.619> much<00:01:52.649> because<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.280> ester

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
not feeling too much because the ester

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.160 
not feeling too much because the ester
still<00:01:53.939> building<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.479> system<00:01:54.930> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
still building in your system it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.620 
still building in your system it's
working<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> say<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.479> not

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
working it's not to say that it's not

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.530 
working it's not to say that it's not
working<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.320> you're<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.710> not<00:01:59.270> feeling<00:02:00.270> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
working but you're really not feeling it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
working but you're really not feeling it
unless<00:02:01.259> you're<00:02:01.469> using<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:02.009> shorter<00:02:02.460> ester

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
unless you're using a shorter ester

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.469 
unless you're using a shorter ester
version<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.990> hence<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.159> bring<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.610> an<00:02:05.790> oral

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
version so hence you bring in an oral

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.290 
version so hence you bring in an oral
steroid<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.680> kick-start<00:02:07.920> your<00:02:08.190> cycle<00:02:08.819> well

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
steroid to kick-start your cycle well

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.869 
steroid to kick-start your cycle well
d-ball<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
d-ball is

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.520 
d-ball is
probably<00:02:11.719> the<00:02:12.489> most<00:02:13.489> popular<00:02:14.180> form<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.019> a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
probably the most popular form of a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.149 
probably the most popular form of a
kickstart<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:16.790> probably<00:02:17.359> you<00:02:17.719> know

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
kickstart and it's probably you know

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.819 
kickstart and it's probably you know
traditionally<00:02:19.159> if<00:02:19.249> you<00:02:19.370> go<00:02:19.879> back<00:02:20.060> into<00:02:20.239> time

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
traditionally if you go back into time

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.110 
traditionally if you go back into time
it's<00:02:21.829> going<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.010> date<00:02:22.310> back<00:02:22.549> that's<00:02:22.909> going<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
it's going to date back that's going to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.059 
it's going to date back that's going to
be<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.780> furthest<00:02:24.200> back<00:02:24.469> that<00:02:24.739> you<00:02:24.859> see

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
be the the furthest back that you see

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.530 
be the the furthest back that you see
that<00:02:25.219> was<00:02:25.400> used<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.909> was<00:02:26.090> always<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.510> most

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
that was used that was always the most

different video just quickly I would

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.940 
different video just quickly I would
tend<00:06:50.120> to<00:06:50.210> recommend<00:06:50.630> keeping<00:06:50.990> it<00:06:51.260> at<00:06:51.410> the<00:06:51.560> 30

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
tend to recommend keeping it at the 30

tend to recommend keeping it at the 30
milligram<00:06:52.940> per<00:06:53.120> day<00:06:53.270> you<00:06:53.660> know<00:06:53.780> range<00:06:54.200> some

people will go a little higher I feel

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.210 
people will go a little higher I feel
that's<00:06:56.930> overdoing<00:06:57.440> it<00:06:57.680> and<00:06:57.860> it's<00:06:58.160> just

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
that's overdoing it and it's just

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.790 
that's overdoing it and it's just
leading<00:06:58.760> to<00:06:58.910> more<00:06:59.150> you<00:06:59.840> know<00:06:59.960> probability<00:07:00.710> of

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
said you know those those are the ways

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.560 
said you know those those are the ways
to<00:07:05.930> really<00:07:06.550> effectively<00:07:07.550> and<00:07:07.820> commonly<00:07:08.270> use

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
to really effectively and commonly use

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.900 
to really effectively and commonly use
d-ball<00:07:09.070> but<00:07:10.070> you're<00:07:10.190> going<00:07:10.280> to<00:07:10.340> find<00:07:10.610> that<00:07:10.760> as

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910 
d-ball but you're going to find that as

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:13.420 
a kickstart to a cycle is the most

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.830 
a kickstart to a cycle is the most
