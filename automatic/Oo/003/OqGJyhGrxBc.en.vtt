 the season goals book the cadres turned over the four disposals stand 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.750
 not less than 8 new players over

 for the first Heimtor and ensures thereby an age well-known own plant Sascha 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.300
 Ehrler scored three of the top four first goals 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.559
 otherwise, the diehard fans are initially little convinced of him 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.549
 What they see against Konstanz does not quite work for them 

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:30.580
 yellow-black guests from Lake Constance 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.580
 make the better impression 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.980
 after the insolvency of the second division Bayer Ortenau it goes into this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.640
 third league derby also to the question how he is the number one in South Baden middle 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.600
 the first half would be that the HSG Konstanz 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.700
 Newcomer Marc Hafner criticizes Hasen with 6 to 4 in the lead Hoffer played 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.199
 until a year ago still Bundesliga in Landau 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.699
 you him during the season 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.699
 changed so for the celebration 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.940
 also formerly HR Ortenau I now but in the jersey of the SG 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.000
 köndringen-teningen first Martine Barlow the Slovak 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.750
 ex-national player is the new strong man at the yellow-black shortened 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.500
 she is at 15 6 and has 60 so the hosts come into play better 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.370
 Goalkeeper Philipp Grangé also thinks that we might still be talking 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.079
 come 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.079
 and it's pretty quick about Steffen Sammer 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.120
 Top scorer Christian Hefter told telemetry we'll get that short 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.520
 before the break 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520
 Boateng is also with a lead in the half 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.530
 1 0 90 feel Schwiers emperor also the newcomer twelfth his team leads 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 half an hour with 15 to 13 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.159
 Coach Wolfgang Jerat the still known clear announcements and must 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.259
 Being understood in the cab in the SG now presents itself better 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.149
 Michael Rossa is attentively attentive and determined in attacking I place 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.760
 a four-goal lead 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.000
 And the government ensures that is at this projection also many soon 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.310
 great her goalkeeper defused the throws of the guests in halftime two 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 straight to the finish 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.780
 Filip Trojan new member of the league rivals Söflingen 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.610
 billions of dollars jumps with its parades the Konstanzer attackers to the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.440
 Edge of despair and the hall 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.450
 for cooking 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.330
 finally the long time showed the Sechserfeld unfamiliar presents Rosé 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
 Nevertheless, he was taken by the atmosphere 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.840
 that was a big compliment to the audience 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.840
 as Ammann SUI again pushed forward in the second half 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.659
 not Mensa should as we believe 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.969
 meanwhile he feels defenseless 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.969
 "It was just damaged the fence 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.730
 really great is the overall performance of SG köndringen-teningen in this first 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.729
 Home game not in the second section but at least successful 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.320
 Newcomer Sebastian Growe here with his first home game hits for 25 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.880
 to 20 that it is in the end again in close and the SG ultimately only with 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.020
 26 to 24 selected 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.430
 but also shows that the newly formed team 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.430
 still needs time with the offered claims 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.880
 Maybe the three to one for Technical thinks so flounder 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.880
 very demanding but variant 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.249
 It takes a long time but I have never played important 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.129
 I think that tomorrow is good way but otherwise 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.799
 whoever, even if the upswing will no longer be due 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.799
 the field of education is getting better and better 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.649
 the approaches were already very good people there 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.449
 with each competitive game better for it summit on Wednesday the 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.809
 Opportunity have waited in the second round of the dhb cup middle 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:44.780
 second division vice champion for this new home a challenge 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.160
 you can only do the freestyle 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.989
 the compulsory insured to Niger 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.459
 and insiders like the SG köndringen-teningen this year in the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.049
 October will not play
