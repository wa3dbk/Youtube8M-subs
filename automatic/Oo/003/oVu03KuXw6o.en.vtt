don't need to be working with and they

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.100 
don't need to be working with and they
were<00:04:51.790> like<00:04:51.940> they<00:04:52.180> said<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:52.449> few<00:04:52.630> other<00:04:52.840> gurus

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
had sign up for it as well so it's

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.840 
had sign up for it as well so it's
perfectly<00:04:55.690> fine<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:56.710> if<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:56.950> have<00:04:57.280> signed<00:04:57.639> up

you<00:04:59.830> deleting<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.610> account<00:05:00.940> because<00:05:01.270> it

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
you deleting that account because it

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.570 
you deleting that account because it
just<00:05:01.750> seems<00:05:02.020> too<00:05:02.290> sketchy<00:05:02.680> for<00:05:02.860> me<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.430> it's
