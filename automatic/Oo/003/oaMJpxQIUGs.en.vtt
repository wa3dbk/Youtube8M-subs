 2004 release jeep grand cherokee 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.090
 VJ is painfully familiar to all parts 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.539
 especially painfully familiar setup and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.600
 replacing these flaps means but 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 the main problem is that the flaps 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.080
 wear flap hinges just 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.380
 fall down and constantly begin to shower in the legs 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.780
 cold air and outside the window minus 25 what 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.790
 agree absolutely unpleasant therefore 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.280
 chrysler presents a new 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.350
 installation kit for replacing old ones 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.520
 worn flaps on new ones so 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.270
 Kit includes 1 valve is such 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.280
 here is metal covered it with something 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.250
 type of foam rubber, there is foam rubber 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.070
 duralumin such a spoon so 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.920
 This is how 2 flap looks 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.650
 plastic looks like this 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.290
 also covered with foam that is glued 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 to it further go themselves new loops on 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.869
 which they will be mounted in is that 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.400
 while you can not think like that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.000
 for what it is necessary since it will be further 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.159
 surprise means mask sachets well and such 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.770
 here it would seem for what all 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.750
 that's what to do with it like this 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.189
 here's a set of valves well and the most and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.130
 ratu for what is generally worth buying 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.450
 this kit is unique not afraid 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.380
 This word is unique instructions from 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.900
 chrysler companies 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.280
 to replace these valves means that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.680
 It would seem uniquely just aha 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.070
 no means unique color instruction 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 for quick replacement and installation of new ones 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.079
 dampers immediately say that many who 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.399
 Do these dampers know me before that 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.560
 In order to change them you need to disassemble 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.210
 almost half the car inside out 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.920
 particular remove the panel until you get 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.189
 before these shutters it took somewhere 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.090
 but half a day is now the company 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.710
 Chrysler themselves apparently did not sleep 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.240
 trained and that's the result of them so 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.850
 called workouts that is unique 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.640
 color instruction how fast and 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.210
 actually indiscriminately change 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.860
 these same flaps 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.660

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.560
 step by step instruction what where crashes 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.320

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.330

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.860

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.300
 January tubes window occurs replacements 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.700
 in this way we become 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.260
 flap and note sticker 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.940
