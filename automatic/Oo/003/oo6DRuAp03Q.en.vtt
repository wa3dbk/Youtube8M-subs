some good ones in there and some that
I'm<00:04:23.729> still<00:04:23.880> intrigued<00:04:24.210> by<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:24.750> there's<00:04:25.590> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
I'm still intrigued by so there's the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.470 
I'm still intrigued by so there's the
chance<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.159> i<00:04:26.520> will<00:04:26.580> will

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
chance that i will will

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.450 
chance that i will will
I guess<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.110> then<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.650> rest<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.920> my<00:04:29.040> January

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
I guess and then the rest of my January

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.770 
I guess and then the rest of my January
is<00:04:29.550> kind<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.880> wide<00:04:30.000> open<00:04:30.300> i'm<00:04:30.390> not<00:04:30.510> entirely

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
is kind of wide open i'm not entirely

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.860 
is kind of wide open i'm not entirely
sure<00:04:30.960> i<00:04:31.470> think<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:32.340> will<00:04:32.580> not<00:04:33.300> take<00:04:33.720> me

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
sure i think that will not take me

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.690 
sure i think that will not take me
through<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.140> entire<00:04:34.230> month<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:34.920> I<00:04:35.160> don't<00:04:35.520> know
