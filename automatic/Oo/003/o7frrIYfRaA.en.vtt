00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.449
 A mousetrap, that is a lot of my friends 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.380
 complain that the mousetrap 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:28.680

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.300
 go anywhere and do not want to catch mice therefore 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.630

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.630
 universal thing 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:46.420
 that is, it consists of a bar of 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.420
 wooden block 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.680
 it is made of spring hole 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.690
 elastic wire 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:06.730
 here in this place is 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:11.740
 steel wire which goes down 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:16.020
 in the slot this slot that is, here it is 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.410

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.420

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:37.960
 drilled here on out here 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:41.410
 here and the mouse climbs into the hole it prevents 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:47.650
 here these threads she gnaws at them 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:51.000
 and spring shackle and rushes springs 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.880
 rushes up and the wire chokes her 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:03.510

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.510
