okay so we're gonna be looking at is
what<00:00:04.819> what<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:05.850> can<00:00:06.089> do<00:00:06.210> by<00:00:06.450> embedding<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.589> so

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
what what I can do by embedding the so

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.419 
what what I can do by embedding the so
called<00:00:08.040> sub<00:00:08.460> page<00:00:08.730> inside<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.809> another

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
called sub page inside of another

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.610 
called sub page inside of another
smaller<00:00:11.429> viewport<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> couple<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.960> uses<00:00:13.440> for

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
smaller viewport so a couple of uses for

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.279 
smaller viewport so a couple of uses for
this<00:00:13.740> function<00:00:14.040> first<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.670> all<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.809> list

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this function first of all this list

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.080 
this function first of all this list
here<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.890> really<00:00:16.920> doesn't<00:00:17.279> do<00:00:17.609> anything

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
here that it really doesn't do anything

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.540 
here that it really doesn't do anything
it's<00:00:18.420> just<00:00:18.539> kind<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.350> demonstration<00:00:19.890> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it's just kind of a demonstration of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
it's just kind of a demonstration of
some<00:00:21.980> single<00:00:22.980> joined<00:00:23.279> object<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.180> happen

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
some single joined object and I happen

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.660 
some single joined object and I happen
to<00:00:24.600> make<00:00:24.810> 15<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.590> them<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.099> little<00:00:26.340> page

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
to make 15 of them on this little page

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
to make 15 of them on this little page
and<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.150> stuck<00:00:27.510> them<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.900> here<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.410> never

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and then stuck them in here and I never

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.650 
and then stuck them in here and I never
really<00:00:28.890> did<00:00:29.010> much<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.150> this

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
really did much with it so but this

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.319 
really did much with it so but this
isn't<00:00:30.869> any<00:00:31.199> type<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.579> generated<00:00:32.579> smart<00:00:33.030> list

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
isn't any type of generated smart list

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.680 
isn't any type of generated smart list
or<00:00:33.600> anything<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:34.170> literally<00:00:34.620> 15<00:00:35.270> buttons<00:00:36.270> on

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
or anything it's literally 15 buttons on

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.930 
or anything it's literally 15 buttons on
a<00:00:36.719> page<00:00:37.020> that's<00:00:37.410> too<00:00:37.680> big<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.219> its<00:00:38.370> own<00:00:38.550> window

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
a page that's too big for its own window

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.190 
a page that's too big for its own window
and<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:40.079> window<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.770> Scrolls<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and the window then Scrolls so this is

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.250 
and the window then Scrolls so this is
great<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.860> things<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.230> when<00:00:46.230> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
great for things like up here when I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.299 
great for things like up here when I
want<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:48.379> little<00:00:49.379> scrolling<00:00:49.710> bar<00:00:50.010> now

want to have a little scrolling bar now

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.569 
want to have a little scrolling bar now
in<00:00:50.489> Crestron<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:52.579> horizontal

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
in Crestron this would be a horizontal

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
in Crestron this would be a horizontal
list<00:00:53.789> item<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.390> something<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.170> not

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
list item or something but it's just not

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.770 
list item or something but it's just not
quite<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.710> easy<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:57.600> way<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
quite as easy to do this the way I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
want to be able to just generate their

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
want to be able to just generate their
own<00:01:00.899> icon<00:01:01.440> based<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> join<00:01:02.280> number<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:02.879> some

other<00:01:03.329> configuration<00:01:03.799> parameter<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.150> so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
other configuration parameter so so

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
other configuration parameter so so
that's<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.020> simple<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

that's only I don't know six hundred and
some<00:03:10.750> pixels<00:03:11.170> by<00:03:11.410> 1024<00:03:12.220> pixels<00:03:12.670> wide<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.270> that

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
some pixels by 1024 pixels wide so that

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.740 
some pixels by 1024 pixels wide so that

way it you know it just shows as much as
I<00:03:16.780> can<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.200> ultimately<00:03:17.620> I'll<00:03:17.860> be<00:03:18.010> able<00:03:18.130> to

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
I can and ultimately I'll be able to

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.690 
I can and ultimately I'll be able to
pinch<00:03:18.700> zoom<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:20.590> haven't<00:03:20.950> really<00:03:21.190> a

so<00:03:24.930> but<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.050> is<00:03:26.080> a<00:03:26.200> fully<00:03:26.470> functional<00:03:27.010> page

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
so but it is a fully functional page

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.949
