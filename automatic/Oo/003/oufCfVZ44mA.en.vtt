we're working so hard to get respect and

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.610 
we're working so hard to get respect and
then<00:03:23.150> we<00:03:23.239> do<00:03:23.359> things<00:03:23.600> like<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.989> that<00:03:24.260> kind<00:03:24.440> of

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
then we do things like that that kind of

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.500 
then we do things like that that kind of
takes<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:24.950> away<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.489> know<00:03:25.639> so<00:03:25.850> it's<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
takes it away you know so it's a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.360 
takes it away you know so it's a
double-edged<00:03:26.870> sword<00:03:26.900> whatever<00:03:27.680> they<00:03:28.100> need<00:03:28.280> to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
double-edged sword whatever they need to

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.500 
double-edged sword whatever they need to
do<00:03:28.519> they<00:03:28.700> need<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.910> do<00:03:29.030> obviously<00:03:29.180> they're

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
do they need to do obviously they're

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.270 
do they need to do obviously they're
doing<00:03:29.690> something<00:03:30.019> right<00:03:30.139> because<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:31.190> know

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
doing something right because you know

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.309 
doing something right because you know
their<00:03:31.459> faces<00:03:31.639> are<00:03:31.910> everywhere<00:03:32.239> so<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:33.200> know<00:03:33.290> I

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
those two and also Sarah Kaufman which I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.840 
those two and also Sarah Kaufman which I
could<00:03:36.650> feel<00:03:36.799> kind<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.069> bad<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:37.280> cause<00:03:37.760> she's

kind<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.060> getting<00:03:38.150> pushed<00:03:38.389> off<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.720> side

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
kind of getting pushed off to the side

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.170
