00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
let's see if we can fire this up and see

00:01:25.560 --> 00:02:02.500 
let's see if we can fire this up and see
how<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.770> works

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:42.860 

and<00:02:02.960> then<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:03.950> high<00:02:04.130> speed

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.430 

not<00:02:43.870> bad<00:02:44.940> now<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.000> bag<00:02:46.300> has<00:02:46.570> some<00:02:46.780> holes<00:02:47.050> in<00:02:47.290> it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
not bad now the bag has some holes in it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.040 
not bad now the bag has some holes in it
so<00:02:48.330> let's<00:02:49.330> see<00:02:49.540> if<00:02:51.210> see<00:02:52.210> what<00:02:52.390> was<00:02:52.570> picked<00:02:52.840> up

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
so let's see if see what was picked up

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:21.899 
so let's see if see what was picked up
here<00:02:53.470> if<00:02:53.950> anything

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:31.149 

picked<00:03:22.909> up<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.180> little<00:03:23.299> bit<00:03:29.860> little<00:03:30.860> bit<00:03:31.069> of

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
picked up a little bit little bit of

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.759 
picked up a little bit little bit of
fuzz<00:03:31.400> there<00:03:31.790> but<00:03:32.629> of<00:03:32.810> course<00:03:33.049> I<00:03:33.200> wasn't<00:03:33.409> really

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
fuzz there but of course I wasn't really

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.530 
fuzz there but of course I wasn't really
expecting<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.489> do<00:03:34.640> all<00:03:34.790> that<00:03:34.940> much<00:03:35.000> since

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
expecting it to do all that much since

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.170 
expecting it to do all that much since
the<00:03:35.690> brush<00:03:35.930> rolls<00:03:37.150> kind<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.470> non-existent<00:03:39.470> but

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.900 

there<00:03:44.180> we<00:03:44.450> have<00:03:44.659> it
