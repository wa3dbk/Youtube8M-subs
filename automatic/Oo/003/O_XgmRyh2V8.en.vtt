00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
we're beginning to have the beginnings

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.140 
we're beginning to have the beginnings
of<00:03:55.050> our<00:03:55.170> green<00:03:55.500> wall<00:03:55.800> here<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.760> love<00:03:57.000> how<00:03:57.120> you

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
of our green wall here so I love how you

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.550 
of our green wall here so I love how you
can<00:03:57.360> get<00:03:57.450> children<00:03:57.780> involved<00:03:58.080> in<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.410> idea

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
can get children involved in this idea

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.710 
can get children involved in this idea
as<00:03:58.860> well<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.760> can<00:03:59.940> definitely<00:04:00.120> get<00:04:00.480> kids

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
as well you can definitely get kids

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.480 
as well you can definitely get kids
involved<00:04:00.990> I<00:04:01.410> mean<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:02.040> something<00:04:02.070> that

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
involved I mean this is something that

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.380 
involved I mean this is something that
is<00:04:03.480> really<00:04:04.050> easy<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.709> do<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.640> doesn't<00:04:05.940> take<00:04:06.090> any

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
is really easy to do it doesn't take any

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.470 
is really easy to do it doesn't take any
special<00:04:07.020> talent<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:08.310> think<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.120> more<00:04:09.330> we

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
special talent I think that the more we

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.360 
special talent I think that the more we
get<00:04:09.630> involved<00:04:10.200> we<00:04:10.440> get<00:04:10.590> kids<00:04:10.830> involved<00:04:11.100> in

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
get involved we get kids involved in

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.370 
get involved we get kids involved in
gardens<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.120> gardening<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.930> being<00:04:13.200> outside

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
gardens and gardening and being outside

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.890 
gardens and gardening and being outside
and<00:04:13.980> they're<00:04:14.160> somewhat<00:04:14.640> disconnected<00:04:15.090> you

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
and they're somewhat disconnected you

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.260 
and they're somewhat disconnected you
know<00:04:16.080> playing<00:04:16.620> video<00:04:17.070> games<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.640> watching<00:04:17.670> TV

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
know playing video games and watching TV

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.449 
know playing video games and watching TV
and<00:04:18.510> doing<00:04:18.840> their<00:04:19.080> homework<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.739> they<00:04:20.280> need

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
and doing their homework that they need

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.770 
and doing their homework that they need
to<00:04:20.489> spend<00:04:20.790> more<00:04:20.850> time<00:04:21.150> outside<00:04:21.359> it's

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
to spend more time outside it's

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.120 
to spend more time outside it's
healthier<00:04:22.140> for<00:04:22.200> them<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:22.800> they'll<00:04:22.920> have<00:04:23.100> a

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
healthier for them and they'll have a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.370 
healthier for them and they'll have a
better<00:04:23.970> idea<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.450> what<00:04:24.630> our<00:04:24.660> world<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.110> about<00:04:25.350> I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
better idea of what our world is about I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.230 
better idea of what our world is about I
think<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:26.190> i<00:04:26.220> think<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.490> that's<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:27.120> know

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
think so i think that that's you know

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.820 
think so i think that that's you know
getting<00:04:27.750> kids<00:04:28.020> involved<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.500> something<00:04:28.770> like

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
getting kids involved in something like

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.210 
getting kids involved in something like
this<00:04:28.950> growing<00:04:30.290> excellent<00:04:31.290> thing<00:04:31.500> i<00:04:31.710> think

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
this growing excellent thing i think

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.410 
this growing excellent thing i think
it's<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.490> really<00:04:32.670> great<00:04:32.880> point<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.300> you're

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
it's a really great point that you're

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.240 
it's a really great point that you're
bringing<00:04:33.540> up<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.200> know<00:04:34.260> as<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> mom<00:04:35.010> for

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
bringing up and I know as a mom for

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.310 
bringing up and I know as a mom for
myself<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.760> love<00:04:36.150> my<00:04:36.390> kids<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.810> get<00:04:36.930> outside<00:04:37.260> and

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
myself I love my kids to get outside and

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.620 
myself I love my kids to get outside and
just<00:04:37.800> play<00:04:38.130> where<00:04:38.850> they<00:04:38.970> can<00:04:39.120> touch<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.600> earth

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
just play where they can touch the earth

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.210 
just play where they can touch the earth
they<00:04:40.050> can<00:04:40.200> be<00:04:40.290> involved<00:04:40.620> in<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.950> earth<00:04:41.070> and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
they can be involved in the earth and

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.740 
they can be involved in the earth and
they<00:04:41.310> can<00:04:41.430> actually<00:04:41.700> get<00:04:41.790> inspired<00:04:42.180> by<00:04:42.540> that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
they can actually get inspired by that

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.510 
they can actually get inspired by that
and<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.290> think<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.590> these<00:04:43.740> kind<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.160> teaching

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
and I think that these kind of teaching

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.710 
and I think that these kind of teaching
moments<00:04:44.880> are<00:04:44.970> really<00:04:45.360> excellent

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
moments are really excellent

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.270 
moments are really excellent
opportunities<00:04:46.350> for<00:04:46.500> our<00:04:46.590> kids<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.919> do

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
opportunities for our kids to do

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.550 
opportunities for our kids to do
stress<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.389> connect<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.780> little<00:04:48.900> bond<00:04:49.200> in<00:04:49.470> a

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
stress and to connect a little bond in a

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.200 
stress and to connect a little bond in a
place<00:04:49.830> kind<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.100> community<00:04:50.490> way<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.880> that's

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
place kind of community way and that's

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.640 
place kind of community way and that's
really<00:04:51.420> maybe<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.780> nice<00:04:51.930> way<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.290> you<00:04:52.470> can

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
really maybe a nice way that you can

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.350 
really maybe a nice way that you can
actually<00:04:52.830> help<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.130> change<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.520> earth<00:04:53.610> one
