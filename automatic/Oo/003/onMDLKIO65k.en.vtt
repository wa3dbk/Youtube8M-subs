00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and therefore a warm welcome too 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.339
 a new follow let's play mobile apps 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.470
 and today I can see you 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.480
 prove indeed that my trick or my 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.040
 Tip given by the last episode 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.269
 did not have absolute coach were two 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 maybe you have already seen this above 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.880
 I'll call it a million 282,000 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.560
 money we now have to assume the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.270
 go market, we have the opportunity 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.500
 to see the story there we all see 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.039
 players we bought and sold 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.990
 to have 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.430
 In this season you see I was already 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.349
 very busy but interesting 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.640
 Of course, upper ranges and I have 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.160
 yes the players with you online 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.360
 So the boys with three talent and stuff 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 still very good ratings you see 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.840
 have contributed 351,000 465,000 here 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 and 346,000 which one must not forget 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.070
 that a bit normal when we look 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.129
 look at a message 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.350
 no that was wrong that was with server 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.180
 maintenance work here we see that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.370
 one was sold minus fees 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.309
 So here are fees and that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 pass server maintenance server 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.690
 from 23 o'clock have not already 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.880
 shown so no problem falls exactly 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.750
 So on the one hand sees that brings what and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.220
 That's why we can go right into the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.960
 Stadium would have to continue here 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.760
 If you can upgrade, that is 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 already finished something about it again 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.450
 really good cola at the start 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 and you have to think about what you have to do 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.000
 You saw her, I still have you 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.420
 Lastly, we have too little 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.250
 spectator 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.810
 we need more and that's why we need it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.729
 what attracts the spectator to the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.680
 example here would be the ticket office 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.930
 what is just being talked about that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.979
 is still just under two hours that is 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.110
 I will then after this video 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.820
 occur for knock 500 points out 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.590
 a bit of a pity what he is now 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 although I can explain exactly where 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.439
 we are going to govern it 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.790
 I have extra maintenance and training 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.220
 on the one hand you have the possibility above 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.810
 the team training every 24 hours 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.729
 to make and you can see it here 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.740
 current attributes of fitness practice 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.049
 and standards in the case I decide 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.090
 me for that we upgrade the practice 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.799
 because it and a bit upwards 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.450
 of course, that's interesting below 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.630
 One-to-one training where I really am 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.920
 want to invest with the game time 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.570
 If I want to have fun, the women 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.100
 I would recommend coming 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.409
 to improve every day I have it yes 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.209
 sometimes you choose here has four yellow 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.000
 deposited attributes the strongest 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.340
 attribut is at the yellow stan 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.960
 that is an attribute and have otherwise 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.190
 but the overview the speed and 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.540
 the ball safety in these three 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.590
 projects recommend it almost always 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.170
 to keep straight 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.750
 the other was the completely white so 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.280
 head at 2k shot force you can completely 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.290
 in the end if everything breaks we have it 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.300
 a free day of training and that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.310
 ms theme best times in the review that 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.240
 we'll top up here by 18 and by that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.100
 that the survey is still that 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.990
 bad is you know I'm still with 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.220
 well equipped premium points do 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.600
 I always use the second training 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.800
 premium then jump right to the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.350
 ours are here next 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.670
 defender and here is the 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.010
 Ballsafety is still the worst 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.600
 27 that means biting the team 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.650
 the security and there you can it 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.720
 only possible with time you get 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.700
 eye for quite good I click through 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.260
 really see that I'm doing so well 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.940
 order from weakest to give two equal 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.560
 Here I gave the opportunity even 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.540
 Both at the same time to level up and 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.910
 but it shows clearly that the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.080
 players who have more stars plus 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.820
 the players are younger 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.560
 the level of just where the one 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.270
 works a little better i think 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.190
 later on, it will become very high 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.380
 device the player has that then too 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.610
 So that's a higher rating too 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.110
 reach that is much longer 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.400
 But then it takes me then the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.739
 last evenings are always quite 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.000
 be conveniently clicked on the selection 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.340
 Header is always such a thing 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.350
 Try it is not too much 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.190
 high to push but only times when 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.690
 want to learn to 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.640
 focus on how to focus 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.930
 eg the overview is speed 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.549
 sure even if your wings 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.140
 a long shot will be a very important one 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:38.080
 thing because at the end you have to remember 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.920
 is the whole here 36 year old from 40 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.239
 which age is the attribute 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.310
 come down after the same again 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.480
 then you can see that the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.500
 attribute partially go down there 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.910
 There was already an arrow down 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.610
 I have I think already times 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.799
 shown in a video and you see 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.840
 I have so many here 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.549
 Fullback what bad now 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.280
 But maybe we will come together 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.519
 Midfield players are still selling here 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.329
 in the fight also not hurt 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.290
 and then let's see that we have the 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.850
 remaining here a bit too 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.620
 everything up now young 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.790
 Men and that is really what 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.930
 I can recommend that she looks 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.670
 that you are as young as possible 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.560
 put together if you then only 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.660
 have advantages if you sell them 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.860
 does it work quickly to buy is one 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.570
 It's a bit hard to do that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.430
 a little more money because of that 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.840
 would be a bit invest their wants 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.790
 to the one of course supports the 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.700
 developer 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.040
 on the other hand yes I think you can too 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.630
 here with relatively little money like that 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.760
 They benefit quite well here 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.350
 get a yellow red card 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.780
 that means we have to go then 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.030
 directly adjust our lineup 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.100
 not that any one automatically 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.750
 It is not played and what does not play 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.460
 I actually wanted to say what I mean 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.870
 had forgotten what has come now 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.620
 you must not forget that whole 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.940
 tactical game that is based yes 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.530
 more or less only on mathematical 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.670
 calculations that means you have then 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.590
 just two teams in each 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.290
 Team played on one player 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.280
 any position and if yes, yes 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.100
 there are any 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.480
 algorithms or calculations again on 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.130
 end of this game results 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.480
 so come the whole set 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.160
 then taken together 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.990
 compared and in the end it is almost 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.490
 always like that if a player 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.020
 that means the other and himself 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.060
 which then in many play just hopes 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.100
 that one can also say the total 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.570
 team with the higher rating 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.880
 then the possibility that in the end 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.290
 the game is very likely 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.730
 won and she is doing so long it has 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.010
 not taken without video even faster 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.720
 I have all trained so 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.340
 temporally I find very manageable and 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.810
 also makes sense , as I think 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.910
 and then you get a reward 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.140
 booster in the case fight and we 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.790
 can see the game report from today 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.290
 it looks good we won by 6 0 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.350
 and if we perhaps already league 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.540
 it climbed a bit high 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.670
 we are now at number 9 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.620
 but unfortunately will descend so well 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.080
 we've got six points behind here 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.160
 and if we look that's it 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.020
 last game we saw on support 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.950
 So I do not know how could 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.080
 you look at the league 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.280
 there is this overview here 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.670
 There were different ones up here 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.050
 stuff 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.240
 then it can be through the game days 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.310
 click 23 so it will not even be that way 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.870
 from tomorrow we will see interesting 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.120
 here's the best striker there is even 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.350
 a bit of money as a bonus and us 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.630
 You can also see the maps here and 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.830
 if we go see this league 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.210
 Unfortunately, there is one more 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.470
 13 league where I then down 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.880
 are passed but I hope times 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.650
 get up there and you can see up here 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.530
 then clicked through 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.790
 through the different countries and can 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.130
 also in germany but that wants to 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.250
 following his scroll or prank movement 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.750
 above, top league high looking into the 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.400
 I have already done in league 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.410
 One there you can see immediately that the whole 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.050
 other calibers are on the way and that 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.639
 cheaper 1.1 have to go it 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.009
 arminias all boys 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.870
 and you have the opportunity to do that 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.949
 Team look roughly at strong fitness 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.569
 practice standards in it 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.939
 average game content is included 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.860
 150000 one has the possibility here 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:46.779
 stadium to see what is offered 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.180
 can see the team look here 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:51.849
 we hold games ratings between 95 or 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.930
 says between 90 and 100 then what 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.340
 really a very different caliber 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.199
 is and you can also see how many times she is 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.060
 has become mostly ascended fairplay 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.279
 and scorers really so many 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.150
 interesting things here 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:03.370
 and I do not need anything at first 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.719
 I will also adapt one for you 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.069
 premiere I'm curious how it will be then 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:06.789
 looks tomorrow and I would say it 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.310
 is quite good 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.569
 exactly then to take back if I 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.370
 show you how such a game day 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:14.319
 change looks the season you have to 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.759
 That's what we have to do with the hook behind 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.050
 did not have to be 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.389
 but I think the next one now 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.580
 currently 38 we work in a team 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.930
 come on every case what i tear 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.460
 would say that it was to today 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.839
 follow a little short hope 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.159
 Of course you liked it anyway 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:28.569
 you are always welcome to thumb up 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:30.159
 leave an abo if he also at 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.409
 want to be there next and we see 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:35.550
