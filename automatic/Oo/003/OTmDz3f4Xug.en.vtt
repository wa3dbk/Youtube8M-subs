00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.400
 Hello and welcome to me 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.440
 Welcome back to another 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.960
 video last I have a little 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.400
 unboxing video made namely to the 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.890
 ambassador edition from new nintendo 3ds 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.539
 It would have been seen just once 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.400
 click on the link then you can 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.279
 Watch the whole unboxing again 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.529
 In this video I want to deal with it 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:36.040
 employ the connection nintendo 3ds 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.580
 and amigo the old one should have an extra 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.650
 sensor or 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.600
 so he gets the tip so to speak 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:48.110
 data of the amigo figure down here in 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.650
 form of a nfc chip in there are read 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.930
 can 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.510
 until now still was not really 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.760
 announced that there is not yet 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.930
 the beautiful thing is with the new nintendo 3ds 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.210
 and even with the 3ds xl the chip is already 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.100
 incorporated or already 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.930
 involved and here in here 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.329
 is he and I want to be now 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.950
 just go through with you as you do 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.600
 Here is a new amigo figure registered 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.240
 unfortunately, unfortunately, to my 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.850
 sorry is with super smash brothers 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.600
 for the 3ds the feature unfortunately still 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.460
 not unlocked 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.659
 So that's how it should be then 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.060
 like the wii version because of the 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.829
 eu version that you stop the on 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.780
 Training could level up items 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.859
 could give you two of the eu version 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.179
 so if you already have your 3ds 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.039
 or you wanted to buy then quite 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.229
 just up here on the left to the new one 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.429
 home menu also want to go the whole 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:51.020
 select designs and if you can 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:53.450
 then as it scrolls down further 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.770
 sometime amigo settings 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.960
 if you look at the amigo 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.759
 Click Settings I'll do it 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.969
 a little louder maybe what 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.530
 we can now follow here options 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.090
 select once owners and tips 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.509
 rather register software data 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.399
 Clear 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.700
 reset amigo that is unfortunately so 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.670
 that chip seems like a lot 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.930
 is limited 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.280
 In the direct lately they have too 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.630
 if you say for example now mario 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.090
 party 10 something on 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.610
 20th third of this year comes out 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.100
 that one wants to use the data 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.750
 delete the one at super smash bros 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.910
 I have personally created fire 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.590
 a bit too bad, it forces one 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.330
 tender almost again for smash 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.700
 to buy brothers and one for one 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.190
 another game if you really think so 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.960
 to use extensively yes there are indeed 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.790
 As I said many waves a great mario 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.110
 wave has now been announced and and 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.090
 some are already doubling 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.110
 characters 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.490
 Let's wait and see what Nintendo is now 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.020
 in the end really up to it 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.070
 Well that should not be our topic 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.030
 we could be there for hours 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.860
 philosophize about it 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.600
 So we are now owners and 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.280
 register top locations 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.070
 then we'll get such a nice one here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.630
 bild touch the ami boni touch with 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.120
 the level of the touchscreen and that is 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.570
 in fact, at the youcat we take 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.950
 give them a quick start here 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.710
 so right at the level successful 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.290
 read 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.900
 so now with the registration and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.020
 Give your nickname amigo nickname 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.570
 Let's get started with the stick 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.530
 what name i call the monkey 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.570
 sora that suits so great insider of you 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.750
 are allowed to laugh now who know which 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:37.390
 Person, yes, my memory please 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:41.260
 Touch the Amiga Play Register 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.170
 you have to keep it short so owner 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.000
 registered and that's it 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.620
 unfortunately I can not do more 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.520
 I could still reset and 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.520
 can also delete it again 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.810
 so successfully deleted at the level read 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.940
 everything is deleted 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.080
 Yes, now you can set it up again 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.440
 and then the chip will be new again 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.020
 described with reset and everything 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.150
 is closed 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:20.160
 yes so the possibilities are still 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.250
 but maybe limited to the level 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.080
 is coming soon because I hope something 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.580
 the updates will be activated by lawyer 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.320
 then you have more 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.870
 possibilities but as long as you can 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.160
 let your time pass your 86 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.160
 to register amigos
