 efe many times I do not have thought I have not done anything 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.480
 I'm here all my life 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.249

 today that has a factor that is teaching the word of God so that 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.079

 they are not crushing auted 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.479
 those things that torment him and that take him away from God and that allows us 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.129
 in his motion he said and lights candles rivera rivera 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.110

 repent in your sins 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.029
 clear added 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.150
 a ticket 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.400
 and they give me the hand of god by hearing wonder 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.819
 in your life look for what we want this program

 that can talk to god 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.270
 that god play and prayer 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.229
 but you have to repent 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.610
 for God to hear me and thorax 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.430
 in those of the city victoria 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.559
 since they communicated their common family and wanted another 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.669
 how to converse with you you have to address the father 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.990
 the name of jesus does not ask me to live in Libya so much the world 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.909
 nor before the hamburg 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.800
 and no prophet 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.199
 pillar and the father in the document 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.980
 They are eating from critic and debates to October 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.350
 because there is no other name given to men 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.700
 in time we take the leap made chapter 4 verse 2 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.039
 and the only mediator 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.480
 first timoteo 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.800
 chapter two verses ico 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.830
 word of God 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.020
 for all p 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.279
 we never put of an intercession 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.899
 if first we do not do it, we also do it, we do not sanctify first 

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:08.289
 this is no longer believed when we were going to press offer or pledge 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.679
 by others first pour that wash good relationship between sanctify 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.419
 first you have to clean yourself well 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.249
 and cry for yourself 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.120
 carrying about hiding or peep i commented well clean 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.900
 the same and if my wife the same holy spirit induce him 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.770
 now 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.580
 by situation it is different 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.020
 and a clamor begins 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.680
 that sometimes does not have for when he murdered nine and even now we carry 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.440
 hour and propitiate to get up that experience is real 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:41.799
 for what are spiritual mud that embodies market with five minutes boat 

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:43.629
 and let loose help improve it 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:45.309
 that fanaticism 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:46.919
 there is no need to act 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.139
 why now country recordings 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.569
 for him to issue in which they prayed taek for a recording 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.039
 and already this one 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.119
 there were no planes 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:55.949
 so 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.839
 those issues are mechanical 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:02.689
 you have to save it mechanically what routine you have to know it you have to walk a 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:05.349
 intimate communion with god a consecration 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.010
 why they can not cry 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.300
 that's why they can not sandy the presence of God 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.430
 that's why they contaminate weekly bust that metal bielsa 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.520
 and the whole church as a business and not as a spiritual issue to fill it 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.680
 of god's power 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.330
 and be able to do 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.220
 shudder the devil returned it and lying 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.860
 In the name of Jesus Christ 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.619
 the power of god 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:29.289
 through prayer 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:30.819
 the nation the mighty
