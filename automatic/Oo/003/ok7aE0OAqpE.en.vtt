00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hi everyone, fine, I'm going to teach today. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.899
 for you a carrot soup with a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.620
 touch of ginger after those clothes 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.530
 that we always make pumpkin 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 soup broth green bean soup 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.990
 vegetables is a different touch than you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.150
 can bring 3 winter principle and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.619
 nothing better than eating a night soup 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.619
 Well, then, learn it well. 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.440
 to start you since this is your 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.920
 pan without making noise 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.100
 I add enough olive oil to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.800
 shriek onion when the olive oil is already 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 hot you just throw onion and let her 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.239
 sautÃ© a little and you add the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.860
 ginger trying to grate not into pieces 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.420
 my suggestion is a spoonful of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.820
 ginger dessert 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.620
 but if you like the taste spice 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 strong ginger you can add 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.170
 more and soon after the carrot is added 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:10.110
 which is cut into slices to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.950
 facilitate the movement here come almost a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.939
 pound of carrot you add the broth 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.150
 of vegetables 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.000
 Here I am using this see always 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.820
 happens here all our powder version 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.100
 because it makes it easier to develop and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.140
 because this version has less sodium 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.479
 I'll add some duck and kaka 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.420
 spicy to give a different taste 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.869
 in our soup and the pepper 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.869
 your preference 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.910
 My lady is already braced I go 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.870
 Shoot in the water my water is already hot 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.870
 to facilitate the process 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:59.510
 Add the sunshine pan person and let 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.760
 boil for 15 minutes after cooking 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.790
 your soup you turn the fire off and let 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.370
 they create a little because now the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.560
 people will need to process the carrot and 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.480
 hot it will blow your 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.610
 blender especially if it is 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.740
 then let me take a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.730
 little is mine is not so 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.840
 cold leave the 10 minutes premiering more 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.660
 It will work well not to explode and there 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.000
 Let's always start the speed 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.000
 casualties that exploded explode public 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.470
 Let's taste our soup as a suggestion. 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.660
 for you to serve 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.970
 I advise you to put a ball of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.510
 believers above and a little bit of 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.500
 parsley and if you like olive oil like 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.500
 a delight 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:10.290
 it looks very creamy and with a touch 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.150
 ginger very good for 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.160
 to warm the winter nights 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.410

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.450
