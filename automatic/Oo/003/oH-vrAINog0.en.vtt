00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.930 

the<00:00:52.589> reason<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> start<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.400> at<00:00:53.580> a<00:00:53.610> slow

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the reason you start this at a slow

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.820 
the reason you start this at a slow
speed<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.570> because<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> go

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
speed is because you don't want it to go

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.979 
speed is because you don't want it to go
flying<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.400> over<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> place<00:00:56.790> so<00:00:57.330> now<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
flying all over the place so now that I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
flying all over the place so now that I
have<00:00:58.080> this<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:59.040> gonna<00:00:59.640> go<00:00:59.790> ahead<00:00:59.879> and

have this going I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.619 
have this going I'm gonna go ahead and
increase<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:00.869> speed<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.729> I'm<00:01:02.729> going<00:01:03.119> to<00:01:03.150> mix

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.649 
increase the speed and I'm going to mix
it<00:01:03.900> until<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.830> fluffy<00:01:05.280> consistency<00:01:05.659> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it until it's a fluffy consistency and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.749 
it until it's a fluffy consistency and
that's<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.380> 5<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.100> 10<00:01:08.310> minutes<00:01:10.490> okay<00:01:11.490> now

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
I've spaced them enough that whenever

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.990 
I've spaced them enough that whenever
they<00:03:01.840> start<00:03:02.200> baking<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.890> start<00:03:03.400> expanding

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
that's what you got to do you got to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.330 
that's what you got to do you got to

play with this a little bit and you want
it<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.730> consistency<00:04:37.570> of<00:04:37.990> maybe<00:04:38.320> like<00:04:38.560> a

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
it to a consistency of maybe like a

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.460 
it to a consistency of maybe like a
gravy<00:04:39.160> that's<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.300> good<00:04:40.480> way<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.690> explain<00:04:41.140> it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
gravy that's a good way to explain it

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.400 
gravy that's a good way to explain it
like<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.130> gravy<00:04:42.790> so<00:04:43.150> we're<00:04:43.750> gonna<00:04:43.840> keep<00:04:44.110> adding

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
like a gravy so we're gonna keep adding

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.090 
like a gravy so we're gonna keep adding
and<00:04:45.160> I<00:04:46.090> think<00:04:46.450> I've<00:04:46.600> got<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.320> then<00:04:47.710> this<00:04:47.890> is

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
and I think I've got it and then this is

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.700 
and I think I've got it and then this is
where<00:04:48.340> I'm<00:04:48.640> going<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.360> add<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.440> food<00:04:50.650> coloring
