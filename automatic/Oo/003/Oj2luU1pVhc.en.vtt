all<00:01:53.350> grown<00:01:53.830> up<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.320> them<00:01:56.439> didn't<00:01:56.740> make

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
all grown up and two of them didn't make

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.070 
all grown up and two of them didn't make
it<00:01:57.130> one<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.580> them<00:01:57.640> died<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:58.150> pretty<00:01:58.990> much

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
it one of them died that pretty much

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.380 
it one of them died that pretty much
that<00:01:59.140> same<00:01:59.560> day<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.369> then<00:02:00.820> another<00:02:01.090> one<00:02:01.360> I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
that same day and then another one I

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.910 
that same day and then another one I
think<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.780> got<00:02:01.900> stepped<00:02:02.290> on<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.590> was<00:02:02.710> halfway

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
think it got stepped on it was halfway

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.980 
think it got stepped on it was halfway
in<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.430> little<00:02:03.640> nest<00:02:03.850> box<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.390> then<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.869> was

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
in the little nest box and then it was

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.330 
in the little nest box and then it was
just<00:02:05.110> like<00:02:05.200> broken<00:02:05.530> in<00:02:05.740> half<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.070> think<00:02:06.220> she

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
just like broken in half I think she

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.369 
just like broken in half I think she
