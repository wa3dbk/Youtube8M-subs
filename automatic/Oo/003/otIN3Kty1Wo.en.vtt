Sproles<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.540> he's<00:01:54.780> proven<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.619> he<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:55.890> do

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
Sproles but he's proven that he can do

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.819 
Sproles but he's proven that he can do
it<00:01:56.340> last<00:01:56.520> year<00:01:56.820> he<00:01:56.969> had<00:01:57.119> over<00:01:57.509> 700<00:01:57.960> total<00:01:58.380> yards

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it last year he had over 700 total yards

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.499 
it last year he had over 700 total yards
and<00:01:58.979> seven<00:01:59.549> touchdowns<00:01:59.579> I<00:02:00.299> mean<00:02:00.420> obviously

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and seven touchdowns I mean obviously

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.630

that<00:02:00.869> was<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> Patriots<00:02:01.740> offense<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
that was on the Patriots offense but I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.190 
that was on the Patriots offense but I
think<00:02:02.909> they're<00:02:03.240> gonna<00:02:03.329> find<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> get

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
think they're gonna find a way to get

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.940 
think they're gonna find a way to get
woodhead<00:02:04.799> very<00:02:05.100> involved

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950

least what I'm thinking GM's are
thinking<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.440> think<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.370> Packers<00:03:21.819> were<00:03:21.940> always

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
thinking I think the Packers were always

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.809 
thinking I think the Packers were always
targeting<00:03:23.019> Franklin<00:03:23.500> but<00:03:23.650> lacy<00:03:23.889> kept<00:03:24.310> falling

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
targeting Franklin but lacy kept falling

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.520 
targeting Franklin but lacy kept falling
so<00:03:25.239> they<00:03:25.389> grabbed<00:03:25.750> him<00:03:26.109> because<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.500> thought

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
so they grabbed him because I thought

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.379 
so they grabbed him because I thought
the<00:03:26.799> value<00:03:27.069> is<00:03:27.130> too<00:03:27.280> good<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.489> pass<00:03:27.579> up<00:03:27.760> but

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
the value is too good to pass up but

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.610 
the value is too good to pass up but
then<00:03:28.510> they<00:03:28.600> got<00:03:28.690> Franklin<00:03:29.109> later<00:03:29.260> ty<00:03:29.440> think

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
then they got Franklin later ty think

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.020 
then they got Franklin later ty think
that's<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.829> guy<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.100> they<00:03:30.190> always<00:03:30.489> wanted<00:03:30.850> so

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
that's a guy that they always wanted so

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.240 
that's a guy that they always wanted so
it's<00:03:31.540> not<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.959> you're<00:03:32.109> standing<00:03:32.590> thinking

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
it's not like you're standing thinking

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.190

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
just think it's kind of a perfect fit

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.450 
just think it's kind of a perfect fit
with<00:04:10.750> him<00:04:11.079> going

Minnesota because he is very much a

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.550 
Minnesota because he is very much a
percy<00:04:14.250> harvin<00:04:14.670> type<00:04:14.880> player<00:04:15.240> so<00:04:15.840> with<00:04:16.200> Harvin

gone<00:04:16.740> Patterson<00:04:17.550> swoops<00:04:17.910> right<00:04:18.180> in<00:04:18.360> they

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
gone Patterson swoops right in they

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.300 
gone Patterson swoops right in they
already<00:04:18.780> got<00:04:18.990> the<00:04:19.170> plays<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.410> figure<00:04:20.010> out<00:04:20.040> and

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
already got the plays and figure out and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.430 
already got the plays and figure out and
just<00:04:20.430> plop<00:04:20.760> him<00:04:20.940> right<00:04:21.150> where<00:04:21.330> he<00:04:21.360> was<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.990> don't

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
just plop him right where he was I don't

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.650 
just plop him right where he was I don't
think<00:04:22.650> he's<00:04:22.830> Percy<00:04:23.250> Harvin<00:04:23.640> but<00:04:24.120> I<00:04:24.150> do<00:04:24.270> think

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
think he's Percy Harvin but I do think

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.450 
think he's Percy Harvin but I do think
that<00:04:24.900> he<00:04:25.200> can<00:04:25.380> definitely<00:04:25.770> have<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.130> part<00:04:26.400> in

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
that he can definitely have a part in

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.800 
that he can definitely have a part in
that<00:04:26.580> offense<00:04:26.940> if<00:04:27.120> your<00:04:27.270> league<00:04:27.450> counts

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
that offense if your league counts

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.660 
that offense if your league counts
return<00:04:28.140> yards<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:29.010> know<00:04:29.070> check<00:04:29.400> out<00:04:29.550> the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
return yards you know check out the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.280 
return yards you know check out the
preseason<00:04:30.030> reports<00:04:30.540> but<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.720> do<00:04:30.780> think<00:04:31.110> they

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
preseason reports but I do think they

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.320 
preseason reports but I do think they
probably<00:04:31.560> will<00:04:31.950> incorporate<00:04:32.580> him<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.150> some

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
probably will incorporate him and some

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.210 
probably will incorporate him and some
