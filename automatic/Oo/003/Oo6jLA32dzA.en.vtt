various items and little updated the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.230 
various items and little updated the
bits<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.710> now<00:01:37.860> drop<00:01:38.070> very<00:01:38.340> dark<00:01:38.820> Scrolls<00:01:39.090> as

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
bits and now drop very dark Scrolls as

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
bits and now drop very dark Scrolls as
well<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:40.500> course<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.920> consumable<00:01:41.490> box

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
well and of course the consumable box

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
well and of course the consumable box
which<00:01:42.150> hands<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.869> 5<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:43.439> example<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.950> can

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
which hands out a 5 all example that can

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
which hands out a 5 all example that can
possibly<00:01:44.490> handle<00:01:44.820> 5<00:01:45.119> long<00:01:45.299> surplus<00:01:45.600> rewards

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
possibly handle 5 long surplus rewards

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.499 
possibly handle 5 long surplus rewards
that's<00:01:46.229> always<00:01:46.409> cool<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.759> let's<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.060> over<00:01:48.210> like

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
it's pretty good for a high-level more a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.220 
it's pretty good for a high-level more a
high-level<00:02:48.459> your<00:02:48.700> papers<00:02:49.090> I'm<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:49.989> at<00:02:50.079> high

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
high-level your papers I'm not at high

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.250 
high-level your papers I'm not at high
level<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:50.769> this<00:02:51.250> really<00:02:51.639> sucks<00:02:51.819> for<00:02:51.940> me<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
level so this really sucks for me the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.479 
level so this really sucks for me the
most<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.709> difference<00:02:54.040> between<00:02:54.190> the

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
most of the difference between the

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.800 
most of the difference between the
regular<00:02:54.730> PMD<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.239> this<00:02:55.359> one<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.629> that<00:02:55.720> the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
regular PMD and this one is that the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.050 
regular PMD and this one is that the
monster<00:02:56.109> actually<00:02:56.349> drop<00:02:56.560> all<00:02:57.129> examples<00:02:57.609> by

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
monster actually drop all examples by

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.220 
monster actually drop all examples by
themself<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.659> don't<00:02:58.810> have<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.989> get<00:02:59.139> them

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
themself so you don't have to get them

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.390 
themself so you don't have to get them
from<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.440> box<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.799> actually<00:03:00.040> drop<00:03:00.220> them

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
from the box to actually drop them

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.030 
from the box to actually drop them
that's<00:03:01.329> pretty<00:03:01.510> cool<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:02.109> mostly<00:03:02.409> high<00:03:02.739> level

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
that's pretty cool but mostly high level

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.520 
that's pretty cool but mostly high level
the<00:03:03.159> maps<00:03:03.370> really<00:03:03.909> big<00:03:04.170> also<00:03:05.170> if<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.379> have<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the maps really big also if you have a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.940 
the maps really big also if you have a
canner

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
canner

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.710
