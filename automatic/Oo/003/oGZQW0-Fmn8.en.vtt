00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.809
 Mohring on average 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.709
 Grant Hill has already been awarded 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:11.879
 in his second year 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.329
 the comparison with 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.449
 Michael Jordan back door a little Jordan also in his second 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.449
 Professional year Bayer not at all 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.319
 only very few games 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.809
 the nba fans know is the second year is Michel already had his foot 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.809
 broken and could not work at all 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.990
 as well as the words that is 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.640
 very interesting to see it there 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.130
 as almost always 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.330
 pull to the basket but now quite well defended by Wortmann and something 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.260
 Meerbeck as two meters to the basket that's not the distance that sounds the word 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.460
 nice front play 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.930
 but he flew up and he is celebrated 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.300
 especially what are you waiting for 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.910
 so far the difference 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.910
 between 10 under union the pressure cen 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.760
 around the historical museum 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 such deals Bulls 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.450
 Percent of scary Beckett research for ever »region 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.950
 or you are like that 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 js 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.560
 Malo too 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.360
 so it is June allowed Timo as a screen 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.350
 it is 11 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.620
 subscribe then it comes more big day out 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.670
 The reform should be explained Stone is wonderful and that is supposed to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.840
 Cargo for now it is like this or just as 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.450
 that it is rarely after the Bernese 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.110
 google-chef 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.520
 Bald Dennis Rottmann explains very briefly in San Antonio you have a lot more 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.130
 Cohabitation is always what I said 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.670
 did what I did not do and here a ski day or laugh at it 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.320
 Anyone have ever laughed about it and laughed 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.820
 besides there are now two big attraction named Michel Jordan 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.180
 Scottie Pippen and what I contribute to Stone 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.280
 the minimum they can easily go in Chicago and much more 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.350
 You can deal with the person with the shock immediately with Jack Hillen for example 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.559
 Soost from the socks 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.999
 as his «son» Jacky Rieling is not a player, the Kock &amp; Voeste is 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.179
 so far never played but who is there a kind of translator 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.739
 between coats of arms and the rest of the world 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.739
 the best friend of Dennis 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.039
 but now Leon believes loose com 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.929
 good with each other 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.999
 be the second time in a row 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.999
 very nice interaction of the Briton 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.259
 but the word should not speak to anyone like that is not even the technology 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.359
 from Chicago's Jason Kay it's already said 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.359
 because it would show take on the few movements 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.829
 speak to open 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.359
 so will 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.359
 wishful thinking 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.279
 without Miba and legend 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.249
 Discretion and 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.439
 Striefler referee legend Bitburg 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.629
 good to see 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.829
 many years 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.829
 nba-match sweet 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.419
 Jordan 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.909
 I enjoy watching Michel Jon 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.719
 besides many litters 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.719
 she is good 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.289
 on the other hand, Sony preferred to have them earlier 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:57.499
 Hella delivered in the late 1980's in the playoffs 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.999
 numerous wet against Jorge 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.799
 after that I already have actions between the 3 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.629
 because both are the same age but most 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.259
 Who can he something that she 33 this year 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.330
 Hero for example still 7 rebounds per game that was one of them 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.629
 not only at the best rebounding Garci still made to Michel Jarre 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.880
 over 30 points or more in July and he is the number, for example 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.889
 four 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.889
 in the statistics of the Tyrolean in the NBA around the 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.009
 become something like the head of the day 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.319
 out of balance and the gate of Marco s 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.409
 So the photographers would have been happy if Mark Reuss did not stand in the way 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.409
 so there's free throws 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.479
 just play in these 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.789
 Mark of 23 000 100 points exceeded Michel Jorden 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.080
 one in 13 plays at all
