00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.370
 good afternoon today i wish you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.970
 tell about such a thing as something 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.830
 leave the banquet I have a lot of people 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.370
 ask what you have this is worth 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.680
 the thing on the steering wheel why is it even needed well 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.510
 no matter how many people have never 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.109
 Seen that something see each other therefore 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.180
 they have this question 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:31.050
 loop based damping paths 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.969
 be the damper of the ls-l company 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.380
 the company produces a damper for 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.510
 motorcycles other things why at all 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.309
 I need a damper where all are taken well 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.460
 why do people install a damper 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.110
 start with this when riding a motorcycle 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.469
 at great speed in a bad road like 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.719
 say motorcycle at the front off 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.690
 wheels off the road surface 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.370
 skip yes we have along a trajectory or 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.680
 his motorcycle to help rearrange give 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.710
 Then it turns out I will give the steering wheel and your 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.570
 motorcycle can go into vibrations 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.260
 fluctuations motorcycle should rejoice 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.299
 wobling 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.520
 in other words you can start 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.880
 raskolbas begin can raskolbas 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.080
 which will cause you to fall 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.860
 the damper is just that device which 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.659
 designed to protect against such cases that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.650
 she does in general what to do damper 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.450
 to the general idea damper damper introduces both 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.520
 say it fixes fixes your steering wheel 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.729
 on some particular effort that is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.360
 he doesn't let your u turn around easily 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.140
 he do steering resistance for example 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.180
 this damper 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.770
 stock it has a setting yes i mean i 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.229
 here dn nl sl here for this twist I 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 can turn 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.430
 counterclockwise respectively 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.829
 This is an easy mode of operation, that is, dna 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.189
 my steering wheel practically doesn't work 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.409
 turn easily damper little effort 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.299
 what makes this mode very convenient in 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.729
 the city then when you need high 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.060
 speed then good condition 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.160
 roads he just like to say 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 you can say it turns off that is very 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.620
 transmits little effort to the steering wheel while 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.200
 you are very easy to maneuver in traffic 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.660
 it is very easy for you to turn the steering wheel 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.590
 drive out of the yards some wag and so 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.000
 further here are such clicks that is, I 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.930
 when I start to turn it against 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.420
 clockwise Clockwise I 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.760
 respectively until the end and for example 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.680
 I twist the hardest mode of operation 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.930
 have it when the damper transmits 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.180
 maximum effort on the steering wheel and in such 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.959
 the case is much harder for me to turn 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.959
 driving 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.330
 Here is precisely this stock damper method 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.519
 such adjustment also happen other dm 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.790
 orphaned but now not out now I 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.660
 I consider stock damper good 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.110
 such demfi 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.090
 Unlike rotary damper stock 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.519
 the damper is lighter than the rota 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.120
 we hope that is why these dampers 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.280
 applies in racing ie on 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.720
 motorcycles while using these 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.670
 competition motivational mota race and 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.220
 so on this damper have less weight 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.470
 accordingly, it is preferable 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.299
 for riders we are with you as a private 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.549
 motorcyclists in the city it is completely 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.799
 whatever it is then there are some 50 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.170
 grams on your motorcycle they are you weather 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.840
 no you do for the fact that you damper 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.010
 its disadvantages are traumatic by others 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.950
 words got into an accident 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.100
 if god forbid it will be fixing something 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.250
 here is this stock here is this stock damper he 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.579
 can stick you in the knee to the left and and 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.799
 I think that this will be fun little 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.720
 that's why it is much preferable 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.829
 install the damper either horizontally 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.170
 located on the steering wheel or under the wheels 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.459
 when the damper is under the crosshead on 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.560
 some motorcycles it is wide 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.630
 distributed either yet 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.269
 use wire and hope it and 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.180
 it is located more compactly here on 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:14.340
 traverse on top of it is attached and smaller 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.109
 and less travmoopasen Now here I 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.180
 for example, when I bought a motorcycle from me 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.919
 this damper is already a show immediately installed with 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.710
 that is, it is not Zavadsky 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.210
 Naturally installation but someone it here 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.680
 put here 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.250
 how to install a damper at all 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.020
 each damper has its own set 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.280
 mounts for your motorcycle by others 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.900
 words punish the phone cycles as if 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.819
 on like on every act of every model 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.490
 a little bit different mounts 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.380
 tracks and everything else so when 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.280
 you buy such a dansi antiworld 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.960
 all ls-l 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.449
 your bike comes with a set of mounts 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.610
 which allow you to install it in 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.819
 In this case, this is the top mount 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:59.190
 which holds the guide rod here 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:02.910
 here by the way the ball which which is like 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.440
 say lets walk a day 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.300
 a little bit on this ball 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.259
 because we have different angles of inclination 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:14.030
 steering wheel here and here is the transverse mount 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:16.110
 which is attached to the damper housing itself 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.909
 respectively here on the yoke on the clamp 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.310
 she is also our river to demfer 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:23.300
 moved because we have different 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.759
 there can be a steering angle and so on 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.699
 That's all about me as far as I am 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.500
 known by design that's it 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.020
 this is something in the damper that is there is 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.560
 how would anthers protect against 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:43.759
 dust in the damper glands 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:46.289
 and also this stock when turning up has 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:50.610
 there is likely some kind of transition such 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.490
 plate which which when changing 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.440
 settings open or close a 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.469
 channel through which the oil passes 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.690
 precisely such precisely because of this that is 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:03.090
 we can customize 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.940
 effort that the dancer seems to be holding 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.120
 rus how much effort is like that 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.039
 I do not know the scheme of work about him 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.099
 I never served him 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:18.449
 here I am for the second season I donâ€™t know 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.919
 much before it hosts the well 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.719
 there is how much before we went 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.419
 other hosts can't say but I have 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:27.090
 while there were no problems with it 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.740
 naturally when in the winter I leave on 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.139
 wintering i mean i can preserve 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.750
 I try to hibernate for wintering or 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.449
 Silicone lubricate here such things as 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.540
 rod guide up the balls so they don't 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:39.250
 subjected to the king 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.990
 what are they naturally in cold 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:46.000
 motorcycle garage 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.480
 that's all i want to tell one ferry 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.030
 I think the thing is simply indispensable for 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.730
 what ordinary motorcycle drivers 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:58.300
 because well, sooner or later on 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:00.370
 speeds of 100 there are 150 200 you can 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.840
 get into a bad situation on the road and 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.430
 here then 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.770
 hope for your professionalism 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.810
 Of course you can, but I would not do this 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.110
 became and here is the usual device in 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.210
 dna is very easy to save you personally 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.090
 I got into a situation when at speed 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.850
 220 I started wobbling on this 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:23.320
 motorcycle due to poor road quality 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.580
 and here is demfi he literally did everything 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.140
 for me, that is, I did not even have time 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.320
 get scared motorcycle garden 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.540
 stabilized and I even slowed down 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.370
 speed and already went a little quieter then 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.740
 I have, in principle, this device is very 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.740
 I am satisfied and recommend it to everyone 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.770
 people who say yes fuck these are yours 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.620
 nobody needs a damper please 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.140
 your affairs in my opinion thing 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:51.640
 irreplaceable absolutely worth such a demarche 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:53.200
 this order 10-12 14,000 rubles well 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.330
 now again the dollar and the euro 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.780
 swims so for sure prices I tell you 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.390
 I can not 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.880
 Well , something about 10,000 rubles for sure 

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:03.220
 arrange something we will leave ferre how many 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.970
 worth rotary there firm DPR I you 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.500
 I can not say 

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:11.050
 at the moment it is firm to in the village here 

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.340
 all probably about the dampers if u 

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.530
 do you have any questions ask them 

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:18.120
 comments subscribe like 

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.120
 bye everyone
