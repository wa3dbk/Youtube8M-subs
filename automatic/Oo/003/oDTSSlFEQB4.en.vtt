that kind of act like rails to keep the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.750 
that kind of act like rails to keep the
boat<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.970> line<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> little<00:00:24.660> bit<00:00:25.460> it's<00:00:26.460> having

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
trouble with a good stuck under the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.990 
trouble with a good stuck under the
glass<00:00:29.970> their<00:00:30.949> last<00:00:31.949> leg<00:00:32.219> didn't<00:00:32.910> have

glass their last leg didn't have
anything<00:00:33.149> below<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.050> gets<00:00:34.170> stuck

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
anything below that so it gets stuck

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.370

right there you know sometimes I would

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.940 
right there you know sometimes I would
get<00:00:37.530> off<00:00:37.680> center<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:39.030> off<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.950> blocks

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
get off center and get off on the blocks

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100 
get off center and get off on the blocks
down<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.780> still<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.079> the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.630 
I got a little bit of a v-shape to the
water<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.520> that<00:02:25.730> helps<00:02:26.060> Center<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:27.310> boat<00:02:28.310> I

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
water here that helps Center the boat I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.090 
water here that helps Center the boat I
think<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.120> same<00:02:29.330> thing<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.600> going<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:29.870> here

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
think the same thing is going on here

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.550 
think the same thing is going on here
not<00:02:31.100> quite<00:02:31.370> as<00:02:31.490> much<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:32.260> having<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.320> little

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
not quite as much but having a little

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.080 
not quite as much but having a little
bit<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:33.890> V<00:02:34.100> there<00:02:34.340> keeps<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.910> boat

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
bit of a V there keeps the boat

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.900 
bit of a V there keeps the boat
hopefully<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.050> center<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:37.430> let's<00:02:37.700> take<00:02:37.850> a

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
hopefully on the center so let's take a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.030 
hopefully on the center so let's take a
ride<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.209> this<00:02:38.450> guy<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.440> same<00:02:42.680> deal

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
ride on this guy it's the same deal

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.650 
ride on this guy it's the same deal
getting<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:43.670> out<00:02:43.760> it's<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.030> little<00:02:44.270> tricky

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
getting in and out it's a little tricky

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.890 
getting in and out it's a little tricky
but<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.880> hit<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.030> bottom<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.480> then<00:02:47.600> click

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
but you hit the bottom and then click

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.590 
but you hit the bottom and then click
and<00:02:48.500> move<00:02:49.040> you'll<00:02:49.670> be<00:02:49.880> all<00:02:49.970> right<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:53.420> here's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
and move you'll be all right so here's

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.320 
and move you'll be all right so here's
the<00:02:53.750> bottom<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.430> got<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.640> source<00:02:55.970> blocks

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
the bottom of it got to source blocks

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.410 
the bottom of it got to source blocks
there<00:02:56.630> actually<00:02:57.140> might<00:02:57.350> be<00:02:57.410> four<00:02:57.830> but<00:02:58.420> they're

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
there actually might be four but they're

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.060 
there actually might be four but they're
flowing<00:02:59.690> this<00:02:59.930> way<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.140> little<00:03:00.260> bit<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.709> a<00:03:00.860> V

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
flowing this way a little bit of a V

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.640 
flowing this way a little bit of a V

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
is I'm going to using the video I shoot

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.300 
is I'm going to using the video I shoot
them<00:04:25.130> at<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.250> time<00:04:25.610> how<00:04:25.910> long<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.150> takes<00:04:26.330> to

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
them at a time how long it takes to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.720 
them at a time how long it takes to
climb<00:04:28.310> this<00:04:28.580> distance<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.420> then<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.640> want<00:04:31.640> to

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
climb this distance and then I want to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.110 
climb this distance and then I want to
fix<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.510> ride<00:04:32.900> to<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.170> top<00:04:33.910> much<00:04:34.910> more<00:04:35.060> fun

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
fix to a ride to the top much more fun

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.790 
fix to a ride to the top much more fun
to<00:04:35.330> ride<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.840> that's<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:36.170> hell<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.620> lot

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
to ride and that's a hell of a lot

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.410 
to ride and that's a hell of a lot
faster<00:04:36.830> but<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.490> want<00:04:37.640> to<00:04:37.700> figure<00:04:37.850> out<00:04:38.030> exactly

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
faster but I want to figure out exactly

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.150 
faster but I want to figure out exactly
how<00:04:38.510> much<00:04:40.450> it's<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.540> weird<00:04:41.690> Gazoo<00:04:42.080> when<00:04:42.980> you're

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
how much it's a weird Gazoo when you're

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.300 
how much it's a weird Gazoo when you're
looking<00:04:44.030> at<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> blocks<00:04:44.660> as<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:44.960> go<00:04:45.110> by<00:04:45.350> after

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
looking at the blocks as you go by after

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.070 
looking at the blocks as you go by after
a<00:04:46.340> while<00:04:46.520> if<00:04:46.730> it<00:04:46.940> kind<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.240> goes<00:04:47.390> backwards<00:04:47.900> do

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
a while if it kind of goes backwards do

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.159 
a while if it kind of goes backwards do
the<00:04:48.290> frame<00:04:48.620> rate<00:04:49.210> so<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.419> kind<00:04:50.780> of<00:04:50.840> throws<00:04:50.990> you

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
the frame rate so it kind of throws you

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.370 
the frame rate so it kind of throws you
for<00:04:51.410> a<00:04:51.440> loop<00:04:51.500> there<00:04:51.890> for<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:52.130> second<00:04:56.200> like<00:04:57.200> right

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
for a loop there for a second like right

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.740 
for a loop there for a second like right
there<00:04:57.500> looks<00:04:57.740> like<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:57.950> stops<00:04:58.370> right<00:04:59.270> at<00:04:59.419> the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
there looks like it stops right at the

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.940 
there looks like it stops right at the
bottom<00:05:00.020> click<00:05:00.350> jump<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:02.090> here's<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.710> ladder

to the top so let's see how long this

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.210 
to the top so let's see how long this
takes

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.760
