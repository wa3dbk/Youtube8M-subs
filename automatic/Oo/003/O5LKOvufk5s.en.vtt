00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.660 
this way this way you know I just kind
of<00:02:47.599> play<00:02:47.870> with<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.139> whatever<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:49.310> know<00:02:49.459> I'm

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
of play with it whatever you know I'm

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.270 
of play with it whatever you know I'm
having<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.060> better<00:02:50.180> hair<00:02:50.569> day<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.160> don't

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
having a better hair day is so I don't

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.729 
having a better hair day is so I don't
really<00:02:52.670> have<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> preference<00:02:53.419> of<00:02:53.840> one<00:02:54.380> side<00:02:54.709> or

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
really have a preference of one side or

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.020 
really have a preference of one side or
the<00:02:54.950> other

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.620 

and<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.359> then<00:03:00.160> another<00:03:01.160> Keith<00:03:01.579> thing<00:03:02.389> let<00:03:02.599> me

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
and so then another Keith thing let me

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.150 
and so then another Keith thing let me
get<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> little<00:03:03.019> closer<00:03:03.260> um<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:06.319> take<00:03:06.919> your

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
get a little closer um you take your

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.479 
get a little closer um you take your
flat<00:03:07.400> iron<00:03:07.669> and<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.299> go<00:03:08.510> out<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.260> then<00:03:09.530> go

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
flat iron and you go out and then go

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.780 
flat iron and you go out and then go
down<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.299> kind<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.540> curl<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:12.859> actually

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
down and kind of curl and that actually

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.530 
down and kind of curl and that actually
will<00:03:14.269> give<00:03:14.510> you

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.700 

even<00:03:19.540> though<00:03:19.630> your<00:03:19.780> straighten<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.530> will

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
even though your straighten it it will

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.920 
even though your straighten it it will
give<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.070> some<00:03:21.340> volume<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:22.000> another<00:03:22.540> thing

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
give you some volume and another thing

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:33.300 
give you some volume and another thing
is<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:29.640> mean<00:03:30.640> usually<00:03:30.790> have<00:03:31.240> to<00:03:31.980> play<00:03:32.980> with<00:03:33.190> this

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
is I mean usually have to play with this

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.080 
is I mean usually have to play with this
for<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.670> minute<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:34.090> see<00:03:34.300> but<00:03:35.460> instead<00:03:36.460> of<00:03:36.610> going

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
for a minute to see but instead of going

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.750 
for a minute to see but instead of going
you<00:03:37.390> know<00:03:37.480> really<00:03:37.900> fast<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:39.520> try<00:03:39.700> to

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
you know really fast to try to

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.360 
you know really fast to try to
straighten<00:03:40.120> your<00:03:40.330> hair<00:03:40.390> like<00:03:41.290> if<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.620> do<00:03:41.860> one

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
nice go relatively slow but you don't

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.370 
nice go relatively slow but you don't
want<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:48.730> burn<00:03:48.880> your<00:03:49.060> hair<00:03:49.300> and<00:03:49.540> go<00:03:49.660> down<00:03:49.930> and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
want to burn your hair and go down and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.350 
want to burn your hair and go down and
if<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.370> do<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.670> one<00:03:51.940> time<00:03:53.100> slower<00:03:54.360> you're

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
if you do it one time slower you're

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.020 
if you do it one time slower you're
gonna<00:03:55.540> get<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:55.960> straightened<00:03:59.520> but<00:04:00.520> these<00:04:00.760> I

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
gonna get it straightened but these I

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.510 
gonna get it straightened but these I
always<00:04:01.300> go<00:04:01.660> out<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:02.830> down<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:06.250> get

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
always go out and down and it you get

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:14.360 
always go out and down and it you get
volume<00:04:06.700> by<00:04:07.180> doing<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:12.480> I'm<00:04:13.480> just<00:04:13.540> gonna

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
volume by doing that so I'm just gonna

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.130 
volume by doing that so I'm just gonna
for<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.490> sake<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:15.790> this<00:04:16.090> video<00:04:16.359> I'm<00:04:16.720> not<00:04:16.930> gonna

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
for the sake of this video I'm not gonna

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.190 
for the sake of this video I'm not gonna
do<00:04:17.440> all<00:04:17.769> over<00:04:18.220> but<00:04:19.080> so<00:04:20.080> then<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:22.120> best<00:04:22.510> thing<00:04:22.840> I

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
do all over but so then the best thing I

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.950 
do all over but so then the best thing I
ever<00:04:23.500> ever<00:04:24.460> got<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.090> was<00:04:25.210> just<00:04:25.480> recently

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
ever ever got and it was just recently

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.650 
ever ever got and it was just recently
but<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:27.220> made<00:04:27.430> shake<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.790> already<00:04:28.150> have<00:04:28.419> showed

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
but it made shake I already have showed

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.650 
but it made shake I already have showed
a<00:04:28.690> video<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:29.169> this<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:29.560> Oasis<00:04:30.250> dust<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.419> I

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
a video in this this Oasis dust it I

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.260 
a video in this this Oasis dust it I
might<00:04:32.200> be<00:04:32.410> pronouncing<00:04:32.860> that<00:04:33.070> wrong<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:34.060> if

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
might be pronouncing that wrong but if

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.220 
might be pronouncing that wrong but if
you<00:04:34.540> what<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.290> do<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:37.380> just<00:04:38.380> like<00:04:39.750> slice<00:04:40.750> open

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
you what you do is just like slice open

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.740 
you what you do is just like slice open
a<00:04:41.710> section<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:45.330> put<00:04:46.330> tape<00:04:46.510> right<00:04:46.690> here

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
a section and the put tape right here

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.810 
a section and the put tape right here
and<00:04:47.200> so<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.590> doesn't<00:04:47.860> all<00:04:48.010> come<00:04:48.040> out<00:04:48.250> at<00:04:48.640> one

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
and so it doesn't all come out at one

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.700 
and so it doesn't all come out at one
time<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.390> then<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.930> because<00:04:50.350> this<00:04:50.440> stuff

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
time and then you because this stuff

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.010 
time and then you because this stuff
isn't<00:04:50.919> really<00:04:51.790> cheap<00:04:52.180> well<00:04:52.419> you<00:04:52.570> can<00:04:52.720> find<00:04:52.840> it

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
isn't really cheap well you can find it
