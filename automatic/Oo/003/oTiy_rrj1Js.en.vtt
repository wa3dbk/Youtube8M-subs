biggest thing would be teaching hat has

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.460 
biggest thing would be teaching hat has
many<00:04:22.880> more<00:04:23.090> rewards<00:04:23.660> than<00:04:23.750> what<00:04:24.169> as<00:04:24.349> we

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
many more rewards than what as we

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.370 
many more rewards than what as we
collide<00:04:24.620> people<00:04:24.949> face<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.639> if<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.509> really<00:04:27.199> do

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
collide people face and if you really do

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.370
