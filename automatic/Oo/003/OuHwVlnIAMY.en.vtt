00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.130
 let's enjoy this heat to give 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.279
 a refreshing river of lemon sorbet 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.410
 It's cool, it 's super easy, you know. 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.849
 You'll need lemon as many as you want. 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.400
 because it goes of your taste 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.830
 in case here we are going to use three one 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.710
 can condensed milk two cups 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.110
 of natural yogurt four eggs if it costs 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.020
 only lightly and two tablespoons 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.650
 sugar appeared cavati that is already home 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.239
 it is she who will reveal the secrets 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.250
 refreshments of this delight 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.260
 first place in the blender the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.420
 condensed milk the yogurt the juice of 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.789
 lemon and beat everything 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.510
 It has to be for 15 more minutes or 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.210
 less to look good creamy mixture 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.909
 pour everything into a bowl and let it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.860
 in the freezer for about six hours 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.860
 Meanwhile beat the egg whites 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.299
 add the sugar and continue beating 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.250
 until well consistent 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.500
 From there I find that I was in the freezer and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.710
 mix with the clear beat and the ice cream 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.869

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:37.490
 time for about three hours the sun to crack 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.110
 ps there is nothing better to put the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.819
 appear in the results already traditional 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.819
 I've never left here how many times 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.740
 too much chocolate on top of you 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:09.090
 You can also put whatever you want 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.700
