review<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.630> decided<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.439> use<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> no

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
review so I decided to just use a no

review so I decided to just use a no
reference<00:00:24.600> design<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.380> four<00:00:25.650> gigabytes

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
of RAM 3-way SLI as possible but why

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.910

that's<00:01:55.590> probably<00:01:56.579> useful<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.210> some<00:01:57.390> people

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that's probably useful for some people

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.450 
that's probably useful for some people
really<00:01:57.990> cool<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.799> would<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.280> a

driver<00:01:59.790> CD<00:02:00.000> which<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> shouldn't<00:02:00.630> use

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
driver CD which you shouldn't use

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.749 
driver CD which you shouldn't use
because<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.290> should<00:02:01.439> always<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:02.579> the

drivers from the website right and then
manual<00:02:08.369> quick<00:02:08.550> installation<00:02:08.849> guide<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.750> is

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
manual quick installation guide there is

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.809 
manual quick installation guide there is
also<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.440> game<00:02:10.739> key<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.190> comes<00:02:11.400> with

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
also a game key that comes with

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.319 
also a game key that comes with
so<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.329> can<00:02:12.629> get<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.349> crew<00:02:13.590> 4x4<00:02:14.400> or<00:02:14.640> Assassins

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
so you can get the crew 4x4 or Assassins

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.839 
so you can get the crew 4x4 or Assassins
Creed<00:02:15.390> unity<00:02:15.980> with<00:02:16.980> your<00:02:17.219> cart

so I'm now gonna move to the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.479 
so I'm now gonna move to the
installation<00:02:21.239> where<00:02:22.109> I'll<00:02:22.260> talk<00:02:22.530> about<00:02:22.560> noise

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
installation where I'll talk about noise

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.399 
installation where I'll talk about noise
levels<00:02:23.909> because<00:02:24.359> it<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.599> reference<00:02:24.780> car<00:02:25.170> and

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
levels because it is a reference car and

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.490 
levels because it is a reference car and
I'm<00:02:25.499> also<00:02:25.680> move<00:02:26.099> to<00:02:26.129> Oh<00:02:26.819> No<00:02:27.329> oh<00:02:27.719> my<00:02:28.019> god<00:02:28.260> I'm

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I'm also move to Oh No oh my god I'm

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.020 
I'm also move to Oh No oh my god I'm
terrible<00:02:28.889> at<00:02:29.010> his<00:02:29.159> art<00:02:29.340> I'm<00:02:31.819> doing<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:32.939> on

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
terrible at his art I'm doing it on

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.429 
terrible at his art I'm doing it on
boxing<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.540> not<00:02:33.689> actually<00:02:34.019> talking<00:02:34.379> about

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
boxing and not actually talking about

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:41.989 
boxing and not actually talking about
the<00:02:34.680> college<00:02:35.040> itself<00:02:40.639> because<00:02:41.639> you<00:02:41.790> should

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:41.999 
the college itself because you should

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:49.030 
the college itself because you should
have<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.419> steady<00:02:42.719> 3d<00:02:43.079> workspace<00:02:47.569> there<00:02:48.569> we<00:02:48.719> go

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
have a steady 3d workspace there we go

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.659 
have a steady 3d workspace there we go
so<00:02:50.299> notice<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.569> opened<00:02:52.109> it<00:02:52.280> upside<00:02:53.280> down<00:02:53.310> on

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
so notice I opened it upside down on

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.869 
so notice I opened it upside down on
purpose<00:02:54.120> because<00:02:54.239> as<00:02:54.629> we<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:55.019> see<00:02:55.199> here<00:02:55.879> it's

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
purpose because as we can see here it's

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.050 
purpose because as we can see here it's
pretty<00:02:57.000> much<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:57.389> with<00:02:57.719> the<00:02:58.069> 670<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.310> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
pretty much like with the 670 and the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.839 
pretty much like with the 670 and the
760<00:03:00.750> it's<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.079> very<00:03:01.500> very<00:03:01.739> short<00:03:01.980> PCB<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:02.730> this

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
760 it's a very very short PCB so this

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.619 
760 it's a very very short PCB so this
is<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.209> 17<00:03:04.109> centimeter<00:03:04.560> ITX<00:03:04.980> spec<00:03:05.419> PCB<00:03:06.419> and

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
is just 17 centimeter ITX spec PCB and

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.110 
is just 17 centimeter ITX spec PCB and
then<00:03:07.260> there<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> lot<00:03:07.889> added<00:03:08.250> for<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.849> cooler

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
then there is a lot added for the cooler

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.030 
then there is a lot added for the cooler
so<00:03:09.750> if<00:03:09.930> you're<00:03:10.049> gonna<00:03:10.169> put<00:03:10.379> water<00:03:10.560> blocks<00:03:10.859> on

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
so if you're gonna put water blocks on

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.099 
so if you're gonna put water blocks on
this<00:03:11.189> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.489> make<00:03:11.699> this<00:03:11.819> card<00:03:12.120> ridiculously

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
this you can make this card ridiculously

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.640 
this you can make this card ridiculously
short<00:03:14.180> bit<00:03:15.180> crowded<00:03:15.510> on<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.199> back<00:03:16.409> here

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
short bit crowded on the back here

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.189 
short bit crowded on the back here
doesn't<00:03:16.979> look<00:03:17.009> too<00:03:17.220> nice<00:03:17.509> long<00:03:18.509> so<00:03:18.959> luring

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
doesn't look too nice long so luring

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.110 
doesn't look too nice long so luring
marks<00:03:19.500> sticking<00:03:19.799> out<00:03:19.949> don't<00:03:20.549> like<00:03:20.729> that

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
marks sticking out don't like that

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.689 
marks sticking out don't like that
but<00:03:21.409> it<00:03:22.409> is<00:03:22.560> one<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.919> cheaper<00:03:23.220> cards<00:03:23.459> but

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
but it is one of the cheaper cards but

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.119 
but it is one of the cheaper cards but
oh<00:03:23.879> my<00:03:24.060> god<00:03:24.269> this<00:03:24.419> looks<00:03:24.479> great<00:03:24.840> doesn't<00:03:25.019> it<00:03:25.290> so

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
oh my god this looks great doesn't it so

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.929 
oh my god this looks great doesn't it so
this<00:03:26.370> plastic<00:03:26.849> all<00:03:27.299> around<00:03:27.599> it's<00:03:27.780> all<00:03:27.900> plastic

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
this plastic all around it's all plastic

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.089 
this plastic all around it's all plastic
but<00:03:29.939> this<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.269> really<00:03:30.720> really<00:03:31.169> nice<00:03:31.470> it's

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
but this is a really really nice it's

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.490 
but this is a really really nice it's
texture<00:03:32.669> so<00:03:32.849> it's<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.299> real<00:03:33.479> treat<00:03:33.659> thing<00:03:34.079> and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
texture so it's a real treat thing and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.189 
texture so it's a real treat thing and
it<00:03:34.919> lets<00:03:35.579> this<00:03:35.699> ticket<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.329> actually<00:03:36.540> looks<00:03:37.019> as

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
it lets this ticket it actually looks as

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.869 
it lets this ticket it actually looks as
good<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.590> camera<00:03:37.889> as<00:03:38.159> it<00:03:38.280> does<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.519> real<00:03:38.669> life

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
good on camera as it does in real life

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.800 
good on camera as it does in real life
and<00:03:39.329> then<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.840> pellet<00:03:40.169> logo<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:41.370> just

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
and then the pellet logo is just

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.449 
and then the pellet logo is just
slightly<00:03:42.810> champagne<00:03:43.530> alright<00:03:43.949> guys<00:03:44.189> Apple

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
slightly champagne alright guys Apple

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.640 
slightly champagne alright guys Apple
would<00:03:44.609> call<00:03:44.819> it<00:03:45.000> instead<00:03:45.509> of<00:03:45.599> just<00:03:45.659> matte

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
would call it instead of just matte

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.339 
would call it instead of just matte
white<00:03:47.519> gold<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.269> champagne<00:03:48.840> color<00:03:49.079> and

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
white gold is so champagne color and

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.599 
white gold is so champagne color and
then<00:03:49.799> nice<00:03:50.009> and<00:03:50.220> shiny<00:03:51.739> letters<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.919> there<00:03:53.099> on

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
then nice and shiny letters on there on

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.849 
then nice and shiny letters on there on
this<00:03:53.970> side<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.299> pretty<00:03:54.359> ugly<00:03:54.719> though<00:03:55.019> so

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
this side it's pretty ugly though so

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.890 
this side it's pretty ugly though so
this<00:03:56.129> is<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> bit<00:03:56.909> you're<00:03:57.060> gonna<00:03:57.209> see<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.719> your

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
in your case I'd like to see that metal

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.949 
in your case I'd like to see that metal
bit<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.530> here<00:04:01.709> as<00:04:01.859> well<00:04:02.299> really<00:04:03.299> ugly<00:04:03.569> thing

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
bit on here as well really ugly thing

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.869 
bit on here as well really ugly thing
that<00:04:04.109> you<00:04:04.199> do<00:04:04.409> get<00:04:04.620> with<00:04:04.829> these<00:04:05.009> shorted<00:04:05.400> PCBs

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
that you do get with these shorted PCBs

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.199 
that you do get with these shorted PCBs
is<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.709> power<00:04:07.889> connectors<00:04:08.340> aren't

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
is that the the power connectors aren't

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.089 
is that the the power connectors aren't
on<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.539> end<00:04:09.719> of<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.989> card<00:04:10.229> which<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.829> really

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
on the end of the card which is really

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.099 
on the end of the card which is really
ugly<00:04:11.219> and<00:04:11.549> then<00:04:11.699> because<00:04:12.479> Nvidia<00:04:12.900> still

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
ugly and then because Nvidia still

and<00:05:59.009> everything<00:05:59.340> because<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.610> can't<00:05:59.940> compare

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
and everything because I can't compare

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.080 
and everything because I can't compare
to<00:06:00.449> too<00:06:00.569> many<00:06:00.779> things<00:06:01.430> but<00:06:02.430> it's<00:06:02.610> on<00:06:02.819> par<00:06:03.060> with

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
to too many things but it's on par with

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.990 
to too many things but it's on par with
in<00:06:03.330> r9<00:06:03.630> 290<00:06:04.229> I<00:06:04.259> know<00:06:04.469> that<00:06:04.830> that's<00:06:05.370> not<00:06:05.669> quite

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
in r9 290 I know that that's not quite

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.439 
in r9 290 I know that that's not quite
as<00:06:06.150> good<00:06:06.330> as<00:06:06.449> a<00:06:06.770> 290x

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
as good as a 290x

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.100 
as good as a 290x
it's<00:06:09.449> also<00:06:09.630> cheaper<00:06:10.590> so<00:06:10.830> yeah<00:06:11.479> so<00:06:12.479> I'm<00:06:12.870> going

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
it's also cheaper so yeah so I'm going

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.019 
it's also cheaper so yeah so I'm going
to<00:06:13.169> talk<00:06:13.469> about<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:13.830> cooler<00:06:14.039> now<00:06:14.310> it's<00:06:14.789> pretty

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
to talk about the cooler now it's pretty

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:18.140 
to talk about the cooler now it's pretty
quiet<00:06:15.270> it<00:06:15.630> doesn't<00:06:16.289> go<00:06:16.440> above<00:06:16.979> 78<00:06:17.729> degrees

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
quiet it doesn't go above 78 degrees

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.300 
quiet it doesn't go above 78 degrees
Celsius<00:06:18.630> like<00:06:18.840> ever<00:06:19.110> so<00:06:19.740> that's<00:06:19.889> pretty<00:06:20.130> good

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
Celsius like ever so that's pretty good

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.769 
Celsius like ever so that's pretty good
even<00:06:20.580> though<00:06:20.669> it's<00:06:20.789> really<00:06:21.150> really<00:06:21.539> holding

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:21.779 
even though it's really really holding

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:22.559 
even though it's really really holding
my<00:06:21.960> room<00:06:22.139> right

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
my room right

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.540 
my room right
because<00:06:22.899> of<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.169> lights<00:06:23.439> and<00:06:23.679> 2pcs

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
because of the lights and 2pcs

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.929 
because of the lights and 2pcs
benchmarking<00:06:25.179> at<00:06:25.330> the<00:06:25.419> same<00:06:25.629> time<00:06:25.869> well<00:06:26.939> yeah

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
benchmarking at the same time well yeah

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.209 
benchmarking at the same time well yeah
so<00:06:28.240> it<00:06:28.749> wasn't<00:06:29.080> go<00:06:29.199> over<00:06:29.529> 80<00:06:29.679> degrees<00:06:30.069> and

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219 
so it wasn't go over 80 degrees and

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:31.889 
so it wasn't go over 80 degrees and
that's<00:06:30.339> where<00:06:30.550> defense<00:06:30.939> never<00:06:31.360> going<00:06:31.689> above

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:31.899 
that's where defense never going above

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:34.829 
that's where defense never going above
50%<00:06:32.289> so<00:06:32.860> at<00:06:33.459> this<00:06:33.610> point<00:06:33.939> it's<00:06:34.209> pretty<00:06:34.479> quiet

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:34.839 
50% so at this point it's pretty quiet

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.839 
50% so at this point it's pretty quiet
but<00:06:34.929> then<00:06:35.199> when<00:06:35.379> you<00:06:35.439> do<00:06:35.589> wrap<00:06:35.800> them<00:06:36.009> up<00:06:36.159> it

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
but then when you do wrap them up it

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.510 
but then when you do wrap them up it
tends<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:37.389> get<00:06:37.599> a<00:06:37.659> bit<00:06:37.839> louder<00:06:38.080> but<00:06:38.979> that's<00:06:39.129> ok

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
tends to get a bit louder but that's ok

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.689 
tends to get a bit louder but that's ok
I<00:06:39.550> guess<00:06:40.289> because<00:06:41.289> it<00:06:41.589> is<00:06:41.709> a<00:06:41.740> single<00:06:42.099> fan<00:06:42.369> and

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
I guess because it is a single fan and

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.029 
I guess because it is a single fan and
now<00:06:43.389> as<00:06:43.599> I<00:06:43.719> showed<00:06:43.990> earlier<00:06:44.020> it<00:06:44.619> has<00:06:44.830> this

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
now as I showed earlier it has this

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.540 
now as I showed earlier it has this
completely<00:06:45.909> open<00:06:46.330> bum<00:06:46.839> slops<00:06:47.080> next<00:06:47.679> to<00:06:47.830> uh<00:06:47.860> if

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
completely open bum slops next to uh if

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.730 
completely open bum slops next to uh if
your<00:06:48.929> DVI<00:06:49.929> then<00:06:50.229> you<00:06:50.289> have<00:06:50.379> three

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
your DVI then you have three

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.589 
your DVI then you have three
normal-sized<00:06:51.580> display<00:06:51.999> ports<00:06:52.330> and<00:06:52.479> then<00:06:52.569> a

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
normal-sized display ports and then a

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.570 
normal-sized display ports and then a
mini<00:06:52.809> DisplayPort<00:06:53.229> really<00:06:53.770> wait<00:06:53.949> layout<00:06:54.429> so

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
mini DisplayPort really wait layout so

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.149 
mini DisplayPort really wait layout so
you<00:06:54.610> get<00:06:54.819> this<00:06:55.229> weird<00:06:56.229> adapter<00:06:56.649> that<00:06:56.800> I<00:06:56.830> showed

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159 
you get this weird adapter that I showed

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.040 
you get this weird adapter that I showed
to<00:06:57.369> go<00:06:57.490> from<00:06:57.759> a<00:06:57.879> and<00:06:58.149> mini<00:06:58.270> display<00:06:58.659> course<00:06:58.930> to

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
to go from a and mini display course to

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.199 
to go from a and mini display course to
an<00:06:59.169> HDMI

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:00.209 
an HDMI

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:02.579 
an HDMI
well<00:07:01.209> at<00:07:01.330> least<00:07:01.449> it<00:07:01.689> comes<00:07:01.869> with<00:07:02.139> us<00:07:02.319> and

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:02.589 
well at least it comes with us and

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.139 
well at least it comes with us and
that's<00:07:02.709> all<00:07:02.860> right<00:07:03.009> it's<00:07:03.279> a<00:07:03.339> very<00:07:03.369> wait<00:07:03.699> weird

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:04.149 
that's all right it's a very wait weird

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:06.629 
that's all right it's a very wait weird
layout<00:07:04.419> and<00:07:05.349> all<00:07:05.800> the<00:07:06.009> heat<00:07:06.159> comes<00:07:06.430> through

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
layout and all the heat comes through

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.399 
layout and all the heat comes through
the<00:07:06.759> single<00:07:07.180> slot<00:07:07.389> and<00:07:07.689> it<00:07:07.749> just<00:07:07.930> gets<00:07:08.110> really

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:08.409 
the single slot and it just gets really

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:10.499 
the single slot and it just gets really
really<00:07:08.680> hot<00:07:08.860> I<00:07:09.129> mean<00:07:09.159> I<00:07:09.430> can't<00:07:09.789> hold<00:07:10.059> my<00:07:10.240> hands

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:10.509 
really hot I mean I can't hold my hands

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:12.420 
really hot I mean I can't hold my hands
here<00:07:10.659> very<00:07:10.869> long<00:07:11.139> before<00:07:11.589> I<00:07:11.800> actually<00:07:11.949> starts

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 
here very long before I actually starts

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.899
