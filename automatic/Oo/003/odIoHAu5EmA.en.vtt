00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
is obviously a lot bigger so with the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.850 
is obviously a lot bigger so with the
way<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> mike<00:00:52.079> says<00:00:52.320> setup<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.710> could

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860

Adam really a lot just because it
doesn't<00:01:47.490> do<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> damage<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.689> want<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
doesn't do the damage you want it

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800 
doesn't do the damage you want it
doesn't<00:01:50.070> give<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> sustain<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.600> want

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
doesn't give you the sustain you want

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.999 
doesn't give you the sustain you want
like<00:01:51.990> you'll<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.530> bit<00:01:52.649> better<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> po

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
like you'll be a little bit better in po

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.310 
like you'll be a little bit better in po
course<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.909> actual<00:01:54.689> fighting<00:01:54.960> you'll<00:01:55.229> be

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
course but in actual fighting you'll be

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.609 
course but in actual fighting you'll be
super<00:01:55.500> weak<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.369> I'd<00:01:56.460> rather<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.880> gone

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
super weak so I'd rather have gone

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.380 
super weak so I'd rather have gone
Bourque<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> game<00:01:58.950> second<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
Bourque that game second because I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.179 
Bourque that game second because I
allowed<00:02:00.689> me<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> go<00:02:00.990> qss<00:02:01.500> third<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.920> needed

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
allowed me to go qss third if I needed

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.490 
allowed me to go qss third if I needed
it<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.729> ended<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.689> needing<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it which I ended up to do needing it and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
it which I ended up to do needing it and
I<00:02:04.560> could<00:02:04.710> go<00:02:04.799> IE<00:02:05.009> third<00:02:05.310> which<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.729> way<00:02:06.509> more

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
I could go IE third which is way more

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.169 
I could go IE third which is way more
damage<00:02:07.439> output<00:02:07.590> than<00:02:07.890> BTW<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.729> that's

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
damage output than BTW is so that's

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
damage output than BTW is so that's
something<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.509> took<00:02:09.569> away<00:02:09.720> from<00:02:09.780> those<00:02:09.989> games

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
something I took away from those games

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.830 
something I took away from those games
overall<00:02:12.069> my<00:02:12.099> performance<00:02:12.940> personally<00:02:13.390> past

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
overall my performance personally past

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.940 
overall my performance personally past
that<00:02:14.190> I'd<00:02:15.190> say<00:02:15.370> did<00:02:15.910> pretty<00:02:16.239> well<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:17.440> didn't

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
that I'd say did pretty well I didn't

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.150 
that I'd say did pretty well I didn't
really<00:02:17.980> make<00:02:18.220> any<00:02:18.280> huge<00:02:18.849> blenders<00:02:19.239> anything

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
really make any huge blenders anything

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.400 
really make any huge blenders anything
first<00:02:21.160> game<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.730> kind<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.810> over<00:02:23.110> really<00:02:23.380> early

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
first game is kind of over really early

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.170 
first game is kind of over really early
so<00:02:23.980> we<00:02:24.099> kind<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.459> went<00:02:24.640> for<00:02:24.819> kills<00:02:25.000> all

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
so we kind of just went for kills all

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.259 
so we kind of just went for kills all
over<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.390> place<00:02:25.590> second<00:02:26.590> game<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:27.489> felt<00:02:28.180> really

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
over the place second game I felt really

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.210 
over the place second game I felt really
starved<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.080> maybe<00:02:29.380> something<00:02:30.069> with

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
starved so maybe something with

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.759 
starved so maybe something with
rotations<00:02:30.670> where<00:02:30.940> was<00:02:31.269> screwed<00:02:31.540> up<00:02:31.769> something

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
rotations where was screwed up something

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.490 
rotations where was screwed up something
to<00:02:32.860> improve<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.190> it's<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.610> team<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.450> as<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.230> team

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
to improve on it's a team so as a team

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.050 
to improve on it's a team so as a team
we<00:02:35.830> didn't<00:02:36.040> play<00:02:36.160> too<00:02:36.220> well<00:02:36.370> obviously<00:02:36.880> we

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
we didn't play too well obviously we

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.240 
we didn't play too well obviously we
lost<00:02:37.239> two<00:02:37.390> games<00:02:37.769> we're<00:02:38.769> gonna<00:02:38.860> try<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.099> prove

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
lost two games we're gonna try to prove

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.670 
lost two games we're gonna try to prove
a<00:02:39.489> lot<00:02:39.760> make<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.540> better<00:02:40.660> all<00:02:41.260> right<00:02:41.380> good<00:02:41.650> luck
