00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
different today I'll be putting in ddr2

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
different today I'll be putting in ddr2
and<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.879> motherboard<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.360> special<00:00:54.690> because

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and this motherboard is special because

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
and this motherboard is special because
the<00:00:55.170> blue<00:00:55.350> ones<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.860> actually<00:00:55.949> ddr3<00:00:56.730> slots

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the blue ones are actually ddr3 slots

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.290 
the blue ones are actually ddr3 slots
the<00:00:57.539> yellow<00:00:57.719> ones<00:00:57.930> are<00:00:57.989> D<00:00:58.140> r2<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> today

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the yellow ones are D r2 and so today

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.720 
the yellow ones are D r2 and so today
I'll<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.420> using<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.840> yellow<00:01:00.960> ones<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730

closer
the<00:01:08.450> ddr3<00:01:09.450> ones<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.900> ddr2<00:01:10.200> ones<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.799> quite

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the ddr3 ones and ddr2 ones are quite

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.969 
the ddr3 ones and ddr2 ones are quite
different<00:01:11.510> they<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.409> notches<00:01:13.650> in

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
different they have the notches in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.600 
different they have the notches in
different<00:01:14.580> areas<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> cannot<00:01:17.070> put<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
different areas and so you cannot put a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.830 
different areas and so you cannot put a
ddr2<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.509> ddr3<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> other<00:01:19.680> slots<00:01:20.600> as<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
ddr2 or ddr3 in the other slots as you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.679 
ddr2 or ddr3 in the other slots as you
see<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.530> some<00:01:22.979> hooks<00:01:23.220> over<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.729> so

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
see here we have some hooks over here so

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
see here we have some hooks over here so
I<00:01:24.720> feel<00:01:24.900> glare<00:01:25.170> they're<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.670> white

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450

sure<00:02:01.500> you're<00:02:01.619> grounded<00:02:02.009> I'd<00:02:02.460> recommend<00:02:02.850> doing

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
sure you're grounded I'd recommend doing

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.319 
sure you're grounded I'd recommend doing
this<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> tile<00:02:03.780> floor<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.770> carpet<00:02:05.329> and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

you<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.600> grab<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.140> piece<00:02:07.259> around<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:08.000> you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you just grab your piece around as you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.570 
you just grab your piece around as you
can<00:02:09.030> see<00:02:09.330> mine<00:02:09.569> right<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.160> see<00:02:11.190> one

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.460 
it in the little notch right there and
then<00:02:26.010> once<00:02:26.189> you<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.459> have<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.730> set<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.000> there

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
then once you just have it set in there

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.880 
then once you just have it set in there
you<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:28.739> grab<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:29.430> press<00:02:30.120> down<00:02:30.890> one
