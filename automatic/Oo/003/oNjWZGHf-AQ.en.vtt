up<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.139> my<00:00:13.349> zombie<00:00:13.889> mode<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.460> take<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> covers

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
up in my zombie mode I take the covers

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.080 
up in my zombie mode I take the covers
off<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.230> walk<00:00:16.410> over<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> alarm<00:00:17.100> clock<00:00:17.340> i<00:00:17.640> hit

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090

off I walk over to the alarm clock i hit
snooze<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.779> then<00:00:18.960> get<00:00:19.109> right<00:00:19.230> back<00:00:19.289> into<00:00:19.650> bed

snooze and then get right back into bed

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.189 
snooze and then get right back into bed
so<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> needed<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.300> an<00:00:21.420> alarm<00:00:21.689> clock<00:00:21.869> to

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
so what I needed was an alarm clock to

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.080 
so what I needed was an alarm clock to
you<00:00:22.289> know<00:00:22.380> get<00:00:22.560> me<00:00:22.710> out<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> Walking<00:00:23.550> Dead<00:00:23.789> mode

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
you know get me out of Walking Dead mode

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.450 
you know get me out of Walking Dead mode
and<00:00:24.390> get<00:00:25.140> my<00:00:25.260> mind<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> right<00:00:25.890> spot<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and get my mind in the right spot to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.929 
and get my mind in the right spot to
wake<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.500> not<00:00:28.500> get<00:00:28.710> back<00:00:28.859> into<00:00:29.039> bed<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.550> get

wake up not get back into bed and get

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.540 
wake up not get back into bed and get
into<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> shower<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.230> decided<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.920> this

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
into the shower so I decided that this

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.819 
into the shower so I decided that this
would<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> best<00:00:33.090> way<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.620> mind

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
would be the best way to to get my mind

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.620 
would be the best way to to get my mind
working<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> morning<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.329> me<00:00:36.480> out

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
working in the morning and get me out

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.200 
working in the morning and get me out
but<00:00:37.440> unfortunately<00:00:37.640> it's<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.000> piece<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
but unfortunately it's a piece of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.700 
but unfortunately it's a piece of
garbage<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.870> I'll<00:00:40.230> explain<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.649> another

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
garbage and I'll explain in another

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
garbage and I'll explain in another
minute<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.280> two<00:00:41.489> let<00:00:41.969> me<00:00:42.030> take<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
minute or two let me take it out of the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:57.200 
minute or two let me take it out of the
box<00:00:42.660> here<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.640> kind<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.879> looks<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
box here so it kind of looks like a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
box here so it kind of looks like a
kid's<00:00:57.510> toy<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.109> right<00:00:58.199> now<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.559> set<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> go

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
kid's toy and right now it's set to go

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.569 
kid's toy and right now it's set to go
off<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> another<00:00:59.520> minutes<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.329> 340<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.579> you'll

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
off in another minutes at 340 and you'll

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.840 
off in another minutes at 340 and you'll
see<00:01:03.059> why<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:04.320> doesn't<00:01:04.979> work<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.400> well<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:05.790> at

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
see why it doesn't work so well or at

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
see why it doesn't work so well or at
least<00:01:05.970> not<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.299> advertised<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:07.740> advertise

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
least not as advertised they advertise

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
least not as advertised they advertise
it<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.540> must<00:01:09.810> put<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> pieces<00:01:10.409> back

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it so that you must put the pieces back

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
it so that you must put the pieces back
in<00:01:11.270> until<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:13.650> make<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> clock<00:01:14.100> stopped<00:01:14.430> as

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
in until to make the clock stopped as

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
in until to make the clock stopped as
you<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> alarm<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.650> stop<00:01:16.979> until

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you see the alarm will not stop until

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.450 
you see the alarm will not stop until
you<00:01:17.460> fix<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> puzzle<00:01:18.409> but<00:01:19.409> you'll<00:01:20.159> see

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you fix the puzzle but you'll see

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.630 
you fix the puzzle but you'll see
exactly<00:01:20.580> why<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.180> isn't<00:01:21.600> exactly<00:01:22.640> honest

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
exactly why that isn't exactly honest

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.780 
exactly why that isn't exactly honest
slogan<00:01:24.650> it<00:01:25.650> should<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.250> off<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.640> another

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
slogan it should be going off in another

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.499 
slogan it should be going off in another
minute<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:29.030> doesn't<00:01:30.030> plug<00:01:30.180> into<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> wall

minute or so doesn't plug into the wall
runs<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.229> batteries<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.920> actually<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
runs on batteries which is actually a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 
runs on batteries which is actually a
good<00:01:32.460> thing<00:01:32.520> because<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> annoys<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
good thing because if it annoys you and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
good thing because if it annoys you and
you<00:01:34.200> couldn't<00:01:34.470> figure<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:35.009> could<00:01:35.729> always

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you couldn't figure it out could always

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.039 
you couldn't figure it out could always
just<00:01:36.060> rip<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> wall<00:01:38.869> there's<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
just rip it out of the wall there's the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.560 
just rip it out of the wall there's the
alarm<00:01:40.490> not<00:01:41.490> very<00:01:41.729> loud

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
alarm not very loud

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.399 
alarm not very loud
there's<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.900> little<00:01:43.170> speak<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.650> bottom<00:01:45.409> but

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
there's a little speak on the bottom but

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.440 
there's a little speak on the bottom but
I<00:01:46.440> here's<00:01:46.950> why<00:01:47.190> just<00:01:47.790> picking<00:01:48.060> pieces<00:01:48.210> all

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I here's why just picking pieces all

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.620 
I here's why just picking pieces all
right<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> don't<00:01:49.110> fly<00:01:49.620> very<00:01:49.650> far

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
right because if you don't fly very far

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.120 
right because if you don't fly very far
and<00:01:51.630> where<00:01:52.229> you're<00:01:52.350> supposed<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.680> look<00:01:53.010> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and where you're supposed to look to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
and where you're supposed to look to
take<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.370> piece<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.170> right

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
take the piece here and put it right

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.740 
take the piece here and put it right
back<00:01:55.440> into<00:01:55.650> a<00:01:55.800> little<00:01:56.070> josh<00:01:56.280> gear<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.850> push

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
back into a little josh gear and push

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.120 
back into a little josh gear and push
down<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.650> see<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.100> actually

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
down and you can see that it actually

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.240 
down and you can see that it actually
pushes<00:01:59.580> down<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> button<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:02.040> biggest

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
pushes down the button but the biggest

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.980 
pushes down the button but the biggest
flaw<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:02.970> is<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.660> actually<00:02:03.840> just

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
flaw here is that you can actually just

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.969 
flaw here is that you can actually just
do<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.210> just<00:02:06.380> push<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> buttons<00:02:07.830> with

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
do this and just push the buttons with

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.669 
do this and just push the buttons with
your<00:02:08.160> hand<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:09.810> combined<00:02:10.350> with<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.649> fact

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
your hand that combined with the fact

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.830 
your hand that combined with the fact
that<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.130> pieces<00:02:11.459> don't<00:02:11.490> go<00:02:12.150> very<00:02:12.330> far<00:02:12.600> as<00:02:12.750> you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that the pieces don't go very far as you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.290 
that the pieces don't go very far as you
can<00:02:12.959> see<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.380> triangle<00:02:13.830> went<00:02:14.130> about<00:02:14.910> an<00:02:15.090> inch

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
can see this triangle went about an inch

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.140 
can see this triangle went about an inch
away<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.650> over<00:02:16.860> here<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:17.670> really

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
away and this over here it just really

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.760 
away and this over here it just really
isn't<00:02:18.360> an<00:02:18.570> effective<00:02:19.050> alarm<00:02:19.290> clock<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
isn't an effective alarm clock in the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.080 
isn't an effective alarm clock in the
morning<00:02:19.830> especially<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.940> get

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
morning especially when you get

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.940 
morning especially when you get
frustrated<00:02:21.330> with<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.590> just<00:02:22.620> click

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
frustrated with it you can just click

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.760 
frustrated with it you can just click
buttons<00:02:23.370> down<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:25.020> turns<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.530> alarm

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
buttons down and it turns out the alarm

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.949 
buttons down and it turns out the alarm
so<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.790> isn't<00:02:26.940> much<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.420> puzzle<00:02:27.630> long

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
so really it isn't much of a puzzle long

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.960 
so really it isn't much of a puzzle long
clock<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.739> an<00:02:28.830> alarm<00:02:29.070> clock<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.580> three

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
clock as it is an alarm clock with three

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.120 
clock as it is an alarm clock with three
off<00:02:30.180> buttons<00:02:33.170> ways<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.440> could<00:02:34.560> fix<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:34.980> is

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
off buttons ways that could fix it is

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.520 
off buttons ways that could fix it is
maybe<00:02:35.459> make<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.390> piece<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:36.989> magnet

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
maybe make the piece have like a magnet

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.680 
maybe make the piece have like a magnet
in<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.310> actually<00:02:38.430> sets<00:02:38.850> all<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> sensor

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
in it so it actually sets all the sensor

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
in it so it actually sets all the sensor
rather<00:02:40.440> than<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.769> just<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:41.040> big<00:02:41.220> button<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.610> can

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
rather than it just a big button you can

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.729 
rather than it just a big button you can
push<00:02:41.850> with<00:02:42.060> your<00:02:42.090> hands<00:02:42.570> or<00:02:42.750> instead<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.650> just

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
push with your hands or instead of just

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.500 
push with your hands or instead of just
a<00:02:43.860> giant<00:02:44.100> button<00:02:44.489> make<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> button<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.209> hole

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
a giant button make a button with a hole

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.449 
a giant button make a button with a hole
in<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.870> then<00:02:46.380> put<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.590> pin<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.100> bottom

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
in it and then put a pin on the bottom

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.620 
in it and then put a pin on the bottom
so<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.730> can't<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.180> push<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.510> with<00:02:48.600> your

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
so you can't just push it with your

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.660 
so you can't just push it with your
fingers<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.440> actually<00:02:49.670> take

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
fingers and you have to actually take

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.020 
fingers and you have to actually take
the<00:02:50.820> pin<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.450> click<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.260> down<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.910> way

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the pin and click it down but the way

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.789 
the pin and click it down but the way
that<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.360> designed<00:02:54.750> right<00:02:54.959> now<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.500> just

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
that is designed right now it's just

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.280 
that is designed right now it's just
completely<00:02:56.130> flawed<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.570> can<00:02:57.780> trigger<00:02:58.170> it

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
completely flawed and you can trigger it

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.770 
completely flawed and you can trigger it
with<00:02:58.470> your<00:02:58.590> fingers<00:02:59.239> not<00:03:00.239> very<00:03:00.540> good

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
with your fingers not very good

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.930 
with your fingers not very good
definitely<00:03:01.470> not<00:03:01.590> as<00:03:01.709> advertised<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.670> not

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
definitely not as advertised and not

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.110 
definitely not as advertised and not
something<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.660> would<00:03:03.810> purchase<00:03:04.290> again<00:03:05.120> it

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
something that I would purchase again it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.780 
something that I would purchase again it
lists<00:03:06.329> for<00:03:06.510> about<00:03:06.690> twenty<00:03:07.140> dollars<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:08.430> it

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
lists for about twenty dollars but it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.539 
lists for about twenty dollars but it
really<00:03:09.150> isn't<00:03:09.390> worth<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:10.019> just<00:03:10.950> because<00:03:11.280> it

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
really isn't worth to just because it

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.250 
really isn't worth to just because it
isn't<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:11.880> advertised<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.930> not<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.079> very

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
isn't as advertised and it's not a very

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.990 
isn't as advertised and it's not a very
good<00:03:13.380> long<00:03:13.769> clock<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.250> general<00:03:14.670> even<00:03:14.820> if

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
good long clock in general even if

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.490 
good long clock in general even if
you're<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.239> using<00:03:15.329> it<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.900> its<00:03:15.989> alarm<00:03:16.260> clock

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
you're just using it for its alarm clock

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.780 
you're just using it for its alarm clock
so<00:03:17.400> it's<00:03:18.120> definitely<00:03:18.600> pass<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.790> it's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
so it's definitely pass on this it's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.520 
so it's definitely pass on this it's
