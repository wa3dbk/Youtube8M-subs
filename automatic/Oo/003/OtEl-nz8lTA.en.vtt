00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
and how to connect these up well you can

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.400 
and how to connect these up well you can
now<00:00:25.730> see<00:00:25.970> that<00:00:26.000> they're<00:00:26.360> in<00:00:26.540> programmer<00:00:27.320> mode

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
now see that they're in programmer mode

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.440 
now see that they're in programmer mode
and<00:00:27.590> they're<00:00:27.710> both<00:00:27.860> doing<00:00:28.190> program<00:00:28.730> number<00:00:29.060> 11

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
and they're both doing program number 11

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.910 
and they're both doing program number 11
but<00:00:29.570> as<00:00:29.630> you<00:00:29.720> can<00:00:29.870> see<00:00:29.930> they're<00:00:30.620> both<00:00:30.740> out

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
but as you can see they're both out

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.560 
but as you can see they're both out
thing<00:00:31.190> so<00:00:31.640> it<00:00:31.730> doesn't<00:00:31.910> look<00:00:32.000> very<00:00:32.059> good<00:00:32.270> so

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
thing so it doesn't look very good so

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.440 
thing so it doesn't look very good so
what<00:00:32.719> we<00:00:32.809> can<00:00:32.960> do<00:00:33.110> is<00:00:33.500> use<00:00:33.770> DMX<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.879> master

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
what we can do is use DMX and master

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.920 
what we can do is use DMX and master
slave<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.899> fixtures<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:36.620> which<00:00:36.980> need<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.220> go

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
slave the fixtures so which need to go

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.970 
slave the fixtures so which need to go
plug<00:00:38.930> two<00:00:39.500> units<00:00:39.800> together<00:00:39.920> DMX<00:00:40.490> out<00:00:41.260> BMX<00:00:42.260> in

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.770 
in slave mode and now you can see that
both<00:00:52.190> fixtures<00:00:52.730> are<00:00:52.910> doing<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.300> same<00:00:53.480> thing

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
this is the most simple I feel if you

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.510 
this is the most simple I feel if you
want<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.729> do<00:01:40.850> color<00:01:41.060> mixing<00:01:41.469> we're<00:01:42.469> now<00:01:42.649> in<00:01:42.920> DMX

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
mode 2 which is 4 channel so we have a

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.589 
mode 2 which is 4 channel so we have a
look<00:01:46.549> here<00:01:46.759> it's<00:01:46.969> pretty<00:01:47.179> similar<00:01:47.359> to<00:01:47.450> the

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
look here it's pretty similar to the

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:50.769 
look here it's pretty similar to the
last<00:01:47.630> one<00:01:47.899> we've<00:01:48.469> got<00:01:48.740> our<00:01:49.009> red<00:01:49.310> or<00:01:49.700> green<00:01:50.509> and

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:50.779 
last one we've got our red or green and

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:53.289 
last one we've got our red or green and
our<00:01:51.170> blue<00:01:51.469> but<00:01:52.099> our<00:01:52.279> fourth<00:01:52.549> channel<00:01:52.849> is<00:01:53.119> now<00:01:53.270> a

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
our blue but our fourth channel is now a

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.800 
our blue but our fourth channel is now a

channel 10 is strobing so I put some up
here<00:02:38.930> let's<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.520> put<00:02:40.520> some<00:02:40.550> bars<00:02:40.970> on<00:02:44.830> and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
here let's just put some bars on and

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.880 
here let's just put some bars on and
channel<00:02:47.240> 10<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.810> strobing

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.940 

see<00:02:55.490> like<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.910> they<00:02:55.970> told<00:02:56.150> ten<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.950> that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
see like that and they told ten is that

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.809 
see like that and they told ten is that

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.750 
we're now in DMX mode 4 which is 2
channel<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:05.540> channel<00:03:05.870> 1<00:03:06.140> here<00:03:06.760> scrolls

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
channel so channel 1 here scrolls

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.050

through<00:03:08.030> different<00:03:08.630> macro<00:03:09.020> programs<00:03:09.880> as<00:03:10.880> you

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
through different macro programs as you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.699 
through different macro programs as you
can<00:03:11.209> see<00:03:11.420> now<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.959> scroll<00:03:12.320> through<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.590> then

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
can see now you scroll through and then

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.260 
can see now you scroll through and then
eventually<00:03:12.980> gets<00:03:13.310> into<00:03:13.400> chases<00:03:15.850> now<00:03:16.850> channel

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
eventually gets into chases now channel

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.320 
eventually gets into chases now channel
2<00:03:17.600> does<00:03:18.080> two<00:03:18.620> things<00:03:18.650> does<00:03:19.160> both<00:03:19.370> sound<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
2 does two things does both sound and

2 does two things does both sound and
speed<00:03:21.050> sensitivity<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.510> we're<00:03:23.630> going<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.840> do

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
speed sensitivity so we're going to do

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.680 
speed sensitivity so we're going to do
is<00:03:24.080> if<00:03:24.459> channel<00:03:25.459> 1<00:03:25.610> fader<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.209> between<00:03:26.569> the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.680 
values of 113 and 238 this fader here
controls<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.450> speed<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.420> can<00:03:35.540> now<00:03:35.660> see

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
controls the speed so you can now see

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.259 
controls the speed so you can now see
it's<00:03:35.959> fading<00:03:36.260> through<00:03:36.440> faster<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.000> stops

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
it's fading through faster and it stops

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.290 
it's fading through faster and it stops
if<00:03:38.420> we<00:03:38.510> bring<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.780> down<00:03:39.670> okay<00:03:40.670> if<00:03:40.820> channel<00:03:41.150> one

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
if we bring it down okay if channel one

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.979 
if we bring it down okay if channel one
fader<00:03:41.540> is<00:03:41.780> between<00:03:42.110> values<00:03:42.440> of<00:03:42.590> 239<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:44.780> put<00:03:44.900> it

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
fader is between values of 239 to put it

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.630 
fader is between values of 239 to put it
up<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:47.230> 255<00:03:48.230> we're<00:03:48.890> now<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.130> certain<00:03:49.400> active
