00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 when we at some time heard 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.429
 or went through a situation like this 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.519
 hey I met a girl as she's called 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.360
 Carla is there when she is 17 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.590

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.439
 chibola 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.830
 or also how it is fixed and it has 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.619
 your big little thing ah, he's 20 and he 's 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.720
 a youngster still lacks much 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.359
 live and meet many people in the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.239
 moment I judge others by the age that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.270
 they have true as saying today is a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.790
 chulazo hey he needs to mature listening already 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.760
 this file is still small or 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.090
 it's awful old man is an old nazo not 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 knows nothing etc etc would we rate and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 we judge people just because of their age 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.820
 this is an idea there is a way to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.460
 think that I have already since 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.350
 many years and I know that maybe or that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.770
 there are also people who share it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.680
 age does not make the person who does not do your 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.719
 intelligence does not make your maturity does not 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.460
 the way you see life because 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.170
 there are children 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.330
 years that are geniuses and adults of 40 or 35 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250
 they do not know how to add because there 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.590
 teenagers of 15 years who for 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.720
 circumstances of life are very much 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.750
 more mature than an adult of 30 or 40 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.690
 years that he always had easy life and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.509
 the whole hand that did not know what it is 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.700
 suffer to get ahead I know that the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.640
 age greatly influences life by 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.979
 school for work by the institute 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.740
 of university from oils in reality 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.170
 everything is here depends on how you are 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 the experiences and the experience is what 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.860
 It makes you big so next time 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
 that you judge or qualify is someone 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.770
 just because of your age, think about it because 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.869
 you never know the lives of others and something 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.420
 I always say age is only the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.420
 time you have on earth
