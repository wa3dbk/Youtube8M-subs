00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
wheel gun so that's pretty cool it could

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.240 
wheel gun so that's pretty cool it could
have<00:00:33.059> three<00:00:33.329> mo<00:00:33.780> per<00:00:33.960> clip<00:00:34.260> before<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.829> reload

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
enemy's head to get a one shot one kill

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.469 
enemy's head to get a one shot one kill
so<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.259> kind<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.619> how<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.299> ask

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
so that's kind of how to do if you ask

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.240 
so that's kind of how to do if you ask
me<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.700> that's<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:05.909> they<00:02:06.180> made<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.250> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
me but that's how they made it so the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.240 
me but that's how they made it so the
next<00:02:08.459> experiment<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.569> range<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.860> got

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
next experiment is the range so I got

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.200 
next experiment is the range so I got
one<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.489> my<00:02:11.580> friend<00:02:11.910> across<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> map<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
one of my friend across the map and

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.050 
one of my friend across the map and
I<00:02:13.240> went<00:02:13.510> across<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.990> map<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.800> see<00:02:15.010> if<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.820> cable

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
I went across the map to see if I cable

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.170 
I went across the map to see if I cable
to<00:02:16.600> like<00:02:16.780> actually<00:02:17.100> accurately<00:02:18.100> kill<00:02:18.550> him<00:02:18.790> so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
to like actually accurately kill him so

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.440 
to like actually accurately kill him so
I<00:02:19.540> shot<00:02:19.990> him<00:02:20.260> twice<00:02:20.710> and<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.550> actually<00:02:21.850> killed

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
I shot him twice and it actually killed

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.860 
I shot him twice and it actually killed
him<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.950> range<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.460> across<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.270> map<00:02:25.570> so

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
him so the range is across the map so

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.800 
him so the range is across the map so
it's<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.350> all<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:27.070> way<00:02:27.220> yes<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.600> range

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
it's like all the way yes so the range

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.380 
it's like all the way yes so the range
is<00:02:29.020> infinite<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:29.890> believe<00:02:30.280> for<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.820> sniper

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
is infinite I believe for the sniper

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.900 
is infinite I believe for the sniper
rifle<00:02:31.900> look<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.740> cap<00:02:32.980> across<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.490> map<00:02:33.670> and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
rifle look in the cap across the map and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.720 
rifle look in the cap across the map and
kill<00:02:34.060> an<00:02:34.150> enemy<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:35.230> I'm<00:02:35.560> sorry<00:02:36.100> guys<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:36.580> this
