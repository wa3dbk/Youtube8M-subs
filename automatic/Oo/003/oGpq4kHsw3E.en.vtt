away with the v6 we opted to wait a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.039 
away with the v6 we opted to wait a
little<00:01:53.340> while<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.790> get<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> 2-liter<00:01:54.570> turbo

little while to get the 2-liter turbo
which<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.130> happen<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> think<00:01:56.939> Jake<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
which I happen to think Jake is a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.990 
which I happen to think Jake is a
fantastic<00:01:58.049> engine<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:58.950> crazy<00:01:59.280> fantastic

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
fantastic engine it is crazy fantastic

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.030 
fantastic engine it is crazy fantastic
it's<00:02:00.149> way<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:00.810> it's<00:02:01.439> way<00:02:01.590> faster<00:02:01.770> than<00:02:01.950> you'd

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
expect for a Hyundai for sure and my

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.499 
expect for a Hyundai for sure and my
only<00:02:04.860> question<00:02:05.130> wasn't<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.670> car<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.030> who<00:02:06.210> is

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509

the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.870 
the
get<00:02:07.050> really<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:08.520> look<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:08.850> a

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
get really for because if you look for a

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.520 
get really for because if you look for a
good<00:02:09.300> gas<00:02:09.540> mileage<00:02:09.570> you'll<00:02:10.050> go<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.320> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
good gas mileage you'll go with the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.310 
good gas mileage you'll go with the
regular<00:02:11.040> four-cylinder<00:02:11.730> or<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.110> want

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
regular four-cylinder or if you want

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.750 
regular four-cylinder or if you want
more<00:02:13.470> probably<00:02:13.800> might<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.190> six<00:02:14.520> but

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
more probably might go with a six but

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.460 
more probably might go with a six but
for<00:02:15.120> us<00:02:15.240> enthusiasts<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.020> pedal<00:02:16.350> this
