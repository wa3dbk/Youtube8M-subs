00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.990
 ah 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.880
 wonderful world one is the last of 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.250
 platinum games and arrives exclusively for 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.960
 wii you a very Japanese title that 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.210
 turns the ideas of pikmin into a 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.220
 real- time action game we 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.779
 It presents a global threat to 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.369
 which can only plant each one 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.860
 little people with power attire 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.990
 rangers these heroes always attack in 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.579
 team and its powers are enhanced when 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.169
 pick up staff 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.239
 the group is handled as if it were a single 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.640
 you have a button to jump and 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.170
 another to hit the nuisance comes with 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.030
 the selection of weapons that forces you to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.699
 draw basic shapes on the screen 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.800
 of the wii command to then execute the 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.230
 order on that drawing and so get 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.629
 a fist a sword or a gun for 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.430
 example the main problem is that 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.890
 it is uncomfortable to have to depend on 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.420
 those drawings in real time there are areas in 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.039
 those that can be raised calmly 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.989
 but normally it assumes a true 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.089
 Annoyance because enemies do not stop 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.280
 attack and every time you make a 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.019
 draw the enemy takes advantage 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.940
 dismantle the paraeta what forces you 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.900
 to pick up again all those who 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.900
 they formed your platoon 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.850
 the other option is to create the shapes 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.380
 Basic with the right analog stick 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.680
 what I found just as uncomfortable 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.000
 Sincerely beyond the action there will be 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 areas where we have to create 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.570
 stairs or bridges using the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.450
 platoon in this case the analog stick 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.160
 if it helps because they are usually lines 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.680
 long straights much easier to 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.570
 trace little by little with the stick the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.810
 drawings on the screen do not work at all 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.810
 all right 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.210
 to this we add that the game does not explain 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.920
 many things there are situations that 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.630
 they understand like puzzles and they work 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.579
 well but in others it would not have cost 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.799
 nothing give a little guide to the player 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.079
 to avoid losing many minutes 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.000
 of his time some of these 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.409
 situations also change the game of 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.750
 your television commanding Wii 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.890
 closing the stage very much what 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.290
 causes the camera to become 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.730
 completely crazy and forces you to change 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.190
 of objects drawing with the stick 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.569
 right analog a cocktail that can 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.569
 with the nerves of the most patient 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.160
 if we look at the game together we see 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.930
 that the idea is good but the execution 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.880
 of mechanics more than taking advantage of 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.130
 characteristics of this console and its 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.470
 command gives the impression that he suffers 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.640
 trying to use them gives me the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.800
 impression that it would have been solved 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.480
 much better the game using one of 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.880
 the top buttons of the knob for 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.700
 change the platoon leader and so use 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.470
 a different weapon but the need for 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.370
 include intensive use of the screen 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.960
 of the command of wii 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.030
 in a real-time action game 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.320
 Under my point of view, great 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.320
 part of the game's grace 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.450
 you see that at the graphic level it is attractive 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.190
 it's the toy look on a board 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.440
 works very well it moves away completely 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.239
 of any realistic tone and it serves as 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.400
 perfect excuse to save a lot 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.140
 in textures and other constructions 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.440
 effects whose resolution is provided 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.440
 very much 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.570
 the people of platinum games make great 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.880
 action games and I recognize that action 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.740
 in wonderful one or one but the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.690
 frustration that generates control the 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.030
 lack of indications and the camera when 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.980
 the action happens to the command they can reach 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.090
 eclipse many of the good ideas of 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.090
 wonderful one or one
