network itself so the network itself is
set<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.420> pretty<00:01:15.630> simply<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> lot<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> people

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
set up pretty simply now a lot of people

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.830 
set up pretty simply now a lot of people
were<00:01:17.009> very<00:01:17.220> disappointed<00:01:17.729> including<00:01:18.689> myself

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
were very disappointed including myself

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.920 
were very disappointed including myself
when<00:01:19.350> Apple<00:01:19.710> changed<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.820> airport<00:01:21.240> setup<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
when Apple changed the airport setup and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870 
when Apple changed the airport setup and
the<00:01:22.530> reason<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.280> seem<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.790> have

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the reason is is they seem to have

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
the reason is is they seem to have
oversimplified<00:01:24.810> things<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.320> they<00:01:25.439> really

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
oversimplified things but they really

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.770 
oversimplified things but they really
haven't<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.340> take<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.090> time<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.540> used

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
haven't it's take some time to get used

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
haven't it's take some time to get used
to<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> does<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.130> things<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you used to have to do yourself so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.370 
you used to have to do yourself so

see you can set all these things and you
can<00:01:37.020> set<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.790> yourself<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.270> let<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> do

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
can set it up yourself or just let it do

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.749 
can set it up yourself or just let it do
it<00:01:39.840> itself<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.560> prefer<00:01:40.950> its<00:01:41.130> own<00:01:41.340> method

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
thing about Airport is the way they set

thing about Airport is the way they set
up<00:02:23.580> themselves<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.750> an<00:02:24.870> extension<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.650> my

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
up themselves this is an extension of my

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.880 
up themselves this is an extension of my
main<00:02:26.040> network<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.060> exact<00:02:27.450> same<00:02:27.480> thing

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
main network it's the exact same thing

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.410 
main network it's the exact same thing
gives<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.040> good<00:02:29.190> connection<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.940> tells<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.300> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
gives a good connection it tells you the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.870 
gives a good connection it tells you the
connection<00:02:30.810> strength<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.950> actually<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.700> is

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
connection strength it actually this is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.270 
connection strength it actually this is
a<00:02:32.910> switching<00:02:33.480> router<00:02:33.709> which<00:02:34.709> means<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.130> will

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
a switching router which means it will

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.420 
a switching router which means it will
support<00:02:35.640> B<00:02:35.910> G<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.209> n<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:37.680> all<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:38.040> those<00:02:38.160> bands

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
support B G and n but all of those bands

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.460 
support B G and n but all of those bands
simultaneously<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.660> what<00:02:39.840> what<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.260> means

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
simultaneously so what what that means

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.130 
simultaneously so what what that means
is<00:02:40.680> my<00:02:41.069> iPad<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.640> an<00:02:41.760> end<00:02:41.940> device<00:02:42.300> if<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.959> have<00:02:43.080> a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
is my iPad is an end device if I have a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.229 
is my iPad is an end device if I have a
G<00:02:43.350> device<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.950> won't<00:02:44.250> slow<00:02:44.610> down<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
G device it won't slow down like the

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.759 
G device it won't slow down like the
time<00:02:45.450> capsule<00:02:45.959> will<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> original<00:02:46.590> time

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
time capsule will the original time

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.890 
time capsule will the original time
capsule<00:02:47.220> was<00:02:47.310> not<00:02:47.580> dual<00:02:47.820> ban<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.780> would

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
capsule was not dual ban so it would

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.840 
capsule was not dual ban so it would
slow<00:02:49.200> down<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.709> slower<00:02:49.980> connection<00:02:50.610> and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
slow down to the slower connection and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.960 
slow down to the slower connection and
use<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.810> frequency<00:02:52.260> as<00:02:52.500> well<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.760> run

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
use that frequency as well so we run

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.690 
use that frequency as well so we run
into<00:02:54.090> some<00:02:54.330> issues<00:02:54.360> there<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:54.900> basically

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
into some issues there but basically

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.120 
into some issues there but basically
we've<00:02:56.700> extended<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.360> network<00:02:57.690> seamlessly<00:02:58.530> so

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
we've extended the network seamlessly so

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.650 
we've extended the network seamlessly so
what<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> wanted<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.000> show<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.269> how<00:03:00.450> that

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
what I wanted to do is show you how that

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.370 
what I wanted to do is show you how that
works

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
works

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.960 
works
what<00:03:01.620> I'll<00:03:01.709> do<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:01.890> I'll<00:03:02.130> reset<00:03:02.610> my<00:03:02.730> time

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
what I'll do is I'll reset my time

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
what I'll do is I'll reset my time
capsule<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.540> actually<00:03:03.810> won't<00:03:03.989> wipe<00:03:04.200> my<00:03:04.380> data

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
capsule it actually won't wipe my data

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.009 
capsule it actually won't wipe my data
but<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.920> will<00:03:05.069> reset<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.940> settings<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.690> we'll

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
but it will reset the settings and we'll

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.600 
but it will reset the settings and we'll
come<00:03:07.200> back<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.560> I'll<00:03:07.620> show<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.860> how<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.370> set

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
come back and I'll show you how that set

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.420 
come back and I'll show you how that set
up<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.880> how<00:03:09.030> simple<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:09.690> really<00:03:10.050> is<00:03:10.370> now<00:03:11.370> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
up and how simple this really is now you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.330 
up and how simple this really is now you
can<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.150> time<00:03:13.110> capsule<00:03:13.620> itself<00:03:13.890> has<00:03:14.130> gone

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
can see the time capsule itself has gone

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.420 
can see the time capsule itself has gone
away<00:03:14.519> kind<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.630> faded<00:03:16.260> out<00:03:16.380> there<00:03:16.620> let's<00:03:17.220> go

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
away kind of is faded out there let's go

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.819 
away kind of is faded out there let's go
back<00:03:17.610> home<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.420> what<00:03:19.200> we'll<00:03:19.320> do<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.560> we'll<00:03:19.680> go

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
back home and what we'll do is we'll go

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.699 
back home and what we'll do is we'll go
to<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.160> Wi-Fi<00:03:20.579> settings<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:22.200> will<00:03:22.380> find

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
to the Wi-Fi settings and it will find

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.890

you<00:04:03.359> will<00:04:03.600> lose<00:04:03.780> some<00:04:03.840> speed<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.590> turn<00:04:04.980> based

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
you will lose some speed in turn based

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.590 
you will lose some speed in turn based
on<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.609> but<00:04:05.730> it's<00:04:05.880> really<00:04:06.120> not<00:04:06.359> too

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
on that but it's really not too

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.090 
on that but it's really not too
noticeable<00:04:07.019> unless<00:04:07.200> you're<00:04:07.530> doing<00:04:07.890> really

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
noticeable unless you're doing really

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.849 
noticeable unless you're doing really
heavy-duty<00:04:08.549> file<00:04:09.060> transfer<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.380> case<00:04:10.680> I

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
heavy-duty file transfer in that case I

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.590 
heavy-duty file transfer in that case I
would<00:04:11.040> suggest<00:04:11.250> extending<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.209> with<00:04:12.450> an

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
would suggest extending it with an

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.810 
would suggest extending it with an
Ethernet<00:04:12.989> cable<00:04:13.140> but<00:04:13.920> for<00:04:14.190> my<00:04:14.280> purposes<00:04:14.760> I

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
Ethernet cable but for my purposes I

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.370 
Ethernet cable but for my purposes I
don't<00:04:15.120> need<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:15.690> what<00:04:15.840> I'm<00:04:15.930> going<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.200> do

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
don't need that so what I'm going to do

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.409 
don't need that so what I'm going to do
is<00:04:16.530> hit<00:04:16.739> next<00:04:17.220> over<00:04:17.669> here<00:04:17.850> we<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.060> go<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.209> other

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
is hit next over here we can go to other

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.930 
is hit next over here we can go to other
options<00:04:19.070> but<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.340> case<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.640> want<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.850> do

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
options but in this case I want to do

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.670 
options but in this case I want to do
next<00:04:21.150> I'm<00:04:21.659> gonna<00:04:21.840> keep<00:04:22.080> it<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.229> same<00:04:22.470> name

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
next I'm gonna keep it the same name

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.700 
next I'm gonna keep it the same name
next<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:24.330> what<00:04:24.599> it's<00:04:24.720> going<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.080> do<00:04:25.200> is<00:04:25.409> set<00:04:25.680> it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
next and what it's going to do is set it

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.860 
next and what it's going to do is set it
up<00:04:25.890> all<00:04:26.130> its<00:04:26.430> own

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.330 

now<00:04:30.870> if<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.110> was<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.410> get<00:04:31.530> another<00:04:31.800> Airport

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
now if I was to get another Airport

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.490 
now if I was to get another Airport
Express<00:04:32.580> another<00:04:33.330> time<00:04:33.600> capsule<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.230> could<00:04:34.410> do

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
Express another time capsule I could do

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980 
Express another time capsule I could do
the<00:04:34.590> exact<00:04:34.950> same<00:04:35.040> thing<00:04:35.490> or<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.850> could<00:04:36.690> create<00:04:36.840> a

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
the exact same thing or I could create a

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.570 
the exact same thing or I could create a
separate<00:04:37.380> Network<00:04:37.530> but<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.980> lot<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.400> time

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
separate Network but a lot of the time

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.040 
separate Network but a lot of the time
to<00:04:38.760> do<00:04:38.940> that<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.150> actually<00:04:39.270> have<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.810> give<00:04:39.960> it

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
to do that you actually have to give it

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.690 
to do that you actually have to give it
an<00:04:40.139> Ethernet<00:04:40.650> cable<00:04:41.010> for<00:04:41.040> an<00:04:41.370> internet

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
an Ethernet cable for an internet

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.090 
an Ethernet cable for an internet
connection<00:04:42.200> so<00:04:43.200> it's<00:04:43.350> waiting<00:04:43.650> for<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.889> time

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
connection so it's waiting for the time

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.800 
connection so it's waiting for the time
cap<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:44.550> what<00:04:44.700> it<00:04:44.790> does<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.210> updates<00:04:45.630> it

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
cap so what it does is it updates it

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.950 
cap so what it does is it updates it
restarts<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.530> with<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.400> settings<00:04:47.760> I<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:51.750> hear

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
restarts it with the settings I can hear

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.570 
restarts it with the settings I can hear
it<00:04:52.050> spinning<00:04:52.500> up<00:04:52.620> now<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:52.830> can<00:04:53.130> hear<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.370> hard

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
it spinning up now I can hear the hard

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.610 
it spinning up now I can hear the hard
drive<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.540> we'll<00:04:54.870> wait<00:04:54.990> for<00:04:55.169> it<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.320> come<00:04:55.440> back

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.010 
drive and we'll wait for it to come back
online<00:04:55.830> it's<00:04:56.340> come<00:04:56.580> back<00:04:56.730> up<00:04:56.880> online<00:04:57.060> I'll<00:04:57.840> hit

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
online it's come back up online I'll hit

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.010 
online it's come back up online I'll hit
done<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.500> now<00:04:59.430> what<00:04:59.730> I'll<00:04:59.820> do<00:05:00.030> is<00:05:00.660> I'll<00:05:00.870> go

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
done and now what I'll do is I'll go

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.770 
done and now what I'll do is I'll go
back<00:05:01.230> over<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.590> my<00:05:01.740> airport<00:05:02.220> utility<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:02.910> you

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
back over to my airport utility and you

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.690 
some people are a big fan of their
routers<00:05:27.660> but<00:05:27.979> they're<00:05:28.979> pretty<00:05:29.280> decent

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
routers but they're pretty decent

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.040 
routers but they're pretty decent
routers<00:05:30.030> if<00:05:30.180> you<00:05:30.270> look<00:05:30.479> up<00:05:30.630> some<00:05:30.810> information

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
routers if you look up some information
