00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.570
 Y 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.380
 the hair has by nature a 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.270
 certain shape can be stiff 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.310
 smooth 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.000
 curled wavy 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.080
 or curly this form can nonetheless 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.550
 be changed temporarily or permanently 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.550
 applying certain procedures 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.059
 we will discuss in this chapter the change 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.730
 Temporary shape of the hair by 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.200
 means of marking with curlers and rings their 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.200
 assembly and technique 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.950
 i 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.980
 let's see first because the hair is 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.960
 able to accept and maintain the form that 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.590
 the hairdresser prints him by means of 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.679
 marked 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.679
 i 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.610
 two 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.560
 although about its characteristics and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.409
 nature we treat thoroughly in the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.619
 chapter 3 remember some of his 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.549
 properties the hair is resistant to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.920
 heat although this softens the cuticle is 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.860
 resistant to traction and elastic 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 being able to resist without breaking a load 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.030
 between 40 to 150 grams depending on its type and 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.030
 state 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.850
 It is also hygroscopic because it absorbs 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.190
 humidity environment 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.590
 the cuticle is composed of plates 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.380
 colorless corneas involved as the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.200
 scales of a fish is the outside 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.540
 of the hair and the more resistant as 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.690
 worse is its more porous state becomes 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.730
 this 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.770
 the cortex constitutes the most 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.540
 voluminous and composed 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.730
 mainly by molecules of 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.250
 keratin forming long chains 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.130
 Helicals located longitudinally 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.400
 to the hair with links to each other called 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.300
 bridges 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.670
 there are destinies and hydrogen 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.560
 when wetting the hair it lengthens 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.690
 because the hydrogen bridges are 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.850
 break 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.250
 by means of heat it can be given 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.890
 then any way that is up 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.340
 that when moistening again it recovers its 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.340
 natural form 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.170
 the medulla or nucleus is the central part and 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.099
 is cylindrical sometimes there 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.099
 in the hair shaft 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.870
 to make a temporary marking with 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.360
 curls or rings we have great 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.930
 variety and sizes of curlers 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.930
 i 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.910
 i 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.910
 do not 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.390
 for the rings we only need tweezers 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.490
 and in some cases as help paper of 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.710
 permanent 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.900
 As a first step we have to check the 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.300
 moisture degree of the hair before 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.090
 proceed to the marking must not be 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.950
 too wet or too dry and not 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.600
 let's forget to condition it with the 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.600
 appropriate product in each case 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.700
 according to the style of hairstyle chosen 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.700
 we will choose the type and thickness of curl 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.250
 i 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.810
 The placement of the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.570
 first loop if we put it very parallel 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.180
 to the line in this case that is a hairstyle 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.889
 with a lateral line we would be left later 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.280
 look at the woman in front 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.650
 unsightly separation gaps 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.270
 Let us look closely at this example of 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.270
 what should not be done 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.230
 ah 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.309
 Y 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.309
 Y 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.619
 i 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.619
 i 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.050
 this is the correct way to place the 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:50.180
 first roller nor parallel to the line nor 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.260
 perpendicular to the same but 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.260
 slightly diagonally 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.610
 and the following in accordance with it 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.559
 this way we will not be left 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.710
 Difficulties or gaps in 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:03.710
 to correct 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.580
 no no 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.560

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.509
 i 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.940
 yes 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.050
