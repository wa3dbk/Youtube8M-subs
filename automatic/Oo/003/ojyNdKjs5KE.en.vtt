00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.230 
mean thought I'll see it in this game
that<00:02:15.810> impossible<00:02:16.700> maybe<00:02:17.700> when<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> saw

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240

something like that but I'm not going to
put<00:02:20.910> money<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.710> saw<00:02:22.980> when<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.250> hit

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400

the<00:02:23.490> wall<00:02:23.670> everything<00:02:24.150> kind<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.420> went<00:02:24.480> great

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the wall everything kind of went great

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.560 
the wall everything kind of went great
out<00:02:24.990> for<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> little<00:02:25.410> bit<00:02:25.620> yeah<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.300> then<00:02:27.480> the

out for a little bit yeah and then the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.540 
out for a little bit yeah and then the
second<00:02:27.900> thing<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.410> basically<00:02:29.160> what<00:02:29.400> we're

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
second thing is basically what we're

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.610 
second thing is basically what we're
pulling<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.910> driver<00:02:30.150> profile<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.500> you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.059 
everything got the side here is what
you're<00:03:43.480> probably<00:03:43.599> reflecting<00:03:44.170> everything<00:03:44.290> if

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
you're probably reflecting everything if

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.500 
you're probably reflecting everything if
you<00:03:45.220> move<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.459> right<00:03:45.640> hand<00:03:45.819> stick<00:03:46.060> around<00:03:46.299> you

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
you move the right hand stick around you

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.729 
you move the right hand stick around you
can<00:03:46.599> actually<00:03:46.690> look<00:03:46.930> around<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.319> cockpit

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
can actually look around the cockpit

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.130 
can actually look around the cockpit
itself<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.760> will<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.180> alternate<00:03:49.780> detail

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
itself so will this alternate detail

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.960 
itself so will this alternate detail
it's<00:03:50.440> very<00:03:50.590> very<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.579> noticed<00:03:51.849> you've

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
want to seem like really perform so what

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.800 
want to seem like really perform so what
we're<00:04:18.130> doing<00:04:18.160> with<00:04:18.430> stars<00:04:18.699> is<00:04:19.120> we're<00:04:19.570> saying

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
we're doing with stars is we're saying

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.080 
we're doing with stars is we're saying
the<00:04:20.109> idea<00:04:20.919> is<00:04:21.070> it's<00:04:21.250> not<00:04:21.459> just<00:04:21.700> about<00:04:21.789> winning

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
the idea is it's not just about winning

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.900 
the idea is it's not just about winning
it's<00:04:22.450> about<00:04:22.570> five<00:04:23.229> star<00:04:23.260> in<00:04:23.800> your<00:04:23.979> race<00:04:24.160> so<00:04:24.849> if

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
it's about five star in your race so if

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.029 
it's about five star in your race so if
you<00:04:24.970> imagine<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.389> kind<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.660> rock<00:04:25.870> band<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.530> idea

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
you imagine a kind of rock band of idea

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.159 
you imagine a kind of rock band of idea
that<00:04:27.880> everything<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.419> you<00:04:28.539> do<00:04:28.660> on<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.870> track

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
that everything that you do on the track

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.900 
that everything that you do on the track
which<00:04:29.590> is<00:04:29.620> related<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.220> driver<00:04:30.460> profile

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
which is related to the driver profile

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.180 
which is related to the driver profile
points<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.930> actually<00:04:32.229> learn<00:04:32.410> stars<00:04:32.710> for<00:04:32.979> and

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
points you actually learn stars for and

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.390 
points you actually learn stars for and
stars<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.700> think<00:04:33.849> they're<00:04:33.970> going<00:04:34.060> to

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
stars and I think they're going to

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.129 
stars and I think they're going to
career<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:35.240> you're<00:04:35.509> talking<00:04:35.720> about<00:04:35.960> those

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
career so you're talking about those

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.510 
career so you're talking about those
points<00:04:36.470> we're<00:04:36.590> getting<00:04:36.800> for<00:04:36.889> doing<00:04:37.100> specific

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
points we're getting for doing specific

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.219 
points we're getting for doing specific
things<00:04:37.759> like<00:04:38.060> drafting<00:04:38.449> or<00:04:38.720> skidding<00:04:39.080> and

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
things like drafting or skidding and

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.650 
things like drafting or skidding and
those<00:04:39.979> will<00:04:40.250> add<00:04:40.400> up<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.820> stars<00:04:41.090> eventually

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
those will add up to stars eventually

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.689 
those will add up to stars eventually
like<00:04:41.870> at<00:04:42.050> certain<00:04:42.410> points<00:04:42.770> okay<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.190> got<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.430> so

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
like at certain points okay I got you so

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:44.529 
like at certain points okay I got you so
if<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:43.910> look<00:04:44.030> on<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.240> left<00:04:44.270> hand<00:04:44.479> side

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
if you look on the left hand side

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.300 
if you look on the left hand side
there's<00:04:44.930> actually<00:04:45.169> a<00:04:45.199> star<00:04:45.470> threshold<00:04:46.070> for

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
there's actually a star threshold for

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.670 
there's actually a star threshold for
getting<00:04:46.669> 300<00:04:47.210> points<00:04:47.389> I'm<00:04:48.050> pretty<00:04:48.259> close<00:04:48.530> to

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
getting 300 points I'm pretty close to

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.610 
getting 300 points I'm pretty close to
that<00:04:48.830> so<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:49.870> supposed<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:50.960> other<00:04:51.139> games<00:04:51.380> where

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
that so I supposed to other games where

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.249 
that so I supposed to other games where
you<00:04:51.680> start<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:53.090> race<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.690> then<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.080> don't

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
you start the race and then you don't

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.450 
you start the race and then you don't
find<00:04:54.470> out<00:04:54.650> when<00:04:54.800> you're<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:54.979> winner<00:04:55.190> until

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
find out when you're a winner until

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.670 
find out when you're a winner until
three<00:04:55.850> months<00:04:55.880> later<00:04:56.300> now<00:04:57.020> you're<00:04:57.380> finding

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
three months later now you're finding

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.230 
three months later now you're finding
out<00:04:57.830> again<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:58.430> again<00:04:58.669> and<00:04:58.850> again<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.090> a
