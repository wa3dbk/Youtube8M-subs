00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello welcome today we are going to do some 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.709
 croissants I will explain the technique 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.490
 I use that I think the easier 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:23.490
 first what we need the cheese 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:25.640
 ham or turkey the chocolate and the yolk 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.640
 egg 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.720
 then a template that I have 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.510
 cut out of a plastic sheet and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.480
 predict the measures 11 x 17 11 from here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.300
 and 17 from here I with this measure that I 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.300
 I made short to make the croissants 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.250
 look how are you see the cuts true 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.750
 it's very simple we put our 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.100
 template that in this case mine is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.780
 as a plasticized type then there is no 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.199
 so much the problem of staining or making 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.969
 nothing and with a short pizzas 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.969
 I cut it out and 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.740
 and then it 's very simple what you take away 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.140
 you already have a thick but you have to do it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.979
 now let's start doing them I go 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.380
 to do today of ham and cheese and cheese 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.039
 chocolate is very simple we put 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.860
 our triangle like that and we're going to do 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.350
 for example one of ham and cheese 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.940
 You can start the streams or 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.500
 buy this that comes in taquitos 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.500
 as you prefer 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.909
 would gain a little ham 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.160
 and a little cheese in this case I've 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.160
 caught of mozzarella that I love 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.740
 and very carefully you are going to roll 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.750
 I do not know if you see it well 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.970
 sometimes they were on the sides but not 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.970
 nothing happens the times is a little 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.690
 the folds you give a little bit the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.370
 way sometimes you see it like this it seems that 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.240
 It is ugly but then looks nice on 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.300
 the oven is going to try you have to 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.280
 try a bit the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.800
 the filling especially what is more 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.800
 problems we are going to make a complaint 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.260
 I also think that they are the best 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.260
 is it so 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.040
 you can melt the chocolate of shopping 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.040
 of chocolate made as you wish 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.100
 and this we do the same 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.670
 There are times that there are people who make them a 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.670
 fold here behind a well cortecito 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.180
 so that they give a little yes but good I 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.040
 at the moment I have never done it but 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.079
 as you can see if you see that you have filled us 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.700
 so much if you do not do a fold 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.650
 cited 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.379
 more or less 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.060
 and once we have made them the 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.900
 We put baking paper in the tray 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.950
 of the oven and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.950
 we apply them 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.710
 with a skewer is here 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.990
 with a brush 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.900
 because if 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.990
 I usually make them savory applied 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.020
 the egg and the sweets applied them in 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:39.410
 instead of egg he applied a little bit of 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:41.840
 from there comes the word of jam or 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.090
 also honey 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.400
 once they are like this we put them in 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.320
 oven and after being collection some 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.180
 sesame seeds if you want me in this 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.580
 case I'm not going to fuck bayle I hope that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.140
 you liked it and now we will see the 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.670
 result in the oven and oven to 200 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.740
 degrees and once we see that they are already 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.740
 we toast them out 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.410
 we are going to put them here in a grid 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.890
 as we have done other times we use the 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.890
 of life 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.280
 I've given them a little bit of 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.030
 cheese on top so that it melts that 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.640
 that effect so crunchy because these are 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.260
 the cures ace and I've already seen that it's very 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.900
 simple the process the most important 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.040
 the same is that cuts of the triangle are worth 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.570
 I hope you like them and can fill 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.940
 what you want me to be or two 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.740
 examples but you can put what I do 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.480
 lack is worth it I hope that I have 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.410
 liked and until the next tutorial 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.410
 Thanks for seeing me
