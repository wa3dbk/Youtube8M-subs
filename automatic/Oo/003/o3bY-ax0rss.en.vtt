00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 yes and in berlin is us now 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 johan akerman joined the new one 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.730
 Federal chairman of the youth organization 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.529
 the spd the jusos a hearty 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.670
 Welcome to berlin women care 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.340
 the cdu we have just seen 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.869
 can in three hours by some 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.949
 It's still three weeks for them 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.240
 not over that does not have to be anything 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.890
 be bad but obviously 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.020
 There are completely in both parties 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 different feelings and me 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.129
 interpret them was the spd 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.629
 it looks more like a balancing act for 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.110
 the party as they describe it 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.610
 but sometimes the emotional situation the emotional state 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.980
 is actually very different depending 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.260
 after whom you ask I was a lot 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.129
 Naturally now with the jusos on the way 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.629
 the last weeks 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.039
 Of course the mood is very nice there 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.809
 critical, but I already have the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.210
 one or another regional conference 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.859
 witnessed there, the mood is more 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.440
 I would say positive 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.359
 and that means very different depending 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.880
 after whom do you ask yes if we ask the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.860
 so ask jusos then there are from 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.229
 a clear no to your side 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.210
 Coalition Agreement fits several things 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.280
 not improvements in the pension the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.259
 mean for the younger ones at the same time 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.880
 more stress also the education 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.680
 Improvements in education come 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 they have too little before them completely 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.520
 clearly no to the coalition agreement 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.680
 but at the same time, if they want to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.390
 a big coalition is involved 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.630
 that sounds a bit like one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.280
 contradiction that is not at all 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.780
 I do not want to contradict you yet 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.030
 clarify that the improvement for 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.740
 in it for the pension what is what we are 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.020
 jusos expressly welcome we have 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.759
 Other points of criticism we have as jusos 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.649
 also have campaigned to vote 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.210
 recruited by young people because we 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.890
 Improvements to the situation of young people 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.850
 people wanted that means we wanted 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.189
 the abolition of the unreasonable 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.750
 a student loan form and 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.060
 We wanted the right education and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.799
 there is a minimum training allowance 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 Unfortunately nothing in the coalition agreement 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.640
 our main criticisms are the jusos 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.770
 but also see or I personally see 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.729
 also that members vote as real 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.990
 good step the party towards one 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.849
 lively party to talk about 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.929
 that's why it goes without saying 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.370
 me depending on how this one 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.019
 membership decision 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.819
 of course I will continue in course 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.159
 bring in the party and also watch 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.930
 that the good points the spd ins 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.980
 government program has bargained 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.720
 or in the coalition agreement 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.519
 bargaining has been implemented 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.200
 as fast as possible and others too 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.030
 points that I have not missed so far 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.560
 us jusos are still missing 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.900
 473,000 are paid 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.730
 the spd has around 200,000 members 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.590
 have already voted yesterday 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.849
 for or against the coalition agreement the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.690
 you still have to find out that's one 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.540
 high number 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.799
 how do you interpret this interest? 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.920
 on the part of the members of this high 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.510
 Interest that shows that it definitely 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.980
 the right step was this 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.769
 members vote too 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.690
 I think the spd has not been around for a long time 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.700
 really so intense about content 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.680
 discussed and explained to 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.530
 everyone is talking to each other 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.780
 and that is a huge success and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.700
 that so many participate shows that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.190
 the right instrument was and that it 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.750
 arrives if so many could join 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.519
 one also presumes that there are many 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.709
 dissatisfied are the says that 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.489
 express experience at much participation 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.260
 often those who are against something are yes 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.079
 you will see I have no as I said 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.450
 I also have to wait like you 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.560
 what comes out on saturday then at the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.500
 mood is indeed very 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.480
 different as I said in the jusos 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.370
 Critical at many regional conferences 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.870
 I have a very positive mood too 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.900
 perceived it will show 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.870
 yes thank you very much for these first 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.400
 impressions of them as it were 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.260
 Federal President here in our in 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.720
 our daily talk to berlin 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.720
 Have a nice day 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.720
