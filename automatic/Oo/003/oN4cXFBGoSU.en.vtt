min<00:02:04.610> er<00:02:04.660> kind<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.750> magic<00:02:06.110> Wi-Fi<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:09.770> dual

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
min er kind of magic Wi-Fi is it dual

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.570 
min er kind of magic Wi-Fi is it dual
Wi-Fi<00:02:10.520> is<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.700> dual<00:02:10.910> band<00:02:11.120> Wi-Fi<00:02:11.300> 5<00:02:11.810> gigahertz

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
Wi-Fi is a dual band Wi-Fi 5 gigahertz

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.250 
Wi-Fi is a dual band Wi-Fi 5 gigahertz
multi<00:02:13.580> ball<00:02:13.700> out<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.660> we<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:16.060> increase<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
multi ball out so it we can increase the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.500 
multi ball out so it we can increase the
Wi-Fi<00:02:18.260> coverage<00:02:18.560> range<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:20.090> data

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
Wi-Fi coverage range and the data

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.270 
Wi-Fi coverage range and the data
transmission<00:02:21.230> efficiency<00:02:21.489> yeah<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:24.160> take<00:02:25.160> her

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
transmission efficiency yeah so take her

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.190 
transmission efficiency yeah so take her
for<00:02:25.549> quad<00:02:26.450> core<00:02:26.720> cortex<00:02:27.440> a15<00:02:28.239> how<00:02:29.239> much<00:02:29.450> how

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
for quad core cortex a15 how much how

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.780
