there is something else that Samsung was

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170 
there is something else that Samsung was
brilliant<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.579> made<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.000> guy

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
brilliant with when they made this guy

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
brilliant with when they made this guy
and<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.049> speakers<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.860> front-facing

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and that's the speakers the front-facing

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.440 
and that's the speakers the front-facing
speakers<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.820> huge<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
speakers these are huge I don't think I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
speakers these are huge I don't think I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
could go back to rear firing speakers on

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490 
could go back to rear firing speakers on
a<00:01:53.280> tablet<00:01:53.670> again<00:01:53.790> front-facing<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:55.200> makes

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
a tablet again front-facing just makes

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
a tablet again front-facing just makes
sense<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.219> every<00:01:56.549> use<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> tablet<00:01:57.329> I

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
sense for every use of a tablet I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.090 
sense for every use of a tablet I
wouldn't<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.079> surprised<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.560> more<00:01:58.770> phones

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
wouldn't be surprised to see more phones

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.709 
wouldn't be surprised to see more phones
to<00:01:59.280> take<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> style<00:01:59.969> now<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> HTC

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
to take on the style now that the HTC

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.690 
to take on the style now that the HTC
One<00:02:01.079> has<00:02:01.590> proved<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.159> makes<00:02:02.310> sense<00:02:02.520> for

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
One has proved that it makes sense for

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580 
One has proved that it makes sense for
smartphones<00:02:03.149> too<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> yes<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> speakers<00:02:04.380> are

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
smartphones too and yes the speakers are

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.889 
smartphones too and yes the speakers are
pretty<00:02:05.189> loud<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.460> clear<00:02:06.119> without<00:02:06.299> any<00:02:06.630> sort

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
pretty loud and clear without any sort

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.540 
pretty loud and clear without any sort
of<00:02:06.930> distortion<00:02:07.380> which<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.160> important

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
of distortion which is pretty important

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
of distortion which is pretty important
again<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:08.940> me<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.149> I'm<00:02:09.270> watching<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.660> movie<00:02:09.690> or

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
like that another thing about the design

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.059 
like that another thing about the design
though<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.269> material<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.319> back<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:17.010> is

though is the material on the back it is

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.009 
though is the material on the back it is
way<00:02:17.879> more<00:02:18.209> important<00:02:18.659> than<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.900> originally

think a lot of people don't talk about

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.850 
think a lot of people don't talk about
this<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.569> part<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.959> reason<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.409> iPad<00:02:22.830> or

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
this but part of the reason the iPad or

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.100 
this but part of the reason the iPad or
the<00:02:23.040> iPad<00:02:23.459> Mini<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.970> feel<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.390> awkward<00:02:24.659> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
the iPad Mini can feel so awkward to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.170 
the iPad Mini can feel so awkward to
hold<00:02:25.290> or<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.980> might<00:02:26.159> slip<00:02:26.459> while<00:02:26.640> holding<00:02:27.060> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
hold or you might slip while holding it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420 
hold or you might slip while holding it
is<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.750> they're<00:02:27.930> just<00:02:28.260> smooth<00:02:28.739> metal<00:02:29.129> plates

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430

grippy slash tacky on the back so you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.809 
grippy slash tacky on the back so you

natural<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.280> think<00:02:47.459> Google<00:02:47.609> learned<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.150> lot

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
natural I think Google learned a lot

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.110 
natural I think Google learned a lot
from<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:49.049> success<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.709> Nexus<00:02:50.069> 7<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.700> how

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
from the success of the Nexus 7 and how

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.470 
from the success of the Nexus 7 and how
well<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.599> is<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.709> hold<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.849> they<00:02:53.970> decided<00:02:54.359> to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
well it is to hold that they decided to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.750 
well it is to hold that they decided to
use<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:54.930> sort<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.260> back<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.980> back<00:02:56.160> welds

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
use this sort of back and the back welds

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.819 
use this sort of back and the back welds
on<00:02:56.910> really<00:02:57.420> nice<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.959> curves<00:02:58.200> around<00:02:58.409> to<00:02:58.739> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
design the hardware itself has held up

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.080

pretty well to regular constant use and

pretty well to regular constant use and
one<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.569> unique<00:03:12.750> points<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.260> actually

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
one of the unique points is actually
