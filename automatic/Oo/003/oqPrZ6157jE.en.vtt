00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
basically right in the glue how they

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.970 
basically right in the glue how they
going<00:02:13.340> cross-eyed<00:02:13.730> here

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
going cross-eyed here

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.740 
going cross-eyed here
so<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.610> want<00:02:15.909> to<00:02:15.970> make<00:02:16.000> sure<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.510> get<00:02:16.629> an

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
so you want to make sure that you get an

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.320 
so you want to make sure that you get an
F<00:02:16.959> on<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.530> honor<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:18.340> either<00:02:18.519> end<00:02:18.790> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
F on the to honor on either end the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.789 
F on the to honor on either end the
inner<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.690> outer<00:02:19.810> corners<00:02:20.290> because<00:02:20.500> those

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
inner and outer corners because those

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.670 
inner and outer corners because those
are<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> areas<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:22.030> are<00:02:22.299> harder<00:02:23.019> usually<00:02:23.440> to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
are the areas that are harder usually to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.289 
are the areas that are harder usually to
stick<00:02:24.519> on<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.040> just<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.370> real<00:02:30.760> pain<00:02:31.120> if

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
stick on so and it's just a real pain if

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.789 
stick on so and it's just a real pain if
you<00:02:31.360> don't<00:02:31.450> get<00:02:31.750> enough<00:02:31.959> glue<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.349> first<00:02:32.560> time

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
you don't get enough glue the first time

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.650 
you don't get enough glue the first time
and<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.459> hard<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.640> go<00:02:33.790> back<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:33.970> add<00:02:34.299> more

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
and it's hard to go back and add more

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.320 
and it's hard to go back and add more
and<00:02:34.870> stuff<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:36.069> once<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.370> have<00:02:36.610> glue<00:02:37.120> this

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
and stuff so so once you have glue this

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.699 
and stuff so so once you have glue this
is<00:02:37.480> probably<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.810> little<00:02:38.019> too<00:02:38.260> much<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.560> can

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
is probably a little too much you can

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.350 
is probably a little too much you can
use<00:02:38.860> less<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.489> I've<00:02:39.640> seen<00:02:39.819> people<00:02:39.970> I've

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
use less but I've seen people I've

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
use less but I've seen people I've
seemed<00:02:40.690> like<00:02:40.840> professional<00:02:41.620> makeup<00:02:41.890> artists

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
seemed like professional makeup artists

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.430 
seemed like professional makeup artists
use<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.519> ton<00:02:42.879> of<00:02:42.910> glue<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.780> think<00:02:44.170> it's<00:02:44.409> just

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
use a ton of glue so I think it's just

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.960 
use a ton of glue so I think it's just
kind<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.890> your<00:02:45.400> own<00:02:45.519> personal<00:02:46.060> preference<00:02:47.970> so

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
kind of your own personal preference so

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.400 
kind of your own personal preference so
yes<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.420> i'm<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.540> going<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.870> kind<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.230> let

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
yes and i'm just going to kind of let

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.729 
yes and i'm just going to kind of let
this<00:02:50.590> air<00:02:50.860> dry<00:02:51.129> of<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.430> for<00:02:51.790> probably<00:02:52.650> close<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
this air dry of it for probably close to

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.760 
this air dry of it for probably close to
30<00:02:54.129> seconds<00:02:54.609> but<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.940> may<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.329> go<00:02:55.569> more

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.010 

just<00:03:01.700> because<00:03:02.000> especially<00:03:02.510> if<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:02.840> have<00:03:02.870> a

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
just because especially if you have a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.080 
just because especially if you have a
thicker<00:03:03.230> line<00:03:03.350> obviously<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.880> want<00:03:05.030> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
thicker line obviously so you want to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.520 
thicker line obviously so you want to
make<00:03:05.120> sure<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.630> glue<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.960> not<00:03:06.260> like

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
make sure that the glue is not like

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.470 
make sure that the glue is not like
really<00:03:06.830> wet<00:03:07.100> anymore<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.670> needs<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:08.000> be<00:03:08.120> tacky

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
really wet anymore it needs to be tacky

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.660 
really wet anymore it needs to be tacky
but<00:03:08.870> not<00:03:09.110> dry<00:03:09.590> yet<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.070> I'm<00:03:10.160> just<00:03:10.310> going<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.520> let

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
but not dry yet so I'm just going to let

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.190 
but not dry yet so I'm just going to let
that<00:03:10.790> dry<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.300> then<00:03:11.390> come<00:03:11.570> back<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.750> show<00:03:12.140> you

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
that dry and then come back and show you

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.520 
that dry and then come back and show you
how<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.860> put<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.340> on<00:03:13.720> okay<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:14.780> once<00:03:15.110> it's

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
how to put it on okay so once it's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.890 
how to put it on okay so once it's
getting<00:03:16.190> dry<00:03:16.460> you<00:03:17.090> want<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.330> just<00:03:17.450> take<00:03:17.630> some

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
getting dry you want to just take some

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.940 
getting dry you want to just take some
tweezers<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:19.690> grab<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.960> lashes<00:03:21.470> pretty

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
tweezers and grab the lashes pretty

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.400 
tweezers and grab the lashes pretty
close<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.240> glue<00:03:23.510> line<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:24.020> not<00:03:24.140> too

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
close to the the glue line but not too

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.160 
close to the the glue line but not too
close<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:25.480> then<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:26.780> going<00:03:26.960> to<00:03:27.020> look

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
close and then you just going to look

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.310 
close and then you just going to look
straight<00:03:27.530> into<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.920> mirror<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.990> just<00:03:29.990> line

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
straight into the mirror and just line

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.930 
straight into the mirror and just line
it<00:03:30.350> up<00:03:30.560> where<00:03:30.800> you<00:03:30.920> want<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.460> put<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:31.730> right

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
it up where you want it and put it right

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.230 
it up where you want it and put it right
next<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> lashes<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.120> just

error basically I've been so brush it
with<00:04:04.310> these<00:04:04.610> in<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.000> in<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.300> past<00:04:05.870> but<00:04:06.170> mainly

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
with these in the in the past but mainly

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.680 
with these in the in the past but mainly
the<00:04:07.490> most<00:04:07.670> important<00:04:08.120> thing<00:04:08.240> is<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.420> the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
the most important thing is that the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.960 
the most important thing is that the
glue<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.260> not<00:04:09.740> too<00:04:10.040> wet<00:04:10.280> when<00:04:10.490> you<00:04:10.580> put<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.880> on

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
glue is not too wet when you put it on

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.960 
glue is not too wet when you put it on
so<00:04:11.420> if<00:04:12.080> you're<00:04:12.740> having<00:04:12.920> issues<00:04:13.250> with<00:04:13.580> them

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
so if you're having issues with them

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.790 
so if you're having issues with them
sticking<00:04:14.390> what<00:04:14.900> when<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.290> put<00:04:15.470> them<00:04:15.620> on

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
sticking what when you put them on

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.590 
sticking what when you put them on
that's<00:04:16.160> probably<00:04:16.670> because<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.180> blue<00:04:17.330> is<00:04:17.570> too

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
that's probably because the blue is too

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.030 
that's probably because the blue is too
wet

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.350

sometimes you can still see some of the
glue<00:04:36.390> even<00:04:36.990> though<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.110> should<00:04:37.410> dry<00:04:37.560> clear<00:04:37.950> so
