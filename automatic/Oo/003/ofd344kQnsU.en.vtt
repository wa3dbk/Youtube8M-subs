don't want it like even even if it does
then<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:07.100> way<00:06:08.020> it<00:06:09.020> doesn't<00:06:09.229> actually<00:06:09.440> die<00:06:09.860> it

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
then this way it doesn't actually die it

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.430 
then this way it doesn't actually die it
doesn't<00:06:10.070> actually<00:06:10.340> go<00:06:10.669> away<00:06:10.880> I<00:06:11.229> won't<00:06:12.229> really

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
doesn't actually go away I won't really

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.290 
doesn't actually go away I won't really
care<00:06:12.530> if<00:06:12.800> he<00:06:12.890> goes<00:06:13.400> either<00:06:13.610> way<00:06:13.850> like<00:06:14.120> if<00:06:14.240> he

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
care if he goes either way like if he

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.880 
care if he goes either way like if he
blocks<00:06:14.479> in<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:14.780> fine<00:06:15.020> if<00:06:15.229> he<00:06:15.350> lets<00:06:15.590> it<00:06:15.680> through

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
blocks in a fine if he lets it through

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.460 
blocks in a fine if he lets it through
them<00:06:16.039> it's<00:06:16.520> like<00:06:16.669> some<00:06:16.910> damage<00:06:17.270> so<00:06:17.539> I<00:06:18.020> don't

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
them it's like some damage so I don't

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.860 
them it's like some damage so I don't
mind<00:06:18.530> at<00:06:18.710> all

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
mind at all

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.540 
mind at all
and<00:06:19.960> hopefully<00:06:20.470> he<00:06:20.800> swings<00:06:21.100> in<00:06:21.250> with<00:06:21.400> his

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
and hopefully he swings in with his

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.040 
and hopefully he swings in with his
furnace<00:06:21.820> welp<00:06:22.030> and<00:06:22.150> doesn't<00:06:22.480> have<00:06:22.630> another

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
furnace welp and doesn't have another

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.720 
furnace welp and doesn't have another
dragon<00:06:23.560> to<00:06:23.650> back<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:23.950> up<00:06:24.010> next<00:06:24.310> turn<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:24.490> then

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
dragon to back it up next turn and then

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.580 
dragon to back it up next turn and then
I<00:06:24.790> could<00:06:25.000> just<00:06:25.180> sort<00:06:25.330> of<00:06:25.480> red<00:06:25.690> win<00:06:25.990> but<00:06:26.290> I<00:06:26.320> doubt

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
I could just sort of red win but I doubt

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.520 
I could just sort of red win but I doubt
he's<00:06:26.770> going<00:06:26.860> to<00:06:26.950> be<00:06:27.040> that<00:06:27.190> dumb<00:06:28.170> but<00:06:29.170> you<00:06:29.350> never

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
he's going to be that dumb but you never

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.860 
he's going to be that dumb but you never
know<00:06:29.710> if<00:06:30.580> he<00:06:30.700> does<00:06:30.880> swing<00:06:31.210> in<00:06:31.330> mixer<00:06:31.690> and<00:06:31.750> then

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
know if he does swing in mixer and then

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.180 
know if he does swing in mixer and then
he's<00:06:32.020> probably<00:06:32.050> just<00:06:32.590> gonna<00:06:32.710> pump<00:06:33.010> all<00:06:33.160> the

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
he's probably just gonna pump all the

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.860 
he's probably just gonna pump all the
way<00:06:33.400> ma<00:06:33.730> if<00:06:33.880> he<00:06:33.970> does<00:06:34.090> block<00:06:34.330> next<00:06:34.630> turn<00:06:34.720> he's

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
way ma if he does block next turn he's

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.860 
way ma if he does block next turn he's
probably<00:06:35.020> just<00:06:35.170> gonna<00:06:35.290> pump<00:06:35.560> all<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:35.710> way<00:06:35.920> and

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
probably just gonna pump all the way and

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.240 
probably just gonna pump all the way and
kill<00:06:37.870> my<00:06:38.080> dude<00:06:38.320> which<00:06:38.590> is<00:06:38.710> gonna<00:06:38.890> be<00:06:39.010> annoying

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
kill my dude which is gonna be annoying

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.090 
kill my dude which is gonna be annoying
but<00:06:39.580> I<00:06:40.090> don't<00:06:40.960> really<00:06:41.080> see<00:06:41.170> how<00:06:41.620> this<00:06:41.800> is<00:06:41.860> much

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
but I don't really see how this is much

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.120 
but I don't really see how this is much
of<00:06:42.250> a<00:06:42.310> decision<00:06:42.730> here<00:06:42.880> he<00:06:42.910> can't<00:06:43.360> swing<00:06:43.690> in

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
of a decision here he can't swing in

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.730 
of a decision here he can't swing in
