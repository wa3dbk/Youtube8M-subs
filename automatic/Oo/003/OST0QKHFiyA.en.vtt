00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.410 

I'm<00:00:25.140> starting<00:00:25.710> out<00:00:25.800> by<00:00:26.010> priming<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.730> eye<00:00:26.760> area

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
I'm starting out by priming the eye area

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900 
I'm starting out by priming the eye area
and<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:28.110> should<00:00:28.290> come<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.680> no<00:00:28.740> surprise<00:00:29.400> at

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
and this should come as no surprise at

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.630 
and this should come as no surprise at
this<00:00:30.090> stage<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.350> important<00:00:31.890> prime<00:00:32.250> prior

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this stage it's so important prime prior

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880 
this stage it's so important prime prior
to<00:00:32.820> eyeshadow<00:00:33.239> application<00:00:33.720> if<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.620> don't

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
to eyeshadow application if you don't

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
to eyeshadow application if you don't
have<00:00:35.160> an<00:00:35.310> eyeshadow<00:00:35.610> primer<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.420> use<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
have an eyeshadow primer just use a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
have an eyeshadow primer just use a
little<00:00:37.110> foundation<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.980> set<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.640> your

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
little foundation and set it with your

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.000 
little foundation and set it with your
face<00:00:39.000> powder<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.690> it'll<00:00:40.140> more<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.559> less<00:00:40.710> work

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
face powder and it'll more or less work

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.430 
face powder and it'll more or less work
the<00:00:41.160> same<00:00:41.400> way<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> primer<00:00:42.600> would<00:00:44.930> as<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.320> are

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the same way as a primer would as we are

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
the same way as a primer would as we are
working<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.949> color<00:00:47.280> today<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.000> am<00:00:48.239> taking<00:00:48.600> an

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
working with color today I am taking an

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.510 
working with color today I am taking an
extra<00:00:49.080> step<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.530> applying<00:00:50.220> a<00:00:50.370> white

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
extra step and applying a white

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.430 
extra step and applying a white
eyeshadow<00:00:50.910> base<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.720> really<00:00:52.050> make<00:00:52.230> those

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
eyeshadow base to really make those

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.310 
eyeshadow base to really make those
colors<00:00:52.920> pop<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.720> applying<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:54.930> pencil

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
colors pop I'm not applying the pencil

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.410 
colors pop I'm not applying the pencil
directly<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.280> eye<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.089> harder

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
directly to the eye because it's harder

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.719 
directly to the eye because it's harder
to<00:00:57.449> blend<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.900> way<00:00:58.199> I'm<00:00:58.500> rubbing<00:00:59.220> some<00:00:59.460> onto

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
to blend that way I'm rubbing some onto

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.820 
to blend that way I'm rubbing some onto
my<00:00:59.850> finger<00:01:00.239> first<00:01:00.479> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.409> warmth<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
my finger first and then the warmth of

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.040 
my finger first and then the warmth of
my<00:01:01.979> hands<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.519> make<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.879> pencil<00:01:03.360> a<00:01:03.540> little

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
my hands will make the pencil a little

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.080 
my hands will make the pencil a little
more<00:01:04.199> creamy<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.159> lot<00:01:05.370> more<00:01:05.610> easier<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
more creamy and a lot more easier to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.930 
more creamy and a lot more easier to
blend<00:01:06.330> out<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:10.830> prevent<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> base<00:01:11.640> from

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
blend out to prevent the base from

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.880 
blend out to prevent the base from
creasing<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.140> set<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.620> white

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
creasing I'm going to set it with white

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
creasing I'm going to set it with white
eyeshadow<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.420> applying<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.960> white

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
eyeshadow so I'm just applying the white

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.320 
eyeshadow so I'm just applying the white
sets<00:01:16.440> wash<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.920> color<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.490> over<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.940> lid<00:01:18.120> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
sets wash of color all over the lid and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
sets wash of color all over the lid and
up<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> brow<00:01:19.170> bone<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.950> will

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
up to the brow bone and this will

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.760 
up to the brow bone and this will
develop<00:01:20.370> as<00:01:20.820> our<00:01:21.299> brow<00:01:21.690> bone<00:01:21.930> highlight<00:01:24.770> next

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
develop as our brow bone highlight next

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.410 
develop as our brow bone highlight next
I'm<00:01:25.920> taking<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> shimmery<00:01:26.850> white<00:01:27.090> eyeshadow

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I'm taking a shimmery white eyeshadow

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.779 
I'm taking a shimmery white eyeshadow
and<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.380> using<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.189> highlight<00:01:29.430> around

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
and I'm using this to highlight around

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.060 
and I'm using this to highlight around
the<00:01:30.060> tear<00:01:30.299> duct<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.780> eye<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.890> gives

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the tear duct of my eye this just gives

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
the tear duct of my eye this just gives
a<00:01:32.189> nice<00:01:32.340> brightening<00:01:32.939> effect<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.570> helps<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
a nice brightening effect and helps to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.690 
a nice brightening effect and helps to
open<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> eyes

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
open up the eyes

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700 
open up the eyes
so<00:01:37.700> now<00:01:37.940> it's<00:01:38.090> time<00:01:38.180> for<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.630> color<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.470> first

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
so now it's time for the color the first

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.460 
so now it's time for the color the first
one<00:01:39.920> I'm<00:01:39.980> taking<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.670> yellow<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.510> you<00:01:42.140> want<00:01:42.320> to

one I'm taking is yellow and you want to

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.710 
one I'm taking is yellow and you want to
use<00:01:42.590> patting<00:01:43.100> motions<00:01:43.580> opposed<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.240> sweeping

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
use patting motions opposed to sweeping

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.110 
use patting motions opposed to sweeping
motions<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.440> apply<00:01:45.650> this<00:01:45.710> shadow<00:01:46.160> to<00:01:46.820> ensure

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
motions to apply this shadow to ensure

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.910 
motions to apply this shadow to ensure
that<00:01:47.150> you<00:01:47.390> get<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.570> nice<00:01:47.810> even<00:01:48.110> color<00:01:48.620> payoff

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that you get a nice even color payoff

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.550 
that you get a nice even color payoff
and<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.580> also<00:01:49.760> prevent<00:01:50.330> fallout<00:01:50.900> I<00:01:53.380> don't<00:01:54.380> like

and to also prevent fallout I don't like

that's it I'm then pulling the black up
into<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.250> crease<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:40.790> slightly<00:03:41.240> across<00:03:41.720> the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
into the crease and slightly across the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.110 
into the crease and slightly across the
outer<00:03:42.200> portion<00:03:42.740> of<00:03:42.860> my<00:03:42.950> eyelid<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.610> then

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
outer portion of my eyelid and then

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.420 
outer portion of my eyelid and then
after<00:03:44.780> pulling<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.260> shadow<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:45.980> areas

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
after pulling the shadow to the areas

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.850 
after pulling the shadow to the areas
that<00:03:46.490> I<00:03:46.670> want<00:03:46.850> I'm<00:03:47.180> tapping<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.200> until<00:03:48.650> it's

so<00:03:56.740> that's<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.130> for<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.460> eyelid<00:03:57.850> in<00:03:58.060> terms<00:03:58.330> of

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
so that's it for the eyelid in terms of

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.630 
so that's it for the eyelid in terms of
shadows<00:03:59.020> now<00:03:59.680> I'm<00:03:59.860> drawing<00:04:00.190> on<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.370> dramatic

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
winged liner and I'm not going to go

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.070

into<00:04:03.010> detail<00:04:03.550> on<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:04.120> as<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.600> have<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.750> full

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
into detail on this as I have a full

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:13.650 
into detail on this as I have a full
tutorial<00:04:05.260> which<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.400> leave<00:04:06.610> inked<00:04:07.000> below<00:04:12.660> so

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
tutorial which I leave inked below so

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.660 
tutorial which I leave inked below so
now<00:04:13.840> I'm<00:04:13.900> going<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.410> apply<00:04:14.770> some<00:04:14.800> false<00:04:15.520> lashes

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
now I'm going to apply some false lashes

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.880 
now I'm going to apply some false lashes
and<00:04:16.300> then<00:04:16.570> we<00:04:16.780> can<00:04:17.080> move<00:04:17.260> on<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.739> lower

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
and then we can move on to the lower

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.390 
and then we can move on to the lower
lash<00:04:18.220> line<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:19.530> firstly<00:04:20.530> I'm<00:04:20.770> taking<00:04:21.220> that
