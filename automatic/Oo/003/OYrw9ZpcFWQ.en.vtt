good<00:03:59.739> job<00:03:59.799> on<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.340> silver<00:04:00.760> color<00:04:01.000> on<00:04:01.150> this

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
good job on the silver color on this

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.210 
good job on the silver color on this
minifigure<00:04:01.989> because<00:04:02.260> he's<00:04:02.410> titanium<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.190> I

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
minifigure because he's titanium and I

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.849 
minifigure because he's titanium and I
think<00:04:03.430> that's<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.750> really<00:04:05.019> cool<00:04:05.230> titanium

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
think that's like a really cool titanium

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.740 
think that's like a really cool titanium
color<00:04:06.069> they<00:04:06.310> used<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.790> actually<00:04:07.030> make<00:04:07.299> this<00:04:07.480> a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
color they used to actually make this a

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.809 
color they used to actually make this a
really<00:04:08.440> detailed<00:04:08.769> figure<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.310> think<00:04:09.549> they<00:04:09.640> did

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
really detailed figure I think they did

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.099 
really detailed figure I think they did
a<00:04:09.879> great<00:04:10.090> job<00:04:10.120> with<00:04:10.390> that<00:04:10.569> so<00:04:10.810> I'll<00:04:10.870> set<00:04:11.079> him

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
a great job with that so I'll set him

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.020 
a great job with that so I'll set him
