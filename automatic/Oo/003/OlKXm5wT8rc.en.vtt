my actual keyboard so it's almost like

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
my actual keyboard so it's almost like
it<00:00:38.670> an<00:00:39.300> actual<00:00:39.629> piano<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:42.750> probably<00:00:43.140> know

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it an actual piano so you probably know

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
it an actual piano so you probably know
that<00:00:43.620> there<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:43.920> only<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.460> nine<00:00:44.640> slots

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
that there are only actually nine slots

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.130 
that there are only actually nine slots
in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.750> hotbar<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.289> minecraft<00:00:47.149> so<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
in the hotbar on minecraft so the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.720 
in the hotbar on minecraft so the
problem<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:50.039> an<00:00:50.219> actual<00:00:50.520> keyboard

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
problem there is on an actual keyboard

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.350 
problem there is on an actual keyboard
there<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.239> twelve<00:00:52.079> notes<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.770> octave<00:00:53.360> so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
there are twelve notes in an octave so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.650

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
five black and seven white so I had to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.240 
five black and seven white so I had to
change<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> little<00:00:58.170> bit<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.680> basically

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
change it a little bit here so basically

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.920 
change it a little bit here so basically
what<00:00:59.640> I've<00:00:59.699> done<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.149> I've<00:01:00.449> basically<00:01:00.600> made<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
what I've done is I've basically made a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.160 
what I've done is I've basically made a
little<00:01:01.170> toggle<00:01:01.320> thing<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.080> either

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
little toggle thing so you can either

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.570 
little toggle thing so you can either
have<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> white<00:01:04.619> key<00:01:04.799> sectors<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.430> black

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
have the white key sectors or the black

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.950 
have the white key sectors or the black
key<00:01:05.790> selected<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.479> press<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.750> little

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
key selected so if I press that little

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.600 
key selected so if I press that little
lamp<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> end<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> nine<00:01:08.010> slots<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.520> I

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
lamp on the end in the nine slots if I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.880 
lamp on the end in the nine slots if I
click<00:01:08.760> nine<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.020> switch<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
click nine it will switch it to the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
click nine it will switch it to the
Black<00:01:11.220> Keys<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> Black<00:01:12.570> Keys<00:01:12.780> are

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
Black Keys so now the Black Keys are

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.859 
Black Keys so now the Black Keys are
activated<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> Black<00:01:14.640> Keys<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.330> five

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
activated so the Black Keys are the five

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.719 
activated so the Black Keys are the five
in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> center<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.040> know<00:01:17.280> black<00:01:17.520> add

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
in the center so you know black add

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.550 
in the center so you know black add
black<00:01:17.970> plus<00:01:18.180> y<00:01:18.330> equals<00:01:18.689> gray<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.200> that's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
black plus y equals gray so that's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.960 
black plus y equals gray so that's
that's<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> logic<00:01:20.490> behind<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that's the logic behind that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.929 
that's the logic behind that
so<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.390> click<00:01:21.540> five<00:01:22.350> again<00:01:22.710> they<00:01:23.670> actually

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so if I click five again they actually

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
so if I click five again they actually
plays<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.299> flat<00:01:24.869> note<00:01:25.110> whereas<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.130> click

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
plays the a flat note whereas if I click

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
plays the a flat note whereas if I click
down<00:01:26.549> again<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.960> switch<00:01:28.080> back<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
down again but to switch back to the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.560 
down again but to switch back to the
whites<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.799> look<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> five<00:01:29.220> again<00:01:29.570> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
whites and look at a five again it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.700 
whites and look at a five again it
actually<00:01:30.869> I've<00:01:30.930> seen<00:01:31.140> they're<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> same

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
actually I've seen they're not the same

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.030 
actually I've seen they're not the same
note<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:34.079> why<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.200> had<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
note so that's why I had to do to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
note so that's why I had to do to
actually<00:01:35.400> make<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.549> quite<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> bit<00:01:36.450> basically

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
actually make it quite a bit basically

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.620 
actually make it quite a bit basically
making<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.070> convenient<00:01:38.460> boss<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:39.090> possible

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
making it convenient boss as possible

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.289 
making it convenient boss as possible
make<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> portable<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.710> er<00:01:40.740> yeah<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.240> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
make it portable so er yeah now this is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.010 
make it portable so er yeah now this is
actually<00:01:42.750> fairly<00:01:43.140> basic<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.420> uses<00:01:45.689> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
actually fairly basic so this uses is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.289 
actually fairly basic so this uses is
health<00:01:46.950> detectors<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
health detectors so if we look in the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.710 
health detectors so if we look in the
items<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.140> some<00:01:50.119> modifiers<00:01:51.119> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
items we actually have some modifiers so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510 
items we actually have some modifiers so
we've<00:01:51.810> got<00:01:51.960> plus<00:01:52.320> one<00:01:52.530> myself<00:01:52.890> plus<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.369> myself

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
we've got plus one myself plus do myself

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
eight max health so basically in

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.030 
eight max health so basically in
minecraft<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> by<00:02:00.810> default<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.710> Mac

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
minecraft to you by default can have Mac

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.999 
minecraft to you by default can have Mac
a<00:02:02.219> maximum<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.729> 20<00:02:03.119> health<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.350> these

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
a maximum of 20 health but these

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.510 
a maximum of 20 health but these
modifiers<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:06.000> actually<00:02:06.479> increase<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.520> so

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
modifiers can actually increase that so

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.280 
modifiers can actually increase that so
what<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.390> is

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
what this here is

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.410 
what this here is
detector<00:02:11.290> which<00:02:11.409> is<00:02:11.439> detecting<00:02:12.040> 421<00:02:12.670> so

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
detector which is detecting 421 so

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.750 
detector which is detecting 421 so
you'll<00:02:14.079> only<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.349> 12<00:02:14.650> 21<00:02:15.099> if<00:02:15.400> you're<00:02:15.519> holding

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
you'll only have 12 21 if you're holding

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.929 
you'll only have 12 21 if you're holding
this<00:02:16.060> item<00:02:16.469> okay<00:02:17.469> and<00:02:17.680> then<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.489> next<00:02:18.700> one<00:02:18.819> is

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
this item okay and then the next one is

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.080 
this item okay and then the next one is
testing<00:02:19.239> 422<00:02:19.810> all<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.680> way<00:02:20.769> up<00:02:20.859> to<00:02:20.920> 27<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:21.549> if<00:02:22.000> I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
testing 422 all the way up to 27 so if I

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.030 
testing 422 all the way up to 27 so if I
hold<00:02:22.269> these<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:23.349> notes<00:02:23.560> will<00:02:23.739> change<00:02:26.849> okay<00:02:27.849> so

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
hold these the notes will change okay so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.440 
hold these the notes will change okay so
over<00:02:30.040> here<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:30.549> have<00:02:30.579> another<00:02:30.909> one<00:02:31.239> which

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
over here we have another one which

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.979 
over here we have another one which
tests<00:02:31.900> for<00:02:32.109> 28<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:33.219> 28<00:02:33.939> is<00:02:34.120> basically<00:02:34.480> VLAN

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
tests for 28 and 28 is basically VLAN

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.259 
tests for 28 and 28 is basically VLAN
now<00:02:35.409> what<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.620> does<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.099> actually<00:02:36.269> flips

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
now what that does is it actually flips

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.459 
now what that does is it actually flips
the<00:02:37.719> white<00:02:38.379> keys<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:38.950> black<00:02:39.129> keys<00:02:40.439> so<00:02:41.439> they

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
the white keys to the black keys so they

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.629 
the white keys to the black keys so they
they<00:02:42.129> use<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.609> same<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.980> instance<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.489> one

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
they use the same for instance this one

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.750 
they use the same for instance this one
actually<00:02:45.939> uses<00:02:46.329> 22<00:02:46.930> like<00:02:47.319> this<00:02:47.859> one<00:02:48.099> uses<00:02:48.370> 22

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
actually uses 22 like this one uses 22

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.309 
actually uses 22 like this one uses 22
but<00:02:48.939> because<00:02:49.239> they<00:02:49.389> can't<00:02:49.419> be<00:02:49.720> activated<00:02:50.049> at

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
but because they can't be activated at

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.699 
but because they can't be activated at
the<00:02:50.379> same<00:02:50.560> time<00:02:50.769> they<00:02:51.569> they<00:02:52.569> work<00:02:52.750> they<00:02:53.560> work

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
the same time they they work they work

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.970 
the same time they they work they work
independently<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:55.359> it's<00:02:56.169> fairly<00:02:56.379> simple<00:02:56.620> I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
independently so it's fairly simple I

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.809 
independently so it's fairly simple I
think<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:57.879> really<00:02:58.090> really<00:02:58.299> cool<00:02:59.700> might<00:03:00.700> be

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
think it's really really cool might be

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.059 
think it's really really cool might be
useful<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.209> adventure<00:03:01.450> map<00:03:01.599> I<00:03:01.689> can't<00:03:01.870> see

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
useful in adventure map I can't see

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.500 
useful in adventure map I can't see
maybe<00:03:03.069> if<00:03:03.219> it<00:03:03.310> detects<00:03:03.609> something<00:03:04.030> maybe<00:03:04.150> but

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
maybe if it detects something maybe but

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.539 
maybe if it detects something maybe but
erm<00:03:04.750> yeah<00:03:05.260> very<00:03:05.409> cool<00:03:05.650> if<00:03:05.889> you<00:03:06.099> want<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.400> down

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
erm yeah very cool if you want to down

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.949 
erm yeah very cool if you want to down
with<00:03:06.669> the<00:03:06.730> map<00:03:06.849> I<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.299> put<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.659> link<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
with the map I will put a link in the

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.589 
with the map I will put a link in the
description<00:03:08.049> unless<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.739> forget<00:03:09.120> yeah<00:03:10.150> hope
