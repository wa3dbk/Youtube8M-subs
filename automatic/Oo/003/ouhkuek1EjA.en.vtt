workload in this episode and she has
just<00:02:16.459> been<00:02:16.580> bringing<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.810> much<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.319> table

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
and I think it's going to be exciting

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:36.210 
and I think it's going to be exciting
for<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.750> audience<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.319> see

a<00:02:42.430> lot<00:02:43.060> of<00:02:43.150> times<00:02:43.360> when<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:43.659> sing<00:02:44.370> especially

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
a lot of times when we sing especially

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.460 
a lot of times when we sing especially
if<00:02:45.459> we're<00:02:45.670> writers<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.569> know<00:02:46.599> we're<00:02:47.170> writing

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
if we're writers you know we're writing

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.979 
if we're writers you know we're writing
from<00:02:47.650> life<00:02:47.860> experience<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.780> life

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
from life experience and that life

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:59.030 
from life experience and that life
experience<00:02:50.379> translates<00:02:51.190> into<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.970> music

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.100 

you<00:02:59.819> see<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.090> through<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.299> music<00:03:00.480> videos<00:03:00.810> you

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
you see it through the music videos you

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.080 
you see it through the music videos you
see<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.379> through<00:03:01.620> when<00:03:02.280> we're<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.519> stage<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
see it through when we're on stage and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.179 
see it through when we're on stage and
we're<00:03:03.180> conveying<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.900> message<00:03:04.109> through<00:03:04.829> melody

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
we're conveying a message through melody

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.080 
we're conveying a message through melody
and<00:03:05.430> lyrics<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.959> translates<00:03:07.560> into

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and lyrics and that translates into

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.020 
and lyrics and that translates into
acting<00:03:09.090> I'm<00:03:09.870> not<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.409> like<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.890> know

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.309 
acting I'm not really like that you know

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
it's just easier people think I'm a

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.979 
it's just easier people think I'm a
bitch<00:03:13.700> but<00:03:14.700> be<00:03:14.819> careful<00:03:15.299> because<00:03:15.329> if<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.689> keep

bitch but be careful because if you keep

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.259
