00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.300
 so we'll see here how light and 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.309
 matter interact what will we 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.139
 to explain the spectra of 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.530
 emission lines and spectra of 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.630
 absorption lines so the light can 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.910
 be considered a transport of 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.040
 corpuscles are corpuscles 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.650
 call the photons so we're going 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.290
 consider a radiation 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.930
 electromagnetic monochromatic which 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.719
 is therefore characterized by a 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.649
 lambda wavelength which is expressed in 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:44.260
 master and also by its frequency that 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:47.269
 we note mu and which is expressed in hertz 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.999
 so every photon that make up that 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.760
 monochromatic radiation is going 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:55.100
 carry a quantity of energy that 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 calls a quantum of energy that one 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:05.330
 can calculate as follows 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:07.340
 of state is equal to h1ni whose cash is 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.080
 a constant called the constant 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.490
 of planck that you do not have to know 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.899
 by heart and that will be given to you 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.759
 every time and mute time the frequency 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.100
 of radiation so they have 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.049
 monochromatic which is expressed in hertz 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.840
 we have the relationship 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:30.289
 mu is equal to it's sure lamba so moved the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.539
 frequency in hertz here is the celerity 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:37.369
 light in the disturbing emptiness 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:39.170
 meters per second and lambda which is in 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.149
 put a relationship that we can 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.189
 find easily by analyzing the 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.930
 units since they are meters away from 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.770
 second on meters so his federation 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.539
 second - 1 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.600
 which is homogeneous at a frequency 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.450
 which is expressed here in hertz and so we 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.299
 can say that this quantum of energy that 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.770
 is carried by every photon is 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.920
 equal to h 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.369
 it's on mandate so that's really 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.950
 a formula that you have to know by heart 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.739
 and we will see how 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.959
 use it in the interaction between the 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.730
 light and matter so in fact we're going 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.560
 talk about quantification of energy 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.360
 since the photon can not 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.849
 carry any values ​​of 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.099
 energy but a determined value of 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.280
 the energy is going to be the same thing at 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:27.640
 level of the material so at the level of 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.620
 matter the energy and quantify 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.200
 that is, energy can not 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.420
 take all the values ​​but can 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.400
 take that certain values ​​that are 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.830
 represented here on a diagram 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.620
 of energy where energy is commonly 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.510
 expressed in electrons volt is not in 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.940
 joules so we will give you the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.040
 electronvolts conversion joule and 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.950
 will be sufficient to convert to this 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.760
 moment there so the energy level the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:06.130
 lower than can have the toon it is 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:09.010
 will call it the ground state the 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.859
 energy levels that are greater than 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:20.109
 the the energy of the ground state are 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:22.120
 called excited states and we're going 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.639
 so use these energy diagrams 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.950
 to explain the interaction between the 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.959
 light and matter so we'll see 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.269
 now how does light and the 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.400
 matter interact through the 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.889
 light emission phenomena and the 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.350
 light absorption phenomena so 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.660
 we will have light emission when a 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.430
 atom is in a state of energy 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.700
 superior so he is in a state 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.739
 excited and he's going to lose that energy 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.859
 to go into a state of energy 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.620
 lower that can be another state 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.450
 excited but of lower energy or 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.230
 the state of the fundamental level 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.530
 so we will represent this loss 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.840
 of energy by an arrow down and 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:11.950
 when the tome is going to lose that energy 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:14.680
 he will issue 1 foot have two lengths 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.700
 well-defined wavelength to determine 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.820
 this wavelength 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.870
 just use the formula delta e 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.960
 is equal to hc on the honda so the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.099
 wavelength of the emitted photon is equal 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:34.360
 to buy on delta e is here the 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:41.200
 variation of energy is equal to 1 st 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:43.330
 least had one so super less had a crazy 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.240
 so the energy of the higher level - 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.010
 the energy of the lower level then a 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.349
 remark on some dogmas diagram 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.380
 of energy we will give you the energies 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.580
 with negative numbers and on 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.110
 others you will find energies 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.210
 with positive signals 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.770
 so we must not be destabilized 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.750
 anyway what matters is the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.340
 difference of energy so this is have 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.370
 been positively or negatively 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.539
 it will come back exactly the same then 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.090
 now we will see the case of 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.370
 light absorption so that when 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.500
 an atom will absorb light that will 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.289
 gain energy so this time 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.710
 he will go from a state of energy 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.770
 lower a state of higher energy 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.260
 and so he will go from that state to 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.669
 this state there absorbing this time 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.039
 a photon to know the wavelength 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.860
 of the photon that will be absorbed we will 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.990
 use exactly the same formula so 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:44.039
 the wavelength of the absorbed photo will be 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:47.830
 equals hc ahc among on received less than 1 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:50.020
 so it's the same formula but both 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.700
 phenomena are different and it takes 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.409
 to be able when one has a diagram 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.599
 energy 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:57.479
 already calculate the wavelength of the 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.129
 emitted photons or photon absorb and he 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.869
 must be able to recognize if we 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.819
 is in the case of an emission so 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:05.279
 down arrow energy loss or 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.779
 of an absorption upward arrow and 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.779
 energy gain from the atom
