00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
blasts are right deck you break anything

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
blasts are right deck you break anything
that<00:01:16.320> lets<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.700> discard<00:01:17.700> during<00:01:17.880> your

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that lets you discard during your

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.219 
that lets you discard during your
opponent's<00:01:18.150> turn<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.600> way<00:01:18.720> when<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.020> becomes

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
opponent's turn that way when it becomes

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.600 
opponent's turn that way when it becomes
your<00:01:19.439> draw<00:01:19.619> face<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:20.040> drawing<00:01:20.280> into<00:01:20.490> that

pretty<00:02:39.920> nice<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.340> in<00:02:40.850> addition<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.570> when

he is destroyed in battle or sent to the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.610 
he is destroyed in battle or sent to the
graveyard<00:02:44.570> by<00:02:44.660> your<00:02:44.780> opponent's<00:02:45.140> card<00:02:45.290> Effect

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
then draw a new card so if you draw a

then draw a new card so if you draw a
new<00:04:04.670> card<00:04:04.700> it's<00:04:05.360> just<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.630> just<00:04:05.840> draw<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:06.050> card

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.560 
new card it's just you just draw a card
so<00:04:06.590> on<00:04:06.890> that<00:04:07.190> is<00:04:07.250> pretty<00:04:07.550> pretty<00:04:07.970> awesome<00:04:08.390> and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
so on that is pretty pretty awesome and

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.850 
so on that is pretty pretty awesome and
I<00:04:08.600> think<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.080> could<00:04:09.110> be<00:04:09.470> pretty

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
I think that that could be pretty

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.090 
I think that that could be pretty
awesome<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.820> use<00:04:11.090> in<00:04:11.930> addition<00:04:12.350> with<00:04:12.560> dragon

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
awesome to use in addition with dragon

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.680 
awesome to use in addition with dragon
because<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.550> can<00:04:13.700> just<00:04:13.730> bet<00:04:14.000> all<00:04:14.180> dragging

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
because you can just bet all dragging

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.780 
because you can just bet all dragging
I'll<00:04:15.350> get<00:04:15.470> rid<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.680> dragon<00:04:16.070> then<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.340> can<00:04:16.489> talk

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
I'll get rid of dragon then you can talk

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.280 
I'll get rid of dragon then you can talk
back<00:04:17.000> whatever<00:04:17.330> you<00:04:17.540> want<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.780> talk<00:04:17.930> back<00:04:18.109> for

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
back whatever you want to talk back for

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.840 
back whatever you want to talk back for
next<00:04:18.410> term<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.070> think<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.489> is<00:04:19.580> kind<00:04:19.700> of

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
next term so I think that is kind of

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.440 
next term so I think that is kind of
nice

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
nice

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.090 
nice
but<00:04:21.450> yeah<00:04:22.200> what<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.380> don't<00:04:22.560> like<00:04:22.650> with<00:04:22.830> him<00:04:22.950> is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
but yeah what I don't like with him is

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.400 
but yeah what I don't like with him is
it<00:04:23.250> does<00:04:23.430> require<00:04:23.610> three<00:04:24.210> different<00:04:24.780> ones<00:04:24.960> to

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
it does require three different ones to

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.230 
it does require three different ones to
be<00:04:25.530> much<00:04:25.770> easier<00:04:26.040> for<00:04:26.280> players<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.790> just<00:04:27.060> bring

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
be much easier for players to just bring

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.820 
be much easier for players to just bring
them<00:04:27.390> out<00:04:27.510> over<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.560> over<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.040> obviously<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
them out over and over and obviously the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.500 
them out over and over and obviously the
new<00:04:31.830> fusion<00:04:32.550> card<00:04:32.760> over<00:04:33.000> here<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.150> think<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.360> said

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
new fusion card over here I think I said

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.060 
new fusion card over here I think I said
ritual<00:04:33.780> before<00:04:33.900> whatever<00:04:34.290> you<00:04:34.680> guys<00:04:34.770> get<00:04:34.950> the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
ritual before whatever you guys get the

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.510 
ritual before whatever you guys get the
idea<00:04:35.100> anyways<00:04:35.880> so<00:04:36.240> this<00:04:36.930> card<00:04:37.140> over<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.520> it's

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
idea anyways so this card over here it's

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.010 
idea anyways so this card over here it's
nice<00:04:38.730> that<00:04:38.760> give<00:04:39.060> us<00:04:39.150> an<00:04:39.210> additional<00:04:39.450> effect

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
nice that give us an additional effect

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.510 
nice that give us an additional effect
but<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.290> don't<00:04:40.500> know<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.800> feel<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.220> it's<00:04:41.430> a

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
but I don't know I feel like it's a

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.640 
but I don't know I feel like it's a
hefty<00:04:41.850> hefty<00:04:42.090> investment<00:04:42.390> I<00:04:42.780> think<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.440> new

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
hefty hefty investment I think the new

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.380 
hefty hefty investment I think the new
bar<00:04:43.920> bar<00:04:44.130> might<00:04:44.490> be<00:04:44.610> just<00:04:44.790> like<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:44.910> tech<00:04:45.150> card

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
bar bar might be just like a tech card

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.970 
bar bar might be just like a tech card
plus<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.690> just<00:04:45.870> have<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.020> decent<00:04:46.200> attack<00:04:46.560> the

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
plus you just have a decent attack the

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.820 
plus you just have a decent attack the
dragon<00:04:47.160> can<00:04:47.490> be<00:04:47.580> an<00:04:47.640> okay<00:04:47.910> card<00:04:48.150> too<00:04:48.390> but<00:04:49.170> let

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
players they were really mixed people

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.220 
players they were really mixed people
like<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.580> absolutely<00:05:03.390> garbage<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:03.960> wouldn't

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
like this absolutely garbage I wouldn't

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.870 
like this absolutely garbage I wouldn't
play<00:05:04.410> any<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.860> these<00:05:04.950> in<00:05:05.100> my<00:05:05.160> burning<00:05:05.370> abyss<00:05:05.640> I

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
play any of these in my burning abyss I

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.760 
play any of these in my burning abyss I
would<00:05:06.210> maybe<00:05:06.390> play<00:05:06.690> one<00:05:06.930> dragging<00:05:07.410> or<00:05:07.560> maybe

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
would maybe play one dragging or maybe

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.310 
would maybe play one dragging or maybe
play<00:05:08.040> one<00:05:08.310> bar<00:05:08.550> bar<00:05:08.790> but<00:05:09.360> overall<00:05:09.990> for<00:05:10.200> me<00:05:10.230> I

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
play one bar bar but overall for me I

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.680 
play one bar bar but overall for me I
think<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.680> is<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.860> hefty<00:05:11.250> investment<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.970> as

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
think this is a hefty investment and as

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.600 
think this is a hefty investment and as
you<00:05:12.840> guys<00:05:12.990> know<00:05:13.020> they<00:05:13.440> didn't<00:05:13.680> top<00:05:13.890> at<00:05:14.130> all<00:05:14.370> at

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
you guys know they didn't top at all at

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.970 
you guys know they didn't top at all at
the<00:05:14.700> last<00:05:14.940> YCS<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:15.720> is<00:05:15.840> zero<00:05:16.200> burning<00:05:16.650> abyss<00:05:16.740> in

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
the last YCS so is zero burning abyss in

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.370 
the last YCS so is zero burning abyss in
the<00:05:17.040> top<00:05:17.250> 32<00:05:17.790> so<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.390> might<00:05:18.540> just<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:19.290> know

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
the top 32 so that might just you know

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.690 
the top 32 so that might just you know
say<00:05:19.560> something<00:05:19.950> for<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.160> deck<00:05:20.310> maybe<00:05:20.490> it's

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
say something for the deck maybe it's

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.610 
say something for the deck maybe it's
over<00:05:20.970> they<00:05:21.360> also<00:05:21.570> mention<00:05:22.140> this<00:05:22.260> which<00:05:22.530> i

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
over they also mention this which i

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.320 
over they also mention this which i
think<00:05:22.680> is<00:05:22.890> kind<00:05:23.130> of<00:05:23.220> important<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.180> says

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
think is kind of important and it says

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.330 
think is kind of important and it says
and<00:05:24.540> that<00:05:24.750> we<00:05:24.960> have<00:05:24.990> reached<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.560> end<00:05:25.620> of<00:05:26.130> the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
and that we have reached the end of the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.400 
and that we have reached the end of the
burning<00:05:26.550> abyss<00:05:26.910> so<00:05:27.420> when<00:05:28.020> I<00:05:28.050> read<00:05:28.290> the<00:05:28.380> article

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
burning abyss so when I read the article

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.900 
burning abyss so when I read the article
I<00:05:28.770> thought<00:05:28.950> that<00:05:29.130> meant<00:05:29.310> okay<00:05:29.550> that's<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.880> end

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
I thought that meant okay that's the end

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.190 
I thought that meant okay that's the end
of<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> burning<00:05:30.330> abyss<00:05:30.540> for<00:05:30.750> this<00:05:30.960> specific

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
of the burning abyss for this specific

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.930

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
about here let me know some people

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.210 
about here let me know some people
thought<00:05:54.780> that<00:05:54.840> this<00:05:55.080> was<00:05:55.260> a<00:05:55.470> mention<00:05:56.010> that

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
thought that this was a mention that

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.700 
thought that this was a mention that
this<00:05:56.430> is<00:05:56.670> end<00:05:57.510> of<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:57.900> burning<00:05:58.110> abyss<00:05:58.290> as<00:05:58.530> in

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
this is end of the burning abyss as in

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.070 
this is end of the burning abyss as in
there's<00:05:59.100> no<00:05:59.490> more<00:05:59.760> burning<00:06:00.060> abyss<00:06:00.450> monsters

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
there's no more burning abyss monsters

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.780 
there's no more burning abyss monsters
and<00:06:01.290> they're<00:06:02.100> not<00:06:02.220> going<00:06:02.280> to<00:06:02.400> release<00:06:02.580> any

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
and they're not going to release any

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.220 
and they're not going to release any
more<00:06:02.880> support<00:06:03.450> for<00:06:03.660> the<00:06:03.810> burning<00:06:04.080> abyss

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
more support for the burning abyss

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.960 
more support for the burning abyss
because<00:06:04.470> if<00:06:04.590> this<00:06:05.100> is<00:06:05.250> it<00:06:05.370> for<00:06:05.520> burning<00:06:05.760> abyss

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
because if this is it for burning abyss

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.970 
because if this is it for burning abyss
I<00:06:06.210> don't<00:06:06.900> think<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.170> they're<00:06:07.620> going<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:07.830> be<00:06:07.950> a

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
I don't think that they're going to be a

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.040 
I don't think that they're going to be a
deck<00:06:08.460> that's<00:06:08.490> going<00:06:08.820> to<00:06:08.880> survive<00:06:09.210> very<00:06:09.870> long

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
deck that's going to survive very long

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.140 
deck that's going to survive very long
especially<00:06:10.860> with<00:06:11.100> ignites<00:06:11.490> and<00:06:11.670> all<00:06:11.790> these

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
especially with ignites and all these

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.600 
especially with ignites and all these
others<00:06:12.480> Effra<00:06:13.140> coming<00:06:13.440> out<00:06:13.560> of<00:06:13.590> thinking<00:06:13.980> but

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
others Effra coming out of thinking but

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.750 
others Effra coming out of thinking but
i<00:06:15.470> was<00:06:16.470> looking<00:06:16.710> at<00:06:16.770> this<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.100> a<00:06:17.190> lot<00:06:17.700> of

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
i was looking at this and a lot of

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.280 
i was looking at this and a lot of
people<00:06:17.850> were<00:06:18.090> also<00:06:18.270> saying<00:06:18.540> that<00:06:18.660> Dante<00:06:19.140> is

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
people were also saying that Dante is

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.990 
people were also saying that Dante is
getting<00:06:19.560> reprinted<00:06:19.890> because<00:06:20.100> this<00:06:20.310> and<00:06:20.520> also

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
getting reprinted because this and also

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.020 
getting reprinted because this and also
I<00:06:21.180> felt<00:06:21.600> like<00:06:21.660> it<00:06:21.810> was<00:06:21.900> kind<00:06:22.260> of<00:06:22.320> just<00:06:22.440> randomly

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
I felt like it was kind of just randomly

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.370 
I felt like it was kind of just randomly
nice<00:06:24.030> to<00:06:24.210> mention<00:06:24.480> that<00:06:24.540> there<00:06:24.720> are<00:06:24.900> more<00:06:25.230> than

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
nice to mention that there are more than

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.020 
nice to mention that there are more than
there's<00:06:26.160> more<00:06:26.310> than<00:06:26.460> one<00:06:26.580> book<00:06:26.820> apparently

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030
