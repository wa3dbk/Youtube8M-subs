00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
how that is just a bend it's not really

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.120 
how that is just a bend it's not really
a<00:02:16.640> curl<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:18.319> then<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.680> kind<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:18.920> pull<00:02:19.099> it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
a curl and then you can kind of pull it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.089 
a curl and then you can kind of pull it
out<00:02:19.420> love<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.720> that's<00:02:21.019> everybody's<00:02:21.920> like

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
so just to kind of recap how this updo

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.830 
so just to kind of recap how this updo
came<00:03:00.160> together<00:03:00.310> we<00:03:00.640> divided<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.300> in<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.569> front

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
came together we divided it in the front

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.229 
came together we divided it in the front
so<00:03:02.200> literally<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.950> section<00:03:03.670> from<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.910> top<00:03:03.940> of

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
so literally a section from the top of

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.059 
so literally a section from the top of
the<00:03:04.300> ear<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.870> top<00:03:05.050> of<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.260> head<00:03:05.410> did<00:03:05.980> a

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
the ear to the top of the head did a

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.280 
the ear to the top of the head did a
little<00:03:06.280> French<00:03:06.520> twist<00:03:06.760> action<00:03:07.150> flipped<00:03:08.110> it

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
little French twist action flipped it

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.620 
little French twist action flipped it
over<00:03:08.489> tucked<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.910> pinned<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.450> little

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
over tucked it and pinned it a little

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.380 
over tucked it and pinned it a little
bit<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.140> then<00:03:11.530> we<00:03:11.709> brought<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.489> sides<00:03:12.760> so

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
bit and then we brought in the sides so

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.240 
bit and then we brought in the sides so
that<00:03:13.420> we<00:03:13.630> created<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.170> little<00:03:14.470> form<00:03:14.830> here

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
that we created this little form here

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.150 
that we created this little form here
looks<00:03:15.850> really<00:03:16.270> pretty<00:03:16.480> really<00:03:16.870> soft<00:03:17.200> on<00:03:17.680> her

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
looks really pretty really soft on her

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.770 
looks really pretty really soft on her
face<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.670> think<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.120> perfect<00:03:19.600> for<00:03:19.630> a

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
face I think this is perfect for a

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.080 
face I think this is perfect for a
