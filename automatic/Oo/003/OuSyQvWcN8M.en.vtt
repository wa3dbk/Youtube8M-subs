in<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.580> daily<00:01:23.729> life<00:01:23.880> you're

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
in it and then in your daily life you're

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.219 
in it and then in your daily life you're
catching<00:01:24.540> things<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
catching things that you know this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.570 
catching things that you know this
before<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> seen<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.310> touched

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
before because you seen it you touched

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.240 
before because you seen it you touched
it<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.150> more<00:01:27.479> real<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.619> this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
it it's more real to you so I think this

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.490 
it it's more real to you so I think this
was<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> car

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
was the car

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.670 
was the car
right<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.730> this<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:32.240> some<00:01:32.540> are<00:01:32.690> great<00:01:33.230> they

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
right and this is some are great they

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.070 
right and this is some are great they
learn<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.250> grapple<00:01:34.730> with<00:01:34.760> ideas<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.840> data

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
learn to grapple with ideas the data

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.690 
learn to grapple with ideas the data
that<00:01:36.260> comes<00:01:36.500> out<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.770> their<00:01:36.950> experiments<00:01:37.340> and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
that comes out of their experiments and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.430 
that comes out of their experiments and
interpretation<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:38.840> data<00:01:39.080> that's

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
interpretation of that data that's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.810 
interpretation of that data that's
science<00:01:39.890> that's<00:01:40.130> what<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:40.370> do<00:01:42.580> you're<00:01:43.580> doing

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
science that's what we do you're doing

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.600 
science that's what we do you're doing
cool<00:01:44.060> stuff<00:01:44.090> with<00:01:44.479> like<00:01:44.890> algae<00:01:45.890> with<00:01:46.250> plans

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
cool stuff with like algae with plans

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.250 
cool stuff with like algae with plans
that<00:01:46.850> can<00:01:47.060> potentially<00:01:47.180> change<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:48.050> world

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
that can potentially change the world

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.810 
that can potentially change the world
and<00:01:48.410> all<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.680> kind<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:48.890> stuff<00:01:48.979> I<00:01:49.310> think<00:01:49.790> that

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
and all that kind of stuff I think that

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.850 
and all that kind of stuff I think that
is<00:01:50.090> really<00:01:50.270> cool<00:01:50.510> we<00:01:50.960> don't<00:01:51.200> know<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.500> answers

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
is really cool we don't know the answers

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.469 
is really cool we don't know the answers
to<00:01:51.890> these<00:01:52.250> questions<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.910> these<00:01:53.300> are<00:01:53.450> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
to these questions and these are a

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.359 
to these questions and these are a
