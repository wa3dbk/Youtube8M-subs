 be brown or lethargic make sure 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.080

 turn the head out and look at the cut 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.689
 put it in the fridge in a dry bag 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.119

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.640
 cook when that moment comes 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.920
 just rinse out in most 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 cases you just need to cut the inflorescence with 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.229
 legs you can cut them right like this 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.110
