00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.649
 tasty and healthy food now I have for 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.740
 back 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.559
 burns a fire and as soon as the corner 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.410
 i will start cooking fish on the grill and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.690
 course will show you how I deal 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.199
 I prepared the fish beforehand 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.960
 cut here with steaks like this somewhere 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.900
 one and a half centimeters thick I will immediately clarify 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.420
 what a recipe like cooking fish 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.399
 I am already on my channel as well, just for 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.879
 those who have not seen him so in two words 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.489
 I will repeat it in advance I salted her eyes 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.950
 sprinkled with lemon juice or sprinkled 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.800
 seasoning for fish 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.460
 this way the pieces stood somewhere 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 10-15 minutes I will use the grid 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.320
 for cooking your steaks and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.199
 I will preliminarily smear it with vegetable 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.420
 oil here a little bit left but me 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.989
 this is quite enough for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.680
 so that the fish do not stick while I 'm waiting for my 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.530
 coal literally a few words I will say no 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.150
 all he's at my house eat fish in particular 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 my son is not very fond of him beloved 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.430
 food is more chicken 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.950
 so now I'm at home in the oven 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.080
 cook chicken ask me why and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 on a fire well, and I donâ€™t even 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.400
 supposed to make fish today 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.119
 it happened spontaneously by chance here 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.159
 so I put it in the oven at home 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.640
 chicken too i do it all very 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.909
 just show you how i do it now 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.460
 I 'm preparing to do an insert video who wants 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.100
 chicken will eat chicken who wants a fish 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.430
 accordingly will eat fish and on 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.490
 garnish 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.000
 we decided to make a very vegetable salad 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.510
 easy and tasty to cook 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.780
 used fresh white cabbage 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.090
 many many green onions and dill 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.080
 fresh cucumber and canned peas 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.100
 I use for refueling 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.509
 freshly made mayonnaise can also 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.810
 use mayonnaise and 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.959
 out of the packaging stores but since now 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.020
 I started cooking mayonnaise myself so I 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.239
 only I use such as 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.840
 freshly made salad is obtained 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.959
 very tasty and but if you neglect 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.070
 mayonnaise even though we are putting it right 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.870
 only fresh organic food 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.090
 can be considered this body is also very 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.060
 useful neighbors began to mow I'll take 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.840
 until the break for half my barbecue 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.920
 embers are ready those drams who continue 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.690
 burn away he is a little fish i 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.900
 placed on the lattice you see 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.159
 and start 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.860
 I will occasionally fry on a fire 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:05.120
 turn fish is preparing very quickly 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:06.129
 and literally in 7-10 minutes our dinner 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.049
 he'll be ready 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.019

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.670

 quietly matures it is very tasty 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.250
 so if you have a garden cottage 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.220
 be sure to buy land plant itself 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.590

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.659

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.370

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.170
 all the most important thing is the sauce 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.170
 so I took the boneless bucket 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.280
 salted it beforehand and 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.380
 pickled in a sauce like this 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.500
 it all stood for about half an hour now 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.170
 I 'll put it in the oven and cook 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.010
 until golden brown to readiness 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:01.710
 accordingly the sauce is 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:05.310
