00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:27.850 
conclusion i think that my iphone is
more<00:06:21.170> thicker<00:06:22.170> than<00:06:22.890> the<00:06:23.780> black<00:06:24.780> one<00:06:25.880> by<00:06:26.880> a<00:06:26.910> bit

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
more thicker than the black one by a bit

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.920 
more thicker than the black one by a bit
