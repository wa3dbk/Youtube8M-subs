00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.410
 to be able to create a score of one 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.420
 way much faster than the time 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.640
 earlier than we did with all of these 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.280
 musical figures that are here at 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.809
 We are going to give it to him that we are going to 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400
 click on this option that is feeley 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.139
 between all the feet to write a lot 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.999
 faster and with the keyboard without having 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.400
 to give so much click to the score 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:22.679
 then with the arrows rain towards 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.479
 down and up or if you want to jump 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.990
 of compass sideways and returns me 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:34.390
 now he looks at his numeric keypad 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.390
 5 is for Black 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:43.110
 6 is for white 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.800
 the 7 is for the round ones the 4 is for 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.800
 the eighth notes 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.000
 the 3 is for the semi-eighth notes and so 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.000
 successively it goes down of level 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.620
 now if I wanted to change the figure 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.290
 indicators for example in this compass 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.080
 I'm going to option 44 which is the one 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.430
 in signature study and I situate myself on the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.509
 compass I want to change the figure 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.759
 indicator but double click I'm going to 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.280
 composite and I put the indicator figure 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.500
 that I want for example now I'm going to 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.020
 put three eighths then ok 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.009
 and then I go back to the one with 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.009
 is defining fast 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:38.970
 and I write for example three short 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.310
 in a garage now if I want to put a 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.850
 silence and put for example in silence 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.860
 black I squeeze the 5 that is a black da 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.040
 the same place where where I place it 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.030
 because it's going to be a silence and above the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.510
 enter 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.120
 there is a little arrow pressed and the note is 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.229
 will transform into a black silence 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.280
 now if I want to put a silence of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.800
 quaver 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.350
 he pressed the eighth note 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.030
 and squeezed the same flex that is 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.600
 up ahead and it's going to transform into 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.600
 a silence 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:18.040
 now if I wanted to change the key that 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.569
 have my score 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.569
 I sit on the compass 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.060
 believe to be a double- click sorter 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.670
 here all the keys appear to me that I 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.320
 should use to be able to change it 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.890
 but there are also every other option 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.930
 that's where the key of the sun is 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.299
 by double click I put here select 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.409
 where is the sun and I also 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.760
 all the keys I want appear 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:49.440
 put for example I want to change it to 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.700
 a fa- key I put on ok and ok and it 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.700
 change everything to key d
