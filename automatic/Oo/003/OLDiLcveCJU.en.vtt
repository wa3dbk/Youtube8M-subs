00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
floor and we're going to solve those by

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.599 
floor and we're going to solve those by
properly<00:00:20.050> air<00:00:20.289> sealing<00:00:20.619> and<00:00:20.829> insulating<00:00:20.980> the

was that there were a lot of gaps and
cracks<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.190> inadequate<00:00:38.790> insulation<00:00:39.170> in<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
cracks and inadequate insulation in the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.570 
cracks and inadequate insulation in the
winter<00:00:40.650> they<00:00:40.890> could<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.070> turn<00:00:41.310> up<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
winter they could just turn up the

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.460 
winter they could just turn up the
thermostat<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.239> compensate<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.380> in

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
thermostat and compensate for it but in

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.470 
thermostat and compensate for it but in
the<00:00:43.559> summer<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.460> was<00:00:44.489> really<00:00:44.760> no<00:00:44.940> solution

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the summer there was really no solution
