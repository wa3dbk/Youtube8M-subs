00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
to mix our fractionated coconut oil with

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300 
to mix our fractionated coconut oil with
our<00:02:26.420> cucumber<00:02:27.049> oil<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.590> our<00:02:27.769> distilled<00:02:28.160> water

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
our cucumber oil and our distilled water

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.180 
our cucumber oil and our distilled water
so<00:02:28.880> put<00:02:29.329> in<00:02:29.480> half<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.840> cup<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.110> water<00:02:30.319> distilled

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
so put in half a cup of water distilled

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.550 
so put in half a cup of water distilled
water<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.849> better<00:02:32.569> than<00:02:32.959> regular<00:02:33.170> water

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
water is better than regular water

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.280 
water is better than regular water
because<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:34.160> been<00:02:34.310> purified<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.450> we<00:02:36.049> bought

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
because it's been purified so we bought

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.470 
because it's been purified so we bought
it<00:02:36.319> distilled<00:02:36.950> but<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.519> can<00:02:37.730> purify<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.239> by

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
it distilled but you can purify it by

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.360 
it distilled but you can purify it by
boiling<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:39.170> or<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.799> could<00:02:39.950> use<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.099> water

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
boiling it or you could use a water

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.430 
boiling it or you could use a water
purification<00:02:41.060> system<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.690> want<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.019> take<00:02:42.230> our

steeped green tea I'm an opponent about

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.830 
steeped green tea I'm an opponent about
1/4<00:02:44.720> cup<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.440> 1/4<00:02:46.190> cup<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.840> fractionated

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
1/4 cup of this 1/4 cup of fractionated

coconut oil I am choosing to use
fractionated<00:02:50.420> coconut<00:02:50.569> oil<00:02:50.930> because<00:02:51.170> it's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
fractionated coconut oil because it's

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.680 
fractionated coconut oil because it's
not<00:02:52.040> gonna<00:02:52.190> solidify<00:02:52.579> at<00:02:53.000> room<00:02:53.180> temperature

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
not gonna solidify at room temperature

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.780 
not gonna solidify at room temperature
you<00:02:53.870> still<00:02:54.319> get<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.739> same<00:02:54.920> benefits<00:02:55.489> as

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
you still get the same benefits as

you still get the same benefits as
regular<00:02:56.450> coconut<00:02:56.780> oil<00:02:57.079> it's<00:02:57.290> just

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
regular coconut oil it's just

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.789 
regular coconut oil it's just
fractionated<00:02:58.280> ohh<00:02:58.510> I'm<00:02:59.510> putting<00:02:59.840> in<00:02:59.959> 10<00:03:00.319> drops

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
fractionated ohh I'm putting in 10 drops

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.490

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
of cucumber seed oil cucumber seed oil

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.069 
of cucumber seed oil cucumber seed oil
is<00:03:03.769> awesome<00:03:04.340> because<00:03:04.489> it's<00:03:05.120> not<00:03:05.359> only<00:03:05.810> going

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
is awesome because it's not only going

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.190 
is awesome because it's not only going
to<00:03:06.380> help<00:03:06.560> hydrate<00:03:06.889> chapped<00:03:07.670> skin<00:03:07.850> or<00:03:08.569> dry<00:03:08.810> hair

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
to help hydrate chapped skin or dry hair

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.110 
to help hydrate chapped skin or dry hair
but<00:03:09.799> it's<00:03:09.950> not<00:03:10.130> gonna<00:03:10.310> leave<00:03:10.549> it<00:03:10.700> greasy

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
but it's not gonna leave it greasy

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.759 
but it's not gonna leave it greasy
either<00:03:11.359> so<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.780> think<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.139> is<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.350> great

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
either so I think this is a great

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.860 
either so I think this is a great
complement<00:03:13.609> to<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.030> coconut<00:03:14.389> oil<00:03:14.510> and

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
complement to the coconut oil and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.319 
complement to the coconut oil and

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329
