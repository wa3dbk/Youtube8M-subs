the<00:00:50.520> legs<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> come<00:00:52.140> off

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the legs on it's they have to come off

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
the legs on it's they have to come off
again<00:00:52.320> while<00:00:52.530> I'm<00:00:52.620> working<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> most<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
again while I'm working on the most of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.889 
again while I'm working on the most of
it<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.780> soldered<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
it but we have actually soldered the

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.990 
it but we have actually soldered the
speed<00:00:57.899> controllers<00:00:58.350> onto<00:00:59.039> the<00:01:00.559> bottom<00:01:01.559> plate

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
speed controllers onto the bottom plate

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000 
speed controllers onto the bottom plate
I<00:01:03.000> haven't<00:01:03.629> put<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> power<00:01:04.229> wires<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.739> here

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
I haven't put the power wires on here

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.969 
I haven't put the power wires on here
and<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.990> two<00:01:06.990> reasons<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and as you can see two reasons one I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.320 
and as you can see two reasons one I
need<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.520> make<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.150> connector<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.799> two<00:01:11.430> we

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
need to make up a connector and two we

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.550 
need to make up a connector and two we
just<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> double<00:01:12.930> check<00:01:12.960> because<00:01:13.229> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
just want to double check because I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.260 
just want to double check because I
think<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:13.950> probably<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.640> soldier<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
think we probably have to soldier in the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.160 
think we probably have to soldier in the
Nasser's<00:01:16.130> pmu<00:01:17.130> power<00:01:17.580> management<00:01:17.909> unit<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:19.020> we

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
Nasser's pmu power management unit so we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.570 
Nasser's pmu power management unit so we
just<00:01:19.290> want<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> check<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.369> see

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
just want to check that but you can see

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
just want to check that but you can see
solder<00:01:21.540> joints<00:01:21.869> look<00:01:22.020> pretty<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:22.470> obviously

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
solder joints look pretty good obviously

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.219 
solder joints look pretty good obviously
up<00:01:23.060> liquid<00:01:24.060> electrical<00:01:24.570> tape<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.020> hide<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
up liquid electrical tape can hide a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
up liquid electrical tape can hide a
multitude<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.770> sins<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:28.220> that<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.340> prevent

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
multitude of sins but that will prevent

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.230 
multitude of sins but that will prevent
any<00:01:30.060> any<00:01:30.900> shorts<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.460> we'll<00:01:32.909> probably<00:01:33.090> just

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
any any shorts so we'll probably just

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.060 
any any shorts so we'll probably just
have<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:33.990> did<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.829> first

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
have a look at what we did so the first

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.370 
have a look at what we did so the first
stage<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.479> was<00:01:36.600> okay<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.110> okay

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
stage was it was okay when it's okay

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
stage was it was okay when it's okay
actually<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> best<00:01:39.000> job<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
actually it's not the best job and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
actually it's not the best job and
please<00:01:40.079> don't<00:01:40.290> criticize<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.710> soldering<00:01:41.130> today

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
please don't criticize a soldering today

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.440 
please don't criticize a soldering today
is<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> first<00:01:41.850> time<00:01:42.000> we've<00:01:42.090> done<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.329> will

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
is the first time we've done it we will

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.359 
is the first time we've done it we will
get<00:01:42.630> better<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> first<00:01:44.070> thing<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.220> have

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
get better but the first thing we have

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.060 
get better but the first thing we have
to<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.880> lay<00:01:45.180> down<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.720> pillow<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.439> solder<00:01:46.890> on

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to do is lay down a pillow of solder on

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.039 
to do is lay down a pillow of solder on
each<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.759> pads<00:01:47.939> ready<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.570> accept<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
each of the pads ready to accept the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.340 
each of the pads ready to accept the
wires<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.140> pretty

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
wires and that was that was pretty

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.380 
wires and that was that was pretty
straightforward<00:01:52.700> use<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> lot<00:01:53.970> more<00:01:54.000> solar

straightforward use a lot more solar

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
straightforward use a lot more solar
than<00:01:54.450> than<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.990> think<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.350> need<00:01:55.380> um<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.040> did

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
than than you think you need um I did

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.679 
than than you think you need um I did
have<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> couple<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.090> them<00:01:57.240> again

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
have to do a couple of them again

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.950 
have to do a couple of them again
because<00:01:57.930> they<00:01:58.110> needed<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> bit<00:01:58.740> more<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.960> once

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
because they needed a bit more I once

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.300 
because they needed a bit more I once
we've<00:02:01.110> done<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.009> question

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we've done that it was just a question

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.330 
we've done that it was just a question
of<00:02:02.369> tinning<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.899> leads<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.829> speed

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
of tinning the leads for the speed

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.809 
of tinning the leads for the speed
controllers<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.810> heating<00:02:07.259> everything

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
controllers and then heating everything

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.229 
controllers and then heating everything
thoroughly<00:02:08.819> through<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.890> put<00:02:10.890> them<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.069> place

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
thoroughly through and put them in place

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.790 
thoroughly through and put them in place
well<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> say<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:13.080> not<00:02:13.319> gonna<00:02:13.470> be

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
well like I say it's not gonna be

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.610 
well like I say it's not gonna be
neatest<00:02:14.160> job<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.690> joint<00:02:15.960> should<00:02:16.290> be

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
neatest job but the joint should be

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.090 
neatest job but the joint should be
strong<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:18.090> double-checked<00:02:18.480> them<00:02:18.840> all

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
strong I have double-checked them all

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.360 
strong I have double-checked them all
four<00:02:20.100> for<00:02:20.550> strength<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.950> they<00:02:23.070> appear<00:02:23.340> to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
four for strength and and they appear to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.530 
four for strength and and they appear to
be<00:02:23.490> pretty<00:02:23.790> good<00:02:23.970> actually

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
be pretty good actually

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.450 
be pretty good actually
time<00:02:25.170> will<00:02:25.440> tell<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.070> course<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:28.250> then<00:02:29.250> what

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
time will tell of course and then what

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.760 
time will tell of course and then what
we<00:02:29.550> did<00:02:29.730> was<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.150> had<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> tip<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.230> use<00:02:31.410> liquid

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
we did was I had a tip to use liquid

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.670 
we did was I had a tip to use liquid
electrical<00:02:32.400> tape<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:33.570> for<00:02:33.900> securing<00:02:34.530> them

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
electrical tape not for securing them

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.680 
electrical tape not for securing them
particularly<00:02:35.130> but<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:35.640> preventing<00:02:36.330> shorts

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
particularly but for preventing shorts

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.990 
particularly but for preventing shorts
because<00:02:36.810> obviously<00:02:36.990> these<00:02:37.200> open<00:02:37.590> solder

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
because obviously these open solder

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.690 
because obviously these open solder
joints<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.270> can<00:02:39.750> cause<00:02:40.580> potentially<00:02:41.580> some

there<00:02:43.440> touching<00:02:44.160> them<00:02:44.460> through<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.530> there<00:02:47.370> we

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
there touching them through so there we

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.990 
there touching them through so there we
go<00:02:47.550> we've<00:02:47.970> done<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.300> soldiering<00:02:49.700> I've<00:02:50.700> put

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
go we've done the soldiering I've put

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.280 
go we've done the soldiering I've put
the<00:02:51.090> legs<00:02:51.300> on<00:02:51.450> here<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.900> sort<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.140> give

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the legs on here just to sort of give

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.230 
the legs on here just to sort of give
you<00:02:52.410> an<00:02:52.530> idea<00:02:52.590> or<00:02:52.920> how<00:02:53.040> it'll<00:02:53.190> look<00:02:53.250> when<00:02:53.730> we're

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
you an idea or how it'll look when we're

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.630 
you an idea or how it'll look when we're
done<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.900> we've<00:02:55.170> got<00:02:55.380> room<00:02:55.620> inside<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
done so we've got room inside for the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.950 
done so we've got room inside for the
flight<00:02:57.120> control<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.570> Naza

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
flight control the Naza

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.890 
flight control the Naza
the<00:02:58.410> PMU<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.790> other<00:03:00.030> bits<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.330> pieces<00:03:00.540> can

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
the PMU and other bits and pieces can

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.990 
the PMU and other bits and pieces can
fit<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.380> side<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.520> top<00:03:02.730> plate

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
fit on this side and then the top plate

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.550 
fit on this side and then the top plate
obviously<00:03:03.390> will<00:03:03.510> make<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.900> all<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> rigid

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
obviously will make it all the rigid

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.680 
obviously will make it all the rigid
structure<00:03:05.010> that's<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:06.000> an<00:03:06.090> idea<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.480> scale

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
structure that's just an idea of scale

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.140 
structure that's just an idea of scale
Tom<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.740> scrub<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.430> back<00:03:08.670> there

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
Tom if you scrub all the back there

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.730 
Tom if you scrub all the back there
arm<00:03:09.420> there<00:03:09.750> they<00:03:09.960> go<00:03:10.170> there's<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> bit<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.620> a

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
arm there they go there's a bit of a

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.690 
arm there they go there's a bit of a
scale<00:03:11.040> for<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.210> sides<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.660> thing

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
scale for you on the sides of the thing

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.140 
scale for you on the sides of the thing
yeah

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
yeah

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.420 
yeah
our<00:03:15.840> soldering<00:03:16.200> station<00:03:16.650> seems<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.040> work

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
our soldering station seems to work

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.910 
our soldering station seems to work
pretty<00:03:17.460> well<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:19.170> solder<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.560> we<00:03:19.739> were

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
pretty well and the solder that we were

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.160 
pretty well and the solder that we were
using<00:03:20.100> was<00:03:20.310> pretty<00:03:20.580> reasonable<00:03:21.120> what<00:03:21.900> I'll<00:03:22.020> do

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
using was pretty reasonable what I'll do

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.080 
using was pretty reasonable what I'll do

here<00:03:24.840> I'll<00:03:25.260> give<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.620> details<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.310> which

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
here I'll give you details of which

here I'll give you details of which
soldering<00:03:27.690> station<00:03:28.110> we<00:03:28.200> got<00:03:28.470> what<00:03:28.830> solder

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
soldering station we got what solder

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.520 
soldering station we got what solder
we're<00:03:29.340> using<00:03:29.550> any<00:03:30.180> other<00:03:30.570> sort<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:31.020> little

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
we're using any other sort of little

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.250 
we're using any other sort of little
tips<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.610> tricks<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.300> found<00:03:33.600> would<00:03:34.050> make

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
tips and tricks that we found would make

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.170 
tips and tricks that we found would make
things<00:03:34.500> easier<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:35.850> you're<00:03:35.970> doing

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
things easier for you if you're doing

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.080 
things easier for you if you're doing
yourself<00:03:36.270> but<00:03:36.890> but<00:03:37.890> no<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.550> far<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.910> was<00:03:39.000> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
yourself but but no so far that was the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.400 
yourself but but no so far that was the
bit<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.390> wasn't<00:03:39.660> looking<00:03:39.840> forward<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.260> and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
bit that I wasn't looking forward to and

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.210 
bit that I wasn't looking forward to and
so<00:03:40.650> far<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:41.070> gone<00:03:41.450> reasonably<00:03:42.450> well<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.920> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
so far it's gone reasonably well so the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.720
