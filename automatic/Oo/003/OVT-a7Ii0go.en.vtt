pretty candid about all that we don't
know<00:01:02.219> about<00:01:02.460> chocolate<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.420> correct<00:01:03.840> one

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
know about chocolate that's correct one

limitation<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.220> study<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> did

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
limitation of this study is that it did

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.149 
limitation of this study is that it did
not<00:01:06.600> determine<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.409> quantity<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.130> chocolate

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
not determine the quantity of chocolate

not determine the quantity of chocolate
that<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.880> consumed<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.990> only<00:01:10.170> divided<00:01:10.680> into

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that was consumed it only divided into

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.190 
that was consumed it only divided into
categories<00:01:11.159> such<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.000> once<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.450> month<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.930> once

categories such as once a month or once
a<00:01:13.680> week<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.670> factor<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
a week so we don't have that factor and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.840 
a week so we don't have that factor and
in<00:01:15.869> addition<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.560> did<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:16.920> tell<00:01:17.189> us<00:01:17.310> what<00:01:17.520> type

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
in addition it did not tell us what type

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.330 
in addition it did not tell us what type
of<00:01:17.880> chocolate<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.600> consumed<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.590> white<00:01:20.040> or

of chocolate was consumed be white or

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.910 
of chocolate was consumed be white or
milk<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:20.909> dark<00:01:21.090> chocolate<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.439> dark

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920

chocolate<00:01:43.680> may<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.189> good<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.670> us<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.909> one

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
chocolate may be good for us in one

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.539 
chocolate may be good for us in one
respect<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.659> regard<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> heart<00:01:46.619> disease<00:01:46.799> but

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
respect with regard to heart disease but

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.520 
respect with regard to heart disease but
then<00:01:47.729> again<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> sugar<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.420> fat<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:49.020> provide

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
then again the sugar and fat can provide

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.350 
then again the sugar and fat can provide
its<00:01:49.799> own<00:01:50.009> problems<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.790> correct<00:01:51.119> because

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
its own problems that's correct because

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.210 
its own problems that's correct because
commercially<00:01:52.170> available<00:01:52.290> chocolate<00:01:53.070> is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
commercially available chocolate is

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.819 
commercially available chocolate is
laden<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:54.090> sugar<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> fat<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.560> can

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
laden with sugar and fat and that can

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
laden with sugar and fat and that can
cause<00:01:56.009> weight<00:01:56.310> gain<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.579> weight<00:01:57.000> gain<00:01:57.030> may

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
cause weight gain and weight gain may

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.450 
cause weight gain and weight gain may
counteract<00:01:58.110> any<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> benefits<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.340> we

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
counteract any of the benefits that we

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.760 
counteract any of the benefits that we
see<00:01:59.700> here<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> curiosity<00:02:00.780> even<00:02:01.350> what

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
see here but out of curiosity even what

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.609 
see here but out of curiosity even what
property<00:02:02.549> does<00:02:02.880> chocolate<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.380> makes

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
property does chocolate have that makes

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.649 
property does chocolate have that makes
it<00:02:04.799> helpful<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.119> my<00:02:06.270> notes<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it helpful I have on my notes of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.080 
it helpful I have on my notes of
something<00:02:07.020> called<00:02:07.229> flava<00:02:07.710> no

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
something called flava no

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.270 
something called flava no
it's<00:02:08.239> flag<00:02:08.479> like<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.780> made-up<00:02:09.050> word<00:02:09.349> but<00:02:09.649> that's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
it's flag like a made-up word but that's

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.040 
it's flag like a made-up word but that's
what's<00:02:10.550> real<00:02:10.789> yeah<00:02:11.120> it's<00:02:11.360> real<00:02:11.569> cocoa

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
what's real yeah it's real cocoa

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.170 
what's real yeah it's real cocoa

development of cardiovascular disease

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.949 
development of cardiovascular disease
and<00:02:19.099> it<00:02:19.280> induces<00:02:19.670> these<00:02:19.970> effects<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.660> number

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
and it induces these effects in a number

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.320 
and it induces these effects in a number
of<00:02:20.989> ways<00:02:21.080> first<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.250> has<00:02:22.400> antioxidant

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
of ways first it has antioxidant

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.119 
of ways first it has antioxidant
properties<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.140> these<00:02:24.560> protect<00:02:25.010> ourselves

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
properties and these protect ourselves

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.910 
properties and these protect ourselves
from<00:02:25.580> free<00:02:26.030> radical<00:02:26.480> damage<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:27.410> also<00:02:27.590> has

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
from free radical damage it also has

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.190 
from free radical damage it also has
anti-inflammatory<00:02:28.459> properties<00:02:29.390> which<00:02:30.019> will

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
anti-inflammatory properties which will

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.839 
anti-inflammatory properties which will
prevent<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.590> development<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:31.310> plaque<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
prevent the development of plaque in the

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.570 
prevent the development of plaque in the
arteries<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.629> addition<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.739> can<00:02:33.769> prevent<00:02:34.190> clot

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
arteries in addition it can prevent clot

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.110 
arteries in addition it can prevent clot
formation<00:02:35.090> by<00:02:35.569> inhibiting<00:02:35.930> platelets<00:02:36.680> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
formation by inhibiting platelets and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.680 
formation by inhibiting platelets and
finally<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.360> can<00:02:38.569> actually<00:02:38.930> enhance<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
finally it can actually enhance the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.240 
finally it can actually enhance the
ability<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.930> antioxidants<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.829> we<00:02:43.010> take

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
ability of the antioxidants that we take

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.699 
ability of the antioxidants that we take
in<00:02:43.489> such<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:43.910> vitamin<00:02:44.329> C<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:45.110> work<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
in such as vitamin C to work so the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.740 
in such as vitamin C to work so the
flavonoids<00:02:46.340> are<00:02:46.489> good<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.090> mean<00:02:47.299> I<00:02:47.420> guess<00:02:47.599> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
flavonoids are good I mean I guess the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.690 
flavonoids are good I mean I guess the
question<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.290> are<00:02:48.500> there<00:02:48.620> any<00:02:48.890> other<00:02:49.190> foods

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
question is are there any other foods

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.670 
question is are there any other foods
that<00:02:49.970> are<00:02:50.120> less<00:02:50.599> fun<00:02:50.900> than<00:02:50.930> chocolate<00:02:51.380> but

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
that are less fun than chocolate but

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.110 
that are less fun than chocolate but
that<00:02:51.829> would<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.160> those<00:02:52.370> flavonoids<00:02:53.000> that

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
that would have those flavonoids that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.850 
that would have those flavonoids that
are<00:02:53.239> beneficial<00:02:53.450> there<00:02:54.170> are<00:02:54.349> there<00:02:54.560> are<00:02:54.650> many

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
are beneficial there are there are many

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.830 
are beneficial there are there are many
that<00:02:55.099> are<00:02:55.129> not<00:02:55.400> nearly<00:02:55.700> as<00:02:55.849> high<00:02:56.120> in<00:02:56.329> sugar<00:02:56.629> or

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
that are not nearly as high in sugar or

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.479 
that are not nearly as high in sugar or
in<00:02:56.989> fat<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.620> example<00:02:58.040> they're<00:02:58.190> found<00:02:58.340> in

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
in fat for example they're found in

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.479 
in fat for example they're found in
