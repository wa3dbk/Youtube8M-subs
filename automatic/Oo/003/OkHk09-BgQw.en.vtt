talking about hordes getting their house
and<00:00:17.250> stuff<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.820> if<00:00:18.029> you've<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.539> outposts<00:00:19.170> in

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and stuff and if you've got outposts in

the<00:00:19.350> correct<00:00:19.619> spots<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.160> shouldn't<00:00:20.460> happen

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the correct spots that shouldn't happen

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.900 
the correct spots that shouldn't happen
okay<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.750> basically<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.830> outpost<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.730> it's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
okay so basically one outpost is is it's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.210 
okay so basically one outpost is is it's
just<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.269> an<00:00:24.480> extension<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.439> your<00:00:25.560> home<00:00:25.769> kind

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

of nobody ever like goes there or
anything<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.480> know<00:00:30.599> they're<00:00:30.810> just

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
anything but you know they're just

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.040 
anything but you know they're just
little<00:00:31.289> places<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.899> these

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
little places that you know see these

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.500 
little places that you know see these
circles<00:00:34.230> basically<00:00:34.980> what<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> does<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.480> you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
circles basically what it does is if you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.229 
circles basically what it does is if you
have<00:00:36.690> these<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> set<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.520> traps<00:00:38.910> if

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
have these and if you set up traps if

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
have these and if you set up traps if
you<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.320> home<00:00:40.590> thing<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.010> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
you go to your little home thing and you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.650 
you go to your little home thing and you
go<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> down<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> outposts<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
go to the down to outposts and see this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.080 
go to the down to outposts and see this
little<00:00:42.899> green<00:00:43.079> part<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:44.100> increases<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> range

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
little green part it increases the range

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
little green part it increases the range
around<00:00:45.300> your<00:00:45.629> outpost<00:00:46.020> okay<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.340> I'll<00:00:47.460> make

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
around your outpost okay and I'll make

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.610 
around your outpost okay and I'll make
the<00:00:47.789> circle<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.329> bigger<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.440> much

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the circle way bigger see how it's much

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
the circle way bigger see how it's much
bigger<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.449> these<00:00:51.600> traps

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
bigger now so if you have these traps

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.189 
bigger now so if you have these traps
set<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.500> any<00:00:53.340> hoard<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.480> might<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.780> walking

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
set up any hoard that might be walking

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.080 
set up any hoard that might be walking
towards<00:00:55.469> your<00:00:55.530> house<00:00:55.770> it'll<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.489> walk<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
towards your house it'll just walk in

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.869 
towards your house it'll just walk in
and<00:00:57.360> he'll<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.840> big<00:00:58.649> fireball<00:00:59.010> come<00:00:59.670> down

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and he'll just big fireball come down

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
and he'll just big fireball come down
kinda<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.690> destroy<00:01:01.260> them

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
kinda and just destroy them

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
kinda and just destroy them
you<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.879> base<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.300> basically<00:01:03.570> lay<00:01:03.840> traps

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
you just base they basically lay traps

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.429 
you just base they basically lay traps
everywhere<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:06.479> particular<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.229> house

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
everywhere so in particular my house

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.320 
everywhere so in particular my house
there's<00:01:07.799> almost<00:01:07.950> no<00:01:08.220> way<00:01:08.369> hordes<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:09.180> in

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
there's almost no way hordes can get in

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.260 
there's almost no way hordes can get in
unless<00:01:10.320> there's<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.710> mass<00:01:11.369> conjunction<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
unless there's some mass conjunction of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
unless there's some mass conjunction of
them<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.780> no<00:01:13.020> idea<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.979> they

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
them that I have no idea about but they

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
them that I have no idea about but they
pretty<00:01:15.090> much<00:01:15.270> can't<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
pretty much can't get in now because of

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.550 
pretty much can't get in now because of
my<00:01:16.710> outpost<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.520> them<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.180> know

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
my outpost and I have them you know

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.899 
my outpost and I have them you know
surrounding<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:19.680> house<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.130> very<00:01:20.340> specific

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
surrounding my house in very specific

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
surrounding my house in very specific
ways<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:21.750> never<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.320> place<00:01:22.650> that's<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
ways so there's never one place that's a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.240 
ways so there's never one place that's a
you<00:01:23.790> know<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.939> little<00:01:24.450> bit<00:01:24.659> too<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.710> protected

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
you know a little bit too more protected

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
you know a little bit too more protected
than<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> other<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:27.439> but<00:01:28.439> another

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
than the other you know but another

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
than the other you know but another
thing<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.920> outposts<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:30.119> also

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
thing that outposts do is they also

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.560 
thing that outposts do is they also
bring<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.200> supplies<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:33.210> house

so<00:02:33.569> uh<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:34.110> don't<00:02:34.379> know<00:02:34.590> maybe<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:35.010> could<00:02:35.159> try

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
so uh I don't know maybe you could try

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.220 
so uh I don't know maybe you could try
setting<00:02:35.579> up<00:02:35.760> some<00:02:35.940> like<00:02:36.060> strategic<00:02:36.659> circle

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
setting up some like strategic circle

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.470 
setting up some like strategic circle
that's<00:02:37.680> far<00:02:38.010> away<00:02:38.159> from<00:02:38.370> your<00:02:38.670> base<00:02:38.909> so<00:02:39.360> they'd

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
that's far away from your base so they'd

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.670 
that's far away from your base so they'd
make<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.750> or<00:02:39.930> whenever<00:02:40.109> they<00:02:40.319> do<00:02:40.500> go<00:02:40.650> missing

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
make it or whenever they do go missing

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.009 
make it or whenever they do go missing
they'd<00:02:41.129> be<00:02:41.190> closer<00:02:41.609> I<00:02:42.000> don't<00:02:42.629> know<00:02:42.720> it's

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
they'd be closer I don't know it's

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.390 
they'd be closer I don't know it's
scared<00:02:43.470> about<00:02:43.590> for<00:02:43.829> you<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> decide<00:02:44.370> but
