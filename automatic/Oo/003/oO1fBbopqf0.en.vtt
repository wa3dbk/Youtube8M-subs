between these two garden beds we're
gonna<00:00:12.059> make<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> path<00:00:12.660> right<00:00:13.110> along<00:00:13.830> here<00:00:14.160> over

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
gonna make a path right along here over

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.129 
gonna make a path right along here over
the<00:00:15.240> grasses<00:00:15.599> we're<00:00:15.690> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> kill<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
the grasses we're going to kill the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.599 
the grasses we're going to kill the
grass<00:00:16.320> but<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> first<00:00:16.920> thing<00:00:17.100> we're<00:00:17.220> gonna<00:00:17.310> do

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
grass but the first thing we're gonna do

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.800 
grass but the first thing we're gonna do
is<00:00:17.910> you're<00:00:18.600> gonna<00:00:18.660> edge<00:00:19.369> this<00:00:20.369> garden<00:00:20.880> bed<00:00:21.600> on

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
is you're gonna edge this garden bed on

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
is you're gonna edge this garden bed on
the<00:00:21.990> left<00:00:22.250> because<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.400> hope<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> grass<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the left because I hope the grass is

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.439 
the left because I hope the grass is
crawling<00:00:24.600> right<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:25.609> it's<00:00:26.609> crawling<00:00:26.880> right<00:00:27.210> up

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
crawling right up it's crawling right up

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.380 
crawling right up it's crawling right up
into<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.930> soil<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.250> that's<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.849> good<00:00:30.119> so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
into the soil and that's not good so

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.690 
into the soil and that's not good so
we're<00:00:30.599> gonna<00:00:30.689> put<00:00:30.960> an<00:00:31.050> edge<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.840> like<00:00:33.840> about

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
we're gonna put an edge on it like about

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.350 
we're gonna put an edge on it like about
there<00:00:36.829> take<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.250> grass<00:00:38.550> take<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.180> this

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
there take all this grass take all this

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.770 
there take all this grass take all this
grass<00:00:39.660> out<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:41.000> then<00:00:42.000> put<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> bark<00:00:42.570> dust

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
grass out and then put the bark dust

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.010 
grass out and then put the bark dust
down<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.980> bumps<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.640> against<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.270> at<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
down so it bumps up against it at a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.100 
down so it bumps up against it at a
level<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.860> along<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:48.600> started

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
level right along there so we started

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.520 
level right along there so we started
here<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.199> see<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.440> get

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
here with it with the see if we can get

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.029 
here with it with the see if we can get
a<00:00:52.559> good<00:00:53.000> picture<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> we're

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
a good picture over here so we're

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.189 
a good picture over here so we're
starting<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> I've<00:00:58.559> edged<00:00:58.800> it<00:01:00.199> just

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
starting here so I've edged it just

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.830 
starting here so I've edged it just
about<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.719> going

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
about to there and then what I'm going

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.830 
about to there and then what I'm going
to<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.320> gonna<00:01:04.619> put<00:01:05.630> this

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
to do is I'm just gonna put this

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:18.859 
to do is I'm just gonna put this
/<00:01:08.619> like<00:01:08.799> this<00:01:11.790> okay<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:16.810> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
/ like this okay like that like that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.880 
/ like this okay like that like that
then<00:01:19.869> we<00:01:19.930> got<00:01:20.079> ourselves<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.470> path<00:01:20.680> and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
then we got ourselves a path and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.410 
then we got ourselves a path and
actually<00:01:21.189> make<00:01:21.340> it<00:01:21.460> thicker<00:01:21.789> than<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.210> to

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
actually make it thicker than that to

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.850 
actually make it thicker than that to
make<00:01:22.570> sure<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:23.049> grass<00:01:23.289> gets<00:01:23.590> killed

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
make sure the grass gets killed

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.800 
make sure the grass gets killed
underneath<00:01:24.310> there<00:01:24.549> it's<00:01:25.060> gonna<00:01:25.179> be<00:01:25.270> great

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
underneath there it's gonna be great

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.160 
underneath there it's gonna be great
grasses<00:01:26.530> grass<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:27.009> actually<00:01:27.340> not<00:01:28.020> too<00:01:29.020> good
