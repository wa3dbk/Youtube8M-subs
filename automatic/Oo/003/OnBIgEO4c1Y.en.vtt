growing it close to 200 k right now

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.870 
growing it close to 200 k right now
maybe<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.290> little<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:37.890> less<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> week<00:01:38.610> like

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
maybe a little bit less as the week like

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.399 
maybe a little bit less as the week like
drops<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> feel<00:01:40.020> there's<00:01:40.200> only

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that means you've got to match them up

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.770 
that means you've got to match them up
with<00:01:43.560> his<00:01:43.799> nationality<00:01:44.250> or<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.329> team<00:01:45.600> so

pretty much limits you of options and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.620 
pretty much limits you of options and
that<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.790> frustration<00:01:48.240> we're<00:01:48.479> trying
