00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
basically you can just go into creative

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.490 
basically you can just go into creative
and<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:34.790> can<00:00:34.940> pick<00:00:35.390> out<00:00:35.510> your<00:00:35.570> guns<00:00:36.020> that<00:00:36.350> you

and you can pick out your guns that you
want<00:00:36.740> so<00:00:37.490> we'll<00:00:37.730> just<00:00:37.880> take<00:00:38.090> out<00:00:38.329> these<00:00:39.290> guns

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
want so we'll just take out these guns

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.830 
want so we'll just take out these guns
and<00:00:39.829> as<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:39.980> can<00:00:40.040> see<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.340> minigun<00:00:40.880> is<00:00:41.150> just

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
and as you can see the minigun is just

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.979 
and as you can see the minigun is just
insane<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.520> when<00:00:43.670> we<00:00:43.760> press<00:00:43.910> file<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:44.930> just

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
insane so when we press file it just

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.709 
insane so when we press file it just
goes<00:00:45.380> like<00:00:45.560> that<00:00:45.620> it<00:00:46.100> just<00:00:46.579> it<00:00:47.329> just<00:00:47.359> doesn't

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
can kill them up with it so we'll just

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.759

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
stroke on it's pretty hard to aim with

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.439 
stroke on it's pretty hard to aim with
these<00:01:02.809> guns<00:01:03.109> to<00:01:03.440> be<00:01:03.620> honest<00:01:04.120> yes<00:01:05.120> so<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.390> can

see a gate okay can I get it I can't get
it<00:01:10.340> alright<00:01:10.580> let's<00:01:10.730> try<00:01:10.910> this<00:01:11.320> again<00:01:12.320> it's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
it alright let's try this again it's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.980 
it alright let's try this again it's
much<00:01:12.830> better<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.690> with<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:15.490> bazooka<00:01:16.810> this<00:01:17.810> is

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
much better and with the bazooka this is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.899 
much better and with the bazooka this is
pretty<00:01:18.380> cool<00:01:18.560> we<00:01:18.680> can<00:01:18.770> press<00:01:18.950> fry<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.579> TNT

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
pretty cool we can press fry and a TNT

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.510 
pretty cool we can press fry and a TNT
comes<00:01:20.270> out<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.689> basically<00:01:21.439> it<00:01:21.799> just<00:01:21.829> explodes

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
comes out and basically it just explodes

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.080 
comes out and basically it just explodes
so<00:01:22.759> like<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:24.070> that's<00:01:25.070> pretty<00:01:25.340> cool<00:01:25.549> that's

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
so like that that's pretty cool that's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.460 
so like that that's pretty cool that's
pretty<00:01:26.479> cool<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.930> just<00:01:27.079> explodes

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
pretty cool and it just explodes

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.920 
pretty cool and it just explodes

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
sure what the katana is but basically

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.770 
sure what the katana is but basically
it's<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:40.909> instant<00:01:41.630> kill<00:01:42.969> with<00:01:43.969> the<00:01:44.149> bat<00:01:44.390> it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
it's just instant kill with the bat it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.260 
it's just instant kill with the bat it
just<00:01:45.189> you<00:01:46.189> just<00:01:46.310> hit<00:01:46.549> them<00:01:46.670> up<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.119> just

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
just you just hit them up and it just

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.910 
just you just hit them up and it just
goes<00:01:47.390> flying<00:01:47.659> up<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.170> air<00:01:48.259> it's<00:01:48.590> pretty

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
goes flying up in the air it's pretty

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.899 
goes flying up in the air it's pretty
cool

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
cool

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.120 
cool
yes<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.570> is<00:01:50.689> basically<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.259> for<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.920> mod

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
yes so that is basically it for the mod

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.280 
yes so that is basically it for the mod
it<00:01:52.759> did<00:01:53.030> say<00:01:53.329> that<00:01:53.570> there's<00:01:53.750> some<00:01:53.960> kind<00:01:54.200> of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
it did say that there's some kind of

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.709 
it did say that there's some kind of
parachutes<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.909> I'm<00:01:56.030> not<00:01:56.180> really<00:01:56.360> sure<00:01:56.600> how

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
parachutes so I'm not really sure how

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.330 
parachutes so I'm not really sure how
that<00:01:56.750> works<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.799> last<00:01:58.009> one<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.310> a

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
that works and the last one is a

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.700 
that works and the last one is a
flamethrower<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.090> basically<00:01:59.750> you<00:02:00.409> have<00:02:00.469> to

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
flamethrower and basically you have to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.100 
flamethrower and basically you have to
tap<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.100> ground<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.520> uh<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:02.570> do<00:02:02.719> it<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.079> a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
tap on the ground to uh to do it and a

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.990 
tap on the ground to uh to do it and a
bunch<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:04.070> fried<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:04.490> comes<00:02:04.670> down<00:02:04.789> there

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
bunch of fried this comes down there

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.910 
bunch of fried this comes down there
with<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.020> if<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.200> press<00:02:06.350> apply<00:02:06.560> with<00:02:06.799> the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
with so if you press apply with the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.560 
with so if you press apply with the
friends<00:02:07.310> with<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.700> front<00:02:07.939> row<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.240> doesn't<00:02:08.509> do

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570
