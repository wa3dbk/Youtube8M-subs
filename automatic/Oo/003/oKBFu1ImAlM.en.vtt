00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.240
 liane starts today in the second must 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.070
 the ball went into the roll 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.599
 yes it is true you often see that we have a lot 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.769
 be better than the phone stays alone 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.450
 that diet coke 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 and if you score a goal so early, yes 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.619
 that only helps because you often know 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.340
 here an arena then my jokes the teams 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.930
 fully committed 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.310
 and if you have a goal that would 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 you come to you will never have to fund spaces again 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.580
 get rid of it then wait for the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.760
 two we wanted chances for that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.140
 Enough for not deciding though , though 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.880
 tell the boys year 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.399
 concentrations if that plays down cells 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.969
 you have to keep it and it comes across 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.640
 self 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.770
 spacious there it was pretty soon the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.020
 finally yes finally i will go one 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.649
 few chances where I say but me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.690
 would like to see it inside the goal but 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.670
 it had to be a very easy one 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.199
 for the fat me again in the gentleman who 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.640
 with max gehore 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.649
 and luckily they are one again today 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.180
 wonderful for him though no matter how 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.070
 you or one with his left ear the right 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.090
 ear or with his nose in it is about that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.490
 now that feeling of it 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.210
 from a rome hopefully there will be more 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.070
 to follow 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.920
 you then those three zero nice cross from 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.450
 left and sparkle felled yes I came 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.070
 exactly the in-between and that ball yes that came 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.650
 also to be precise just the one 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.340
 number of opening they are whipped cream 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.440
 cake 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.530
 definitely drove in with this one 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.720
 you now stand at least up to a quarter 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.869
 in four hours tomorrow afternoon at the top 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.310
 yes very nice so we want too 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.920
 stand 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.479
 and let's hope the end of the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.890
 also ride it together it eventually 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.460
 most importantly 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.720
 yes we fight yes no I saw we 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.119
 it also on the screens the other 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.770
 results and yes there is where we want 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.540
 stand and I am also supposed to be 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.220
 these sites pass and you can finally 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.600
 look forward to that very special one 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.119
 contest 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.190
 yes it remains just one of them 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.860
 must play and of course those 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.789
 barcelona fantastic opponent must 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.940
 you also enjoy but you must too 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.860
 realize why you are in the field and 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.180
 I want to see you took from us 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.039
 just want to have three points 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.660
 it will be very beautiful and and hopefully 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.160
 we can in a good result but 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.610
 we have to go there, we really have to 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.880
 believe and and I honestly believed 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.920
 in and if we like we all of ourselves 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.220
 kept out if we do everything we can 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.540
 and then believe in our own philosophy 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.319
 I think we can achieve good results 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.640
 to make 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.640
 so of course we have to go there
