okay guys today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.240> program<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.259> castle<00:00:05.009> link<00:00:05.960> ESC<00:00:07.099> I'm

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
how to program a castle link ESC I'm

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.900 
how to program a castle link ESC I'm
going<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.370> be<00:00:08.460> doing<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.110> ice<00:00:10.160> hvad<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.790> now

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
going to be doing that ice hvad for now

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.289 
going to be doing that ice hvad for now
but<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.450> first<00:00:12.690> thing<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.929> want<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.320> know<00:00:13.620> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
gear a she owes you know what your setup

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.620 
gear a she owes you know what your setup
is<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:25.849> great<00:00:26.849> site<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.449> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
is going to be a great site to do that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.900 
is going to be a great site to do that
is<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.410> I'm<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.609> now

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
is this one that I'm on here right now

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.190 
is this one that I'm on here right now
it's<00:00:30.619> dark<00:00:31.619> horse<00:00:31.980> head<00:00:32.189> speed<00:00:32.460> calculator<00:00:33.200> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it's dark horse head speed calculator so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
it's dark horse head speed calculator so
let's<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> am<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.880> doing<00:00:36.000> as

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
let's see what I am going to be doing as

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.680 
let's see what I am going to be doing as
I'm<00:00:36.899> doing<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> 12<00:00:37.530> cell<00:00:37.800> setup<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.399> inline<00:00:38.790> 600

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I'm doing a 12 cell setup on inline 600

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
I'm doing a 12 cell setup on inline 600
so<00:00:40.320> down<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.950> give<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> nice

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so down here it can give you a nice

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.520 
so down here it can give you a nice
little<00:00:41.930> guide<00:00:43.070> for<00:00:44.070> aligned<00:00:44.430> t-rex<00:00:44.910> 600

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
little guide for aligned t-rex 600

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.979 
little guide for aligned t-rex 600
during<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.920> main<00:00:47.180> gear<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.420> most<00:00:48.719> people

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
during the main gear that most people

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
during the main gear that most people
use<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> 170<00:00:50.250> I've<00:00:50.610> seen<00:00:50.969> other<00:00:51.120> people

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
use is the 170 I've seen other people

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.569 
use is the 170 I've seen other people
these<00:00:51.629> different<00:00:52.050> setups<00:00:52.320> Brown<00:00:52.530> doing<00:00:52.739> 174

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
these different setups Brown doing 174

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.229 
these different setups Brown doing 174
now<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.230> gold<00:00:55.230> head<00:00:55.500> speed<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> about<00:00:56.239> 2,000

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
now and gold head speed is about 2,000

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
now and gold head speed is about 2,000
so<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:59.100> usually<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.460> good<00:01:01.219> guide<00:01:02.219> for

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so that's usually a good guide for

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.450 
so that's usually a good guide for
whatever<00:01:03.390> helicopter<00:01:04.080> you're<00:01:04.199> using<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.220> I've

whatever helicopter you're using so I've

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.870 
whatever helicopter you're using so I've
got<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> 12<00:01:06.750> cell<00:01:07.049> set<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.430> tell

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
got the 12 cell set up here you tell

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.070 
got the 12 cell set up here you tell

I'm making mine about 85 we've got

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.590 
I'm making mine about 85 we've got
scorpion<00:01:24.659> motor<00:01:25.070> 90<00:01:26.070> percent<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.850> you

a<00:01:31.350> little<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.310> realistic<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.210> 85<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.020> I've

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
a little more realistic is 85 so I've

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.200 
a little more realistic is 85 so I've
got<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:38.030> with<00:01:39.030> this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
got it there and I'm going to with this

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
able to come in here and figure it out

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.650 
able to come in here and figure it out
it'll<00:02:36.489> say<00:02:36.730> somewhere<00:02:37.180> in<00:02:37.390> the
