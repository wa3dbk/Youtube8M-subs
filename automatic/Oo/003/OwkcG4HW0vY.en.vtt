00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it and there were wonderful programs we

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.120 
it and there were wonderful programs we
have<00:00:41.730> students<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.780> years<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.860> talked

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
have students for years that have talked

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.330 
have students for years that have talked
about<00:00:44.340> their<00:00:44.850> musicals<00:00:45.570> their<00:00:46.340> presentations

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
about their musicals their presentations

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.550 
about their musicals their presentations
and<00:00:47.580> that's<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:48.810> remember<00:00:49.320> learning

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
and that's how they remember learning

not<00:00:50.430> sitting<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.060> their<00:00:51.240> desk<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.720> front<00:00:51.900> of<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
not sitting in their desk in front of a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680 
not sitting in their desk in front of a
book<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.490> that's<00:00:53.700> why<00:00:54.060> I<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
book and so that's why I think it's a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.530 
book and so that's why I think it's a
valuable<00:00:55.020> approach<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.770> learning<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.220> why

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
valuable approach to learning and why

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.080 
valuable approach to learning and why
teachers<00:00:57.540> should<00:00:57.960> integrate<00:00:58.440> music<00:00:59.370> dance

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.189 
teachers should integrate music dance
