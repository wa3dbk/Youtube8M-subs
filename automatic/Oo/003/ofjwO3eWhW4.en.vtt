00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
entertainment to the point that this

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.760 
entertainment to the point that this
thing<00:03:07.570> could<00:03:07.690> be<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:08.020> on<00:03:08.170> for<00:03:08.410> years<00:03:08.560> and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
thing could be going on for years and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.590 
thing could be going on for years and
years<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.070> years<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.340> I<00:03:09.550> could<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.970> can<00:03:10.420> make

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
years and years and I could I can make

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.820 
years and years and I could I can make
something<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:11.080> this<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.350> actually<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:11.740> an

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
something of this I actually have an

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.800 
something of this I actually have an
opportunity<00:03:12.040> now<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.240> think<00:03:13.480> it's<00:03:13.630> weird

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
opportunity now and I think it's weird

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.750 
opportunity now and I think it's weird
because<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.170> think<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.620> took<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.550> point

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
because I think it took to the point

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.250 
because I think it took to the point
that<00:03:15.880> something<00:03:16.330> had<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.540> present<00:03:16.690> itself<00:03:17.110> for

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
that something had to present itself for

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.640 
that something had to present itself for
me<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.560> be<00:03:17.650> like<00:03:17.770> oh<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:19.060> that's<00:03:19.450> what<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.470> want
