00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:19.380
 we play on the flood plain on the 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.380
 roofing from where 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:32.190
 we're going to start from neumann and we will 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.870
 have to wait 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:40.250
 the pc expects like a sow that lasts 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.160
 in battlefield still long long 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.040
 the game is new , it takes me a long time 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.160
 patches and optimizations everything came 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:57.120
 in which just a new update I out 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:00.570
 hope it's going well now are four 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.739
 minutes past four minutes 30 nothing 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.690
 you have to wait for them to happen 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.820
 still counts for four minutes from 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.070
 count 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.070
 nobody knows why nobody knows how 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.720
 bad things yes it's ten years five 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.580
 hours and four minutes are over 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.430
 still in the load are a nonsense 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.180
 five minutes past that always happens 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.409
 not yet five minutes 34 seconds ago 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.659
 nothing is happening yet 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.119
 I do not know what they are there again 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.479
 that must be a golden one 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.479
 website 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.329
 so we are finally in and how 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:58.710
 to get the same shot here 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:01.140
 ping is ok, let me play it that way 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.860
 here the ping goes reasonably 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.390
 switch here from 20 to 30 framerate 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.660
 back and forth 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 and somehow it is not like that here 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.650
 berner 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.319
 now it's okay again that's not it 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.090
 bad we'll see here it wishes 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.599
 a little bit hiroko goes up and them 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.470
 down 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.140
 he plays no sau , everything is empty 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.150
 It was crowded here and now 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.370
 empty 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.530
 they are just playing again 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:40.920
 fourth 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:44.209
 but here it is yes I am broken but 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.209
 I will kill you 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.480
 so i could be fast yes i could 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.660
 at least here a bit the graphics 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:12.630
 get down to low and that has that 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:17.550
 reason because I am recording is increasing rapidly 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.640
 high on 60 accidents including environment on 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.210
 20 what a shit how do you want 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.720
 then to clarify as if you like that 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:32.970
 prevalence of 50 it is actually possible 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.090
 But the framerate does not increase anymore 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.830
 this is beknackt last time went 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.840
 it also 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.340
 Last time it worked and it jerks like 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.280
 a pig that's shit that is 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.580
 complained shit 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.580
 apa 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:04:01.159
 magnus of fruit from the fast one 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.019
 Grenade throw up and I believe 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:09.109
 every time I've looked somewhere 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:12.340
 I've I've I have no keel 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.340
 that does not make me happy 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.460
 it always depends on what he indicates 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.560
 So must the graphics card then have a 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.400
 bit of problems website of course too 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:41.419
 a bit of power of course 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:44.389
 a little bit running, I know 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.210
 not where the guy is all here 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:05:04.940
 hey I know quite well it went 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:05:06.889
 have to take care he yes you little yes 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.250
 I have no idea what I am 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.250
 said 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.870
 we're pretty much on the hook 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.820
 rather with the sugar friends here 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:32.100
 a bit more accurate is a premier and 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:35.400
 nicely done looks like they could 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.850
 synonymous snipers but I think comma high 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.200
 here the frame rate is now 80 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.660
 it would be like that now 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.480
 but if there are a few things here 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.590
 now 16 is on display now 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.710
 stay up 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.590
 he rises to 90 we have a highest 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:57.510
 Record of 90 90 pictures per second 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:02.760
 runs through here and it remains steadfast 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:05.060
 at 90 and the field and ok if you like that 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.060
 Law 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.010
 One should always stay calm 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.640
 play better because you do not always 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.830
 upset 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.180
 just stay calm as you can on 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.060
 play best and I have it now 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.910
 one killed we even killed three 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.480
 we killed right away 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:31.890
 that automatically all players 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:37.490
 automatically it rises and falls 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:41.590
 stay tuned yes I think so 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.590
 a bit of everything here saw times 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:49.210
 now it's better again as more 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.210
 if much is displayed here 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:03.229
 forgiveness as backbone as sour but 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:05.870
 I think how do we do that 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:09.580
 Next time we have too 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:11.810
 long we have to wait in here were 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:15.259
 but I think we do it in the west 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.800
 with the sugar girlfriend so we see ourselves 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.800
 on a battlefield
