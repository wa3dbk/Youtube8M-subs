00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.030
 and so people hello today I am like 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.579
 I promised to post a video about how 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.360
 make a noose fast 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.350
 they started it, I catch it today 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.120
 video I'll show you how it happens 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.239
 Now I will show how to do it first 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.979
 Determine decipher rover 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.559
 in this case, I define for myself 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:02.379
 riding tail tail further after 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.409
 as i defined up from the side up a 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.009
 i stick 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:13.780
 let's say jig-head well and the hook is important 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:17.439
 like that way that is top down I 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.110
 I hook the hook all the way through 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.640
 the end 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.360
 By the way, some say that 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.479
 this hook 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.229
 grind I can say that I do not 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.079
 I do and I do not see anything terrible 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.299
 Well, if there is a desire, then waste it well, then 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:40.659
 Your fishing will be a little different. 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.969
 further before sticking into the body vesti.ru 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.319
 hook we mark where we have 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:49.270
 let's say so the longest part of the hook 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.619
 Here we have the longest part of the hook and 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:58.539
 it is in this place we stick a sting 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.689
 poke to the place where he can 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.490
 come to the surface 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.490
 more precisely, it will be literally in millimeter 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:14.130
 or even less distance from 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:17.620
 top of our 3 pages and see here 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.890
 how when pike bites 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.770
 it usually goes like this to us 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.550
 does not interfere in order to hook her here 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.550
 the hook goes out and the pike gets hooked 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.700
 this is the easiest way for me 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:45.030
 now about the nuances the nuance is 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:49.620
 that the body or rather the hook bend and the body 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.770
 mister shouldn't be even better 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.520
 if the hook hook is much larger 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.120
 or more of the body to withdraw Mr. otherwise 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.170
 Itâ€™s such an option when 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.180
 we stick the hook of our bodies to take wounds 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.520
 will be able to make good and high quality 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.050
 because the hook handguard will interfere 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.830
 see this 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:18.000
 and squeezed won't come to the right distance 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.540
 in order to hook the pike so 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.670
 way we will have a lot of gatherings 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.760
 so friends are such a hook here to this 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.890
 Twister this hook will not work 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.970
 another hook with a big one will fit 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.980
 by size 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:41.250
 Bend I wish you a good fishing 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.820
 now I'll show you how it works 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.820
 this tackle 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.299
 and
