then<00:02:10.739> again<00:02:12.920> yep<00:02:14.000> weapon<00:02:15.000> savvy<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:16.200> keep

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
then again yep weapon savvy you keep

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.740 
then again yep weapon savvy you keep
that<00:02:16.680> pressure<00:02:16.890> going<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.269> lot<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.599> us

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
that pressure going and a lot of us

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.460 
that pressure going and a lot of us
don't<00:02:19.230> use<00:02:19.440> our<00:02:19.590> needs<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.129> strikes<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:22.319> get

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
don't use our needs and strikes to get

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.199 
don't use our needs and strikes to get
it<00:02:22.650> out<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.099> because<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.849> kinetic

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
it out and then because it's a kinetic

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.710 
it out and then because it's a kinetic
opener<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:25.349> use<00:02:25.500> lethal<00:02:25.680> force<00:02:25.920> or

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
opener I can use lethal force or

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.780 
opener I can use lethal force or
biomechanically<00:02:27.720> charge<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.500> shoot<00:02:28.890> shutting

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
biomechanically charge to shoot shutting

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.090 
biomechanically charge to shoot shutting
