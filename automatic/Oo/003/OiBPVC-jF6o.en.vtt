00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
often and not it comes down to that

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.920 
often and not it comes down to that
exactly<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.800> it's<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.520> loose<00:02:06.880> ball<00:02:07.180> to<00:02:07.600> hustle

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
exactly that it's a loose ball to hustle

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.150 
exactly that it's a loose ball to hustle
plays<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.580> know<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.989> that's<00:02:11.380> usually<00:02:11.830> the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
plays you know that that's usually the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.890 
plays you know that that's usually the
difference<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:14.400> there<00:02:15.480> they<00:02:16.480> put<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> lot

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
difference you know there they put a lot

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.590 
difference you know there they put a lot
of<00:02:16.930> pressure<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:18.840> we're<00:02:19.840> small<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:22.450> need

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
of pressure on so we're small we need

or<00:03:43.670> outside<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.740> think<00:03:45.770> they

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
or outside like that and I think they

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.710 
or outside like that and I think they
understand<00:03:47.330> that<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:49.040> that's<00:03:49.220> why<00:03:49.720> when

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
understand that I think that's why when

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.660 
understand that I think that's why when
you<00:03:50.840> look<00:03:51.020> at<00:03:51.170> what<00:03:51.320> they've<00:03:51.530> gone<00:03:51.740> to<00:03:52.070> be<00:03:52.460> the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
you look at what they've gone to be the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.570 
you look at what they've gone to be the
defending<00:03:53.180> world<00:03:53.210> champions<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.980> have<00:03:55.160> a

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
defending world champions to have a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.940 
defending world champions to have a
winning<00:03:55.940> streak<00:03:56.240> like<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:56.720> knowing<00:03:57.680> that

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
winning streak like that knowing that

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.130 
winning streak like that knowing that
everyone's<00:03:58.280> chasing<00:03:58.630> its<00:03:59.630> credit<00:03:59.960> then

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
everyone's chasing its credit then

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.540 
everyone's chasing its credit then
straight<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.160> them<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:03.680> think<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.370> can

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
straight to them so I think you can

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.760 
straight to them so I think you can
learn<00:04:04.700> from<00:04:04.910> them<00:04:05.260> they<00:04:06.260> drink<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.590> every

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
learn from them they drink it every

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.950 
learn from them they drink it every
night
