well there's you know the ipod ipad as a

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.660 
well there's you know the ipod ipad as a
physical<00:04:58.720> switch<00:04:59.050> for<00:04:59.380> locking<00:04:59.620> him<00:04:59.920> to<00:05:00.250> a

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
physical switch for locking him to a

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.000 
physical switch for locking him to a
portrait<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:01.780> landscape<00:05:01.990> it<00:05:02.500> says<00:05:02.680> here<00:05:02.980> that

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
portrait and landscape it says here that

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.860 
portrait and landscape it says here that
you<00:05:03.190> get<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.520> on<00:05:03.730> this<00:05:06.870> hardware-wise

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
you get to that on this hardware-wise

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.920 
you get to that on this hardware-wise
what<00:05:08.470> is<00:05:08.620> this<00:05:09.280> set<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.730> top<00:05:10.120> right<00:05:10.390> here<00:05:10.690> the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
what is this set the top right here the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.100 
what is this set the top right here the
little<00:05:11.560> gray<00:05:11.940> or<00:05:12.940> right<00:05:13.390> here<00:05:13.600> right<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.810> buffer

your<00:05:14.290> peacekeeper<00:05:14.830> oh<00:05:15.160> i<00:05:15.670> think<00:05:15.880> is<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:16.990> on

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
your peacekeeper oh i think is that on

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.519 
your peacekeeper oh i think is that on
the<00:05:17.110> proximity<00:05:17.530> sensor<00:05:18.300> proximity<00:05:19.300> sensor<00:05:19.900> is

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:30.829 

I<00:05:22.589> just<00:05:23.039> try<00:05:23.279> Aaron<00:05:27.169> Kristin<00:05:28.169> Bauer<00:05:29.839> yeah

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:30.839 
I just try Aaron Kristin Bauer yeah

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.929 
I just try Aaron Kristin Bauer yeah
proximity<00:05:31.349> sensor<00:05:31.619> so<00:05:32.099> it<00:05:32.129> makes<00:05:32.339> it<00:05:32.489> the

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:32.939 
proximity sensor so it makes it the

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:33.889 
proximity sensor so it makes it the
screen<00:05:33.179> turn<00:05:33.329> off<00:05:33.449> when<00:05:33.569> you<00:05:33.659> cleared<00:05:33.839> on

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:33.899 
screen turn off when you cleared on

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:38.080 
screen turn off when you cleared on
purpose

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.150 

I<00:05:38.210> was<00:05:39.110> hard<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.380> see<00:05:39.530> on<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.770> black<00:05:39.949> one

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
I was hard to see on the black one

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.730 
I was hard to see on the black one
because<00:05:40.340> it<00:05:41.770> kind<00:05:42.770> of<00:05:42.800> disappears<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:44.740> so

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
because it kind of disappears and so

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.430 
because it kind of disappears and so
we've<00:05:45.860> got<00:05:46.040> a<00:05:46.280> front<00:05:47.000> and<00:05:47.090> rear<00:05:47.360> camera<00:05:50.440> you

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
we've got a front and rear camera you

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.700 
we've got a front and rear camera you
can<00:05:51.500> take<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:51.800> picture<00:05:52.220> this<00:05:52.520> away<00:05:53.139> or<00:05:54.139> use<00:05:54.560> this

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
can take a picture this away or use this

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.129 
can take a picture this away or use this
icon<00:05:54.860> here<00:05:55.070> to<00:05:55.400> switch<00:05:55.880> to<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.210> other<00:05:56.300> one<00:05:56.510> to
