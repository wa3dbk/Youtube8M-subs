00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 speaks Galley dcn bad news here 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.330
 resident evil revelations 2 people tÃ´ 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.000
 here to talk in an interview that was 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.160
 given to the site as the promoters of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.599
 resident evil revelations two gave 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.340
 some details about the cooperative mode 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.529
 Then let's go party. 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 the game will feature the co-op mode only 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.189
 speak in and claire and moreira will have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 confuses different ones during the campaign 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.269
 class responsible for fighting and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.210
 currency will become a character of this size 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.859
 It's like it 's john l nekounam. 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.720
 internal and healing rhythms when 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.279
 is playing in the cope the players 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.850
 have a different path within the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.230
 game 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.390
 if you choose to play the player by yourself 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.559
 you can switch between the two characters 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 any time 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 This is it , it's difficult too 150 in the galley 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.030
 is this feature and calls it is difficult and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.170
 opinion why the hell the co op mode will be 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.329
 I just can not answer one thing 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.989
 of this tendency of the cover layer 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.180
 honestly I do not understand why 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.650
 mode was offline 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.170
 could very well put an online mode 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.110
 that certainly and attract more people to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.990
 play the game and such is the maybe a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.880
 His test I do not know how he looks at my 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 I wish I had a way 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.900
 little an obvious but we never know 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.150
 which are further planning to end 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.229
 she may have a dlc resource 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.150
 something like that that ends now 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.720
 do that kind of thing is that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.400
 guys 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.799
 the video was very short - just to speak and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.380
 of my opinion only the cope and also 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.729
 to see what you think there right? 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.390
 comment something to discuss 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.729
 because in my opinion and I do not understand 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 f1 on something else was also a goal there 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.060
 that the effective red 12 fpf tape 1 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.100
 confirming nothing here at night and 6 find 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.290
 that all who likes to hear that enjoyed 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.969
 people share the video there and if 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.979
 want to comment some people discuss 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.340
 about the subject and that's it guys until 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.340
