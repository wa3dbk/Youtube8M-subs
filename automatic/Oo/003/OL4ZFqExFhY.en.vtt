going to explain a little bit about

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.790 
going to explain a little bit about
routing<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.850> what<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> does<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.439> start<00:00:22.650> off

routing and what it does so to start off
with<00:00:23.070> routing<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> basically<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> process<00:00:24.720> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
with routing is basically the process of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.710 
with routing is basically the process of
opening<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.710> file<00:00:26.099> system<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:27.060> allow<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.480> to

maybe<00:00:59.879> even<00:01:00.149> flash<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:01.260> example<00:01:01.710> hema

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
maybe even flash for example hema

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
maybe even flash for example hema
exploits<00:01:02.460> roms<00:01:02.760> come<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> ability<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
exploits roms come with the ability to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
exploits roms come with the ability to
use<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.040> FM<00:01:05.369> radio<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.760> has<00:01:06.210> flashlight<00:01:07.790> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
use the FM radio and has flashlight so

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
overclock your phone you can only

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.930 
overclock your phone you can only
underclock<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:32.400> reason<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.730> want<00:02:32.880> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
underclock it the reason you want to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.180 
underclock it the reason you want to
underclock<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.900> save<00:02:34.080> battery<00:02:34.560> so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
underclock it is to save battery so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.500 
underclock it is to save battery so
let's<00:02:35.340> say<00:02:35.430> only<00:02:35.640> had<00:02:35.760> about<00:02:35.850> thirty<00:02:36.210> percent

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
let's say only had about thirty percent

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
let's say only had about thirty percent
battery<00:02:36.750> left<00:02:37.110> well<00:02:37.530> I'd<00:02:37.680> want<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.890> underclock

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
battery left well I'd want to underclock

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.480 
battery left well I'd want to underclock
it<00:02:38.610> because<00:02:39.180> I'm<00:02:39.270> not<00:02:39.390> using<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.990> much<00:02:40.490> so

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
it because I'm not using it that much so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.410 
it because I'm not using it that much so
just<00:02:41.520> drag<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.240> bar<00:02:42.440> down<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.160> there

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
just drag the bar down here and there

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.180 
just drag the bar down here and there
you<00:02:45.420> go<00:02:45.540> my<00:02:45.810> CPU<00:02:46.290> will<00:02:46.470> always<00:02:46.710> be<00:02:46.830> running<00:02:47.100> at

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
you go my CPU will always be running at

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.030 
you go my CPU will always be running at
245<00:02:47.910> megahertz<00:02:48.600> now<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.530> will<00:02:49.680> slow<00:02:49.890> your

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
245 megahertz now this will slow your

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.890 
245 megahertz now this will slow your
phone<00:02:50.280> down<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.550> bit<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.330> you'll<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.540> able<00:02:51.600> to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
phone down a bit but you'll be able to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.660 
phone down a bit but you'll be able to
save<00:02:52.110> battery<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.770> your<00:02:52.980> phone<00:02:53.160> will<00:02:53.280> last<00:02:53.490> a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
save battery and your phone will last a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.180 
save battery and your phone will last a
lot<00:02:53.850> longer<00:02:54.560> another<00:02:55.560> thing<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.830> can<00:02:56.040> do<00:02:56.100> with

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.020 
there that's really cool that requires
root<00:03:39.269> is<00:03:39.450> wireless<00:03:40.260> tether<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:41.580> this<00:03:41.790> app

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
root is wireless tether so this app

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.640 
root is wireless tether so this app
basically<00:03:42.300> lets<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.780> tether<00:03:43.050> your<00:03:43.350> phone's

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
basically lets you tether your phone's

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.120 
basically lets you tether your phone's

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
3g or edge connection to your laptop or

3g or edge connection to your laptop or
mobile<00:03:47.280> device<00:03:47.810> it's<00:03:48.810> simple<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.440> tap

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
mobile device it's simple you just tap

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.550 
mobile device it's simple you just tap
them<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.950> little<00:03:50.100> arrow<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:51.150> will<00:03:51.300> start

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
them a little arrow and it will start

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.710 
them a little arrow and it will start
this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.709> really<00:03:52.920> useful<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:54.180> if<00:03:54.390> you're<00:03:54.540> on<00:03:54.690> a

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
this is really useful for if you're on a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.720 
this is really useful for if you're on a
bus<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.590> want<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.860> tether<00:03:56.070> to<00:03:56.580> your

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
bus and you want to tether to your

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.360 
bus and you want to tether to your
laptop<00:03:57.239> or<00:03:57.540> if<00:03:57.690> you're<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.500> school<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.220> you

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
laptop or if you're in school and you

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.740 
laptop or if you're in school and you
need<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.610> go<00:03:59.730> on<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.880> blocked<00:04:00.120> website<00:04:02.750> I've

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
need to go on a blocked website I've

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.050 
need to go on a blocked website I've
used<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.320> many<00:04:04.440> times<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.160> can<00:04:05.370> say<00:04:05.550> that

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
used it many times and I can say that

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.630 
used it many times and I can say that
it's<00:04:06.360> worth<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:07.050> routing<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.370> app

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
it's worth the routing to have this app

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.330 
it's worth the routing to have this app
also<00:04:09.510> with<00:04:09.870> wireless<00:04:10.260> tether<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.950> allows<00:04:11.190> you

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
also with wireless tether it allows you

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.640 
also with wireless tether it allows you
to<00:04:11.430> tether<00:04:11.670> through<00:04:12.299> bluetooth<00:04:12.780> or<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.470> can

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
to tether through bluetooth or you can

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.830 
to tether through bluetooth or you can
turn<00:04:13.769> your<00:04:13.920> phone<00:04:14.130> into<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.430> hotspot<00:04:14.720> so<00:04:15.720> it

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
turn your phone into a hotspot so it

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.140 
turn your phone into a hotspot so it
would<00:04:15.959> be<00:04:16.080> like<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.290> mobile<00:04:16.880> broadband<00:04:17.880> router

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
would be like a mobile broadband router

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.170 
would be like a mobile broadband router
