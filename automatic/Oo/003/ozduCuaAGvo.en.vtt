rocks<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.359> make<00:00:42.359> the<00:00:42.479> transition<00:00:43.079> pretty

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
rocks and make the transition pretty

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.639 
rocks and make the transition pretty
smooth<00:00:43.979> from<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> base<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.999> the<00:00:45.030> rock<00:00:45.809> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
smooth from the base to the rock you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.959 
smooth from the base to the rock you
want<00:00:46.799> to<00:00:46.859> have<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.039> rock<00:00:47.249> have<00:00:47.429> jagged<00:00:47.699> edges

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
want to have the rock have jagged edges

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.680 
want to have the rock have jagged edges
on<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.409> did<00:00:49.499> now<00:00:49.799> was<00:00:50.429> I<00:00:50.850> added<00:00:51.449> some

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
on it so what I did now was I added some

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.930 
on it so what I did now was I added some
other<00:00:52.079> rocks<00:00:52.409> next<00:00:52.769> to<00:00:52.920> those<00:00:53.069> rocks<00:00:53.459> and<00:00:53.729> now

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
other rocks next to those rocks and now

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.419 
other rocks next to those rocks and now
what<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.209> doing<00:00:54.299> is<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.679> a<00:00:55.709> base<00:00:56.010> work<00:00:56.280> for

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
what I'm doing is I have a base work for

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.399 
what I'm doing is I have a base work for
the<00:00:56.489> piece<00:00:56.639> of<00:00:56.789> terrain<00:00:56.999> down<00:00:57.359> and<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:58.289> I'm

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
the piece of terrain down and now I'm

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.829 
the piece of terrain down and now I'm
adding<00:00:58.530> extra<00:00:59.129> bits<00:00:59.369> to<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.729> terrain<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.690> give

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
adding extra bits to the terrain to give

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.709 
adding extra bits to the terrain to give
it<00:01:00.959> some<00:01:01.289> livelihood<00:01:01.979> so<00:01:02.819> here<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.510> see

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it some livelihood so here you can see

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.260 
it some livelihood so here you can see
the<00:01:03.749> terrain<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:05.160> knife<00:01:05.370> in<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:05.580> rock<00:01:05.790> it's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the terrain the knife in the rock it's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.570 
the terrain the knife in the rock it's
pretty<00:01:06.510> symbolic<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.680> someone<00:01:08.190> was<00:01:08.370> there

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
pretty symbolic that someone was there

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.610 
pretty symbolic that someone was there
and<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> ammo<00:01:09.270> box<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.990> symbolic<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
and that ammo box was symbolic of

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.580 
and that ammo box was symbolic of
someone<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.760> entrenched<00:01:12.090> back<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.440> now

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
someone was entrenched back there so now

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.310 
someone was entrenched back there so now
though<00:01:14.160> that<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.940> train<00:01:15.240> set<00:01:16.170> up

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
though that was just the train set up

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.650 
though that was just the train set up
and<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:17.490> glued<00:01:17.820> into<00:01:18.000> place<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.540> was

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
and not really glued into place that was

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.480 
and not really glued into place that was
just<00:01:18.810> me<00:01:18.960> brainstorming<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.010> how<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> was

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
just me brainstorming about how I was

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.400 
just me brainstorming about how I was
going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> place<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.380> doing

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
going to place it so now what I'm doing

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.130 
going to place it so now what I'm doing
is<00:01:22.800> I'm<00:01:22.860> glowing<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> knife<00:01:24.870> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
is I'm glowing it now for the knife I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.470 
is I'm glowing it now for the knife I
actually<00:01:25.500> stuck<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.520> knife<00:01:26.670> into<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> piece

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
actually stuck the knife into the piece

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.320 
actually stuck the knife into the piece
of<00:01:27.660> terrain<00:01:28.340> since<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.550> styrofoam<00:01:29.910> you

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
of terrain since this is styrofoam you

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.730 
of terrain since this is styrofoam you
can<00:01:30.480> actually<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.080> because<00:01:31.440> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
can actually do that because the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.090 
can actually do that because the
styrofoam<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.030> soft<00:01:34.850> now<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.150> used

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
styrofoam is that soft now I used

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.980 
styrofoam is that soft now I used
superglue<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.640> accelerant<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.300> glue<00:01:39.810> on

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
superglue with an accelerant to glue on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.690 
superglue with an accelerant to glue on
the<00:01:41.690> glue<00:01:42.690> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.320> pieces<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.860> bits<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the glue on the the pieces of bits to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.840 
the glue on the the pieces of bits to
give<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.940> extra<00:01:45.170> extra<00:01:46.170> story<00:01:46.380> behind<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.850> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
give it extra extra story behind it so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.820 
give it extra extra story behind it so
you<00:01:48.510> can<00:01:48.690> use<00:01:48.840> Elmer's<00:01:49.080> but<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.620> seems

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
you can use Elmer's but that seems

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.460 
you can use Elmer's but that seems
