no<00:02:40.810> disrespect<00:02:41.810> meant<00:02:42.349> I<00:02:43.480> simply<00:02:44.480> do<00:02:45.019> not

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
no disrespect meant I simply do not

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.399 
no disrespect meant I simply do not
believe<00:02:45.650> that<00:02:46.040> strong<00:02:46.670> lifts<00:02:46.970> 5<00:02:47.150> by<00:02:47.389> 5<00:02:47.629> is<00:02:47.989> the

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
believe that strong lifts 5 by 5 is the

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.839 
believe that strong lifts 5 by 5 is the
best<00:02:49.150> option<00:02:50.150> available<00:02:50.689> for<00:02:51.409> beginners

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
best option available for beginners

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.210 
best option available for beginners
simply<00:02:52.849> because<00:02:53.269> it<00:02:53.689> recommends<00:02:54.409> 5<00:02:54.799> working

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
simply because it recommends 5 working

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.179 
simply because it recommends 5 working
sets<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.639> squats<00:02:55.819> three<00:02:56.239> times<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.659> week<00:02:56.689> and<00:02:57.189> I

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
sets of squats three times a week and I

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.159 
sets of squats three times a week and I
just<00:02:58.220> think<00:02:58.700> it's<00:02:58.849> overkill<00:02:59.239> it's<00:02:59.750> just<00:03:00.019> too

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
just think it's overkill it's just too

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.619 
just think it's overkill it's just too
much<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:00.650> just<00:03:00.680> don't<00:03:01.069> need<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:02.090> do<00:03:02.389> need

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
much you just don't need it you do need

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.920 
much you just don't need it you do need
report<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.560> practice<00:03:04.010> your<00:03:04.189> form<00:03:04.540> that's<00:03:05.540> a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
report to practice your form that's a

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.909 
report to practice your form that's a
good<00:03:06.290> thing<00:03:06.700> but<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:08.540> don't<00:03:08.870> need<00:03:09.079> 5<00:03:09.409> sets<00:03:09.799> of

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919 
good thing but you don't need 5 sets of

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.089 
good thing but you don't need 5 sets of
squats<00:03:10.189> three<00:03:10.970> times<00:03:11.269> a<00:03:11.540> week<00:03:11.750> that's<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.799> bit

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
squats three times a week that's a bit

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.819 
squats three times a week that's a bit
overkill<00:03:14.060> I'd<00:03:14.900> rather<00:03:15.199> see<00:03:15.530> you<00:03:15.590> doing

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
overkill I'd rather see you doing

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.990 
overkill I'd rather see you doing
starting<00:03:16.250> strength<00:03:17.709> or<00:03:18.709> I'd<00:03:19.010> rather<00:03:19.220> see<00:03:19.940> you

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
starting strength or I'd rather see you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.520 
starting strength or I'd rather see you
do<00:03:20.120> one<00:03:20.359> of<00:03:20.449> the<00:03:20.569> star<00:03:21.250> beginner<00:03:22.250> routines

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
do one of the star beginner routines

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.770 
do one of the star beginner routines
instead<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:25.180> instead<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.239> killing<00:03:26.659> yourself

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
instead of instead of killing yourself

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.599 
instead of instead of killing yourself
in<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.889> manner<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.540> kids<00:03:30.409> that's<00:03:31.040> my<00:03:31.280> honest

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
in that manner so kids that's my honest

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.809 
in that manner so kids that's my honest
opinion<00:03:32.409> again<00:03:33.409> it's<00:03:33.650> no<00:03:33.859> disrespect<00:03:34.609> meant

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
opinion again it's no disrespect meant

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.539 
opinion again it's no disrespect meant
to<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> guy<00:03:35.359> behind<00:03:35.629> strong<00:03:36.199> lifts<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:37.489> I

advice<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:40.129> don't<00:03:40.699> think<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.060> need<00:03:41.180> five<00:03:41.479> sets

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
advice I don't think you need five sets

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.319 
advice I don't think you need five sets
of<00:03:41.989> squats<00:03:42.229> three<00:03:42.709> times<00:03:42.979> a<00:03:43.190> week<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.729> think

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
of squats three times a week I think

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.420 
of squats three times a week I think
you'd<00:03:44.479> be<00:03:44.599> fine<00:03:44.870> with<00:03:44.900> three<00:03:45.349> working<00:03:45.799> sets<00:03:46.129> a

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
you'd be fine with three working sets a

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.629 
you'd be fine with three working sets a
week<00:03:46.940> that's<00:03:47.750> pretty<00:03:48.109> standard<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:49.489> don't

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
week that's pretty standard you don't

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.399

really<00:03:49.790> need<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.180> kill<00:03:50.389> yourself<00:03:50.810> beyond<00:03:51.139> that

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409
