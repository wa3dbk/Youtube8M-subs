00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
transducers on the automobiles so that

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.610 
transducers on the automobiles so that

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
they can determine when the car went

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.960 
they can determine when the car went

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
international road circuit it was

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.970 
international road circuit it was
pulling<00:05:07.430> point<00:05:07.730> 9<00:05:08.060> 4<00:05:08.360> g's<00:05:08.630> and<00:05:08.840> will<00:05:09.590> monitor

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
pulling point 9 4 g's and will monitor

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.470 
pulling point 9 4 g's and will monitor
the<00:05:10.010> driver<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.550> see<00:05:10.760> how<00:05:10.880> it<00:05:11.030> works<00:05:11.060> for<00:05:11.360> him

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
the driver and see how it works for him

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.210 
the driver and see how it works for him
and<00:05:11.720> if<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.080> feels<00:05:12.290> good<00:05:12.470> for<00:05:12.770> him<00:05:12.920> we<00:05:13.070> might

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
and if it feels good for him we might

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.850 
and if it feels good for him we might
say<00:05:13.490> this<00:05:14.060> is<00:05:14.240> good<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:14.690> if<00:05:15.200> it<00:05:15.290> feels<00:05:15.500> bad<00:05:15.830> for

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
say this is good and if it feels bad for

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.530 
say this is good and if it feels bad for
him<00:05:16.250> but<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.550> numbers<00:05:16.850> were<00:05:17.000> good<00:05:17.210> we<00:05:17.360> might

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
him but the numbers were good we might

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.880 
him but the numbers were good we might
say<00:05:17.720> time<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.140> look<00:05:18.260> at<00:05:18.380> this<00:05:18.500> a<00:05:18.560> little<00:05:18.740> more

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
say time to look at this a little more

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.250 
say time to look at this a little more
so<00:05:19.550> we<00:05:19.730> have<00:05:19.910> computers<00:05:20.570> there<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:21.050> make<00:05:21.200> sure

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
so we have computers there to make sure

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.840 
so we have computers there to make sure
there's<00:05:21.560> no<00:05:21.680> human<00:05:22.010> error<00:05:22.160> but<00:05:22.490> then<00:05:22.640> we<00:05:22.730> use

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
there's no human error but then we use

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.280 
there's no human error but then we use
people<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.240> make<00:05:23.540> sure<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.810> computers<00:05:24.170> are

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
people to make sure the computers are

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.500 
people to make sure the computers are
being<00:05:24.470> honest<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.980> con<00:05:25.460> say<00:05:25.700> is<00:05:25.880> getting<00:05:26.360> the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
being honest to con say is getting the

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.420 
being honest to con say is getting the
human<00:05:26.900> input<00:05:27.050> saying<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:27.950> maybe<00:05:28.190> the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
human input saying that maybe the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.520 
human input saying that maybe the
numbers<00:05:28.730> look<00:05:29.180> good<00:05:29.210> but<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.020> feeling<00:05:30.380> isn't

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
numbers look good but the feeling isn't

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.170 
numbers look good but the feeling isn't
there<00:05:30.830> so<00:05:31.190> we've<00:05:31.340> got<00:05:31.490> to<00:05:31.580> go<00:05:31.700> back<00:05:31.850> and<00:05:32.120> get

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
there so we've got to go back and get

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.610 
there so we've got to go back and get
the<00:05:32.330> feeling<00:05:32.660> right<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.080> get<00:05:33.230> the<00:05:33.320> numbers

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
the feeling right and get the numbers

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.080 
the feeling right and get the numbers
right<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:34.070> that's<00:05:34.220> just<00:05:34.550> what<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:34.940> whole

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
right and that's just what the whole

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.230 
right and that's just what the whole
philosophy<00:05:35.360> is<00:05:35.720> about<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:36.350> seems<00:05:36.770> like<00:05:37.430> you're

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
philosophy is about it seems like you're

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.810 
philosophy is about it seems like you're
willing<00:05:38.720> it<00:05:38.870> around<00:05:39.260> the<00:05:39.410> corner<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:40.250> it

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
willing it around the corner and it

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.940 
willing it around the corner and it
doesn't<00:05:41.090> take<00:05:41.210> very<00:05:41.240> much<00:05:41.540> effort<00:05:42.050> to<00:05:42.620> do<00:05:42.740> what

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
doesn't take very much effort to do what

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.590 
doesn't take very much effort to do what
you<00:05:43.070> want<00:05:43.280> to<00:05:43.370> do<00:05:43.520> you<00:05:43.970> don't<00:05:44.150> have<00:05:44.270> to<00:05:44.360> think

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
you want to do you don't have to think

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.000 
you want to do you don't have to think
about<00:05:44.720> what<00:05:45.020> you're<00:05:45.170> going<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.440> disturb<00:05:45.800> it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
about what you're going to disturb it

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.790 
about what you're going to disturb it
can<00:05:46.160> sort<00:05:46.430> of<00:05:46.490> an<00:05:46.550> extension<00:05:46.880> of<00:05:47.060> personality

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
can sort of an extension of personality

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.660 
can sort of an extension of personality
Oh

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.000 

I'd<00:05:53.210> like<00:05:53.480> to<00:05:53.630> make<00:05:53.780> a<00:05:53.810> car<00:05:54.140> that<00:05:54.410> the<00:05:54.500> customer

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
I'd like to make a car that the customer

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.190 
I'd like to make a car that the customer
doesn't<00:05:55.040> want<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:55.730> sell<00:05:55.970> or<00:05:56.240> change<00:05:56.570> that<00:05:57.080> the

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
doesn't want to sell or change that the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:05.760 
doesn't want to sell or change that the
customer<00:05:57.710> wants<00:05:57.980> to<00:05:58.100> keep<00:05:58.310> forever

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.619 

I<00:06:05.860> thought<00:06:06.580> that<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:08.440> Mafia<00:06:08.789> between<00:06:09.789> drivers

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:10.629 
I thought that the Mafia between drivers

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.150 
I thought that the Mafia between drivers
and<00:06:11.129> massacres<00:06:12.129> happened

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.320 

Oh

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.120 

I<00:06:26.130> think<00:06:26.310> Mazda<00:06:26.910> is<00:06:27.540> going<00:06:28.020> to<00:06:28.230> be<00:06:28.980> a<00:06:29.010> very

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
I think Mazda is going to be a very

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.559 
I think Mazda is going to be a very
sound

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:31.569

we're just starting to kind of show our

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:38.900 
we're just starting to kind of show our
muscles

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.650 

it<00:06:39.450> can<00:06:39.630> be<00:06:39.780> a<00:06:39.810> beautiful<00:06:40.500> looking<00:06:40.860> car<00:06:41.640> it<00:06:42.420> was

it can be a beautiful looking car it was

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.790 
it can be a beautiful looking car it was
in<00:06:42.810> a<00:06:42.840> shop<00:06:43.080> all<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:43.380> time<00:06:43.940> right<00:06:45.290> it<00:06:46.290> doesn't

in a shop all the time right it doesn't

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.190 
in a shop all the time right it doesn't
do<00:06:46.890> me<00:06:47.070> any<00:06:47.100> good<00:06:47.340> this<00:06:48.150> car<00:06:48.420> is<00:06:48.630> never<00:06:48.840> been

but we're very happy with lost us and i

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.850 
but we're very happy with lost us and i
would<00:06:55.520> certainly<00:06:56.090> buy<00:06:56.449> another<00:06:56.749> one

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
would certainly buy another one

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.800 
would certainly buy another one
and<00:06:59.189> install<00:06:59.669> it<00:06:59.789> as<00:06:59.909> a<00:06:59.939> rock<00:07:00.240> it's<00:07:00.509> a<00:07:00.599> very

and I guess that's what you refer to as
