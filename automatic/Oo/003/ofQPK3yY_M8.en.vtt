00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.619
 the fourth day I am also a bit 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.949
 become ill means mosquito bite on the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.080
 lip 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.460
 we're getting evening dresses for 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.800
 Tomorrow because we're on the red carpet 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.990
 I'm not curious, I hope so 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 is something ground landes is so much 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 my climate we got one 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.789
 But I do not have a tour 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.740
 except here shows us the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.989
 assistant or something not a clue 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.969
 They showed the clothes and we 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.820
 have tried a lot and i have 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.530
 I decide like a dress 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.420
 I now have a dress here which is followed 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.100
 which is best against that is so 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.100
 a cross talk with such a big one 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.420
 maybe you know this is this 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:57.580
 a 3d fabric that means there is weeks 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.000
 should matter over its holder twice 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.130
 of course I separated myself 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.720
 then decided that for this dress 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.910
 was then hung up somewhere and on 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.310
 lay next day as delivered 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.630
 and now we are on the way out 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.390
 process yvonne and here we became 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.190
 even from tap again filmed the clothes 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.800
 I only tried on shoes 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.370
 clean and you 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.370
 forgetting that I am me 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.390
 All at once that annoyed the goods 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.490
 was so big and had such a 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.790
 better choice than in German schools 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.530
 but I should search 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.990
 someone from my clique 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.240
 because the biggest thing we are after is me 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.610
 ran lightning bar and have one 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.720
 get massage it was so cool 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.299
 to be even just a massage the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.600
 first time ever and they are everything 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.369
 I really can fully recommend 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.610
 now completely follow the trail in the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.869
 station I kind of get on with it 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.259
 showered daily but I did not have it 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.149
 required 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.149
 but you feel a mega cool 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.739
 for the phone call 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.530
 After massage we are to the port 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:26.560
 drove and there awaits us the eight- 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:27.790
 or to cool it cool on hard 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.750
 we are really lucky with the weather 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:35.739
 everything does not burn hot and that is the case 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:40.260
 a nice sight megacool people me 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.260
 I think that's that back there 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 eat 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.490
 there 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.580
 People I was so afraid of the boat 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.440
 For me it was 2000 meters 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.630
 distance there and they had the boat 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.709
 even wear or have you got it I have it 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.410
 later so that the bonds again 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.410
 tried and pushes 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.700
 what the memory card 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:43.500
 you can at least put and the wing 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:48.269
 stood this time is just awesome 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.720
 moderately cold not my body 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.720
 yourself 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.940
 really so cheesy find 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.069
 if you can rarely see that up there 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.300
 A camera is hovering in the air 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.300
 now with fruits 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.320
 that's too much 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.320
 everything is like that 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.600
 bigger buildings if you finally 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.600
 finally I have 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.360
 It was such a glaring prospect that came 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:48.200
 a film like in a movie so really 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:50.660
 so many were up for about four hours 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.940
 this boat and we could easily 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.350
 not enough photos make enough videos 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.890
 that just as good as I have right 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:01.280
 counted what if you look horny I 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.100
 and you really saw everything 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.780
 Everything and we have really contemporary 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.670
 This scene was drone with a 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.280
 recorded and it looks like 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.730
 a movie or not we have the whole 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.060
 time just enjoyed the view and 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.940
 chatted and correct the time the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.770
 just great and if you have one 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.710
 view in front of you with such blatant 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.290
 People next to you and really like to measure 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.180
 then really you appreciate everything if I am 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.720
 but that's just what you want to do 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.300
 Life 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.140
 I was so thankful that trip 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.240
 to be able to do 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.670
 and look at the pictures are that 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.830
 not dreamlike pictures we were up 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.900
 at sunset even as at night 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.420
 was and the sun was in ten minutes 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.460
 she was down and all the whole 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:54.050
 horizon saw the man was red 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:57.380
 everything was red I thought it was so cool and so 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.990
 then at night everything looked even more blatant 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.490
 and it you see something see 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.320
 I hope you like it 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.090
 the next video is the one up there 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.830
 last 2 but the next video is coming 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.830
 tomorrow then some look at it
