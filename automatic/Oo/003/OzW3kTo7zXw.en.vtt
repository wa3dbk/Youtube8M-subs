secondary dns is 162 dot 24 36 5 31 and

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.210 
secondary dns is 162 dot 24 36 5 31 and
again<00:01:45.659> pause<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.530> would<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.860> and

the<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.930> download<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.530> upload<00:02:01.649> speed<00:02:02.070> will

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the you download and upload speed will

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.120 
the you download and upload speed will
dip<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:03.270> by<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> lot<00:02:03.840> sometimes<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.829> goes<00:02:04.920> down

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
dip like by a lot sometimes it goes down

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.780 
dip like by a lot sometimes it goes down
to<00:02:05.189> six<00:02:05.520> sometimes<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> goes<00:02:06.329> down

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
to six sometimes it goes down

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.030 
to six sometimes it goes down
then<00:02:06.910> sometimes<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.870> miss<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.500> other<00:02:08.649> salmon

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040
