because i had restart and so yeah anyway
let<00:00:54.390> us<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.879> my<00:00:56.879> rough<00:00:57.390> comparison<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.230> how

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
let us go to my rough comparison of how

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.939 
let us go to my rough comparison of how
big<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.600> well<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:00.750> big<00:01:01.079> pandora<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
big it is well how big pandora is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
big it is well how big pandora is
compared<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> follow<00:01:02.940> threes<00:01:03.300> wastelands<00:01:03.840> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
compared to follow threes wastelands so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.340 
compared to follow threes wastelands so
that's<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> best<00:01:05.790> i<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> paint<00:01:06.689> drawing

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
that's the best i can do a paint drawing

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.260 
that's the best i can do a paint drawing
this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> very<00:01:10.430> rough<00:01:12.350> representation

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
this is a very rough representation

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.609 
this is a very rough representation
of<00:01:14.359> it<00:01:16.119> sing<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:17.149> again<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:17.929> think<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
of it sing it again I think that the

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.090 
of it sing it again I think that the
fallout<00:01:19.189> 3<00:01:19.759> border<00:01:20.210> should<00:01:21.200> be<00:01:21.380> like<00:01:22.070> right

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
fallout 3 border should be like right

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:32.240 
fallout 3 border should be like right
here<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.850> overall<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:28.130> should<00:01:28.369> be<00:01:28.520> right<00:01:28.819> here

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.230 

if<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.000> straighten<00:01:33.360> that

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.080 

so<00:01:38.869> yeah

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.440 

that's<00:01:46.689> all<00:01:46.929> big<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.469> file<00:01:48.219> 32<00:01:48.670> Borderlands

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
it's not really the same as like 5545

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.899 
it's not really the same as like 5545
I'm<00:01:55.689> not<00:01:55.990> including<00:01:56.560> DLC<00:01:56.859> because<00:01:57.399> that's<00:01:57.640> not

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
I'm not including DLC because that's not

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.200 
I'm not including DLC because that's not

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
yeah you can do that in fallout 3 but

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.440 
yeah you can do that in fallout 3 but
it's<00:02:59.260> horrible<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.829> mean<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.250> can't<00:03:00.459> even<00:03:00.639> aim

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
with that so overall what game do i

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.020 
with that so overall what game do i
think<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.109> better<00:03:05.730> Borderlands<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.819> think

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
think is better Borderlands I think

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.030 
think is better Borderlands I think
Borderlands<00:03:07.630> has<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.780> high<00:03:08.019> replay<00:03:08.380> value<00:03:08.620> but

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
Borderlands has a high replay value but

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.220 
Borderlands has a high replay value but
that's<00:03:09.250> my<00:03:09.459> opinion<00:03:09.579> don't<00:03:10.329> take<00:03:10.599> my<00:03:10.840> opinion

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
that's my opinion don't take my opinion

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.530 
that's my opinion don't take my opinion
too<00:03:11.380> seriously<00:03:11.799> I<00:03:11.950> mean<00:03:12.069> go<00:03:12.760> watch<00:03:13.269> some

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
too seriously I mean go watch some

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.220 
too seriously I mean go watch some
reviews<00:03:13.959> or<00:03:14.109> whatever<00:03:14.380> um<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.840> personally

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
reviews or whatever um and I personally

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.080 
reviews or whatever um and I personally
think<00:03:17.470> Borderlands<00:03:18.130> better<00:03:18.370> than<00:03:18.549> fallout<00:03:18.730> 3

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
think Borderlands better than fallout 3

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.990 
think Borderlands better than fallout 3
because<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.840> Borderlands<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:21.579> have<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.790> high

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
because in Borderlands you have a high

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.460 
because in Borderlands you have a high
replay<00:03:22.299> value<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:22.810> play<00:03:23.169> through<00:03:23.349> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
replay value you can play through the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.059 
replay value you can play through the
story<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:24.069> think<00:03:24.880> up<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.720> three<00:03:26.169> times<00:03:26.200> i'm<00:03:26.919> not

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
story I think up to three times i'm not

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.180 
story I think up to three times i'm not
mistaken<00:03:27.630> once<00:03:28.630> normal<00:03:29.349> playthrough<00:03:29.739> second

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
mistaken once normal playthrough second

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.520 
mistaken once normal playthrough second
playthrough<00:03:30.970> even<00:03:31.599> once<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.109> beat<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.380> first

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
playthrough even once you beat the first

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.620 
playthrough even once you beat the first
playthrough<00:03:33.069> which<00:03:33.639> is<00:03:33.790> just<00:03:33.910> main<00:03:34.180> quests

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
playthrough which is just main quests

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.360 
playthrough which is just main quests
not<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.959> side<00:03:35.139> quest<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.769> can<00:03:36.010> do<00:03:36.220> the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
not the side quest so you can do the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.710 
not the side quest so you can do the
second<00:03:36.700> playthrough<00:03:36.849> which<00:03:37.209> is<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.389> exact

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
second playthrough which is the exact

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.309 
second playthrough which is the exact
same<00:03:37.930> story<00:03:38.340> but

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
same story but

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.750 
same story but
the<00:03:40.980> enemies<00:03:41.310> are<00:03:41.340> twice<00:03:41.760> as<00:03:41.790> hard<00:03:42.120> um<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:44.579> you

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
the enemies are twice as hard um and you

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.039 
the enemies are twice as hard um and you
get<00:03:44.909> better<00:03:45.090> Luke<00:03:45.329> though<00:03:45.540> on<00:03:45.749> the<00:03:45.780> second

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
get better Luke though on the second

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.750 
get better Luke though on the second
play<00:03:46.139> through<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.560> then<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.739> think<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.549> don't

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760
