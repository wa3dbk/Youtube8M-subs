bat<00:04:14.860> is<00:04:15.189> this<00:04:15.400> is<00:04:15.519> one<00:04:15.670> of<00:04:15.790> those<00:04:15.909> few<00:04:16.120> cars<00:04:16.389> you

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
bat is this is one of those few cars you

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.409 
bat is this is one of those few cars you
can<00:04:16.780> actually<00:04:17.049> floor<00:04:17.820> frequently<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.060> not

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
can actually floor frequently and not

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.689 
can actually floor frequently and not
get<00:04:19.600> in<00:04:19.750> trouble<00:04:19.959> that's<00:04:20.769> partly<00:04:21.160> because<00:04:21.250> the

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:21.699 
get in trouble that's partly because the

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.430 
get in trouble that's partly because the
suspension<00:04:22.270> chassis<00:04:22.539> handled<00:04:23.199> the<00:04:23.260> power

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
suspension chassis handled the power

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.140 
suspension chassis handled the power
well<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.100> partly<00:04:24.400> because<00:04:24.460> there's<00:04:24.820> not<00:04:24.910> too

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
well and partly because there's not too

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.860 
well and partly because there's not too
much<00:04:25.300> power

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
much power

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.300 
much power
now<00:04:26.199> nevermind<00:04:26.560> what<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.770> see<00:04:26.919> on<00:04:27.070> paper

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
now nevermind what you see on paper

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.850 
now nevermind what you see on paper
there's<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.330> broad<00:04:28.660> flat<00:04:29.020> spot<00:04:29.500> from<00:04:29.650> like

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
there's a broad flat spot from like

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.860 
there's a broad flat spot from like
three<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.460> five<00:04:30.490> thousand<00:04:31.150> rpm<00:04:31.600> maybe<00:04:31.840> a

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
three to five thousand rpm maybe a

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.020 
three to five thousand rpm maybe a
little<00:04:31.960> bit<00:04:32.139> higher<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:33.010> power<00:04:33.220> doesn't<00:04:33.580> gag

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
little bit higher the power doesn't gag

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.750 
little bit higher the power doesn't gag
there<00:04:34.510> but<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.050> definitely<00:04:35.199> shaves<00:04:35.979> off<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.430> bit

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
there but it definitely shaves off a bit

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.310 
there but it definitely shaves off a bit
and<00:04:36.940> that's<00:04:37.240> part<00:04:37.449> of<00:04:37.510> what<00:04:37.660> gives<00:04:37.810> this<00:04:38.050> car<00:04:38.289> I

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
and that's part of what gives this car I

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.260 
and that's part of what gives this car I
think<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.650> real<00:04:38.800> tractable<00:04:39.520> feel<00:04:39.789> it's

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
think a real tractable feel it's

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.939 
think a real tractable feel it's
actually<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.750> lot<00:04:40.930> of<00:04:40.960> fun<00:04:41.080> although<00:04:41.560> it's<00:04:41.710> not

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
actually a lot of fun although it's not

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.529 
actually a lot of fun although it's not
what<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:42.220> lot<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.460> carmakers<00:04:42.669> go<00:04:43.150> for<00:04:43.419> these

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
what a lot of carmakers go for these

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.540 
what a lot of carmakers go for these
days<00:04:43.810> another<00:04:44.710> thing<00:04:44.830> we<00:04:44.949> noticed<00:04:45.250> about<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
days another thing we noticed about the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.540 
days another thing we noticed about the
FRS<00:04:46.060> is<00:04:46.300> got<00:04:46.539> a<00:04:46.570> real<00:04:46.840> firm<00:04:47.550> mechanical

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
FRS is got a real firm mechanical

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.150 
FRS is got a real firm mechanical
shifter<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.330> clutch<00:04:49.780> effort<00:04:50.289> and<00:04:50.470> take-up<00:04:50.770> is

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
shifter the clutch effort and take-up is

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.830 
shifter the clutch effort and take-up is
just<00:04:51.460> about<00:04:51.669> perfect<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.210> love<00:04:52.360> this<00:04:52.539> clutch

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
just about perfect I love this clutch

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.230 
just about perfect I love this clutch
it's<00:04:53.440> about<00:04:53.889> as<00:04:54.100> good<00:04:54.130> as<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.520> in<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.729> 911

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
it's about as good as that in the 911

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.879 
it's about as good as that in the 911
and<00:04:55.360> that's<00:04:55.419> saying<00:04:55.720> something<00:04:55.810> now<00:04:56.650> as<00:04:56.770> much

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
and that's saying something now as much

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.560 
and that's saying something now as much
as<00:04:56.949> I<00:04:57.130> love<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.430> gearbox<00:04:57.820> in<00:04:58.030> this<00:04:58.180> car<00:04:58.389> I've

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
as I love the gearbox in this car I've

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.750 
as I love the gearbox in this car I've
got<00:04:58.630> to<00:04:59.110> check<00:04:59.260> out<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.620> automatic<00:05:00.160> it's<00:05:00.580> got

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
got to check out the automatic it's got

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.310 
got to check out the automatic it's got
panels<00:05:01.210> as<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.449> mentioned<00:05:01.900> those<00:05:01.990> can<00:05:02.199> be<00:05:02.289> a

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
panels as I mentioned those can be a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.170 
panels as I mentioned those can be a
gimmick<00:05:02.620> if<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.039> transmission<00:05:03.520> isn't<00:05:03.910> as

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
gimmick if the transmission isn't as

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.450 
gimmick if the transmission isn't as
quick<00:05:04.360> as<00:05:04.660> your<00:05:05.050> inputs<00:05:05.620> on<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.830> paddles<00:05:06.310> and

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
quick as your inputs on the paddles and

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.189 
quick as your inputs on the paddles and
the<00:05:07.060> reason<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.360> looking<00:05:07.570> at<00:05:07.599> that<00:05:07.750> automatic

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
the reason I looking at that automatic

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.570 
the reason I looking at that automatic
because<00:05:08.500> they<00:05:08.650> talk<00:05:08.830> about<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:09.220> being<00:05:09.400> quite

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
because they talk about it being quite

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.240 
because they talk about it being quite
advanced<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.870> this<00:05:11.289> car<00:05:11.560> is<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.710> kind<00:05:12.070> you'll

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
advanced and this car is the kind you'll

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.890 
advanced and this car is the kind you'll
probably<00:05:12.400> have<00:05:12.699> as<00:05:12.820> your<00:05:13.000> only<00:05:13.180> card<00:05:13.630> as<00:05:13.840> a

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
probably have as your only card as a

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.290 
probably have as your only card as a
result<00:05:14.410> it's<00:05:14.650> nice<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:15.099> have<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.639> well<00:05:15.970> tuned

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
result it's nice to have a well tuned

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.020 
result it's nice to have a well tuned
