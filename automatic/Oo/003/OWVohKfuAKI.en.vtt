where you can change the intensity of

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.550 
where you can change the intensity of
how<00:02:29.310> blurred<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.150> image<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.140> adds

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
how blurred the image is and that adds

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.199 
how blurred the image is and that adds
