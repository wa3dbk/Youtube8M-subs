00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.620
 what comes to you here is a silver businessman 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.630
 that a type of insect is very normal to find houses 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.960
 how this copy is bigger than it is again about and has also gone to 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.749
 stop in broad daylight 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:15.589
 I've been recorded so they can see it and so I can learn something that I think will come 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.829
 they should learn nothing useful 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.249
 if I do not know if you can see by this insect has three curious 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.259
 appendix prescribe glue 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.519
 at the end of his body one that points to that I started to throw 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.849
 and two others that start from the tip towards the body to one side apart from the 2 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.589
 antenna 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.410
 that if you can not book 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.460
 is moving 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 I'm probably not well and then I'm standing still 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 raise of the poor one who is camouflaging 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 that persist his hip hop has done these things that normally live holes 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410
 that between the walls by the corners and streets 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.800
 will affect us by xavi in ​​broad daylight 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.450
 for kilograms profile 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.640
 Exquisite metal is the most normal thing to be fed 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.400
 of mushrooms and things and that grow from pipes and cables 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.530
 so in fact unlike princeton like cockroaches 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.900
 for worse things than if you exclude anything annoying 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.060
 and in fact beneficial they left the house 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.490
 this only insect that remain alive and in this day probably one of the most 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.490
 old 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.890
 that fossils of insects similar to this one have been found 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.890
 in the Carboniferous period even before 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 as it is logical by the time the one that comes they preferred humid places 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.440
 and because of that 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.440
 so the places with humidity in the house especially the bathrooms 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.110
 they are especially remarkable 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.300
 that's why I say that I do not have the remotest idea of ​​what you have written 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.880
 believe me that light was emitted 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 and according to adepa and according to dark room during the night 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.820
 bolivia and venezuela with ten months this is not what makes the day criminal 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.270
 since they are 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.270
 the department has added is exactly 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.690
 timoshenko and the service of the stretch of the day 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.020
 especially aggravated because he could learn something useful
