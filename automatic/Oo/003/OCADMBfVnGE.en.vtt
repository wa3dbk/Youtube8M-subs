that's not that's not art you know but I

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.699 
that's not that's not art you know but I
always<00:00:57.120> wanted<00:00:57.389> it<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.659> kind<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.589> an

always wanted it to be kind of an
interactive<00:00:59.069> thing<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.639> I<00:00:59.699> think<00:00:59.940> that's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
interactive thing and I think that's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.000 
interactive thing and I think that's
what<00:01:00.749> people<00:01:00.780> liked<00:01:01.229> about<00:01:01.409> it<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.829> liked

what people liked about it they liked

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.590 
what people liked about it they liked
the<00:01:02.159> idea<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.459> you<00:01:02.639> know<00:01:02.670> being<00:01:03.059> able<00:01:03.179> to<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.569> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the idea of you know being able to put a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
the idea of you know being able to put a
vision<00:01:04.470> or<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> thought<00:01:04.890> out<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> then

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
vision or a thought out there and then

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.970 
vision or a thought out there and then
the<00:01:05.790> next<00:01:05.820> day<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.180> see<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.480> materialized<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.320> in

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
the next day I see it materialized in in

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.970 
the next day I see it materialized in in
a<00:01:08.100> painting<00:01:08.550> and<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.910> think<00:01:09.120> it<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.300> became

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
a painting and I think it just became

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.270 
a painting and I think it just became
much<00:01:10.980> less<00:01:12.260> self-involved<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.620> it<00:01:14.010> became

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
much less self-involved and it became

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.460 
much less self-involved and it became
more<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.420> process<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.080> interacting

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
more about the process of interacting

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
more about the process of interacting
with<00:01:16.800> someone<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.280> finding<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.450> what

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
with someone and finding out what what

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.690 
with someone and finding out what what
really<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.350> capture<00:01:19.590> them<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.490> what

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
really would capture them and what

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
really would capture them and what
greeny<00:01:20.940> would<00:01:21.120> mean<00:01:21.270> something<00:01:21.660> to<00:01:21.780> them<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
greeny would mean something to them and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.380 
greeny would mean something to them and
sometimes<00:01:23.010> sometimes<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.610> doesn't<00:01:23.760> feel<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
sometimes sometimes it doesn't feel I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.920 
sometimes sometimes it doesn't feel I
knew<00:01:24.810> percent<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.280> wanted<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.930> but

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
knew percent the way you wanted to but

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.750 
knew percent the way you wanted to but
you<00:01:28.380> always<00:01:28.530> find<00:01:28.980> that<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.400> people

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
you always find that there are people

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.490 
you always find that there are people
out<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.510> those<00:01:30.810> pieces<00:01:31.140> more

out there that like those pieces more

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.610 
out there that like those pieces more
than<00:01:31.710> any<00:01:32.130> others<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.750> part

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
than any others and I think that's part

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.469 
than any others and I think that's part
of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> beauty<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.010> this<00:01:35.160> project

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.209 

now<00:01:38.020> what's<00:01:38.200> even<00:01:38.469> more<00:01:38.500> amazing<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.189> that

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
now what's even more amazing is that

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.499 
now what's even more amazing is that
this<00:01:39.460> young<00:01:39.670> lady<00:01:39.850> did<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.270> for<00:01:40.450> an

pursue that creativity in you but I was
looking<00:04:14.950> at<00:04:15.010> these<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.370> thinking<00:04:15.910> the

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
looking at these and thinking the

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.090 
looking at these and thinking the
surface<00:04:16.419> is<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:16.780> beautifully<00:04:17.350> kind<00:04:17.829> of<00:04:17.889> put

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
surface is so beautifully kind of put

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.830 
surface is so beautifully kind of put
together<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.880> must<00:04:19.090> be<00:04:19.150> quite<00:04:19.239> unforgiving

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
together it must be quite unforgiving

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.629 
together it must be quite unforgiving
painting<00:04:20.169> these<00:04:20.260> pictures<00:04:20.560> because<00:04:20.769> it's<00:04:21.489> got

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
painting these pictures because it's got

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.040 
painting these pictures because it's got
any<00:04:21.790> clean<00:04:22.060> all<00:04:22.389> around<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:22.870> you're<00:04:22.960> gonna

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
any clean all around and you're gonna

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.990 
any clean all around and you're gonna
have<00:04:23.139> this<00:04:23.229> one<00:04:23.560> focal<00:04:24.100> point<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.790> tell<00:04:24.910> me

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
have this one focal point and tell me

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.310 
have this one focal point and tell me
about<00:04:25.060> about<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.479> artistic<00:04:25.720> process<00:04:26.050> of

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
about about the artistic process of

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.010 
about about the artistic process of
creating<00:04:26.620> these<00:04:26.710> yeah<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.910> guess<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.660> what

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
creating these yeah I I guess the what

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.480 
creating these yeah I I guess the what
kind<00:04:29.229> of<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.410> quite<00:04:29.620> forgiving<00:04:30.040> so<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.280> can

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
kind of is quite forgiving so you can

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.890 
kind of is quite forgiving so you can
wash<00:04:30.639> it<00:04:30.790> away<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.210> you<00:04:31.300> can<00:04:31.450> sharpen<00:04:31.690> the

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
wash it away and you can sharpen the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.290 
wash it away and you can sharpen the
edges<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.740> there's<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.460> certain<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:34.030> certain

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
edges and there's a certain a certain

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.340 
edges and there's a certain a certain
amount<00:04:34.419> of<00:04:34.510> times<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:34.870> can<00:04:34.990> wash<00:04:35.169> away

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
amount of times that you can wash away

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.990 
amount of times that you can wash away
the<00:04:35.560> paint<00:04:35.740> until<00:04:36.039> it<00:04:36.130> actually<00:04:36.160> just<00:04:36.669> stays

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
the paint until it actually just stays

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.190 
the paint until it actually just stays
there<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.389> then<00:04:37.510> you<00:04:37.600> have<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.870> start<00:04:38.080> over

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
there and then you have to start over

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.960 
there and then you have to start over
but<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:38.889> doesn't<00:04:39.190> happen<00:04:39.280> too<00:04:39.789> often

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
but that doesn't happen too often

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.580

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
but also quite different because I need

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.980 
but also quite different because I need
something<00:05:36.580> to<00:05:36.760> be<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:36.880> bit<00:05:37.090> more<00:05:37.270> flexible<00:05:37.750> to

that<00:05:39.940> I've<00:05:40.150> had<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.419> turn<00:05:40.539> away<00:05:40.740> just<00:05:41.740> because

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
that I've had to turn away just because

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.680
