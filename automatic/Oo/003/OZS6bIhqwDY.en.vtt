00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.600
 Ronald the greater self-confidence after the good series of matches in to the end 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 on Sundays in which Eindhoven but it has not been successful for a long time 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.019
 well the woman is present but 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.029
 we didn't play well the last two games of course and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.609
 we do not build open either 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.429
 great series 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.749
 in recent years with psv from 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.859
 in which I find 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.109
 that his footballers often failed 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.360
 so yes I am not so convinced of that 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.300
 with teams recently said of but psv yes 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.860
 is a team 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.630
 that perhaps should take this form anyway 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.210
 well you didn't do that in advance 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.690
 it is irregular saadane good series that they lose the last two 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.220
 matches 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.910
 a lot of talent I have to do qualitatively a good group 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.960
 from a distance 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 but they are standing 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.900
 of course not where they belong and must understand that is clear 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.680
 but it is also a team that 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.130
 which can play football very well so yes it is just to form 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.620
 it is that she 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.240
 both in arrears or against cols then you will of course see the one there 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.770
 others go wrong 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.040
 he thinks this is underperforming in eindhoven 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 what do you think 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.039
 he gets a year 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.109
 I will call diamonds again on psv things 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.450
 think everyone does site psv 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.020
 considering the quality there is too low 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.450
 The recent relapse may have something to do with the absence of training 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.650
 also affects player thinking 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.000
 on the recent relapse after the third last two duels cause for it 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.200
 cooking in the middle and not with almeria 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.450
 the but not me 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.900
 no it is difficult to estimate 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 yes it is difficult the cambuur I can not judge 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.350
 it is very important to postpone a possible title party in an arena 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.140
 so it's still important for you 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.280
 no that is mandatory 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 I think the most important thing is that I think we are 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.600
 being able to take a good step to the second place 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 and if that's because of that do the party in Amsterdam 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.429
 a week later must 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.829
 then it is not 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:12.939
 it not bad 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.449
 whole you actually have to win was created to be able to finish under encounter 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.589
 and for me to clear up the dreamed or desired end of the competition 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.790
 mean that you will also play like that to win with that intention but we 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.939
 always play to win 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.310
 and before you play 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.819
 I never think that is important either 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.619
 how you play pli you have to show initiative and you have to last 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.959
 soccer to win and m 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.959
 I never go anywhere with the idea of 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:47.859
 a point with it I go everywhere with the idea of ​​winning a competition 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.859
 and for that you have to attack and then you have to put pressure 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.449
 what we always try to do 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.749
 is via a serious option to play like in Groningen with five defenders 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.429
 after they always look an option 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.739
 because I have said that before 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.799
 that's why we regularly train that 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.150
 That also has for the other games of the past twenty 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.859
 done that it has always been different once in a while just drop 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.199
 give players the feeling that we can play multiple systems and 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.659
 it is also an option for one for me that i have said before to the 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.119
 sometimes changing a cat into a competition 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:26.769
 against the opponent 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.769
 put then the experience of the prizes may be important Sunday in such a competition 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.009
 experience is always important 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.739
 certainly basket at moments like this 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.340
 it is always broken because of the new come closer to you what you want 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.499
 to achieve 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.989
 but yes that dacom excitement when watching participate trainer are not today 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.460
 yes it said what bothered from his knee 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.019
 but we will wait until tomorrow 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.889
 whether he is fit enough to be with the group
