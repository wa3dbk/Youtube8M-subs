00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:11.110
 The Chrysler Crossfire Concept will be released when a prototype traveling photo is released 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.709
 At the same time the version was announced 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:20.680
 It was under the same group umbrella by throwing the chassis packing bead. 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:23.820
 The mass-produced model is only two years later because it was used from the Mercedes-Benz slk 320 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 Completed in 2003 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:36.250
 Mass production type cross fire is greatly miniaturized according to the picture of slk and further front 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:41.140
 The design of around was reworked for the production efficiency and international of this standard 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:47.190
 However , the character of the body, which is the design identity, and the character 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:53.789
 The line and distinctive rear design were well inherited 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:58.460
 Production body production of convenient and yet complex shapes to parts supply from Mercedes-Benz 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.900
 Karmann of Germany is in charge with the excellent know-how in 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.540
 pros fire 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.540
 And r one's degree fallen snow say to be produced in Germany to use the components of German cars 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.580
 It is not became 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:18.910
 Mechanical components generate maximum output of 218 horsepower 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:21.480
 3.2 liter v6 sohc engine transmission up to 2 turns slk 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.950
 Exactly the same as 32 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:33.090
 It does not change the suspension and brake in common also wheelbase 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.350
 The difference is slinch 32 up to 17 inches back and front 18 inches rear 19 inches 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.520
 Expanded to 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.780
 Tire size only 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:46.060
 However, the road that the body rigidity is greatly improved 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:49.560
 Performance as a sports car is cross because aerodynamic performance is further enhanced 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.159
 It is above the clear direction of fire 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.960
 Roadster model added to lineup in 2004 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.960
 I enriched the variation
