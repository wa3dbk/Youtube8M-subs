anything from half hour to an hour I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.360 
anything from half hour to an hour I
think<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:47.039> has<00:00:47.879> given<00:00:48.270> me<00:00:49.370> endurance

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
think that's what has given me endurance

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.950 
think that's what has given me endurance
enough<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.090> able<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.449> continue<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.379> ski

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
enough to be able to continue to ski

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.520 
enough to be able to continue to ski
it's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.140> question<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.969> what<00:00:56.969> comes<00:00:57.239> first<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it's a question of what comes first the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
it's a question of what comes first the
love<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.039> skiing<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.789> really<00:01:00.420> gives<00:01:00.660> me<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
love of skiing it really gives me the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.100 
love of skiing it really gives me the
inspiration<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.949> keep<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.730> shape<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
inspiration to keep in shape so that I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.250 
inspiration to keep in shape so that I
can<00:01:04.320> enjoy<00:01:05.030> being<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> snow<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.990> get

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
can enjoy being in the snow and I get

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.969 
can enjoy being in the snow and I get
here<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> motivation<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.439> matter

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
here I think the motivation is a matter

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.719 
here I think the motivation is a matter
of<00:01:11.100> attitude<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.920> we're<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.520> earth

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.330 
of attitude you know we're on this earth
just<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> short<00:01:16.140> while<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.420> there's<00:01:18.420> no<00:01:18.570> use

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
just a short while and there's no use

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.179 
just a short while and there's no use
trading<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.520> chips<00:01:20.970> too<00:01:21.270> early<00:01:22.189> you've

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
trading in your chips too early you've

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.060 
trading in your chips too early you've
got<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> stay<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.030> shape<00:01:24.270> you've<00:01:25.080> got<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.530> stay

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
got the stay in shape you've got to stay

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.679 
got the stay in shape you've got to stay
motivated<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:29.009> thought<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.610> coming<00:01:30.450> up

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
motivated and the thought of coming up

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.160 
motivated and the thought of coming up
here<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.259> ski<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.909> greater<00:01:33.299> motivation<00:01:33.810> all

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
here to ski is a greater motivation all

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.440 
here to ski is a greater motivation all
by<00:01:34.439> itself<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> wonderful

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
by itself because this is a wonderful

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.580 
by itself because this is a wonderful
activity<00:01:37.610> for<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.640> ages<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:40.409> it's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
activity for all ages I think it's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
activity for all ages I think it's
important<00:01:41.189> too

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
important too

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420 
important too
not<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.600> bite<00:01:42.840> off<00:01:43.050> more<00:01:43.350> than<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.890> chew

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
not to bite off more than you can chew

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
not to bite off more than you can chew
start<00:01:45.120> slowly<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.900> think<00:01:46.470> people<00:01:46.770> get

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
start slowly I think people get

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.610 
start slowly I think people get
discouraged<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.900> expect<00:01:48.900> too<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.290> too

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620
