00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.529
 Hi all 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.700
 let's change the brake pads 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.410
 of the motorbike 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.410
 we are going to do it in such a way 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.970
 that you are not going to have to take the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.190
 screws 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.660
 that hold the clamps 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.670
 ok we're going to do it in such a way 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.670
 it is the easiest way that exists 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.610
 the first thing you have to do 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 is to take out these two pins 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.420
 what is here 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.790
 we have a pin 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.210
 and the other 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.580
 and then we take out 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.220
 the piece that holds the pills that 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.940
 are these you see the holes that is 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.200
 where these pins go 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.200
 then we have to take out 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.980
 this piece 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.780
 if you see that there is an arrow this arrow 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.510
 have to go looking up what 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.610
 I say so that when you do not get the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.280
 place in the same position 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.159
 then the pills 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.240
 It's very easy because they come out 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.240
 no problem 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.320
 these are the old pills are not 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.740
 very worn 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.740
 as you see, he still has 0-2 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.770
 but we are going to change them 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.060
 before changing them we have to catch 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.220
 the pistons 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.470
 and with a clothespin itself 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.600
 let's throw them in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.600
 doing a little bit of leverage 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.600
 It is very easy 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.710
 if you do not take a cue 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.710
 and with the cue a wooden cue 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.340
 until the pistons are up to 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.340
 final 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.040
 another way you have so that the 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.510
 pistons go inwards is before 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.349
 take out the pills 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.349
 you give him 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.170
 with a screwdriver you give this 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.349
 way 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.650
 as you can see the pistons move and not 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:06.659
 you have to put pressure on the disc 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.659
 a good way too 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.549
 in the front calipers remember 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.879
 take out this piece and put it in the other 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.879
 tablet 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.290
 and we put it 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.209
 we have not placed it 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.549
 we look at the arrow going towards 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.549
 above 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.410
 we put it like that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.200
 the pin 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.420
 we introduce it through the holes of the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.420
 tweezers between the piece 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.020
 you will see it is very easy 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.040
 and we put back 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.040
 the pin 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.550
 Well, it's done now, just 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.229
 you have to pump the brake 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.229
 until the pistons 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.649
 touch with 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.889
 pills 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.860
 we have done it on a disk 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:49.759
 and now we have to do it in the other 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.330
 for the rear brake we have to remove 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.330
 this screw 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:05:00.569
 once we have removed it 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:05.899
 with an allen key of 5 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.899
 we take them out we take out the screw this 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.050
 what is the pin that holds the 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.050
 pills 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.510
 once 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:28.750
 we remove the pin 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.630
 We do the same operation with a 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:36.470
 screwdriver we press 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:40.180
 what are the pills for 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.180
 pistons push them back 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.450
 we take him out 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.450
 the pills 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.530
 we remove the screw this 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.440
 and in this way we get it right 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.289
 the other tablet 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.480
 now look good 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:13.310
 this is the old 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.510
 it is not spent absolutely at all 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.510
 they are almost intact 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.790
 what happens 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.840
 I'm going to change them because they're very, very 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.840
 cracked 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.240
 and good as I changed the front 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:36.120
 I'm going to put the backs 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.819
 now in these clamps you have these 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.630
 pieces that you just have to 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:44.710
 remove is the anti screech that has and 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:49.540
 put it 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:52.260
 in the other it is very simple to take out and put 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.620
 Okay, you have it all, put it back 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.620
 and ready
