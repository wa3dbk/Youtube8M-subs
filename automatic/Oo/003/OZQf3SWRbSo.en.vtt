00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
there this rally unfortunately is placed

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.349 
there this rally unfortunately is placed
that<00:03:30.329> it's<00:03:30.959> been<00:03:31.260> no<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:32.160> resembles<00:03:32.819> metal

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
that it's been no so it resembles metal

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:40.610 
that it's been no so it resembles metal
but<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.410> plastic<00:03:35.840> exhaust<00:03:36.840> stack<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:39.620> fuel

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
wondering what that's for that is for

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.740 
wondering what that's for that is for
the<00:04:05.130> piece<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.639> goes<00:04:05.819> on<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.209> bottom<00:04:06.420> of<00:04:06.630> the

the piece that goes on the bottom of the
boom<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.950> actually<00:04:08.430> plastic<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.389> there

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
boom that is actually plastic in there

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.930 
boom that is actually plastic in there
because<00:04:10.739> when<00:04:10.950> they<00:04:11.040> cast<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> boom<00:04:11.609> it's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
because when they cast the boom it's

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.610 
because when they cast the boom it's
only<00:04:12.150> casted<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.569> three<00:04:12.840> sides<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.260> then<00:04:13.410> they

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
only casted on three sides and then they

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.339 
only casted on three sides and then they
add<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.100> plastic<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.959> at<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.200> bottom

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
add the plastic to it so at the bottom

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.279 
add the plastic to it so at the bottom
of<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.650> boom<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:16.950> plastic<00:04:17.430> but<00:04:17.489> this<00:04:18.289> both

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
of the boom is plastic but this both

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.570 
of the boom is plastic but this both
sides<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.890> top<00:04:20.159> is
