this whole face I got used to it and
it<00:02:06.540> also<00:02:06.689> works<00:02:07.140> well<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> concealer<00:02:08.399> for

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.160 
it also works well as a concealer for
your<00:02:08.880> eyes<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.270> well<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.569> your<00:02:09.690> lips<00:02:09.929> when

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
you're applying it over your face though

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.880 
you're applying it over your face though
if<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.720> choose<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.230> put<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.680> top<00:02:13.860> of

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
if you do choose to put it on top of

if you do choose to put it on top of
your<00:02:14.100> eyes<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.640> would<00:02:14.880> suggest<00:02:15.060> applying<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
your eyes I would suggest applying a

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.050 
your eyes I would suggest applying a
primer<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.890> concealer<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.400> top<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.850> if

primer and concealer on top of that if
you<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.180> double<00:02:18.569> eyelids<00:02:18.959> like<00:02:19.140> me<00:02:19.520> the

maybe people actually concentrate where
your<00:02:23.160> lid<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:24.000> when<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.300> blink<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
your lid is because when you blink and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.570
