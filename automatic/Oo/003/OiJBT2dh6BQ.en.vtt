00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you think some protein is gonna pretty

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.190 
you think some protein is gonna pretty
much<00:00:44.160> anything<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> chef<00:00:45.329> anyway<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
of course the math macronutrient ratio

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
of course the math macronutrient ratio
that's<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> determine<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:03.989> body

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that's going to determine your body

protein is man on thin protein is that's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.990 
protein is man on thin protein is that's
a<00:01:11.070> macronutrient

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
a macronutrient

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240 
a macronutrient
and<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.930> protein<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.890> doesn't

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and all it is it's protein it doesn't

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.130 
and all it is it's protein it doesn't
matter<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> name<00:01:14.820> brand<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.600> doesn't<00:01:15.750> matter

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
who sells it you know it's of course you

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.730 
who sells it you know it's of course you
got<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.180> casings<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.560> weight

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
got your casings and your weight

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.399 
got your casings and your weight
isolates<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.729> your<00:01:21.420> weight<00:01:21.600> concentrates

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
isolates and your weight concentrates

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
isolates and your weight concentrates
but<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> still<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.400> fucking<00:01:24.090> protein<00:01:24.479> dude

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
but it still just fucking protein dude

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
but it still just fucking protein dude
don't<00:01:25.140> don't<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.740> caught<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> hype

you spend money you know say let me tell

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.810 
you spend money you know say let me tell
you<00:01:32.280> why<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.869> protein<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.439> Walmart<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.100> much

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you why the protein in Walmart is much

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
you why the protein in Walmart is much
cheaper<00:01:36.060> than<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.720> protein<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.799> doing

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
cheaper than the protein how you doing

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.690 
cheaper than the protein how you doing
man<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.939> protein<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.479> Walmart<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> much<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
man the protein at Walmart is much you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.969 
man the protein at Walmart is much you
know<00:01:41.850> saying<00:01:42.180> more<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.930> much<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.470> cheaper

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
know saying more it's much more cheaper

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.219 
know saying more it's much more cheaper
than<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> protein<00:01:44.909> you'll<00:01:45.060> probably<00:01:45.270> by<00:01:45.540> GNC

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
than the protein you'll probably by GNC

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.480 
than the protein you'll probably by GNC
or<00:01:46.380> Vitamin<00:01:47.220> Shoppe

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490

or Vitamin Shoppe
all<00:01:48.060> right<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.780> protein<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:50.270> vitamin<00:01:51.270> shop

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
all right the protein at a vitamin shop

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.300 
all right the protein at a vitamin shop
they<00:01:52.020> actually<00:01:52.470> got<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> make<00:01:52.860> their<00:01:53.070> money

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310

they actually got to make their money
you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:54.000> saying<00:01:54.240> these<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.750> super<00:01:55.110> huge

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you know saying these are not super huge
