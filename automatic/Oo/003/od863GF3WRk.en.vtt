for HP and you've made some

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.360 
for HP and you've made some
announcements<00:00:11.840> with<00:00:11.960> 3d<00:00:12.410> printing<00:00:12.889> now

announcements with 3d printing now
a<00:00:13.400> lot<00:00:14.179> of<00:00:14.300> us<00:00:14.389> hear<00:00:14.630> about<00:00:14.840> 3d<00:00:15.230> printing<00:00:15.820> tell

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
a lot of us hear about 3d printing tell

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.880 
a lot of us hear about 3d printing tell
us<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.660> significance<00:00:17.869> of<00:00:18.410> what<00:00:18.470> you've<00:00:18.710> got

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
us the significance of what you've got

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.310 
us the significance of what you've got
behind<00:00:19.070> me<00:00:19.369> yeah<00:00:19.699> so<00:00:19.730> today<00:00:20.390> we<00:00:20.570> introduced<00:00:21.020> a

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
behind me yeah so today we introduced a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.099 
behind me yeah so today we introduced a
new<00:00:21.350> 3d<00:00:22.250> printing<00:00:22.609> technology<00:00:23.150> called<00:00:23.449> multi

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
new 3d printing technology called multi

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.099 
new 3d printing technology called multi
jet<00:00:24.439> fusion<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:25.220> what<00:00:26.180> it<00:00:26.300> does<00:00:26.510> it<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:26.869> really

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
jet fusion and what it does it it really

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.769 
jet fusion and what it does it it really
is<00:00:27.320> a<00:00:27.350> breakthrough<00:00:27.830> in<00:00:28.279> 3d<00:00:28.640> printing<00:00:28.670> in<00:00:29.359> the

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
is a breakthrough in 3d printing in the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.520 
is a breakthrough in 3d printing in the
sense<00:00:30.019> it<00:00:30.140> makes<00:00:30.380> itself<00:00:30.710> well<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:31.870> it<00:00:32.870> it's

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
sense it makes itself well it it it's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.829 
sense it makes itself well it it it's
ten<00:00:33.859> times<00:00:34.100> faster<00:00:34.670> than<00:00:34.999> any<00:00:35.179> other<00:00:35.479> 3d

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
ten times faster than any other 3d

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.689 
ten times faster than any other 3d
printing<00:00:36.289> technology<00:00:36.829> on<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.249> market<00:00:37.579> today

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
printing technology on the market today

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.059 
printing technology on the market today
it<00:00:38.359> gives<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:38.719> incredible<00:00:39.050> quality<00:00:39.889> in<00:00:40.039> terms

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:40.069 
it gives you incredible quality in terms

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.579 
it gives you incredible quality in terms
of<00:00:40.399> both<00:00:40.609> robustness<00:00:41.569> of<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:41.839> parts<00:00:42.229> but<00:00:42.440> also

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
of both robustness of the parts but also

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:44.289 
of both robustness of the parts but also
the<00:00:42.829> precision<00:00:43.399> of<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.579> part<00:00:43.879> that<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.149> can

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
the precision of the part that you can

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.689 
the precision of the part that you can
create<00:00:44.569> and<00:00:45.139> it's<00:00:45.530> going<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.799> allow<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.280> much

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
create and it's going to allow a much

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.329 
create and it's going to allow a much
lower<00:00:46.999> car<00:00:47.389> a<00:00:47.659> lower-cost<00:00:48.649> part<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.219> be

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
lower car a lower-cost part to be

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.759 
lower car a lower-cost part to be
constructed<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:50.659> it<00:00:51.199> gives<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.559> that

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
constructed so it gives you that

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.299 
constructed so it gives you that
combination<00:00:52.100> of<00:00:52.579> speed<00:00:53.389> quality<00:00:54.139> and<00:00:54.679> low

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
combination of speed quality and low

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.479 
combination of speed quality and low
cost<00:00:55.579> now<00:00:56.119> this<00:00:56.479> is<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.719> rather<00:00:57.199> big<00:00:57.739> machine

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
cost now this is a rather big machine

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.399 
cost now this is a rather big machine
behind<00:00:58.879> me<00:00:58.999> this<00:00:59.179> is<00:00:59.329> not<00:00:59.539> a<00:00:59.569> home<00:00:59.959> printer

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
behind me this is not a home printer

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.559 
behind me this is not a home printer
clearly<00:01:01.249> well<00:01:01.519> no<00:01:01.729> it's<00:01:01.909> not<00:01:01.999> a<00:01:02.089> home<00:01:02.329> printer

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
clearly well no it's not a home printer

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.060 
clearly well no it's not a home printer
unless<00:01:02.779> you<00:01:02.899> have<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.049> really<00:01:03.319> large<00:01:03.499> room<00:01:03.859> that

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
unless you have a really large room that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.500 
unless you have a really large room that
you<00:01:04.190> can<00:01:04.309> put<00:01:04.519> it<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:05.330> really

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
you can put it in but it's really

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.240 
you can put it in but it's really
designed<00:01:06.020> for<00:01:06.200> what<00:01:06.409> we<00:01:06.500> call<00:01:06.680> central

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
designed for what we call central

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.370 
designed for what we call central
production<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:08.509> where<00:01:08.689> you'll<00:01:08.840> see<00:01:09.170> that

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
production and so where you'll see that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.560 
production and so where you'll see that
it<00:01:09.680> will<00:01:09.799> be<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.100> enterprises<00:01:10.579> you<00:01:11.180> might<00:01:11.390> see

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
it will be in enterprises you might see

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.660 
it will be in enterprises you might see
it<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.719> retail<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.590> certainly<00:01:13.250> service

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
it in retail and certainly service

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.880 
it in retail and certainly service
providers<00:01:14.270> companies<00:01:14.960> like<00:01:15.140> Shapeways<00:01:15.649> who

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
providers companies like Shapeways who

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.249 
providers companies like Shapeways who
is<00:01:16.039> at<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.310> event<00:01:16.579> they<00:01:17.060> actually<00:01:17.450> provide<00:01:17.750> 3d

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
is at the event they actually provide 3d

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.149 
is at the event they actually provide 3d
printing<00:01:18.679> parts<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.960> consumers<00:01:20.990> now<00:01:21.829> what

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
printing parts to consumers now what

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.520 
printing parts to consumers now what
talk<00:01:22.969> about<00:01:23.270> 3d<00:01:23.659> printing<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.170> one<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:24.409> those

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
talk about 3d printing is one of those

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.109 
talk about 3d printing is one of those
things<00:01:24.740> people<00:01:24.829> are<00:01:25.100> starting<00:01:25.640> here<00:01:25.789> a<00:01:25.820> lot<00:01:26.000> of

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
things people are starting here a lot of

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.969 
things people are starting here a lot of
that<00:01:26.240> again<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:26.689> not<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.869> consumer<00:01:27.679> product

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
that again it's not a consumer product

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.289 
that again it's not a consumer product
per<00:01:28.219> se<00:01:28.460> although<00:01:28.609> there<00:01:28.939> are<00:01:29.090> some

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
per se although there are some

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.239 
per se although there are some
inexpensive<00:01:29.810> 3d<00:01:30.289> printers<00:01:30.649> out<00:01:30.829> there<00:01:31.070> and

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
inexpensive 3d printers out there and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.489 
inexpensive 3d printers out there and
does<00:01:31.759> HP<00:01:31.969> actually<00:01:32.509> have<00:01:32.600> designs<00:01:33.049> for<00:01:33.439> the

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499 
does HP actually have designs for the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.770 
does HP actually have designs for the
home<00:01:33.649> market<00:01:33.829> with<00:01:34.249> 3d<00:01:34.549> printing<00:01:34.880> well<00:01:35.240> what

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
home market with 3d printing well what

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.279 
home market with 3d printing well what
we<00:01:35.899> want<00:01:36.079> to<00:01:36.259> do<00:01:36.469> is<00:01:37.420> basically<00:01:38.420> customers<00:01:39.229> are

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
we want to do is basically customers are

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.539 
we want to do is basically customers are
going<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.469> have<00:01:39.560> choice<00:01:39.799> but<00:01:40.070> with<00:01:40.219> this

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
going to have choice but with this

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.569 
going to have choice but with this
technology<00:01:41.450> multi<00:01:42.020> jet<00:01:42.229> fusion<00:01:42.259> because<00:01:43.130> of

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
technology multi jet fusion because of

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.929 
technology multi jet fusion because of
the<00:01:43.700> speed<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.569> low<00:01:44.719> cost<00:01:45.020> we<00:01:45.619> think<00:01:45.939> the

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
the speed and the low cost we think the

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.149 
the speed and the low cost we think the
consumer<00:01:47.689> will<00:01:47.840> have<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.259> choice<00:01:48.499> they'll<00:01:49.039> be

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
consumer will have a choice they'll be

technology and we're basically using

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.000 
technology and we're basically using
what<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.700> call<00:02:39.030> kind<00:02:39.629> of<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.900> fusing<00:02:40.379> agent<00:02:40.860> on

what we call kind of a fusing agent on
there<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.730> we're<00:02:41.910> able<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.239> basically<00:02:42.989> jet

to find the image on a bed of material

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.660 
to find the image on a bed of material
get<00:02:48.450> an<00:02:48.599> energy<00:02:48.780> source<00:02:49.260> basically<00:02:49.829> fuse<00:02:50.459> it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
get an energy source basically fuse it

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.670 
get an energy source basically fuse it
and<00:02:50.849> build<00:02:51.239> up<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> product<00:02:51.959> layer<00:02:52.440> by<00:02:52.650> layer

and build up the product layer by layer

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.370 
and build up the product layer by layer
but<00:02:53.400> because<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.269> speed<00:02:54.630> at<00:02:54.840> which<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:55.200> can

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
but because of the speed at which we can

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.140 
but because of the speed at which we can
do<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.769> can<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.129> rapidly<00:02:56.760> build<00:02:57.030> these

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
do we can just rapidly build these

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.000 
do we can just rapidly build these
layers<00:02:57.480> up<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.410> way<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.829> can

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
layers up in a way that you can

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.240 
layers up in a way that you can
construct<00:02:59.459> products<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.829> times<00:03:01.829> that<00:03:02.010> have

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
construct products and times that have

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.710 
construct products and times that have
not<00:03:02.430> been<00:03:02.459> possible<00:03:02.819> before

now<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:04.110> say<00:03:04.410> low<00:03:04.650> cost<00:03:05.010> where<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.879> talk<00:03:06.090> about

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
now you say low cost where we talk about

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.059 
now you say low cost where we talk about
how<00:03:06.480> how<00:03:06.660> expensive<00:03:06.959> is<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:07.530> thing<00:03:07.739> well

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
how how expensive is this thing well

2016<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.209> gathered<00:03:15.600> 2016<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.680> what<00:03:16.859> will<00:03:17.010> be

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
2016 I gathered 2016 is what will be

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.099 
2016 I gathered 2016 is what will be
available<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.269> general<00:03:18.299> public

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
but in terms of cost what we will say is

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.569 
but in terms of cost what we will say is
a<00:03:21.329> product<00:03:21.870> cost<00:03:22.019> itself<00:03:22.470> relative<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> in

something<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:36.120> today<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.599> cannot<00:03:37.139> print<00:03:37.470> oh

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
something that today you cannot print oh

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.960 
something that today you cannot print oh
we<00:03:39.450> have<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.660> roadmap<00:03:39.959> certainly<00:03:40.950> what<00:03:41.669> it<00:03:41.819> can

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
we have a roadmap certainly what it can

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.180 
we have a roadmap certainly what it can
print<00:03:42.239> today<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:42.780> probably<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.380> not<00:03:43.410> doable

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
print today that probably is not doable

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.819 
print today that probably is not doable
is<00:03:44.370> actually<00:03:45.329> taking<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.900> band<00:03:46.139> of<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
is actually taking a band of the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.920 
is actually taking a band of the
precision<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.489> resolution<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.720> there's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
precision and resolution so there's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.300 
precision and resolution so there's
going<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.139> be<00:03:49.230> sorts<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:50.840> sophisticated<00:03:51.840> 3d

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
going to be sorts of sophisticated 3d

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.680 
going to be sorts of sophisticated 3d
parts<00:03:53.310> with<00:03:53.489> details<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.269> would<00:03:54.450> encourage

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
parts with details and I would encourage

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.030 
parts with details and I would encourage
you<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.930> go<00:03:55.019> around<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:55.440> look<00:03:55.590> at<00:03:55.739> some<00:03:55.919> of<00:03:55.980> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
you to go around and look at some of the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.740 
you to go around and look at some of the
samples<00:03:56.489> we're<00:03:56.910> printing<00:03:57.150> things<00:03:57.419> that<00:03:57.599> you

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
samples we're printing things that you

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.470 
samples we're printing things that you
cannot<00:03:58.200> print<00:03:58.500> because<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.310> fine<00:03:59.970> details

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
cannot print because of the fine details

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.809 
cannot print because of the fine details
that<00:04:00.690> you're<00:04:00.840> unable<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.560> actually<00:04:01.819> construct

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
that you're unable to actually construct

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.629 
that you're unable to actually construct
with<00:04:03.269> other<00:04:03.510> 3d<00:04:03.870> printing<00:04:04.200> technologies<00:04:04.739> all

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
with other 3d printing technologies all

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.129 
with other 3d printing technologies all
right<00:04:05.819> Steve<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.329> show<00:04:06.569> us<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.810> couple<00:04:06.959> of

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
right Steve so show us a couple of

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.539 
right Steve so show us a couple of
things<00:04:07.319> you<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.650> actually<00:04:07.799> print<00:04:08.190> with<00:04:08.400> this

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
things you can actually print with this

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.420 
things you can actually print with this
thing<00:04:08.790> okay<00:04:09.120> well<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.569> first<00:04:09.780> one<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:11.010> this

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
thing okay well the first one is this

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.720 
thing okay well the first one is this
dinosaur<00:04:12.299> skull<00:04:13.019> which<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.560> why<00:04:14.190> all<00:04:14.220> needed

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
dinosaur skull which is why all needed

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.980 
dinosaur skull which is why all needed
dinosaurs

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
dinosaurs

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.229 
dinosaurs
and<00:04:16.140> Halloween<00:04:16.620> yeah<00:04:16.920> exactly<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.880> can<00:04:18.150> do

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
and Halloween yeah exactly you can do

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.270 
and Halloween yeah exactly you can do
any<00:04:18.420> of<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.720> but<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.170> is<00:04:19.320> like<00:04:19.500> very<00:04:19.860> cool

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
any of this but this is like very cool

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.550 
any of this but this is like very cool
and<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.730> lot<00:04:20.910> of<00:04:20.940> fine<00:04:21.180> details<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:22.200> other<00:04:22.350> one

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
and a lot of fine details the other one

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.170 
and a lot of fine details the other one
this<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.800> actually<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.280> future<00:04:23.700> capability

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
this is actually a future capability

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.450 
this is actually a future capability
color<00:04:24.480> and<00:04:25.050> really<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.410> cannot<00:04:25.830> print<00:04:26.190> color

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
color and really you cannot print color

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.160 
color and really you cannot print color
parts<00:04:26.850> today<00:04:26.970> with<00:04:27.240> strengths<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.810> certainly

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
parts today with strengths and certainly

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.380 
parts today with strengths and certainly
with<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.500> fine<00:04:28.740> level<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.190> detail<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:29.820> this

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
with this fine level of detail so this

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.770 
with this fine level of detail so this
is<00:04:30.540> like<00:04:30.720> pretty<00:04:30.990> incredible<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.670> there's<00:04:33.510> so

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
is like pretty incredible and there's so

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.510 
is like pretty incredible and there's so
many<00:04:33.870> applications<00:04:34.110> whether<00:04:34.740> it's<00:04:35.010> for<00:04:35.280> kind

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
many applications whether it's for kind

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.240 
many applications whether it's for kind
of<00:04:35.640> an<00:04:35.790> architectural<00:04:36.480> or<00:04:36.930> certainly<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:38.100> can

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
of an architectural or certainly you can

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.400 
of an architectural or certainly you can
imagine<00:04:38.370> for<00:04:38.730> your<00:04:38.880> kids<00:04:39.120> how<00:04:39.960> long<00:04:40.200> did<00:04:40.380> it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
imagine for your kids how long did it

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.410 
imagine for your kids how long did it
take<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.890> print<00:04:41.100> something<00:04:41.400> like<00:04:41.730> these<00:04:41.940> well

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
take to print something like these well

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.720 
take to print something like these well
these<00:04:42.990> will<00:04:43.410> be<00:04:43.530> printed<00:04:44.040> let's<00:04:44.310> say<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.610> this

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
these will be printed let's say in this

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.370 
these will be printed let's say in this
sort<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.060> orientation<00:04:45.240> this<00:04:45.990> will<00:04:46.170> probably

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
sort of orientation this will probably

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.550 
sort of orientation this will probably
take<00:04:46.560> about<00:04:47.040> 15<00:04:47.910> minutes<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.390> produce<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:49.410> if

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
take about 15 minutes to produce and if

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.320 
take about 15 minutes to produce and if
you<00:04:49.680> kind<00:04:49.980> of<00:04:50.040> think<00:04:50.100> about<00:04:50.520> anybody<00:04:50.880> who<00:04:51.150> has

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
you kind of think about anybody who has

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.430 
you kind of think about anybody who has
a<00:04:51.750> desktop<00:04:52.470> 3d<00:04:53.430> printer<00:04:53.810> there's<00:04:54.810> really<00:04:55.050> not

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
a desktop 3d printer there's really not

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.320 
a desktop 3d printer there's really not
a<00:04:55.500> lot<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.830> can<00:04:56.100> produce<00:04:56.250> in<00:04:56.550> 15<00:04:56.940> minutes

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
a lot you can produce in 15 minutes

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.130 
a lot you can produce in 15 minutes
