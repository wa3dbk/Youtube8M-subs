I<00:02:39.989> look<00:02:40.230> here<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.800> about<00:02:41.370> phone<00:02:41.670> section<00:02:42.300> so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
I look here the about phone section so

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.580 
I look here the about phone section so

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
you can see this is the young for pas

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.710 
you can see this is the young for pas
1n0<00:02:48.290> version<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.800> for<00:02:50.550> those<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.970> want<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.300> see

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.870 
the version there and you can see
basically<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> build<00:02:58.260> date<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.739> very<00:02:58.880> recent

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
basically the build date is very recent

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.800 
basically the build date is very recent
August<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.930> 15th<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:02.090> think<00:03:03.090> there's<00:03:03.660> also

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
August the 15th I think there's also

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
August the 15th I think there's also
where<00:03:04.319> another<00:03:04.590> smaller<00:03:05.040> update<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.760> you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
where another smaller update that you

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.559 
where another smaller update that you
can<00:03:06.150> flash<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.769> if<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:08.069> are<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:08.819> Android

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
can flash on if you are on like Android

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.680 
can flash on if you are on like Android
5.0<00:03:10.230> which<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.800> freedom<00:03:11.160> 4<00:03:11.459> megabytes<00:03:11.940> by<00:03:12.660> a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
5.0 which like freedom 4 megabytes by a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.220 
5.0 which like freedom 4 megabytes by a
flashed<00:03:13.080> on<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.440> larger<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.069> here<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.200> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
flashed on the larger one here so that I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.690 
flashed on the larger one here so that I
can<00:03:16.500> get<00:03:16.739> nice<00:03:16.980> clean<00:03:17.310> install<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.670> yeah<00:03:20.670> I

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
can get nice clean install so yeah I

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.170 
can get nice clean install so yeah I
think<00:03:21.049> that's<00:03:22.049> about<00:03:22.470> colors<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.310> really<00:03:23.340> here

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
think that's about colors it really here

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.620 
think that's about colors it really here
what<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.019> wanted<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.470> cover<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:26.100> did<00:03:26.610> do<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.390> to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
what I wanted to cover I did do a and to

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.180 
what I wanted to cover I did do a and to
to<00:03:27.930> speed<00:03:28.620> test<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.470> got<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.829> score

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
to speed test of it and I got this score

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.220 
to speed test of it and I got this score
we<00:03:32.820> should<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.269> honest<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.720> think<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:34.049> actually

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
we should be honest I think is actually

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.949 
we should be honest I think is actually
a<00:03:34.440> bit<00:03:34.620> lower<00:03:34.860> than<00:03:35.190> why<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.150> got<00:03:36.390> on<00:03:36.600> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
a bit lower than why I got on the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.920 
a bit lower than why I got on the
android<00:03:37.590> 5.0.2<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.390> remember<00:03:39.690> getting

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
android 5.0.2 I do remember getting

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.430 
android 5.0.2 I do remember getting
about<00:03:40.820> 49,000<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.510> maybe<00:03:42.930> it's<00:03:43.200> just<00:03:43.290> a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
about 49,000 so maybe it's just a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.140 
about 49,000 so maybe it's just a
one-off<00:03:43.650> but<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> don't<00:03:44.519> think<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.850> huge

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
one-off but I don't think is a huge

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.849 
one-off but I don't think is a huge
difference<00:03:45.750> here<00:03:45.989> when<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.260> comes<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
difference here when it comes to the

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.479 
difference here when it comes to the
performance<00:03:47.010> gains<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.630> do<00:03:49.160> bear<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.370> in

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
performance gains so do bear that in

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.750 
performance gains so do bear that in
mind<00:03:50.519> here<00:03:51.480> but<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.410> know<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> think<00:03:52.680> it's<00:03:53.519> good

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
mind here but you know I think it's good

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.670 
mind here but you know I think it's good
that<00:03:53.790> cyanogen<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.690> still<00:03:54.959> supporting<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
that cyanogen is still supporting the

oneplus one here now we have the oneplus

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.130 
oneplus one here now we have the oneplus
