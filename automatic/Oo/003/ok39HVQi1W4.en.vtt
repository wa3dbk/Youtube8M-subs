surprisingly enough boo Jin's are a fair
deck<00:03:25.090> even<00:03:26.090> though<00:03:26.300> they<00:03:27.190> have<00:03:28.190> some<00:03:28.520> of<00:03:28.610> the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
deck even though they have some of the

qualities of generating +1 as this and
that<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.870> reason<00:03:33.140> why<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.320> call<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.709> kind

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
that and the reason why I call it kind

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.030 
that and the reason why I call it kind
of<00:03:34.130> fair<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:34.600> because<00:03:35.709> they<00:03:36.709> have<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:36.860> lot<00:03:37.010> of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
of fair is because they have a lot of

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.160 
of fair is because they have a lot of
clauses<00:03:37.610> where<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.420> could<00:03:38.540> only<00:03:38.660> control<00:03:38.990> one

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
clauses where you could only control one

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.070 
clauses where you could only control one
of<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.890> can<00:03:40.010> do<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.370> once<00:03:40.580> per<00:03:40.700> turn

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
of this you can do this once per turn

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.440 
of this you can do this once per turn
you<00:03:42.080> know<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.860> reliance<00:03:43.280> on<00:03:43.370> your<00:03:44.030> motto<00:03:44.270> to
