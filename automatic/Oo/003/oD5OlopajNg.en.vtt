00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.640
 so friends now let's see how 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.369
 do this trick but the trick is generally childish 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.349
 that is, there is even no need 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.439
 no there 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.839
 and Joseph in communication the account is not necessary 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.240
 just essentially a column on that dogs 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.830
 and we say that often 1 our viewers who 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.069
 willing to show of course we will be behind this 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.069
 suspicious work 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.630
 giving was instituted 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.740
 and I arbitrarily any card 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.140
 but when i look at the cynicism map we 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 remember csc we take got 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.569
 there 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:36.220
 we look small 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.220
 ecologist this will be a card stuck 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.450
 that is, we give the audience 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.780
 card then belly 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.180
 ladies black date that is, we still give the lady 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.260
 black i.e. crosses 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.930
 still would 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.070
 Christine Damm 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.120
 and we say that in October let's say 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.240
 vicious circle 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.820
 Alexey Belyaev 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.470
 yourself but by the time they elected 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.650
 by specialists 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.380
 scrolling up to the top card 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.980
 remember the top card to another 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.950
 I do not know will be shorter rub 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.830
 mechnikova foliage further 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.490
 they talk about themselves and oh yeah 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.480
 yes taste in Kiev 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.480
 let's shorten 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.450
 that's all you have to do 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.770
 suppose zoom 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.700
 king crowded 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.940
 Dayan head flooded number one he does not take 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.020
 we say counting cards on the table in any 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.420
 moment stop putting your card and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.980
 in the Caucasus 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.430
 next card he starts counting 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.030
 sphere of life 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.950
 let's say he brought 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.270
 he stopped 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.050
 put your card 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.450
 since we have korepanova downstairs 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.120
 puddles just this bank 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.290
 and then when we flip through 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.690
 it will decline like this 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.800
 unit 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.680
 that is, we did it 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.730
 but when we started to take away from the top 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.830
 remember the first one is like that getting that 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.080
 autobike technique king shooting gone 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.389
 sleep do not execute we have something on top 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.159
 and then pass him 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.279
 that is, Moscow henchmen 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.699
 further we speak to the second hammered to make 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.659
 the same 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.659
 he gives them 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.599
 if building 300 does not match 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.399
 tired of 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:28.759
 he put his card 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.439
 and without knowing it will go to her 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.269
 his taught 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.919
 that is, we all know 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.389
 no abilities we can do 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.799
 laugh a couple of times 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.089
 unlikely to be 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:45.689
 map these measures so you ask 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.779
 so under laughter yes 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.689
 ask the viewers say stuck 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:50.559
 appeared 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.249
 Schleck Standard Shirokov 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:54.209
 the second slap plumecock said 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.069
 political scientist believe 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.069
 ranks go through karting 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.309
 got data 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.949
 and this card which 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.339
 here for you it is like the left yes for me she 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.639
 on the right nato 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.009
 on the right side 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.149
 Blimey 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.789
 We do not think and under the code of the GTO viewers 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.359
 leafing on 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.119
 and under the king's code here he caught the king 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:20.459
 also king 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.589
 a fruit for the second type 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.469
 besieged 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.599
 and after that know th 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.129
 stuck Khmelnitsky 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.249
 stuck 30 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.349
 he is so cool simple trick but 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.709
 causes awesome delight and cool 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.730
 phenomenon so you can safely use
