00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.590
 in this number of chords let's see the 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.270
 strum of fan and of course a 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.269
 Once we have it where we are going to 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.980
 use be your applications 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.599
 the rips are the fundamental basis of 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.150
 the flamenco guitar are used 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.789
 very much in the dance of course 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.789
 because 90% or more is torn is the 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.679
 rhythmic basis there holds everything in 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.419
 the cante of course and on the guitar 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:35.000
 of the concert - - but also that 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.949
 from there it goes once we have the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
 rhythmic base with the rips we can go 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.910
 making melodies also tearing 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.829
 of fan in this case that is what 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.230
 let's try to serve to finish for 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.399
 finish falsetas and also the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.199
 performed normal they serve to 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.160
 in between the falsetas let's leave 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.960
 a mattress and supporting and putting a 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.480
 base where the melodies are being cut 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.050
 I'm going to explain the fan grater 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.150
 It consists of three three thumb executions 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.420
 upwards 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:10.480
 then we will go down with the ring and with 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.480
 the index would be 23 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.770
 Y 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.829
 some guitarists instead of using 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.179
 the ring using the little finger is my case 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.219
 I do not know why this would not be necessary either 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.719
 that is, physically we each have 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.210
 hand in a way and we take advantage 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.009
 then the nail a little bit longer 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.679
 little finger but it's a way that I have of 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.890
 the hand then we have the game of the 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:40.369
 doll that the fingers are like there 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.369
 caught without moving and then we do rest 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.479
 the stiff thumb we leave the hand like this 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.009
 we went down from ring and again we left the 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.009
 hand ready to raise the ring 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.920
 this 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.729
 t 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.729
 once we have this that is 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.240
 let's see some applications where 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.150
 appears the fan tearing by 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.740
 example let's do 7 8 9 and 10 in a 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.740
 bulería compass that would be this 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.560
 once and do 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.850
 simple let's start from 13 times 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.850
 6 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:03:09.459
 two 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:15.220
 12 36 or we make the formula and we finish 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.850
 with 7 8 9 and 10 that would be point 1 2 3 4 5 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.850
 6 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.660
 yes here in many auctions of for example 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.250
 by bulería a closing appears 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.400
 would follow for example would also be what 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.400
 same 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.170
 for example, from Malaga there is a 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.739
 introduction by malagueñas that we do 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.739
 the next 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:31.050
 then we can follow that what we have 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.050
 fact is 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.990
 if you have seen we always start with the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.639
 normal that is what we are repeating and 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.810
 when we have finished we return to 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.810
 add your thumb up 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.040
 and thanks 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.389
 a good formula to practice this 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.389
 it would be a shared verdial that would be 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:33.549
 for example by tanguillos to make a 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:36.239
 closures and I 've always made a tear 

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:36.239
 with two chords 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.590
 and it would be 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.670
 for example a very used thing is the 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.940
 closure by soleá we are playing for 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.940
 soleá 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.529
 let's close closed 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.510
 3 

00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:41.770
 Y 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.580
 and of course by rumba also a 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.580
 closing by rumba would be 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.190
 and 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.950
 seen then we have a technique that is the 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.170
 of the fan 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.480
 with all with all the applications that 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.690
 they are coming out like this we are going to go little by little 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.350
 seeing the technique and its applications we 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.350
 we see in the next
