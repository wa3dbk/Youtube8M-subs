00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.740
 the video analysis system is managed 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.600
 by Peter in between different pants 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.100
 cameramen and you and those 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.090
 from the youth academy of 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.779
 Sparta 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.700
 At FC Utrecht I think there is a line 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.860
 has been deployed to bring that to a higher level 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.510
 to bring the youth education also to more 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.150
 players to flow through to it 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.539
 first team in the field of 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.539
 video analysis 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.960
 we have also restarted there 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.260
 is being built and I make it here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:46.110
 also big steps what you do it is still 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.720
 fairly new we do have a ball 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.340
 use them over the years but 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.170
 not yet in the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 in the quantity as we are now 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.030
 they are mostly using it 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.200
 very nice and they really like it too 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.870
 very educational and 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.820
 is often the look of oh oh dear the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.390
 I should have been able to do this too 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.710
 see or want to see and in their 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.939
 development 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.700
 I think they feel that way 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.890
 that good good will means during 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 the match coding peter and pier all 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.760
 actions that happen on the field 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.229
 this is the first for analysis 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.900
 made and that saves a lot of time 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.330
 for the trainers that way we can 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.180
 very easy and fast after a match 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 images and so we can 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.070
 to the needs of the trainers 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.320
 go to select images wanted to say 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.330
 nevertheless a lot and can do a lot 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.670
 clarify what you yourself as 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.710
 trainer observes but also especially that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.900
 feeling with those guys but I stood or 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.140
 here or I did or this or he stood up 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.909
 free and then with images you can do that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.280
 pretty good with each other 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.560
 after the analysis the data appears on the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.240
 general server where all trainers use the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 have access to the competitions 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.259
 and that looks like this we have 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.060
 a code screen no more that and in it 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.030
 code screen are all individual 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
 players and basically everything that is in the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.909
 match happens 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.099
 of the structure of switching from 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.319
 a chance back and forth cone free 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.819
 stairs and that we can and 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.030
 we can choose through dog 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.030
 keep track of it and then after the game 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.329
 all moments of that roll out 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.920
 and we can find them very quickly 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.420
 if i now watch the match i 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.319
 behind this and so the competition exists 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.389
 young to young fc utrecht young az up 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.549
 click execute then i can see it 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:38.579
 possession percentage of fc utrecht 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:40.950
 65% was that of az 35% all coding 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.959
 now they are placed under the competition 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.340
 as you can see at the moment that I am 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.180
 him on to play the striker click 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.419
 with making image 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.939
 great then i will see that fc utrecht 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:57.030
 here the striker will search 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.760
 right now here the striker plays clip 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.719
 you walk something through so we see what it 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.939
 or sequel and then the moment will again 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.760
 skip to the following 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.079
 The striker and Utrecht are still playing 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.120
 not finished with the system 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.109
 there are still some points for improvement yes we 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.419
 are working on some ideas to put it on 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:22.229
 expand even further to players too 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:25.109
 send images online so that it 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:27.209
 can also look back at home and also the 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.209
 facilities here at the youth academies 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.430
 to expand in it so that we are optimal 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.549
 can use the images that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.549
 we have
