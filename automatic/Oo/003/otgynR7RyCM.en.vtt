00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
I started this review by saying it was

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.570 
I started this review by saying it was
way<00:04:57.900> too<00:04:57.960> small<00:04:58.410> but<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:58.980> know<00:04:59.010> what<00:04:59.250> being

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
way too small but you know what being

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.240 
way too small but you know what being
small<00:04:59.910> is<00:05:00.120> not<00:05:00.150> all<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.570> bad<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.890> means<00:05:02.100> that

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
small is not all that bad it means that

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.740
