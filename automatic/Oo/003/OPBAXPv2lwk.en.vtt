there's<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.710> long<00:00:45.860> time<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.100> go<00:00:46.339> now<00:00:46.519> maybe<00:00:47.030> it's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
there's a long time I go now maybe it's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.289 
there's a long time I go now maybe it's
a<00:00:47.659> long<00:00:47.839> time<00:00:48.049> maybe<00:00:48.559> we<00:00:48.799> start<00:00:49.010> i<00:00:49.729> think<00:00:50.210> we

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
a long time maybe we start i think we

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:51.460 
a long time maybe we start i think we
probably<00:00:50.479> left<00:00:50.839> ourselves<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.199> little<00:00:51.290> bit

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
probably left ourselves a little bit

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.259 
probably left ourselves a little bit
sure<00:00:51.619> i<00:00:51.830> think<00:00:52.040> if<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.640> weren't<00:00:52.790> out<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.030> only

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
sure i think if you weren't out the only

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.509 
sure i think if you weren't out the only
signed<00:00:53.540> equal<00:00:53.900> him<00:00:54.049> as<00:00:54.199> well<00:00:54.409> as<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.920> striker<00:00:55.250> i

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
signed equal him as well as a striker i

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:56.890 
signed equal him as well as a striker i
think<00:00:55.729> we're<00:00:55.879> looking<00:00:55.909> very<00:00:56.420> very<00:00:56.629> strong<00:00:56.809> i

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
think we're looking very very strong i

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.170 
think we're looking very very strong i
think<00:00:57.049> we'll<00:00:57.170> probably<00:00:57.400> be<00:00:58.400> a<00:00:58.430> little<00:00:58.549> bit<00:00:58.760> in

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
think we'll probably be a little bit in

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.520 
think we'll probably be a little bit in
terms<00:00:59.269> of<00:00:59.420> challenging<00:00:59.809> joseph<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:00.350> tight

terms of challenging joseph and tight

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.570
