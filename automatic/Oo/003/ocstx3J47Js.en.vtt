00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.420
 What really appeals to us the most 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.410
 namely is the artist and the art 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.730
 jürgen teller has been in ours since 2011 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 represented 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.100
 He has a cooperation with Helmut Lang 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.020
 made and, among other things, these works 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.900
 shown here 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.230
 and these photos with mcmenamy is he 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 Made in 1996 for the south german magazine 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.929
 jürgen dish had become charlotte 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.300
 Roche wanted as a conversation partner 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.390
 but for a long time she has canceled her today 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.390
 is ill and could not come 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.250
 How does your idea evolve? 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 campaigns because you continue to work 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.610
 I grew up in Bubenreuth 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:01.530
 but they are so relative 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:03.750
 similar to what one hears of music and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.780
 and and for what you are interested in 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.270
 and so on and so forth, and we 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.549
 wanted to start differently but as in 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.810
 Shoot does not title that way now 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.600
 model number abc have tried this too 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.799
 make what interests us only below 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.360
 Entrepreneur's breakfast had with 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.490

 He has his hands with him 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:38.930
 So all I as they are 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 Good things are also attractive 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.689

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.020

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:59.719

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.340
 otherwise not the connection would have the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.049
 Mark asked me to blame 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.720

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.349

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:55.510
 either I could tilt it that way 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:57.900
