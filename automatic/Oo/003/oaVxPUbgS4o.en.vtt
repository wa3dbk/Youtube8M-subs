too<00:05:26.260> long<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:27.160> it<00:05:27.340> does<00:05:27.580> have<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.820> little<00:05:28.060> bit<00:05:28.240> of

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
too long so it does have a little bit of

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.850 
too long so it does have a little bit of
orange<00:05:28.840> in<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.790> but<00:05:30.790> some<00:05:31.510> of<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:31.690> nuts<00:05:31.870> didn't

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
orange in it but some of the nuts didn't

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:44.070 
orange in it but some of the nuts didn't
get<00:05:33.010> bleached<00:05:33.310> but<00:05:36.360> that's<00:05:37.360> how<00:05:37.600> it<00:05:37.660> looks<00:05:43.080> so

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
get bleached but that's how it looks so

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.240 
get bleached but that's how it looks so
it's<00:05:44.260> my<00:05:44.440> final<00:05:44.710> look<00:05:45.130> at<00:05:46.169> my<00:05:47.169> closure<00:05:47.500> I'm<00:05:48.010> not

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
it's my final look at my closure I'm not

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.280 
it's my final look at my closure I'm not
a<00:05:48.280> hundred<00:05:48.610> percent<00:05:48.820> satisfied<00:05:49.690> with<00:05:50.020> how<00:05:50.169> it

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
a hundred percent satisfied with how it

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.210 
a hundred percent satisfied with how it
turned<00:05:50.320> out<00:05:51.780> but<00:05:52.780> this<00:05:53.110> was<00:05:53.410> my<00:05:53.800> second

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
turned out but this was my second

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.700 
turned out but this was my second
attempt<00:05:54.700> I'm<00:05:54.880> not<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.180> pro<00:05:55.510> at<00:05:55.750> this<00:05:55.990> believe<00:05:56.590> it

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
attempt I'm not a pro at this believe it

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.060 
attempt I'm not a pro at this believe it
or<00:05:56.800> not<00:05:56.860> um<00:05:58.229> so<00:05:59.229> I<00:05:59.260> think<00:05:59.620> I<00:05:59.830> did<00:05:59.979> a<00:06:00.010> pretty

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
or not um so I think I did a pretty

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.740 
or not um so I think I did a pretty
decent<00:06:00.400> job<00:06:00.639> with<00:06:00.850> my<00:06:00.940> second<00:06:01.300> attempt<00:06:01.600> I

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
decent job with my second attempt I

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.000 
decent job with my second attempt I
think<00:06:02.080> I'm<00:06:02.169> going<00:06:02.320> to<00:06:02.380> going<00:06:02.530> to<00:06:02.590> do<00:06:02.680> is<00:06:02.800> I'm

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
think I'm going to going to do is I'm

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.600 
think I'm going to going to do is I'm
going<00:06:03.070> to<00:06:03.600> think<00:06:04.600> once<00:06:04.840> I<00:06:04.990> add<00:06:05.200> some<00:06:05.680> concealer

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
going to think once I add some concealer

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.270 
going to think once I add some concealer
to<00:06:06.940> the<00:06:07.930> you<00:06:08.440> see<00:06:08.650> some<00:06:08.830> of<00:06:08.860> the<00:06:08.979> knots<00:06:09.130> are

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
to the you see some of the knots are

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.000 
to the you see some of the knots are
bleach<00:06:09.580> but<00:06:10.330> um<00:06:10.510> I<00:06:10.960> think<00:06:11.080> if<00:06:11.470> i<00:06:11.590> add<00:06:11.740> some

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
bleach but um I think if i add some

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.670 
bleach but um I think if i add some
concealer<00:06:12.370> to<00:06:12.669> it<00:06:12.910> and<00:06:13.180> put<00:06:14.110> some<00:06:14.229> material

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
concealer to it and put some material

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.290 
concealer to it and put some material
underneath<00:06:14.889> the<00:06:15.669> closure<00:06:15.880> will<00:06:16.120> look<00:06:16.210> a

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
underneath the closure will look a

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.580 
underneath the closure will look a
little<00:06:16.510> bit<00:06:16.840> better<00:06:18.600> but<00:06:19.600> that's<00:06:20.169> my<00:06:20.380> final

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
little bit better but that's my final

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.590 
little bit better but that's my final
look<00:06:20.910> so<00:06:21.910> stay<00:06:22.780> tuned<00:06:23.430> to<00:06:24.430> my<00:06:25.090> other<00:06:25.300> video
