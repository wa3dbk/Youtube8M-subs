00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
doing the running and this is where I

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.149 
doing the running and this is where I
found<00:01:25.570> out<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:25.899> sometimes<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.680> doesn't<00:01:26.890> work

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
found out that sometimes it doesn't work

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.459 
found out that sometimes it doesn't work
you'll<00:01:27.399> just<00:01:27.579> get<00:01:27.759> one<00:01:28.149> extra<00:01:28.450> panda<00:01:29.020> spawn<00:01:29.289> in

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
you'll just get one extra panda spawn in

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.679 
you'll just get one extra panda spawn in
so<00:01:29.619> you're<00:01:29.740> left<00:01:29.859> to<00:01:29.979> if<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:31.030> happens<00:01:31.479> I

found just abandoned the quest

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.179 
found just abandoned the quest
pick<00:01:33.969> priorities<00:01:34.600> up<00:01:34.810> again<00:01:35.109> and<00:01:35.289> then<00:01:35.859> run

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189

and<00:01:36.429> fly<00:01:36.729> back<00:01:36.969> and<00:01:37.329> then<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.780> usually<00:01:38.109> works

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
and fly back and then it usually works

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.380 
and fly back and then it usually works
the<00:01:38.500> second<00:01:38.890> time<00:01:39.100> but<00:01:39.909> if<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.210> doesn't

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
message repeat it and it will eventually

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.330 
message repeat it and it will eventually
work<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:42.700> your<00:01:42.820> love<00:01:42.969> millions<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.659> pandas<00:01:44.340> and

when we head north and I'll highlight on

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.719 
when we head north and I'll highlight on
a<00:01:49.149> map<00:01:49.420> where<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.079> need<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.469> go<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:50.829> there's

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
a map where you need to go and there's

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.239 
a map where you need to go and there's
some<00:01:52.090> bamboo<00:01:52.479> pythons<00:01:53.259> now<00:01:53.619> these<00:01:53.770> are<00:01:53.920> elites

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
some bamboo pythons now these are elites

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.599 
some bamboo pythons now these are elites
and<00:01:54.520> they<00:01:54.670> gives<00:01:54.909> 65k<00:01:55.869> XP<00:01:56.469> per<00:01:57.100> kill<00:01:57.130> and

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
and they gives 65k XP per kill and

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.359 
and they gives 65k XP per kill and
there's<00:01:58.479> around<00:01:58.689> 12<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.320> them<00:01:59.499> spawned<00:01:59.859> so<00:02:00.310> you

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
there's around 12 of them spawned so you

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.760 
there's around 12 of them spawned so you
farm<00:02:00.759> all<00:02:00.969> of<00:02:01.090> those<00:02:01.270> down<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.840> then<00:02:02.649> they've

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
farm all of those down and then they've

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.919 
farm all of those down and then they've
got<00:02:02.799> about<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.100> five-minute<00:02:03.700> spawn<00:02:03.969> timer<00:02:04.270> so

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
got about a five-minute spawn timer so

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.359 
got about a five-minute spawn timer so
then<00:02:05.079> you<00:02:05.259> move<00:02:05.409> down<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.740> road<00:02:06.069> and<00:02:06.280> I'll

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
then you move down the road and I'll

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.730 
then you move down the road and I'll
highlight<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.999> as<00:02:07.149> well<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:08.410> kill

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
highlight this as well and you kill

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.190 
highlight this as well and you kill
bunches<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.819> deers<00:02:10.090> now<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.450> deers<00:02:10.810> only<00:02:11.050> give

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
bunches of deers now the deers only give

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.740 
bunches of deers now the deers only give
20k<00:02:11.800> XP<00:02:12.190> per<00:02:12.430> kill<00:02:12.460> but<00:02:12.880> they're<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.150> groups<00:02:13.510> of

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
20k XP per kill but they're in groups of

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.830 
20k XP per kill but they're in groups of
three<00:02:14.260> or<00:02:14.350> four<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.070> still<00:02:15.760> good<00:02:15.940> XP

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
three or four so it's still good XP

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.540 
three or four so it's still good XP
and<00:02:16.930> then<00:02:17.620> once<00:02:17.860> you've<00:02:17.980> killed<00:02:18.160> all<00:02:18.310> these

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
and then once you've killed all these

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.790 
and then once you've killed all these
you<00:02:18.819> go<00:02:19.000> back<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.720> Pythons<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.290> respond

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
you go back in the Pythons of respond

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.740 
you go back in the Pythons of respond
and<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.040> just<00:02:21.220> farmed<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.090> did<00:02:22.360> level

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
and you just farmed that and I did level

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.869 
and you just farmed that and I did level
85<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.830> 86<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:24.879> 57<00:02:25.840> minutes<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:27.099> do<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.849> math

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
85 to 86 in 57 minutes so do the math

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.229 
85 to 86 in 57 minutes so do the math
that<00:02:28.390> maze<00:02:29.260> in<00:02:29.440> experience<00:02:30.040> while<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.970> works

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
that maze in experience while this works

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.500 
that maze in experience while this works
best<00:02:31.599> from<00:02:32.170> 85<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.769> 87<00:02:33.400> because<00:02:34.090> after<00:02:34.390> that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
best from 85 to 87 because after that

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.330 
best from 85 to 87 because after that
the<00:02:34.750> XP<00:02:35.110> drops<00:02:35.410> from<00:02:35.709> your<00:02:35.860> game<00:02:35.950> from<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the XP drops from your game from the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.420 
the XP drops from your game from the
mobs<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.879> it's<00:02:37.840> no<00:02:37.989> longer<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.739> quick<00:02:39.099> and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
mobs and it's no longer that quick and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.910 
mobs and it's no longer that quick and
there's<00:02:39.580> other<00:02:39.700> ways<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:40.209> exploit<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.720> game

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
there's other ways to exploit the game

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.090 
there's other ways to exploit the game
so<00:02:41.920> good<00:02:42.370> luck<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.879> have<00:02:43.060> fun
