00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
excited I can't wait he might have some

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.250 
excited I can't wait he might have some
games<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:14.630> anyway<00:00:15.630> we've<00:00:15.809> already<00:00:15.900> done<00:00:16.080> two

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
games but anyway we've already done two

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.160 
games but anyway we've already done two
fairies<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:16.800> pokemon<00:00:17.340> X&amp;Y<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:17.880> I've<00:00:18.029> said<00:00:18.210> we

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
fairies on pokemon X&amp;Y as I've said we

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.050 
fairies on pokemon X&amp;Y as I've said we
have<00:00:19.260> done<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.100> DNA<00:00:20.490> fairy<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:20.970> also

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
have done the DNA fairy and we're also

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.750 
have done the DNA fairy and we're also
done<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.199> free<00:00:22.590> d<00:00:22.769> ferry<00:00:23.070> which<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.519> very

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
done the free d ferry which was a very

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.820 
done the free d ferry which was a very
simple<00:00:24.180> theory<00:00:24.449> now<00:00:25.199> today<00:00:25.439> we're<00:00:25.590> looking<00:00:25.650> at

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
simple theory now today we're looking at

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.830 
simple theory now today we're looking at
another<00:00:26.010> theory<00:00:26.340> which<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.060> am<00:00:27.180> dubbing<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
another theory which I am dubbing the

another theory which I am dubbing the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
germ theory sounds a bit weird ya know

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.470 
germ theory sounds a bit weird ya know
but<00:00:31.260> um<00:00:31.410> I'm<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> start<00:00:32.369> off<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.579> sort

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
but um I'm going to start off with sort

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660 
but um I'm going to start off with sort

which you know the simple things that
work<00:00:59.910> produce<00:01:00.629> two<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.079> three<00:01:01.289> primary<00:01:01.770> tissue

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010

layers<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:03.140> animals<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.260> bilateral

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
layers now animals with bilateral

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340 
layers now animals with bilateral
symmetry<00:01:05.129> produce<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.939> third<00:01:06.510> layer<00:01:06.750> whereas

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
symmetry produce a third layer whereas

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
symmetry produce a third layer whereas
animals<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> radial<00:01:08.369> symmetry<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:08.820> produce

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
animals of radial symmetry only produce

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.149 
animals of radial symmetry only produce
two<00:01:09.330> now<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> first<00:01:10.229> two<00:01:10.470> layers<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.100> are

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
two now the first two layers that are

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
two now the first two layers that are
produced<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.760> animals<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.450> radial<00:01:12.750> symmetry

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
produced in animals of radial symmetry

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.609 
produced in animals of radial symmetry
like<00:01:13.710> Synod<00:01:14.310> Aryans<00:01:14.760> produce<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.110> germ<00:01:16.409> layers

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
like Synod Aryans produce to germ layers

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
like Synod Aryans produce to germ layers
which<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> ectoderm<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.150> endoderm

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
which are the ectoderm and the endoderm

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.090 
which are the ectoderm and the endoderm
which<00:01:19.380> makes<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.830> die<00:01:20.450> plastic<00:01:21.710> bit<00:01:22.710> random

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
which makes them die plastic bit random

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
which makes them die plastic bit random
word<00:01:23.310> there<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:23.850> yeah<00:01:24.060> anyway<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:24.900> animals<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
word there but yeah anyway so animals of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
word there but yeah anyway so animals of
bilateral<00:01:25.890> symmetry<00:01:26.430> produce<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.390> third<00:01:27.659> layer

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
bilateral symmetry produce a third layer

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
bilateral symmetry produce a third layer
between<00:01:28.080> these<00:01:28.530> two<00:01:28.710> layers<00:01:28.920> which<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.670> called

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
between these two layers which is called

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.780 
between these two layers which is called
the<00:01:30.360> mesoderm<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.710> makes<00:01:31.979> them<00:01:32.159> try

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the mesoderm which makes them try

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.020 
the mesoderm which makes them try
plastic<00:01:33.920> germ<00:01:34.920> layers<00:01:35.159> eventually<00:01:35.700> give<00:01:35.820> rise

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
plastic germ layers eventually give rise

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.429 
plastic germ layers eventually give rise
to<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.450> an<00:01:36.540> animal's<00:01:36.900> tissues<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.320> organs

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
to all of an animal's tissues and organs

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.969 
to all of an animal's tissues and organs
through<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> process<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.820> organogenesis<00:01:39.979> so

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
through the process of organogenesis so

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.740 
through the process of organogenesis so
basically<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> germ<00:01:41.610> layers<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
basically the germ layers are the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.469 
basically the germ layers are the
original<00:01:43.350> parts<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.970> started

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
original parts of you you you started

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.960 
original parts of you you you started
with<00:01:45.659> free<00:01:45.960> germ<00:01:46.229> layers<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.070> endoderm<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
with free germ layers the endoderm the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.960 
with free germ layers the endoderm the
mesoderm<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.899> ectoderm<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.670> first

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
mesoderm and the ectoderm so first

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
mesoderm and the ectoderm so first
looking<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> ectoderm<00:01:52.200> non<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.770> extra<00:01:53.009> go

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
looking at the ectoderm non the extra go

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
looking at the ectoderm non the extra go
matters<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> three<00:01:54.030> primary<00:01:54.420> germ

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
matters as one of the three primary germ

actually<00:03:40.540> look<00:03:40.690> at<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.840> legendaries<00:03:41.260> finally

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
actually look at the legendaries finally

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.710 
actually look at the legendaries finally
now<00:03:41.650> first<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.580> will<00:03:42.640> look<00:03:42.760> at<00:03:42.880> sonia's<00:03:43.570> and

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
now first it will look at sonia's and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.940 
now first it will look at sonia's and
either<00:03:43.900> turn<00:03:44.170> obviously<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.620> only<00:03:44.709> ones

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
either turn obviously the only ones

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.370 
either turn obviously the only ones
released<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:45.700> far<00:03:45.730> we<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.630> see<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.900> as<00:03:47.110> Onias

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
released so far we can see that as Onias

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.949 
released so far we can see that as Onias
actually<00:03:47.800> looks<00:03:47.920> quite<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.550> lot<00:03:48.820> like<00:03:49.240> what

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
actually looks quite a lot like what

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.360 
actually looks quite a lot like what
they've<00:03:50.140> ever<00:03:50.290> get<00:03:50.410> very<00:03:50.620> biological<00:03:51.310> you

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
they've ever get very biological you

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.550 
they've ever get very biological you
know<00:03:51.520> they<00:03:51.760> have<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:52.120> sort<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.390> organic<00:03:53.290> sort

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
know they have have sort of organic sort

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.830 
know they have have sort of organic sort
of<00:03:53.620> traits<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.190> them<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:55.270> you<00:03:55.480> can<00:03:55.600> see<00:03:55.750> as

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
of traits to them and you can see as

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840 
of traits to them and you can see as
early<00:03:56.020> asus<00:03:56.380> design<00:03:56.980> highlight<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.520> more<00:03:57.760> of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
early asus design highlight is more of

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.090 
early asus design highlight is more of
it<00:03:57.970> its<00:03:58.420> horns<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.050> Eve<00:03:59.470> tells<00:03:59.709> design

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
it its horns and Eve tells design

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.340 
it its horns and Eve tells design
highlight<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:00.580> more<00:04:00.820> sort<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.840> pulsing

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
highlight is more sort of the pulsing

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.120 
highlight is more sort of the pulsing
the<00:04:02.680> red<00:04:02.890> black<00:04:03.280> stuff<00:04:03.820> like<00:04:04.060> on<00:04:04.390> its<00:04:04.660> body<00:04:05.130> now

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
the red black stuff like on its body now

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.490 
the red black stuff like on its body now
we<00:04:06.190> can<00:04:06.550> say<00:04:06.790> that<00:04:06.820> xerneas<00:04:07.420> represents<00:04:08.410> the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
we can say that xerneas represents the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.280 
we can say that xerneas represents the
ectoderm<00:04:08.950> which<00:04:09.520> is<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.790> do<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.060> nerves<00:04:10.330> as<00:04:10.660> its

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
ectoderm which is to do of nerves as its

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.230 
ectoderm which is to do of nerves as its
horns<00:04:11.650> look<00:04:11.830> very<00:04:12.100> similar<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.550> nerves<00:04:12.910> i

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
horns look very similar to nerves i

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.790 
horns look very similar to nerves i
screen<00:04:13.570> it<00:04:13.750> makes<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:14.050> lot<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.230> sense<00:04:14.350> there<00:04:14.740> you

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
screen it makes a lot of sense there you

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.789 
screen it makes a lot of sense there you
can<00:04:14.950> see<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.310> Evil<00:04:16.060> 2<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:17.109> representation

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
can see and Evil 2 is a representation

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.949 
can see and Evil 2 is a representation
of<00:04:18.040> muscles<00:04:18.520> blood<00:04:18.910> vessels<00:04:19.359> stuff<00:04:19.660> at<00:04:19.810> out

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
of muscles blood vessels stuff at out

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.260 
of muscles blood vessels stuff at out
due<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.590> its<00:04:20.859> red<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.400> curve<00:04:21.609> red<00:04:21.820> pumping

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
due to its red this curve red pumping

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.420 
due to its red this curve red pumping
blood<00:04:22.419> also<00:04:22.780> it's<00:04:23.020> sort<00:04:23.229> of<00:04:23.320> muscle<00:04:23.830> like<00:04:23.950> arms

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
blood also it's sort of muscle like arms

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.770 
blood also it's sort of muscle like arms
and<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.669> tail

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
and the tail

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.860 
and the tail
looks<00:04:25.990> very<00:04:26.080> similar<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:26.920> general<00:04:27.400> arm

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
looks very similar to it in general arm

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.290 
looks very similar to it in general arm
which<00:04:28.870> leaves<00:04:29.080> us<00:04:29.230> with<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.770> Z<00:04:30.639> legendary

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
which leaves us with the Z legendary

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.000 
which leaves us with the Z legendary
which<00:04:31.540> nobody<00:04:32.139> knows<00:04:32.440> what<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.460> is<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:35.010> that

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
which nobody knows what it is and that

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.040 
which nobody knows what it is and that
will<00:04:36.190> represent<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.669> endoderm<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.630> very<00:04:37.900> much

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
will represent the endoderm so very much

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.870 
will represent the endoderm so very much
lungs<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:40.180> know<00:04:40.270> organs<00:04:40.780> generally<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:41.470> lungs

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
lungs you know organs generally so lungs

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.540 
lungs you know organs generally so lungs
liver<00:04:42.880> stuff<00:04:43.720> like<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:43.930> so<00:04:44.889> that's<00:04:45.310> going<00:04:45.490> to

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
liver stuff like that so that's going to

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.800 
liver stuff like that so that's going to
be<00:04:45.610> very<00:04:45.760> interested<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.240> see<00:04:46.419> what<00:04:46.570> kind<00:04:46.780> of

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
be very interested to see what kind of

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.830 
be very interested to see what kind of
what<00:04:47.020> that<00:04:47.290> comes<00:04:47.740> out<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:47.950> turn<00:04:48.340> like<00:04:48.639> so<00:04:49.360> this

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
what that comes out to turn like so this

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.840 
what that comes out to turn like so this
is<00:04:49.960> another<00:04:50.139> theory<00:04:50.560> really<00:04:50.889> we<00:04:50.980> have<00:04:51.010> you

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
is another theory really we have you

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.970 
is another theory really we have you
know<00:04:51.940> each<00:04:52.240> legendary<00:04:52.810> representing<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.770> germ

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
know each legendary representing a germ

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.340 
know each legendary representing a germ
layer<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.880> we<00:04:55.240> can<00:04:55.389> really<00:04:55.690> just<00:04:55.900> use<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.230> to

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
layer so we can really just use this to

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.080 
layer so we can really just use this to
kind<00:04:56.470> of<00:04:56.590> guess<00:04:56.800> what<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.610> said<00:04:57.790> legend

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
kind of guess what the said legend

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.510 
kind of guess what the said legend
variable<00:04:58.360> will<00:04:58.450> like<00:04:58.680> as<00:04:59.680> we<00:05:00.130> look<00:05:00.250> at<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.460> the

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
variable will like as we look at in the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.460 
variable will like as we look at in the
final<00:05:00.910> four<00:05:01.090> x<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:01.600> y<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.810> could<00:05:02.290> be<00:05:02.440> a

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
final four x and y it could be a

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
final four x and y it could be a
snake-like<00:05:02.919> creature<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:05.280> could<00:05:06.280> have<00:05:06.400> you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
snake-like creature and I could have you

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.490 
snake-like creature and I could have you
know<00:05:06.580> that<00:05:06.790> sort<00:05:06.940> of<00:05:07.000> lungs<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.660> you<00:05:08.410> know

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
know that sort of lungs and you know

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.110 
know that sort of lungs and you know
what<00:05:08.620> was<00:05:08.770> not<00:05:08.950> lungs<00:05:09.220> in<00:05:09.490> particular<00:05:09.730> but

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
what was not lungs in particular but

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.080 
what was not lungs in particular but
it's<00:05:10.570> gonna<00:05:10.720> have<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:11.110> think<00:05:11.230> a<00:05:11.500> very<00:05:11.680> soft

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
it's gonna have I think a very soft

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.570 
it's gonna have I think a very soft
pinkish<00:05:13.090> design<00:05:13.510> maybe<00:05:13.990> pinkish<00:05:14.860> green<00:05:15.220> maybe

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
pinkish design maybe pinkish green maybe

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.150 
pinkish design maybe pinkish green maybe
that's<00:05:15.820> my<00:05:16.000> guess<00:05:16.060> here<00:05:16.720> but<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:17.950> should<00:05:18.070> have

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
that's my guess here but we should have

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.610 
that's my guess here but we should have
to<00:05:18.280> see<00:05:18.460> guys<00:05:18.700> I<00:05:18.880> think<00:05:19.060> it's<00:05:19.180> gonna<00:05:19.270> be<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.620> very

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
to see guys I think it's gonna be a very

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.800 
to see guys I think it's gonna be a very
sort<00:05:20.860> of<00:05:20.919> or<00:05:21.160> not<00:05:21.340> not<00:05:21.550> muscley<00:05:22.000> but<00:05:22.240> more

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
sort of or not not muscley but more

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.110 
sort of or not not muscley but more
lummi<00:05:23.470> sort<00:05:23.979> of<00:05:24.040> thing<00:05:24.280> not<00:05:24.700> not<00:05:24.850> not<00:05:25.060> not

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
lummi sort of thing not not not not

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.090 
lummi sort of thing not not not not
muscles<00:05:25.630> not<00:05:25.870> nervous<00:05:26.110> I'm<00:05:26.410> in<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.830> middle

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.460 
muscles not nervous I'm in the middle
you<00:05:27.370> know<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.540> guys<00:05:29.020> know<00:05:29.169> I'm<00:05:29.229> trying<00:05:29.380> to
