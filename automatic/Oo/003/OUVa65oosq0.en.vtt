are actually several ways to do that

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.660 
are actually several ways to do that
which<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.140> will<00:00:19.289> get<00:00:19.439> ready<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.920> cover<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.460> this

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
video so the first way and probably the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.380 
video so the first way and probably the
easiest<00:00:26.099> way<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> let<00:00:26.970> your<00:00:27.150> budgie

out<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.779> its<00:00:27.930> cage<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.500> simply<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.340> open

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
out of its cage is just simply to open

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.690 
out of its cage is just simply to open
the<00:00:29.760> cage<00:00:30.000> door<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.359> let<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> climb<00:00:31.260> out

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
the cage door and let it climb out

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.280 
the cage door and let it climb out
chances<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.300> bird<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.719> familiar

with its environment and comfortable it

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.639 
with its environment and comfortable it
will<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.480> come<00:00:36.780> out<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.170> its<00:00:37.380> own

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
