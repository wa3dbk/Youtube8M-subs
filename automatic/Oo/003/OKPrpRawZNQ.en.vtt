really that uncomfortable for me it's

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.710 
really that uncomfortable for me it's
just<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.130> prefer<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.519> slightly<00:03:22.790> lower<00:03:23.150> driving

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
just I prefer a slightly lower driving

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.420 
just I prefer a slightly lower driving
position<00:03:24.139> where<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.709> steering<00:03:25.130> wheel<00:03:25.250> is

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
position where the steering wheel is

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.159 
position where the steering wheel is
down<00:03:25.609> here<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.120> instead<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.510> me<00:03:26.690> being<00:03:26.989> up

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
down here and instead of me being up

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.199 
down here and instead of me being up
here<00:03:27.470> that's<00:03:27.919> just<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.250> niggly<00:03:28.609> thing<00:03:28.790> but<00:03:29.000> it's

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
here that's just a niggly thing but it's

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.270 
here that's just a niggly thing but it's
often<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.660> case<00:03:29.780> shorter<00:03:30.739> drivers<00:03:31.099> win

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280

ratios<00:04:49.290> now<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:49.950> problem<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.730> when<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.300> take

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490

off while you're still accelerating so

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.620 
off while you're still accelerating so
you<00:04:58.770> still<00:04:59.130> want<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.430> get<00:04:59.640> more<00:04:59.910> speed<00:05:00.330> going

you're used to when you're driving and

you're used to when you're driving and
often<00:05:07.500> times<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:07.860> want<00:05:08.100> just<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.400> little<00:05:08.430> bit

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
more speed so as the revs are falling

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.340 
more speed so as the revs are falling
you<00:05:11.250> have<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.550> put<00:05:11.700> more<00:05:12.030> throttle<00:05:12.450> in<00:05:12.780> which<00:05:13.229> I

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
you have to put more throttle in which I

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.600 
you have to put more throttle in which I
think<00:05:13.530> it's<00:05:13.620> counterproductive<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
transmission are going to be two

the decision-making when it comes to
this<00:05:23.190> vehicle<00:05:23.640> I<00:05:23.789> think<00:05:24.150> it's<00:05:24.300> fairly<00:05:24.570> well

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
this vehicle I think it's fairly well

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.840 
this vehicle I think it's fairly well
priced<00:05:25.140> especially<00:05:26.010> since<00:05:26.250> you<00:05:26.340> get<00:05:26.490> all<00:05:26.669> of
