playlist<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.779> decided<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.859> dedicated

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
playlist but I decided I do a dedicated

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
playlist but I decided I do a dedicated
video<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> browser<00:00:24.420> now<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.050> i<00:00:25.590> also

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
video on the browser now and i also

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.080 
video on the browser now and i also
thought<00:00:26.010> I'd<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> comparison<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
thought I'd do a comparison to the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.169 
thought I'd do a comparison to the
iPhone<00:00:27.150> 4<00:00:27.689> browser<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.650> iphone<00:00:29.010> is

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
iPhone 4 browser because the iphone is

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.790 
iPhone 4 browser because the iphone is
widely<00:00:30.179> known<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> best<00:00:31.320> browsers

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
widely known is one of the best browsers

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
widely known is one of the best browsers
on<00:00:32.009> any<00:00:32.160> mobile<00:00:32.369> device<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> that's<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> pretty

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
on any mobile device so that's a pretty

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.560 
on any mobile device so that's a pretty
nice<00:00:34.380> comparison<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.550> how<00:00:36.180> well<00:00:36.420> those

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
nice comparison just see how well those

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
nice comparison just see how well those
two<00:00:36.750> devices<00:00:36.989> compared<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.010> also<00:00:38.129> all

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
two devices compared so we can also all

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.160 
two devices compared so we can also all
apps<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> background<00:00:39.270> are<00:00:39.719> closed<00:00:39.960> as

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
apps in the background are closed as

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.959 
apps in the background are closed as
well<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> browsers<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.820> just

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
well as the browsers so we can just

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.459 
well as the browsers so we can just
start<00:00:42.180> both<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> browsers<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> same

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
start both of the browsers at the same

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.490 
start both of the browsers at the same
time<00:00:43.680> we'll<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.190> how<00:00:44.370> they<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.210> three<00:00:45.660> two

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
time we'll see how they do so three two

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.029 
time we'll see how they do so three two
one<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.770> phones<00:00:50.340> open<00:00:50.760> &amp;<00:00:51.680> iPhone<00:00:52.680> open<00:00:52.710> up

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
we can reload these both and do them

we can
see<00:02:08.090> how<00:02:08.240> responsive<00:02:08.899> they<00:02:09.050> are<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.470> terms<00:02:09.770> of

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
see how responsive they are in terms of

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.950 
see how responsive they are in terms of
scrolling<00:02:12.460> so<00:02:13.460> both<00:02:13.730> pretty<00:02:14.030> good<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.840> can

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
scrolling so both pretty good you can

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.600 
scrolling so both pretty good you can
see<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> Android<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.830> definitely<00:02:16.250> scrolling

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
see the Android is definitely scrolling

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.670 
see the Android is definitely scrolling
pretty<00:02:16.790> well<00:02:16.970> iphone<00:02:17.960> is<00:02:18.110> definitely

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
pretty well iphone is definitely

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.560 
pretty well iphone is definitely
smoother<00:02:19.220> we<00:02:19.340> can<00:02:19.460> do<00:02:19.550> some<00:02:19.730> pinch<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.150> zoom<00:02:20.180> in

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
smoother we can do some pinch to zoom in

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:28.030 
smoother we can do some pinch to zoom in
on<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.530> Android<00:02:21.890> here<00:02:23.470> pretty<00:02:24.470> good<00:02:26.709> we<00:02:27.709> zoom

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
on the Android here pretty good we zoom

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.780 
on the Android here pretty good we zoom
in<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.310> bit<00:02:28.400> more<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:30.740> you<00:02:30.830> can<00:02:31.010> see<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.580> little

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
in a bit more so you can see a little

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.580 
in a bit more so you can see a little
bit<00:02:31.940> closer<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.870> see<00:02:38.930> scrolling<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.530> a

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
bit closer you can see scrolling is a

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.440 
bit closer you can see scrolling is a
little<00:02:39.950> bit<00:02:40.070> jittery<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:41.000> not<00:02:41.209> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
little bit jittery it's not the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.940 
little bit jittery it's not the
smoothest<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:42.230> sort<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:43.360> it's<00:02:44.360> not<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.870> best

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.850 

whereas<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.100> iphone<00:02:50.860> smoothing

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
whereas on the iphone smoothing

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.220 
whereas on the iphone smoothing
scrolling<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.700> smooth<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.390> scrolling<00:02:54.170> and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
scrolling and smooth it scrolling and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.590

smoothing<00:02:54.770> scrolling<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.500> everything<00:02:57.500> is

smoothing scrolling and everything is

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.180 
smoothing scrolling and everything is
spectacular<00:03:02.500> double<00:03:03.500> topping<00:03:03.860> works<00:03:04.040> pretty

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
spectacular double topping works pretty

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.690 
spectacular double topping works pretty
well<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:06.530> yeah<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:06.920> working<00:03:07.280> definitely

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
well so yeah that is working definitely

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.000 
well so yeah that is working definitely
pretty<00:03:07.910> well<00:03:08.090> they're<00:03:08.739> pinching<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.040> zooming

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
pretty well they're pinching and zooming

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.970 
pretty well they're pinching and zooming
but<00:03:13.010> almost<00:03:13.580> as<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.910> these<00:03:14.299> devices<00:03:14.630> iphone<00:03:15.410> is

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
but almost as I these devices iphone is

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.229 
but almost as I these devices iphone is
almost<00:03:16.220> always<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.580> smoother<00:03:17.000> scrolling

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
almost always a smoother scrolling

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.729 
almost always a smoother scrolling
experience<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.090> we<00:03:20.630> can<00:03:20.780> open<00:03:21.080> up<00:03:21.140> an<00:03:21.290> article

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
experience so we can open up an article

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.699 
experience so we can open up an article
let's<00:03:22.610> say<00:03:23.709> this<00:03:24.709> one<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:27.410> in<00:03:27.769> Russia<00:03:28.100> one

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
let's say this one this in Russia one

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.350 
let's say this one this in Russia one
will<00:03:30.709> just<00:03:30.860> do<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.130> like<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.489> three<00:03:31.940> two<00:03:32.330> one

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
will just do it like this three two one

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.090 
will just do it like this three two one
go<00:03:33.580> so<00:03:34.580> which<00:03:34.880> one's<00:03:35.090> going<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.299> load<00:03:35.420> up<00:03:35.570> first

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
go so which one's going to load up first

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.509 
go so which one's going to load up first
and<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:38.000> looks<00:03:38.209> like<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:42.070> it's<00:03:43.070> pretty<00:03:43.340> close

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
and it looks like the it's pretty close

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.490 
and it looks like the it's pretty close
and<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:43.970> Android<00:03:44.299> finished<00:03:44.630> first<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.230> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
and the Android finished first and the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.190 
and the Android finished first and the
iphone<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.920> now<00:03:46.220> finishing<00:03:46.700> up<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.870> there<00:03:48.079> we

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
iphone is now finishing up so there we

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.410 
iphone is now finishing up so there we
go<00:03:49.239> android<00:03:50.239> finish<00:03:50.540> just<00:03:50.750> before<00:03:52.420> scrolling

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
go android finish just before scrolling

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.229 
go android finish just before scrolling
is<00:03:53.540> smooth<00:03:54.019> double<00:03:54.530> tapping<00:03:54.790> faster<00:03:55.790> on<00:03:56.120> the

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
is smooth double tapping faster on the

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.130 
is smooth double tapping faster on the
iphone<00:03:58.239> I've<00:03:59.239> always<00:03:59.450> found<00:03:59.660> Android

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
iphone I've always found Android

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:12.680 
iphone I've always found Android
scrolling<00:04:00.500> too<00:04:00.739> fast

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.590 

so<00:04:13.690> working<00:04:14.380> pretty<00:04:14.770> well<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:16.209> can<00:04:16.330> open<00:04:16.420> up

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
so working pretty well you can open up

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.930 
so working pretty well you can open up
my<00:04:16.720> gadget<00:04:17.200> now<00:04:17.459> three<00:04:18.459> two<00:04:19.090> one<00:04:19.870> oh<00:04:20.400> no<00:04:21.400> oh

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
my gadget now three two one oh no oh

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.420 
my gadget now three two one oh no oh
that's<00:04:22.930> okay<00:04:23.230> anyways<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.770> guess<00:04:23.830> because<00:04:24.250> we

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
that's okay anyways I guess because we

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.100 
that's okay anyways I guess because we
have<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.730> go<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.140> desktop<00:04:26.290> version<00:04:27.900> no<00:04:28.900> the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
have to go to the desktop version no the

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.660 
have to go to the desktop version no the
iphone<00:04:29.500> went<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.830> desktop<00:04:30.160> version<00:04:30.190> again

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
iphone went to the desktop version again

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.290 
iphone went to the desktop version again
by<00:04:30.850> itself<00:04:32.760> so<00:04:33.760> we'll<00:04:33.880> just<00:04:33.910> go<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.180> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
by itself so we'll just go to the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.740 
by itself so we'll just go to the
desktop<00:04:34.450> version<00:04:34.660> both<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:36.070> then<00:04:36.310> we<00:04:36.460> can<00:04:36.750> do

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
desktop version both and then we can do

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.840 
desktop version both and then we can do
a<00:04:37.780> little<00:04:37.990> bit<00:04:38.230> of<00:04:38.290> opening<00:04:39.190> up<00:04:39.250> articles<00:04:39.670> and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
a little bit of opening up articles and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.380 
a little bit of opening up articles and
such<00:04:42.240> so<00:04:43.240> we<00:04:43.570> can<00:04:43.720> open<00:04:43.840> up<00:04:44.460> let's<00:04:45.460> say<00:04:45.910> this

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
such so we can open up let's say this

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:56.250 
such so we can open up let's say this
article<00:04:46.990> here<00:04:48.480> three<00:04:49.480> two<00:04:49.720> one<00:04:50.400> go<00:04:55.260> the

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
article here three two one go the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.810 
article here three two one go the
Android<00:04:56.560> one<00:04:56.710> does<00:04:56.890> look<00:04:57.100> faster<00:04:57.580> so<00:04:57.730> the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
Android one does look faster so the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.220 
Android one does look faster so the
android<00:04:58.090> phones<00:04:58.330> need<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.540> be<00:04:58.630> loading<00:04:59.020> faster

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
android phones need to be loading faster

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.500 
android phones need to be loading faster
but<00:04:59.980> in<00:05:00.070> terms<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.430> smoothness<00:05:00.760> of<00:05:01.120> scrolling

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
but in terms of smoothness of scrolling

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.460 
but in terms of smoothness of scrolling
the<00:05:02.380> iphone<00:05:02.710> is<00:05:02.740> definitely<00:05:03.370> winning

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
the iphone is definitely winning

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.980 
the iphone is definitely winning
assuming<00:05:05.470> pinching<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.160> zooming<00:05:06.960> get<00:05:07.960> a

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
assuming pinching and zooming get a

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.150 
assuming pinching and zooming get a
little<00:05:08.230> bit<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.350> checker<00:05:08.620> boarding<00:05:09.040> on<00:05:09.130> the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
little bit of checker boarding on the

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.030 
little bit of checker boarding on the
iphone<00:05:09.580> sometimes<00:05:10.440> but<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.560> pinching<00:05:11.920> and

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
iphone sometimes but the pinching and

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.800 
iphone sometimes but the pinching and
zooming<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.700> definitely<00:05:13.180> smoother<00:05:13.600> on<00:05:13.720> the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
zooming is definitely smoother on the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:21.600 
zooming is definitely smoother on the
iphone<00:05:18.630> we<00:05:19.630> can<00:05:19.780> run<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.020> flash<00:05:20.770> video<00:05:21.040> on<00:05:21.460> the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
