time so I used to go to the live games
at<00:00:33.020> Villa<00:00:33.200> Park<00:00:33.290> I'd<00:00:33.949> say<00:00:34.190> what<00:00:34.370> what<00:00:34.520> was

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
always what I wanted to do I did love

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.780 
always what I wanted to do I did love
rest<00:00:36.559> in<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:36.829> when<00:00:37.100> I<00:00:37.129> was<00:00:37.309> younger<00:00:37.520> but

rest in it when I was younger but

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.540 
rest in it when I was younger but
obviously<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.660> wasn't<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:39.020> real<00:00:39.230> market<00:00:40.220> like

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550
