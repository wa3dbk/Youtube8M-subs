00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:20.820
 Why Write a novice dr 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.189
 I'm back again . Today I am now in the structure and name of each train 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.329
 I'll try to explain it once. 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.470
 Uh you guys wonder what kind of name is what kind of part 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.619
 You'll have it. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:39.530
 Then remove Would you describe the next generation of names 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.530
 And I do not like your attitude determines it to you, why me god among you 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:51.480
 Simply explain why you are in detail. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.430
 I 'll give you a brief description of the transaction 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.379
 4 This part is called the head part of the guitar 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.199
 Give me that head , too . And here is a dog on the cod pad. 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.540
 I have to go around this line. 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.740
 Saying that we are called to bear that killed nine times and his English is what is called tuning 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.130
 I will 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.929
 It 's a head machine because it's a head . 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 For what should be a lot wrong that someone should be in English and vain 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:26.520
 When you can not be scared 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:30.899
 4 weeks game looks to me to publish the convergence represented renounce School 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.860
 It's a history of winding a line together with a role in repaying a regular sin . 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:40.170
 One such role coiled know how to respond 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.549
 Highs and this part of my story is that every 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.360
 You would have to see what I have head rests kicks Though right off 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.220
 I will 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.510
 For me language 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:57.800
 There are two black and fingerboard Yes 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:01.850
 Flash, once we break down each of these sea areas, 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:08.240
 Mobile overhang in the sand while there are six stringed instrument such that you 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.740
 The biggest part of the price difference between the instruments is the flash. 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.360
 Wake up the Kindle 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.910
 As pointed out was he ever right when indicating that the call wooung hand 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.500
 So I like it in the river again. 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.760
 I have referred to that today, the class dividing the request referred ahkiha is turned just want an education 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.470
 I left. 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.950
 Others have it but do not have to memorize only the fifth column Bar 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.810
 Car 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.830
 At this point in time, I went to see how the Lord met me and made a sound. 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.290
 Because of 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.670
 4 can not guess as to what the previous example, so the play is very simple 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.990
 Very important 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:49.190
 Then the yigoyo part of its role 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:52.340
 Here we go to the bottom of the body. 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.880
 There are a lot of things in common . 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.890
 The pick-up as part of the law that p is No. 1 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.340
 10 years of original guitar 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.860
 Ten years we went because 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.510
 Lee Hyun sounded a cold vibration 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:14.640
 This pick-up is accepted, and it is introduced as an electric signal. 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:19.890
 So what if I'm a very eye to remove what he scientifically Yes 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.960
 I do not know. Anyway, the part that makes the sound is the affection part. 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.970
 There's a so-called bucket that makes a sound. 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:32.730
 No sound through this inlay full Feasible'm picking the chin 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.490
 I am going to receive Somied , and I keep on promising you, Jehovah , 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:41.280
 It's a lie Yes 3 4 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:45.120
 Sometimes and 21 minutes of rapping hopes were evolved Yes Yes 1 2 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.260
 As other decades of the day and that a sound job 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.860
 It's surrounded by cans. 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.890
 Can the defendant geonjin nickname'm going to charge me * 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.030
 Leaf Dokdo Constitution Coffee Grass 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:05.160
 Why worry about it once and take it easy . 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.010
 This is it . It's the season. There's a two in the mower . 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.010
 4 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:14.290
 So, for example, according to the party LAN de Foresta are happy to allow the humbucker pickup 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.209
 And Eger 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:22.930
 It is called "leather selector". 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:27.100
 I picked up a tired topic because I had two pickups. 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:32.830
 Now you 're gonna choose something. I 'm locked in a foreign frame. 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:36.280
 The ones here stone volume and toll those who say this is now under 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.639
 It's all in one. You'll see it in your eyes . 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:45.270
 The title ought to adjust the volume and the tone control 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:50.440
 Volume and intelligent foundation is to yigitae then I'll tell him someday again 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:54.310
 Volume is just what you usually think of as a legacy on your audio cell phone 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:58.599
 Because of the volume replacement and this is different from dealing 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:03.910
 I guess you 'll need to get a separate explanation for each of these volume lovers. 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.570
 If you do not always get the right ratio and tone, 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.310
 It's 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:12.900
 We have to find that function . 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:17.460
 This part is now part of my dreams. 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.990
 This section is followed Kelty Well now we see the fire goes against a lie 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.200
 Write this 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.380
 To Timothy so I stopped dancing in the air 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:30.600
 Star Tee 4 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:35.370
 I mean, you know why it's just a bracelet when it comes out . 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:40.020
 The most important role in the branch is to lock the line. 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.190
 It's just because we are denying the line , 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.020
 I'm in attendance. 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:50.340
 The explanation of the 4th person s4 is here. As I mentioned earlier , 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.930
 For each of the four University Stratocaster, two each of the stroke casts 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.930
 I will also record the explanation.
