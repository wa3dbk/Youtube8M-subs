lives<00:04:28.680> since<00:04:29.070> this<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> secret<00:04:30.060> tap<00:04:30.750> course

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
lives since this is a secret tap course

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
lives since this is a secret tap course
it<00:04:31.620> still<00:04:32.070> must<00:04:32.220> be<00:04:32.370> rather<00:04:32.610> painful<00:04:33.300> so

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
it still must be rather painful so

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.450 
it still must be rather painful so
making<00:04:35.160> your<00:04:35.490> way<00:04:35.700> back<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.450> castle<00:04:40.460> okay

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
making your way back to the castle okay

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.740

so<00:04:42.740> where<00:04:43.740> are<00:04:43.919> we<00:04:43.950> going<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.550> do<00:04:44.700> next<00:04:44.970> you'll

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
so where are we going to do next you'll

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.110 
so where are we going to do next you'll
see<00:04:47.270> we<00:04:48.270> are<00:04:48.510> going<00:04:48.960> over<00:04:49.380> here<00:04:50.040> because<00:04:50.850> that

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
see we are going over here because that

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.270 
see we are going over here because that
admissible<00:04:51.690> cap<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:52.080> needed<00:04:52.470> in<00:04:52.650> places<00:04:53.100> where

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
admissible cap is needed in places where

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:04.430 
admissible cap is needed in places where
you<00:04:53.400> might<00:04:53.490> not<00:04:53.850> treat<00:04:54.180> so<00:05:02.840> now<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.080> where

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
you might not treat so now this is where

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.909 
you might not treat so now this is where
the<00:05:05.180> invisible<00:05:06.180> cap<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:06.600> needed<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.169> trust<00:05:07.770> me

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
the invisible cap is needed and trust me

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.640 
the invisible cap is needed and trust me
this<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:08.850> harder<00:05:09.180> than<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.419> looks<00:05:09.540> what<00:05:10.530> you

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
this is harder than it looks what you

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.920 
this is harder than it looks what you
have<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.979> do<00:05:11.190> you<00:05:11.820> have<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.210> use<00:05:12.600> the

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
have to do you have to use the

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.290 
have to do you have to use the
visible<00:05:13.380> pad<00:05:13.650> but<00:05:14.190> since<00:05:14.400> an<00:05:14.580> invisible<00:05:15.090> cat

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
visible pad but since an invisible cat

visible pad but since an invisible cat
has<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:15.810> really<00:05:16.350> limited<00:05:16.710> amount<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.370> time

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
has a really limited amount of time

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.100 
has a really limited amount of time
until<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.300> runs<00:05:18.690> out<00:05:20.479> I'm<00:05:21.479> afraid<00:05:21.870> you're

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
until it runs out I'm afraid you're

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.969 
until it runs out I'm afraid you're
going<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.410> have<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.949> use<00:05:23.160> really<00:05:24.150> quick<00:05:24.360> time

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
going to have to use really quick time

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:32.570 
going to have to use really quick time
okay<00:05:27.259> it's<00:05:28.259> like<00:05:28.470> a<00:05:28.500> good<00:05:29.100> time<00:05:30.710> okay<00:05:31.710> this<00:05:32.370> is

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
okay it's like a good time okay this is

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.310 
okay it's like a good time okay this is
