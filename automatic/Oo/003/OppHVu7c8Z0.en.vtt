00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
yeah we got construct BOTS and then we

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.280 
yeah we got construct BOTS and then we
got<00:03:13.190> generations<00:03:14.190> dirge<00:03:14.760> right<00:03:15.180> here<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.659> in

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
got generations dirge right here and in

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.720 
got generations dirge right here and in
like<00:03:16.590> great<00:03:16.890> condition<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:19.440> know<00:03:19.560> for<00:03:19.739> $15

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
like great condition you know for $15

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.059 
like great condition you know for $15
which<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.330> basically<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.989> retail<00:03:22.379> price<00:03:22.709> of

which is basically the retail price of
it<00:03:23.879> and<00:03:26.390> everything<00:03:27.799> I'll<00:03:28.799> probably<00:03:29.129> I<00:03:29.790> don't

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
it and everything I'll probably I don't

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.539

VidCon<00:04:01.140> what's<00:04:01.920> cool<00:04:02.129> is<00:04:02.159> that<00:04:02.250> both<00:04:02.580> of<00:04:02.849> them

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
VidCon what's cool is that both of them

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.710 
VidCon what's cool is that both of them
comes<00:04:03.299> with<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.569> primes<00:04:04.099> arms<00:04:05.099> micron

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
comes with the primes arms micron

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.199 
comes with the primes arms micron
usually<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.810> was<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.610> jb<00:04:08.610> con<00:04:08.879> 1<00:04:09.060> so

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
usually it was just the jb con 1 so

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.100 
usually it was just the jb con 1 so
that's<00:04:09.299> pretty<00:04:09.599> cool

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
that's pretty cool

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.610 
that's pretty cool
and<00:04:11.629> there's<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:12.720> back<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.230> everything<00:04:13.500> with<00:04:13.590> a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
and there's a back and everything with a

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.840 
and there's a back and everything with a
bio<00:04:13.920> card<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.939> that's<00:04:15.150> nice<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.810> will<00:04:16.079> open<00:04:16.320> this

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
bio card so that's nice I will open this

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.699 
bio card so that's nice I will open this
and<00:04:17.850> review<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.449> someday<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.199> not

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
and review it someday but not

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.460 
and review it someday but not
so<00:04:20.639> that's<00:04:20.789> cool<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.389> then<00:04:21.900> it's<00:04:22.049> like<00:04:22.350> they
