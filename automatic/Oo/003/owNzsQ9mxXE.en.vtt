crunches<00:00:38.039> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:39.539> of<00:00:39.690> people<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.440> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
crunches a lot of people think that you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.819 
crunches a lot of people think that you
know<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> best<00:00:41.489> way<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> crunch<00:00:43.289> is<00:00:43.620> with

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
know the best way to do a crunch is with

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.060 
know the best way to do a crunch is with
slow<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:45.810> controlled<00:00:47.329> speed<00:00:48.390> hold<00:00:49.290> it<00:00:49.560> come

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
slow and controlled speed hold it come

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.780 
slow and controlled speed hold it come
back<00:00:50.220> down<00:00:50.520> nice<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:50.850> slow<00:00:52.579> now<00:00:53.579> there's

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
back down nice and slow now there's

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.650 
back down nice and slow now there's
nothing<00:00:53.880> wrong<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
nothing wrong with that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.860 
nothing wrong with that
but<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.489> study<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.910> darn<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.480> crunch

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
but a study that was darn on crunch

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.280 
but a study that was darn on crunch
speed<00:00:58.290> found<00:00:58.950> that<00:00:59.760> when<00:01:00.149> subjects<00:01:00.720> actually

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
speed found that when subjects actually

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.459 
speed found that when subjects actually
did<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> crunch<00:01:02.120> it's<00:01:03.120> fast<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.469> explosive

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
did the crunch it's fast and explosive

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.039 
did the crunch it's fast and explosive
as<00:01:07.590> possible<00:01:07.790> not<00:01:08.790> only<00:01:09.210> did<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.479> use<00:01:09.689> more

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
as possible not only did they use more

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.480 
as possible not only did they use more
of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.219> rectus<00:01:12.060> abdominis<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:14.040> main

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
of the rectus abdominis the your main

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.149 
of the rectus abdominis the your main
abs<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.210> 6-pack<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.649> see<00:01:16.829> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> front

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
abs the 6-pack that you see in the front

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.889 
abs the 6-pack that you see in the front
of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.399> ABS<00:01:17.579> not<00:01:17.939> only<00:01:18.090> they<00:01:18.209> use<00:01:18.389> more<00:01:18.630> about

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
of the ABS not only they use more about

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.090 
of the ABS not only they use more about
those<00:01:19.560> muscle<00:01:20.069> fibers<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.359> actually

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
those muscle fibers but they actually

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.739 
those muscle fibers but they actually
also<00:01:23.100> used<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.819> of<00:01:24.259> their<00:01:25.259> obliques<00:01:26.219> so

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:26.749 
also used more of their obliques so

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:30.319 
also used more of their obliques so
basically<00:01:27.749> they're<00:01:28.170> turning<00:01:28.469> the<00:01:29.340> crunch<00:01:29.969> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
basically they're turning the crunch and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.349 
basically they're turning the crunch and
do<00:01:30.569> not<00:01:30.719> just<00:01:30.959> an<00:01:31.109> ab<00:01:31.350> exercise<00:01:31.670> but<00:01:32.670> also<00:01:32.880> an

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
do not just an ab exercise but also an

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.069 
do not just an ab exercise but also an
oblique<00:01:33.689> exercise<00:01:34.289> because<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.399> really<00:01:36.079> get

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
oblique exercise because to really get

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.749 
oblique exercise because to really get
that<00:01:38.119> explosive<00:01:39.119> motion<00:01:39.779> going<00:01:40.310> all<00:01:41.310> those

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that explosive motion going all those

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.160 
that explosive motion going all those
muscle<00:01:42.270> fibers<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.759> fire<00:01:44.759> together<00:01:45.209> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
muscle fibers have to fire together to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.709 
muscle fibers have to fire together to
lift<00:01:46.499> your<00:01:47.009> shoulders<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.849> bring<00:01:48.060> er<00:01:48.209> your

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
lift your shoulders up and bring er your

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.949 
lift your shoulders up and bring er your
torso<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.349> so<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:51.090> actually<00:01:51.359> a<00:01:51.599> far<00:01:51.929> more

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
torso up so it's actually a far more

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.209 
torso up so it's actually a far more
effective<00:01:52.499> way<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.719> focus<00:01:54.719> on<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.619> ABS<00:01:55.829> by

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
effective way to focus on the ABS by

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.269 
effective way to focus on the ABS by
instead<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.819> just<00:01:57.060> doing<00:01:57.270> them<00:01:57.509> nice<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.929> slow

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279 
instead of just doing them nice and slow

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:03.730 
instead of just doing them nice and slow
but<00:01:59.279> to<00:01:59.490> actually<00:01:59.729> do<00:02:00.179> them<00:02:00.359> with<00:02:00.509> us<00:02:02.689> fast

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
but to actually do them with us fast

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.989 
but to actually do them with us fast
manner<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> doesn't<00:02:05.369> mean<00:02:05.669> you're

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
manner now that doesn't mean you're

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.600 
manner now that doesn't mean you're
gonna<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.959> forms<00:02:07.380> gonna<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.770> all<00:02:07.950> crazy

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
gonna be your forms gonna be all crazy

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
gonna be your forms gonna be all crazy
when<00:02:08.910> you're<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:11.150> flying<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.360> over<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
when you're just flying all over the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.540 
when you're just flying all over the
place<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.500> want<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.010> focus<00:02:14.220> on

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
place what you want to do is focus on

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.510 
place what you want to do is focus on
bringing<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:15.330> fast<00:02:15.739> but<00:02:16.739> coming<00:02:17.130> down<00:02:17.280> nice

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
bringing it up fast but coming down nice

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.809 
bringing it up fast but coming down nice
and<00:02:17.550> controlled

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.640 

now<00:02:21.819> as<00:02:22.060> you're<00:02:22.240> doing<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.750> you're<00:02:23.410> going<00:02:23.560> to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
now as you're doing that you're going to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.059 
now as you're doing that you're going to
notice<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.370> your<00:02:25.330> abs<00:02:25.630> fatigue<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.650> lot

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
notice that your abs fatigue a lot

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.350 
notice that your abs fatigue a lot
quicker<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.069> can<00:02:30.220> do<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.819> let's<00:02:31.150> say

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
quicker so what you can do is let's say

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.110 
quicker so what you can do is let's say
you're<00:02:31.540> doing<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:33.400> know<00:02:33.520> ready

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
you're doing you know ready

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.390 
you're doing you know ready
reps<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.600> failure<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.680> can<00:02:35.830> normally<00:02:36.220> do

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
reps to failure and you can normally do

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.510 
reps to failure and you can normally do
say<00:02:36.670> 20<00:02:37.090> reps

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
say 20 reps

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.610 
say 20 reps
crunches<00:02:39.520> at<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:40.060> normal<00:02:40.540> speed<00:02:40.569> but<00:02:41.140> when

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
crunches at a normal speed but when

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.260 
crunches at a normal speed but when
you're<00:02:41.739> doing<00:02:42.040> them<00:02:42.190> fast<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:45.270> explosively

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
you're doing them fast and explosively

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.850 
you're doing them fast and explosively
you<00:02:47.200> start<00:02:47.500> fatiguing<00:02:48.250> at<00:02:48.790> around<00:02:49.209> maybe<00:02:50.170> 810

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
you start fatiguing at around maybe 810

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.300 
you start fatiguing at around maybe 810
reps

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
reps
