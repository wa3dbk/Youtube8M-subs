00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
being bigger that does not mean moving

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.130 
being bigger that does not mean moving
to<00:01:30.829> a<00:01:30.890> mood<00:01:31.189> outside<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.850> prayer<00:01:32.479> for<00:01:32.750> an

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
to a mood outside of prayer for an

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.709 
to a mood outside of prayer for an
emotion<00:01:33.679> outside<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:34.340> prayer<00:01:34.640> it's<00:01:35.479> still

emotion outside of prayer it's still

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.200 
emotion outside of prayer it's still
staying<00:01:36.109> within<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.530> same<00:01:36.909> state<00:01:37.909> of<00:01:37.969> mind

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
staying within the same state of mind

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.160 
staying within the same state of mind
but<00:01:38.990> just<00:01:39.229> more<00:01:39.590> obvious<00:01:40.689> now<00:01:41.689> if<00:01:41.929> you<00:01:42.049> look

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
but just more obvious now if you look

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.429 
but just more obvious now if you look
into<00:01:43.149> subjects<00:01:44.149> such<00:01:44.329> as<00:01:44.359> brain<00:01:44.899> wave

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
into subjects such as brain wave

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.850 
into subjects such as brain wave
entrainment<00:01:46.689> you<00:01:47.689> will<00:01:47.840> find<00:01:48.170> out<00:01:48.350> about

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
entrainment you will find out about

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.160 
entrainment you will find out about
the<00:01:50.070> idea<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.580> hemispheric<00:01:51.170> synchronization

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the idea of hemispheric synchronization

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.200 
the idea of hemispheric synchronization
whereby<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.160> left<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> right<00:01:53.820> hemispheres

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
whereby the left and right hemispheres

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.290 
whereby the left and right hemispheres
of<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.780> brain<00:01:54.840> itself<00:01:55.400> start<00:01:56.400> resonating<00:01:56.850> at

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
of the brain itself start resonating at

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.560 
of the brain itself start resonating at
the<00:01:57.450> same<00:01:57.780> electromagnetic<00:01:58.760> frequencies<00:01:59.760> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the same electromagnetic frequencies and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.900 
the same electromagnetic frequencies and
this<00:02:00.900> can<00:02:01.110> become<00:02:01.230> much<00:02:02.100> more<00:02:02.340> dominant

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
this can become much more dominant

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.120 
this can become much more dominant
throughout<00:02:03.510> the<00:02:03.840> whole<00:02:04.020> brain<00:02:04.320> itself<00:02:04.830> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
throughout the whole brain itself I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.540 
throughout the whole brain itself I
think<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:06.030> would<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.210> appropriate<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
think it would be appropriate to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.950 
think it would be appropriate to
extrapolate<00:02:08.550> from<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.270> phrase<00:02:09.509> inflame

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
extrapolate from the phrase inflame

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.740 
extrapolate from the phrase inflame

myself with prayer and also from the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.440 
myself with prayer and also from the
knowledge<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.130> from<00:02:14.670> neuroscience

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
knowledge that we have from neuroscience

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.350 
knowledge that we have from neuroscience
these<00:02:15.810> days<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.440> suggest<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:18.090> state<00:02:18.330> of

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
these days to suggest that the state of

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.320 
these days to suggest that the state of
mind<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.140> crowd<00:02:19.440> was<00:02:19.650> talking<00:02:20.100> about<00:02:20.340> was<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
mind the crowd was talking about was a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
mind the crowd was talking about was a
more<00:02:22.280> intense<00:02:23.280> or<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.790> much<00:02:24.330> more<00:02:24.600> focused

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
more intense or a much more focused

more intense or a much more focused
state<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.040> mind<00:02:26.280> which<00:02:26.610> could<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.150> theory<00:02:27.480> be

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
state of mind which could in theory be

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.560 
state of mind which could in theory be
measured<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.470> an<00:02:28.620> EEG<00:02:28.770> machine<00:02:29.550> there<00:02:30.360> are

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
measured on an EEG machine there are

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.240 
measured on an EEG machine there are
various<00:02:31.080> different<00:02:31.470> frequencies<00:02:32.100> of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
brainwave activity which seems to occur

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.810

in different graphical states I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.250 
in different graphical states I
personally<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.780> spoken<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.470> one<00:02:38.430> particular

their<00:02:44.310> head<00:02:44.580> will<00:02:45.180> find<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.570> incredibly

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
their head will find it incredibly

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.810 
their head will find it incredibly
difficult<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.560> sleep<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:47.489> that

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
difficult to sleep because that

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.550 
difficult to sleep because that
visualization<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.930> state<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.380> euphoria

and visualizing a light above your head

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.780 
and visualizing a light above your head
can<00:02:54.600> have<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.049> effects<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.100> seems<00:02:56.400> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
can have the effects so it seems of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.150 
can have the effects so it seems of
creating<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.420> gamma<00:02:57.780> brainwave<00:02:58.530> frequency

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
or clairaudience but of course there are

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.040 
or clairaudience but of course there are

different frequencies associated with
prayer<00:03:28.350> such<00:03:28.740> as<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.190> alpha<00:03:29.850> theta<00:03:30.000> state

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
prayer such as the alpha theta state

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.380 
prayer such as the alpha theta state
which<00:03:30.570> is<00:03:30.600> slower<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.800> also<00:03:32.580> focus<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.180> very

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
which is slower and also focus in a very

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.690 
which is slower and also focus in a very
different<00:03:33.630> way<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:35.100> these<00:03:35.250> are<00:03:35.310> things<00:03:35.610> of

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
different way so these are things of

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.090 
different way so these are things of
which<00:03:35.910> we<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.330> experiment<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:37.100> what

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
which we have to experiment with what

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.180 
which we have to experiment with what

relearn<00:04:13.230> what<00:04:13.260> stage<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.830> prayer<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.850> try

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
relearn what stage of prayer is and try

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.289 
relearn what stage of prayer is and try
and<00:04:15.690> do<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.079> more<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.280> try<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.940> do<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.150> with
