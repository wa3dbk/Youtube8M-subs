00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.460 
to 85 while I was loving it to do a few
instances<00:05:06.430> my<00:05:06.670> favorite<00:05:07.000> by<00:05:07.150> far<00:05:07.180> was<00:05:07.870> vortex

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
instances my favorite by far was vortex

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.490 
instances my favorite by far was vortex
that<00:05:09.190> is<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.760> most<00:05:10.060> beautiful<00:05:10.390> zone<00:05:10.870> in<00:05:11.230> world

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
that is the most beautiful zone in world

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.460 
that is the most beautiful zone in world
of<00:05:11.560> warcraft<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:12.340> is<00:05:12.640> it's<00:05:13.030> like<00:05:13.420> it's<00:05:14.320> like

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
of warcraft it is it's like it's like

doing<00:05:14.980> an<00:05:15.070> instance<00:05:15.460> in<00:05:15.610> heaven<00:05:15.970> I<00:05:16.380> really

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
doing an instance in heaven I really

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.170 
doing an instance in heaven I really
reverted<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:17.980> like<00:05:18.160> a<00:05:18.310> five<00:05:18.550> year<00:05:18.760> old<00:05:18.940> when<00:05:19.150> I

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
reverted to like a five year old when I

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.790 
reverted to like a five year old when I
saw<00:05:19.390> that<00:05:19.570> zone<00:05:19.810> because<00:05:20.110> it<00:05:20.230> just<00:05:20.350> reminded

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
saw that zone because it just reminded

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.920 
saw that zone because it just reminded
me<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.010> like<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.340> princess<00:05:22.000> castle<00:05:22.630> I'm<00:05:22.750> sure

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
me of like a princess castle I'm sure

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.330 
me of like a princess castle I'm sure
that<00:05:23.110> all<00:05:23.200> you<00:05:23.350> manly<00:05:23.710> men<00:05:23.830> out<00:05:24.010> there<00:05:24.160> don't

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
that all you manly men out there don't

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.990 
that all you manly men out there don't
like<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.700> but<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:25.350> loved<00:05:26.350> for<00:05:26.650> text<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.670> fights

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
like it but I loved for text the fights

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.110 
like it but I loved for text the fights
were<00:05:28.210> fun<00:05:28.680> all<00:05:29.680> of<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:30.160> new<00:05:30.430> instances<00:05:30.970> are

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
were fun all of the new instances are

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.820 
were fun all of the new instances are
like<00:05:31.300> refreshingly<00:05:31.690> challenging<00:05:32.620> they're

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
like refreshingly challenging they're

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.890 
like refreshingly challenging they're
not<00:05:33.010> like<00:05:33.310> oh<00:05:33.490> my<00:05:33.730> god<00:05:33.910> this<00:05:34.030> is<00:05:34.210> impossible

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
not like oh my god this is impossible

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.680 
not like oh my god this is impossible
but<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.650> is<00:05:35.830> helpful<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.430> use<00:05:36.580> CC<00:05:37.090> and<00:05:37.330> you

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
but it is helpful to use CC and you

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.540 
but it is helpful to use CC and you
might<00:05:37.900> wipe<00:05:38.080> once<00:05:38.350> or<00:05:38.500> twice<00:05:38.740> learning<00:05:39.490> the

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
might wipe once or twice learning the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.280 
might wipe once or twice learning the
mechanics<00:05:39.970> of<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.300> fight<00:05:40.510> and<00:05:40.540> it's<00:05:41.050> nice<00:05:41.260> to

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
mechanics of the fight and it's nice to

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.950 
mechanics of the fight and it's nice to
have<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.710> learn<00:05:41.890> mechanics<00:05:42.550> of<00:05:42.760> instances<00:05:43.720> I

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
have to learn mechanics of instances I

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.450 
have to learn mechanics of instances I
have<00:05:44.260> everything<00:05:44.650> so<00:05:44.800> far<00:05:44.980> that's<00:05:45.280> any

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
have everything so far that's any

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.159 
have everything so far that's any
Cataclysm<00:05:46.030> I<00:05:46.120> think<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.540> things<00:05:46.810> that<00:05:46.960> I'm

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
Cataclysm I think the things that I'm

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.170 
Cataclysm I think the things that I'm
enjoying<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:47.650> most<00:05:47.860> are<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.340> changes<00:05:48.820> to<00:05:49.090> the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
enjoying the most are the changes to the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.750 
enjoying the most are the changes to the
way<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.570> you<00:05:49.900> quest<00:05:50.200> a<00:05:50.560> lot<00:05:51.340> of<00:05:51.460> the<00:05:51.520> quest

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
way that you quest a lot of the quest

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.220 
way that you quest a lot of the quest
now<00:05:51.970> are<00:05:52.120> like<00:05:52.240> mini<00:05:52.510> game<00:05:52.720> there's<00:05:52.960> also

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
now are like mini game there's also

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.460 
now are like mini game there's also
really<00:05:54.040> really<00:05:54.460> interesting<00:05:55.150> and<00:05:55.330> well<00:05:56.169> made

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
really really interesting and well made

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.450 
really really interesting and well made
cinematic<00:05:56.980> cutscenes<00:05:57.220> often<00:05:58.560> levels<00:05:59.560> 1885

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460

cinematic cutscenes often levels 1885
there's<00:06:01.150> also<00:06:01.330> a<00:06:01.419> few<00:06:01.600> in<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.810> goblets<00:06:02.110> are

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
there's also a few in the goblets are

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.010 
there's also a few in the goblets are
unit<00:06:02.530> unnoticed<00:06:03.130> but<00:06:03.940> if<00:06:04.360> they<00:06:04.510> really<00:06:04.750> add

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
unit unnoticed but if they really add

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.480 
unit unnoticed but if they really add
another<00:06:05.380> element<00:06:05.620> to<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:06.010> game<00:06:06.190> because<00:06:06.370> it

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
another element to the game because it

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.380 
another element to the game because it
was<00:06:06.640> very<00:06:06.910> easy

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
was very easy

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.320 
was very easy
previously<00:06:08.290> to<00:06:08.410> ignore<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:09.040> lore<00:06:09.250> and<00:06:10.120> just

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
previously to ignore the lore and just

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.610 
previously to ignore the lore and just
get<00:06:10.540> the<00:06:10.660> things<00:06:10.900> with<00:06:11.080> the<00:06:11.169> quests<00:06:11.500> are

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
get the things with the quests are

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.290 
get the things with the quests are
telling<00:06:11.830> you<00:06:11.919> go<00:06:12.070> get<00:06:12.280> and<00:06:12.490> not<00:06:12.610> really<00:06:12.880> know
