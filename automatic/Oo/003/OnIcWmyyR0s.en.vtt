00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.160 
recipe and obviously we're gonna need
salmon<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:24.029> there's<00:00:24.240> two<00:00:24.420> kinds<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:24.930> buy

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
salmon now there's two kinds you can buy

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.320 
salmon now there's two kinds you can buy
you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.740> buy<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> frozen<00:00:26.490> kind<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.150> can

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
you can buy the frozen kind or you can

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.990 
you can buy the frozen kind or you can
buy<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.779> kind<00:00:28.050> that's<00:00:28.410> fresh<00:00:28.740> cut<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
buy the kind that's fresh cut but the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.849 
buy the kind that's fresh cut but the
only<00:00:30.150> downside<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.689> buying<00:00:30.960> fresh<00:00:31.199> cut<00:00:31.439> salmon

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
only downside to buying fresh cut salmon

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.440 
only downside to buying fresh cut salmon
is<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.189> normally<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> cook<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> pretty

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
is you normally have to cook it pretty

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
is you normally have to cook it pretty
quick<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.010> about

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
quick but the thing that I like about

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.910 
quick but the thing that I like about
buying<00:00:35.790> frozen<00:00:36.329> salmon<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.140> individually

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
buying frozen salmon and individually

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
buying frozen salmon and individually
wrapped<00:00:38.190> package<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.300> it's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
wrapped package like this is it's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
wrapped package like this is it's
normally<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> lot<00:00:40.890> cheaper<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> don't

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
normally a lot cheaper and you don't

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.490 
normally a lot cheaper and you don't
have<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.270> cook<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:42.719> away<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
have to cook it right away because you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
have to cook it right away because you
can<00:00:43.649> store<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.070> freezer<00:00:44.340> now

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
can store it in your freezer now

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
can store it in your freezer now
obviously<00:00:45.539> since<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.110> salmon<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.739> frozen

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
obviously since this salmon is frozen

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
obviously since this salmon is frozen
we're<00:00:47.940> actually<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.170> thaw

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
we're actually going to have to thaw

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
we're actually going to have to thaw
them<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.680> now<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> found<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> quickest

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
them out now I found that the quickest

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.880 
them out now I found that the quickest
and<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.329> easiest<00:00:51.390> way<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and the easiest way is to just get a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
and the easiest way is to just get a
large<00:00:53.160> bowl<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.510> actually

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
large bowl like this one and actually

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.720 
large bowl like this one and actually
fill<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.379> some<00:00:55.590> hot<00:00:55.739> water<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.340> then

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
fill it with some hot water and then

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
fill it with some hot water and then
we're<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> place<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.809> salmon

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
we're just going to place the salmon

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
we're just going to place the salmon
fillets<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.280> they'll<00:00:59.430> thaw<00:00:59.640> out

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
fillets in there and they'll thaw out

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240 
fillets in there and they'll thaw out
and<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.480> ready<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> cook<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:02.010> went

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
where you can wrap it over the top of

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
where you can wrap it over the top of
the<00:01:26.729> salmon<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.299> now<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.409> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the salmon and now what I have here is

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
the salmon and now what I have here is
about<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.430> cup<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.570> organic<00:01:30.900> baby

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
about one cup of some organic baby

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200 
about one cup of some organic baby
spinach<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.460> we're<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
spinach and what we're going to do is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.950 
spinach and what we're going to do is
just<00:01:33.479> set<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> bottom<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.979> our<00:01:35.490> pan

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
just set that in the bottom of our pan

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
just set that in the bottom of our pan
so<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.170> should<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.470> something<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.220> at

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
so you should get something like this at
