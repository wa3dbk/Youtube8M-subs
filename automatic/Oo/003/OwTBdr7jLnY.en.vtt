for<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.680> sake<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:33.950> argument<00:01:34.490> let's<00:01:34.520> say<00:01:34.790> she

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
for the sake of argument let's say she

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.240

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
think that necessarily means that she

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.290 
think that necessarily means that she
isn't<00:01:39.830> in<00:01:39.920> love<00:01:40.130> with<00:01:40.340> me<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:43.300> don't

on<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.360> don't<00:02:26.540> think<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.840> was<00:02:26.930> sympathy<00:02:27.470> but

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829
