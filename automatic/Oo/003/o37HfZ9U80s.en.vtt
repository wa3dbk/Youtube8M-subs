00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
I think they're on crystal meth mmm that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.670 
I think they're on crystal meth mmm that
might<00:03:21.180> explain<00:03:21.209> it

so<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.920> second<00:03:33.280> here<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.610> regenerating

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
so in a second here that regenerating

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.570 
so in a second here that regenerating
guys<00:03:34.510> going<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:35.160> spawn<00:03:36.160> through<00:03:36.340> one<00:03:36.460> of<00:03:36.490> the

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
guys going to spawn through one of the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.430 
guys going to spawn through one of the
gates<00:03:36.730> there<00:03:37.090> we<00:03:37.210> go<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.960> you<00:03:38.020> have<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.230> kind<00:03:38.350> of
