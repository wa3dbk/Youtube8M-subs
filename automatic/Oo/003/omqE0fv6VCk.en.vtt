00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
the short program maybe a little bit

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.400 
the short program maybe a little bit
more<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.250> long<00:03:48.820> there<00:03:49.720> people<00:03:50.110> are<00:03:50.170> saying

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
more in the long there people are saying

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.350 
more in the long there people are saying
that<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.650> long<00:03:51.010> program<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.490> not<00:03:51.640> constructed

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
that the long program is not constructed

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.080 
that the long program is not constructed
in<00:03:52.720> favor<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.590> new<00:03:53.709> system<00:03:54.160> but<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:54.880> think

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
in favor of the new system but I think

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.250 
in favor of the new system but I think
in<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.209> short<00:03:55.270> program<00:03:55.480> where<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.870> elements

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
in the short program where the elements

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.440 
in the short program where the elements
are<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.709> precise<00:03:57.490> and<00:03:57.820> so<00:03:58.620> specific<00:04:00.300> she'll<00:04:01.300> do

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
are so precise and so specific she'll do

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.180 
are so precise and so specific she'll do
well<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.900> she<00:04:02.020> did<00:04:02.230> skate<00:04:02.440> well<00:04:02.620> here<00:04:02.890> I've

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
well and she did skate well here I've

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.100 
well and she did skate well here I've
got<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.550> say<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:04.270> her<00:04:04.360> jumps<00:04:04.780> are<00:04:04.959> the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
got to say that her jumps are the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.690 
got to say that her jumps are the
strongest<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.830> think<00:04:06.010> I've<00:04:06.070> ever<00:04:06.100> seen<00:04:06.370> them

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
strongest I think I've ever seen them

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.150 
strongest I think I've ever seen them
she<00:04:06.940> she<00:04:07.570> tends<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.900> jump<00:04:08.080> quite<00:04:08.320> low<00:04:08.560> but

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
she she tends to jump quite low but

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.740 
she she tends to jump quite low but
there<00:04:09.670> definitely<00:04:09.910> seems<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.510> be<00:04:10.600> more

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
there definitely seems to be more

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.860 
there definitely seems to be more
strength<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.260> elevation<00:04:11.830> in<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.040> jumps<00:04:12.870> well
