fairly heavy nice heavy coat around the
edges<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.510> center<00:01:13.900> isn't<00:01:14.290> important<00:01:15.070> at<00:01:15.100> all

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
edges the center isn't important at all

center<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.159> really<00:01:21.400> just<00:01:21.520> these<00:01:21.850> edges<00:01:22.300> that

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
center so really just these edges that

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.220 
center so really just these edges that
its<00:01:22.570> most<00:01:22.840> important<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:28.870> know<00:01:29.020> where

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
its most important and if you know where

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.050 
its most important and if you know where
to<00:01:29.260> put<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.800> on<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.070> hand<00:01:30.370> you<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.670> also<00:01:30.790> put

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
to put it on the hand you can also put

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.940 
to put it on the hand you can also put
on<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.300> hand<00:01:31.630> now<00:01:32.260> what<00:01:32.409> I'm<00:01:32.530> going<00:01:32.620> to<00:01:32.680> do<00:01:32.830> is

since I don't know exactly where to put

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.870 
since I don't know exactly where to put

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.940 
actually use that as a bit of a guide
and<00:01:48.790> apply<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.540> little<00:01:49.750> more<00:01:49.960> spirit<00:01:50.350> gum<00:01:50.500> as

fold over well it won't stick down in
this<00:02:42.810> case<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.200> going<00:02:43.380> down<00:02:43.590> very<00:02:43.800> nicely<00:02:43.920> but

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
this case is going down very nicely but

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.310 
this case is going down very nicely but
if<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.000> had<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> quarter<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.570> wasn't<00:02:45.930> sticking

if I had a quarter that wasn't sticking
down<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.920> could<00:02:47.520> peel<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.880> up<00:02:47.990> dabble<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.080> blue

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
down I could peel it up dabble the blue

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.430

tack<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.940> down<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.420> then<00:02:51.930> I'd<00:02:51.960> have<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.200> sit

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
tack it down and then I'd have to sit

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.650 
tack it down and then I'd have to sit
there<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.650> tap<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.250> keep<00:02:54.150> tapping<00:02:54.390> it

until it sticks and if it's not sticking
we<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:57.930> keep<00:02:58.110> trying<00:02:58.350> because<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.710> will

actually going to start this time with

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.110 
actually going to start this time with
just<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.370> touch<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.390> red<00:03:34.370> around<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.670> there

just a touch of the red around and there

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.910 
just a touch of the red around and there
was<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.330> go<00:03:36.420> very<00:03:36.660> light<00:03:36.870> makeup<00:03:37.230> goes<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> long

ways<00:03:38.370> one<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.670> these<00:03:38.850> little<00:03:39.030> stacks<00:03:39.450> of

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
ways one of these little stacks of

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.550 
ways one of these little stacks of

make is putting too much on and we'll

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.410 
make is putting too much on and we'll
use<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:52.800> little<00:03:53.100> bit<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.220> black<00:03:53.640> on<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.210> one

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
use a little bit of black on this one

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.510 
use a little bit of black on this one
too

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.790 

especially<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.420> black<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.840> what's<00:03:59.710> the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
especially the black is what's the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.890 
especially the black is what's the
farthest<00:04:00.100> okay<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:01.210> once<00:04:01.510> we've<00:04:01.690> done<00:04:01.840> that

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
farthest okay so once we've done that

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.290 
farthest okay so once we've done that
we'll<00:04:02.230> take<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.410> makeup<00:04:02.620> sponge<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.970> let's

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
we'll take a makeup sponge and let's

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.960 
we'll take a makeup sponge and let's
actually<00:04:07.570> let's<00:04:07.840> grab<00:04:08.020> our<00:04:08.170> purple<00:04:08.650> here

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
and if you ran this glass or your finger

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.640 
and if you ran this glass or your finger
most<00:04:17.750> like<00:04:18.049> that's<00:04:18.709> going<00:04:18.920> black<00:04:20.410> most<00:04:21.410> likely

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
most like that's going black most likely

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.790 
most like that's going black most likely
you<00:04:22.180> bruised<00:04:23.180> yourself<00:04:23.630> pretty<00:04:23.870> bad<00:04:24.050> I've<00:04:24.590> got

too much there but we'll take it will

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.280 
too much there but we'll take it will
smear<00:04:27.110> this<00:04:27.200> around<00:04:28.540> if<00:04:29.540> you<00:04:29.660> got<00:04:29.780> glass<00:04:30.020> stuck

is<00:06:10.400> we<00:06:10.580> go

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.960 

you<00:06:19.060> can<00:06:19.180> go<00:06:19.270> off<00:06:19.419> in<00:06:19.599> various<00:06:19.900> directions<00:06:20.050> now

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
you can go off in various directions now

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.089 
you can go off in various directions now
the<00:06:21.970> last<00:06:22.150> step<00:06:22.360> I'm<00:06:22.690> going<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:22.930> do<00:06:23.110> since<00:06:24.039> this

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
the last step I'm going to do since this

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.650 
the last step I'm going to do since this
is<00:06:24.250> an<00:06:24.340> older<00:06:24.669> one<00:06:24.849> I'm<00:06:25.120> actually<00:06:25.330> going<00:06:25.569> to

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
is an older one I'm actually going to

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:35.930 
is an older one I'm actually going to
take<00:06:29.879> another<00:06:30.879> sponge<00:06:32.129> kind<00:06:33.129> of<00:06:33.220> small<00:06:33.400> piece

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.100 

I'm<00:06:36.940> going<00:06:37.060> to<00:06:37.120> dab<00:06:37.330> just<00:06:37.599> a<00:06:37.659> little<00:06:37.870> bit<00:06:37.990> of

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
I'm going to dab just a little bit of

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.820 
I'm going to dab just a little bit of
thee<00:06:38.259> this<00:06:39.190> is<00:06:39.310> not<00:06:39.460> this<00:06:39.729> is<00:06:39.789> not<00:06:39.909> the<00:06:40.150> gel

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.770 

this<00:06:44.830> is<00:06:44.979> the<00:06:45.129> FX<00:06:45.490> blood<00:06:45.849> and<00:06:46.389> this<00:06:46.509> will<00:06:46.629> add

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
this is the FX blood and this will add

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.529 
this is the FX blood and this will add
some<00:06:46.830> splatters<00:06:47.830> of<00:06:47.860> some<00:06:48.220> brighter<00:06:49.060> colored

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
some splatters of some brighter colored

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:55.529 
some splatters of some brighter colored
real<00:06:50.319> blood<00:06:51.210> onto<00:06:52.210> it<00:06:52.360> so<00:06:54.120> you<00:06:55.120> can<00:06:55.389> make<00:06:55.479> a

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
real blood onto it so you can make a

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.040 
real blood onto it so you can make a
very<00:06:55.780> gruesome<00:06:56.050> and<00:06:57.630> probably<00:06:58.630> a<00:06:58.690> little<00:06:58.810> less

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
very gruesome and probably a little less

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.960 
very gruesome and probably a little less
purple<00:06:59.560> might<00:06:59.800> have<00:07:01.349> been<00:07:02.349> pretty<00:07:02.620> good<00:07:02.650> to

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
purple might have been pretty good to

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.490 
purple might have been pretty good to
you<00:07:03.970> can<00:07:04.150> see<00:07:04.300> you<00:07:04.479> up<00:07:04.659> close<00:07:04.690> you<00:07:04.990> can<00:07:05.259> kind<00:07:05.440> of

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
you can see you up close you can kind of

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.990 
you can see you up close you can kind of
see<00:07:05.740> the<00:07:05.949> edges<00:07:06.099> a<00:07:06.310> little<00:07:06.400> bit<00:07:06.759> of<00:07:06.880> the

prosthetic but in a dark room and most
of<00:07:10.300> the<00:07:10.419> times<00:07:10.630> that<00:07:10.690> we<00:07:10.780> going<00:07:10.930> to<00:07:10.990> be<00:07:11.050> using

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199
