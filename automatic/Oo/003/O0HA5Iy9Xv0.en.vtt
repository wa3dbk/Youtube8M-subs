see<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.420> multi<00:00:25.080> scale<00:00:25.380> which<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.619> amazing

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
see got multi scale which is amazing

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.820 
see got multi scale which is amazing
some<00:00:26.970> people<00:00:27.240> were<00:00:27.330> already<00:00:27.660> using<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> but

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
some people were already using it but

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.160 
some people were already using it but
let<00:00:29.490> me<00:00:29.580> point<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.119> both<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.359> these<00:00:30.720> sets

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
let me point out for both of these sets

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
let me point out for both of these sets
it<00:00:31.769> was<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.099> legal<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.759> roost<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.210> them

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it was not legal to have roost with them

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
it was not legal to have roost with them
but<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.410> black<00:00:34.649> 2<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.040> white<00:00:35.130> twos

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
but because of black 2 and white twos

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.690 
but because of black 2 and white twos
move<00:00:35.880> tudor<00:00:36.239> that's<00:00:36.960> no<00:00:37.230> longer<00:00:37.410> an<00:00:37.680> issue<00:00:37.920> but

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
move tudor that's no longer an issue but

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.910 
move tudor that's no longer an issue but
back<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.120> lugia<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:40.020> multi<00:00:40.410> scale<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
back to lugia with multi scale it

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160 
back to lugia with multi scale it
becomes<00:00:41.309> an<00:00:41.489> even<00:00:41.610> more<00:00:42.090> amazing<00:00:42.510> wall<00:00:42.960> if

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
becomes an even more amazing wall if

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.950 
becomes an even more amazing wall if
that<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.620> even<00:00:43.649> possible<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:45.149> only<00:00:45.360> downside

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that was even possible the only downside

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.709 
that was even possible the only downside
to<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.920> somewhat<00:00:47.340> hindered

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
to this is it's somewhat hindered

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.940 
to this is it's somewhat hindered
because<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> fact<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.289> black<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> white

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
because of the fact that black and white

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.689 
because of the fact that black and white
kirim<00:00:50.610> were<00:00:50.910> released<00:00:51.829> being<00:00:52.829> able<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> cancel

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
kirim were released being able to cancel

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.750 
kirim were released being able to cancel
out<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.820> multi<00:00:54.210> scale<00:00:54.510> ability<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.430> go<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.730> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
out the multi scale ability and go for a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360 
out the multi scale ability and go for a
very<00:00:57.030> powerful<00:00:57.329> stab<00:00:57.899> ice<00:00:58.170> attack<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> big

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
very powerful stab ice attack is a big

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.849 
very powerful stab ice attack is a big
deal<00:00:59.780> but<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:01.500> an<00:01:01.710> issue

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
deal but it's not so much an issue

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.579 
deal but it's not so much an issue
because<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.940> lugia<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.320> very

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
because you know lugia is very very

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
because you know lugia is very very
bulky<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.090> much<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> big<00:01:06.780> deal

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
bulky so it's not so much of a big deal

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.990 
bulky so it's not so much of a big deal
along<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> fact<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.700> does<00:01:08.850> get

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
along with the fact that it does get

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.109 
along with the fact that it does get
roost<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> has<00:01:09.840> 110<00:01:10.680> base<00:01:11.130> speed<00:01:11.820> which<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
roost and it has 110 base speed which is

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539 
roost and it has 110 base speed which is
very<00:01:12.630> good<00:01:13.250> moving<00:01:14.250> on

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
very good moving on

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.149 
very good moving on
hoo<00:01:14.909> got<00:01:15.390> rid<00:01:15.570> generator<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.860> see

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
hoo got rid generator as you can see

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.950 
hoo got rid generator as you can see
which<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.670> very<00:01:18.150> very<00:01:18.450> good

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
which is very very good

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109 
which is very very good
as<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.250> had<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> four<00:01:20.820> times

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
as we all know it had a four times

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.870 
as we all know it had a four times
weakness<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.840> stealth<00:01:22.140> rock<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.729> being<00:01:23.729> able

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
weakness to stealth rock and being able

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.480 
weakness to stealth rock and being able
to<00:01:24.030> switch<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.600> after<00:01:24.960> taking<00:01:25.229> 50%<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to switch out after taking 50% and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.130 
to switch out after taking 50% and
restoring<00:01:27.380> 33%<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.560> pretty<00:01:29.220> big<00:01:29.460> deal<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.729> him

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
restoring 33% is pretty big deal for him

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.020 
restoring 33% is pretty big deal for him
now<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.200> does<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.829> course<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.400> very<00:01:32.820> good

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
now he does of course have very good

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.289 
now he does of course have very good
special<00:01:33.509> defense<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.200> HP<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.220> attack<00:01:35.759> an

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
special defense and HP and attack an

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.319 
special defense and HP and attack an
even<00:01:36.630> special<00:01:36.869> attack<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.670> many<00:01:38.670> sets<00:01:39.060> are

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
even special attack so many sets are

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.770 
even special attack so many sets are
still<00:01:39.750> open<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.439> course<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.540> choice

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
still open of course and the choice

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.350 
still open of course and the choice
scarf<00:01:43.140> slash<00:01:43.470> choice<00:01:44.130> band<00:01:44.460> said<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:44.939> also

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
scarf slash choice band said are also

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
scarf slash choice band said are also
very<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.979> there's

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
very good because now if there's

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.980 
very good because now if there's
something<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.790> can't<00:01:48.030> quite<00:01:48.299> hit<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> can

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
something that it can't quite hit it can

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
something that it can't quite hit it can
restore<00:01:49.170> some<00:01:49.619> HP<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> most<00:01:50.430> likely<00:01:50.549> lost

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
restore some HP that it most likely lost

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
restore some HP that it most likely lost
from<00:01:51.360> stealth<00:01:51.780> rock<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.530> great<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
from stealth rock which is great in it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.810
