four things you need to look at is blood
work<00:03:44.560> health<00:03:46.110> flexibility<00:03:47.459> conditioning<00:03:48.459> and

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
work health flexibility conditioning and

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.490 
work health flexibility conditioning and
strength<00:03:49.060> those<00:03:49.269> are<00:03:49.420> really<00:03:49.690> in<00:03:49.930> my<00:03:50.080> opinion

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
strength those are really in my opinion

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.770 
strength those are really in my opinion
the<00:03:50.620> four<00:03:50.890> pillars<00:03:51.820> if<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.090> will<00:03:52.330> or<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.570> four

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
the four pillars if you will or the four

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.930 
the four pillars if you will or the four
legs<00:03:53.019> of<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.320> table<00:03:53.799> of<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.190> fitness<00:03:54.370> table

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
legs of the table of the fitness table

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.090 
legs of the table of the fitness table
and<00:03:55.360> so<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:55.959> me<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.680> those<00:03:56.920> are<00:03:56.950> the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
and so to me that is those are the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.710 
and so to me that is those are the
things<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.610> try<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:57.940> focus<00:03:58.150> on<00:03:58.480> with<00:03:58.630> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
things that I try to focus on with the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.449 
things that I try to focus on with the
material<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.320> put<00:03:59.560> out<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.739> don't<00:04:00.010> mind<00:04:00.190> giving

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
material I put out I don't mind giving

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.580 
material I put out I don't mind giving
some<00:04:00.910> work<00:04:01.209> for<00:04:01.450> people<00:04:01.570> who<00:04:01.840> do<00:04:02.140> want<00:04:02.350> better

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
some work for people who do want better

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.400 
some work for people who do want better
aesthetics<00:04:03.160> but<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.269> would<00:04:04.480> rather<00:04:04.660> see<00:04:05.019> people

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
aesthetics but I would rather see people

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.979 
aesthetics but I would rather see people
use<00:04:06.190> their<00:04:06.400> overall<00:04:06.880> fitness<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.600> achieve

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
use their overall fitness to achieve

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.960 
use their overall fitness to achieve
those<00:04:08.230> aesthetics<00:04:08.739> use<00:04:08.980> your<00:04:09.250> your<00:04:09.519> strength

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
those aesthetics use your your strength

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.570 
those aesthetics use your your strength
work<00:04:10.299> your<00:04:10.959> conditioning<00:04:11.590> work<00:04:11.739> a<00:04:11.860> good<00:04:12.040> diet

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
work your conditioning work a good diet

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.880 
work your conditioning work a good diet
to<00:04:13.299> get<00:04:13.480> there<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:13.959> then<00:04:14.110> if<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.470> want<00:04:14.830> to

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
to get there and then if you want to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.789 
to get there and then if you want to
balance<00:04:15.250> your<00:04:15.370> aesthetics<00:04:15.910> out<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.060> little<00:04:16.479> bit

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
balance your aesthetics out a little bit

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.440 
balance your aesthetics out a little bit
come<00:04:17.799> in<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.099> do<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.190> few<00:04:18.400> isolation<00:04:19.060> movements

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
come in and do a few isolation movements

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.029 
come in and do a few isolation movements
to<00:04:19.630> bring<00:04:19.870> up<00:04:20.020> to<00:04:20.109> whatever<00:04:20.380> two<00:04:20.650> muscle

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
to bring up to whatever two muscle

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.430 
to bring up to whatever two muscle
groups<00:04:21.250> are<00:04:21.400> lagging<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.000> most

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
groups are lagging the most

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.200 
groups are lagging the most
if<00:04:22.530> your<00:04:22.740> goals<00:04:22.950> are<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.280> be<00:04:23.760> more

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
if your goals are to be more

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.990 
if your goals are to be more
aesthetically<00:04:24.570> pleasing<00:04:25.520> because<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.850> me

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
aesthetically pleasing because to me

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.940 
aesthetically pleasing because to me
that<00:04:27.210> is<00:04:27.390> how<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:27.900> would<00:04:28.170> combine<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.710> two<00:04:28.890> is

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
that is how you would combine the two is

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.370 
that is how you would combine the two is
that<00:04:29.100> being<00:04:29.430> overall<00:04:29.850> fit<00:04:30.480> because<00:04:31.050> if<00:04:31.290> you

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
that being overall fit because if you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.950 
that being overall fit because if you
fit<00:04:31.680> you're<00:04:31.860> gonna<00:04:32.070> be<00:04:32.460> relatively<00:04:32.940> lean<00:04:33.450> or

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
fit you're gonna be relatively lean or

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.840 
fit you're gonna be relatively lean or
you're<00:04:34.170> gonna<00:04:34.350> get<00:04:34.560> leaner<00:04:34.950> over<00:04:35.280> time<00:04:35.520> and

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
you're gonna get leaner over time and

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.670 
you're gonna get leaner over time and
you're<00:04:36.720> gonna<00:04:36.900> have<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.140> fair<00:04:37.350> amount<00:04:37.380> of

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
you're gonna have a fair amount of

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.320 
you're gonna have a fair amount of
muscle<00:04:37.980> mass<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.460> can't<00:04:38.760> keep<00:04:39.000> getting

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
muscle mass and you can't keep getting

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.360 
muscle mass and you can't keep getting
stronger<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.930> stronger<00:04:40.170> on<00:04:40.500> big<00:04:40.950> functional

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
stronger and stronger on big functional

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.100 
stronger and stronger on big functional
movements<00:04:41.820> without<00:04:41.880> gaining<00:04:42.360> muscle<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:42.840> over

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
movements without gaining muscle so over

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.340 
movements without gaining muscle so over
time<00:04:43.290> that<00:04:43.500> will<00:04:43.650> contribute<00:04:43.980> massively<00:04:45.350> to

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
time that will contribute massively to

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.530 
time that will contribute massively to
aesthetics<00:04:46.800> rather<00:04:47.550> than<00:04:47.760> people<00:04:47.910> focusing

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540
