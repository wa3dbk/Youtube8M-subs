let's get back to the children you

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.170 
let's get back to the children you

mostly need to explore the stages of the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.089 
mostly need to explore the stages of the
game<00:03:02.360> such<00:03:02.660> as<00:03:02.690> new<00:03:02.930> quack<00:03:03.200> City<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.650> find<00:03:03.920> them

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
game such as new quack City to find them

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.280 
game such as new quack City to find them
but<00:03:04.610> one<00:03:04.790> easy<00:03:05.000> way<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.269> find<00:03:05.540> them<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.810> by<00:03:05.989> ear

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
but one easy way to find them is by ear

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.289 
but one easy way to find them is by ear
they<00:03:06.799> usually<00:03:06.980> cry<00:03:07.310> out<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.610> same<00:03:07.849> repeated

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
they usually cry out the same repeated

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.759 
they usually cry out the same repeated
sound<00:03:08.599> so<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.959> helps<00:03:09.170> telling<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.560> whether

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
sound so that helps telling you whether

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.920 
sound so that helps telling you whether
or<00:03:09.829> not<00:03:09.980> you're<00:03:10.250> close<00:03:10.489> this<00:03:11.420> comes<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.900> handy

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
or not you're close this comes in handy

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.289 
or not you're close this comes in handy
because<00:03:12.590> usually<00:03:12.920> wherever<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.489> child<00:03:13.819> is<00:03:14.030> near

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
because usually wherever a child is near

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.360 
because usually wherever a child is near
you<00:03:14.750> can<00:03:14.840> change<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.290> respectable<00:03:15.890> character
