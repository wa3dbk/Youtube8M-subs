00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
and get it exactly how we want it then

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.460 
and get it exactly how we want it then
we<00:01:59.740> take<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.159> into<00:02:00.610> 3d<00:02:01.090> studio<00:02:01.330> max<00:02:01.780> where<00:02:02.289> we

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
we take that into 3d studio max where we

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.700 
we take that into 3d studio max where we
build<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.950> game<00:02:03.250> version<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.910> them<00:02:04.450> model<00:02:05.050> we

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
build the game version of them model we

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.440 
build the game version of them model we
take<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.009> model<00:02:06.250> into<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.580> Photoshop<00:02:07.149> where<00:02:07.360> we

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
take the model into a Photoshop where we

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.969 
take the model into a Photoshop where we
do<00:02:07.570> all<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.810> texturing<00:02:08.320> work<00:02:08.500> for<00:02:08.830> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
do all the texturing work for the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.400 
do all the texturing work for the
character<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.610> then<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.600> take<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.260> our

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
character and then we take it to our

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.410 
character and then we take it to our
in-house<00:02:11.890> tools<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.550> rig<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.209> do<00:02:13.300> the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
in-house tools to rig it and do the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.509 
in-house tools to rig it and do the
final<00:02:13.570> polish<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.470> model<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:14.950> then<00:02:15.310> it's

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
final polish on the model and then it's

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.430 
final polish on the model and then it's
passed<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.209> animation<00:02:16.660> department<00:02:17.260> in

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
passed on to the animation department in

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.199 
passed on to the animation department in
once<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.069> animations<00:02:18.640> for<00:02:18.850> those<00:02:19.000> are

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
once the animations for those are

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.759 
once the animations for those are
starting<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.510> come<00:02:19.690> together<00:02:19.810> audio<00:02:20.500> will

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
starting to come together audio will

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.770 
starting to come together audio will
take<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> look<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.519> see<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.480> might<00:02:22.600> sound

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
take a look to see what it might sound

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.380 
take a look to see what it might sound
like<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:23.410> slapped<00:02:23.739> by<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.100> mole<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:24.970> talked

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
like to get slapped by a mole we talked

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.000 
like to get slapped by a mole we talked
about<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:25.810> kind<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.170> sounds<00:02:26.530> what<00:02:26.769> kind<00:02:26.950> of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
about what kind of sounds what kind of

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.250 
about what kind of sounds what kind of
character<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:28.000> mole<00:02:28.180> would<00:02:28.330> have<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:28.989> can

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
character the mole would have if we can

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.590 
character the mole would have if we can
make<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.800> big<00:02:30.340> ones<00:02:30.550> sound<00:02:30.760> sort<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.060> tougher

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
make the big ones sound sort of tougher

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.860 
make the big ones sound sort of tougher
maybe<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.560> meteor<00:02:33.130> sort<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.760> thing<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.750> then

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
maybe the meteor sort of thing and then

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.479 
maybe the meteor sort of thing and then
i<00:02:34.959> looked<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.320> artwork<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.980> mean<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.190> giant

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
i looked at the artwork I mean the giant

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.250 
i looked at the artwork I mean the giant
mole<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.820> really<00:02:37.180> nasty<00:02:37.480> ugly<00:02:37.930> looking

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
mole is a really nasty ugly looking

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.259 
mole is a really nasty ugly looking
thing<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:38.860> i<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.549> imagine<00:02:39.700> some<00:02:40.060> really

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
thing so i can imagine some really

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.390 
thing so i can imagine some really
horrible<00:02:40.510> kind<00:02:41.079> of<00:02:41.170> growling<00:02:41.769> guttural<00:02:41.980> sound

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
horrible kind of growling guttural sound

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
horrible kind of growling guttural sound
effects<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:45.459> i<00:02:45.579> have<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.820> come<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.239> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
effects and then i have to come in and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.970 
effects and then i have to come in and
make<00:02:47.140> sure<00:02:47.170> all<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.470> those<00:02:47.620> things<00:02:47.680> are

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
make sure all of those things are

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.440 
make sure all of those things are
actually<00:02:48.100> working<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.549> ever<00:02:48.700> correctly<00:02:49.209> in
