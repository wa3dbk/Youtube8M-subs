in where the groove is and go right into

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.749 
in where the groove is and go right into
it<00:01:42.049> now<00:01:43.049> depending<00:01:43.920> how<00:01:44.009> dull<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.549> how<00:01:44.700> many

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.910 
times you have to do it but if you have
a<00:01:46.649> good<00:01:47.009> sharp<00:01:47.369> file<00:01:48.079> three<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> five<00:01:49.500> times

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
a good sharp file three to five times

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.120 
a good sharp file three to five times
will<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.240> whatever<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> same

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
will do it whatever you do do the same

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
will do it whatever you do do the same
on<00:01:53.399> all<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.970> teeth<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> start<00:01:54.899> doing<00:01:55.140> more

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
on all the teeth if you start doing more

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.399 
on all the teeth if you start doing more
on<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:56.399> going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> wear<00:01:57.060> them

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
on one that's going to wear them

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.440 
on one that's going to wear them
differently<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.799> won't<00:01:59.009> cut<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.399> well<00:01:59.670> so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
differently and it won't cut as well so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.899 
differently and it won't cut as well so
what<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:03.500> cut<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.100> then<00:02:05.670> we

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
what we do is cut it like so then we

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.339 
what we do is cut it like so then we
advanced<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.840> chain<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> next<00:02:08.640> one

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
advanced the chain to the next one

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.520 
advanced the chain to the next one
repeat<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> process<00:02:10.770> all<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:12.270> way<00:02:12.360> around

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
repeat the process all the way around

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.800 
repeat the process all the way around
until<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.010> find<00:02:14.340> my<00:02:14.430> marked<00:02:14.940> one<00:02:15.209> then<00:02:15.690> we

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
until I find my marked one then we

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.800 
until I find my marked one then we
reverse<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.530> saw<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:21.150> even

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
reverse the saw and and I even

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.360 
reverse the saw and and I even
right-handed<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:22.860> doing<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
right-handed so I like doing it with the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.160 
right-handed so I like doing it with the
right<00:02:23.400> if<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> can<00:02:24.030> do<00:02:24.180> when<00:02:24.569> you're<00:02:24.720> left<00:02:24.900> in

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
right if you can do when you're left in

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.290 
right if you can do when you're left in
you<00:02:25.290> could<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.590> could<00:02:25.770> switch<00:02:26.040> hands<00:02:26.340> too<00:02:26.640> but

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
you could you could switch hands too but

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.559 
you could you could switch hands too but
we<00:02:27.420> do<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> ones<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.200> side<00:02:28.260> too<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.420> we

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
we do the ones on this side too so we

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.890 
we do the ones on this side too so we
just<00:02:30.780> cut<00:02:30.959> down<00:02:30.989> through<00:02:31.560> them<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.630> three

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
just cut down through them of the three

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.460 
just cut down through them of the three
times<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.739> one<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.160> go<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.550> next<00:02:35.850> one

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
times on this one we go to the next one

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.110 
times on this one we go to the next one
we<00:02:37.470> go<00:02:37.620> down<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.100> we<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.489> three<00:02:38.760> strokes

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
we go down and we do it three strokes

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.040 
we go down and we do it three strokes
also<00:02:40.790> what<00:02:41.790> this<00:02:41.910> going<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.209> do<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.390> greatly

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
also what this going to do is greatly

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.660 
also what this going to do is greatly
increase<00:02:43.530> how<00:02:44.040> well<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:45.030> cuts<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:46.670> like

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
increase how well actually cuts and like

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.320 
increase how well actually cuts and like
I'd<00:02:47.880> said<00:02:48.120> after<00:02:48.690> 10<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.530> 15<00:02:49.980> times<00:02:50.280> I'd<00:02:50.940> bring

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
I'd said after 10 to 15 times I'd bring

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.630 
I'd said after 10 to 15 times I'd bring
it<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> company<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.680> actually<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.310> grind

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it to a company that actually can grind

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.370 
it to a company that actually can grind
it<00:02:53.880> they'll<00:02:54.390> straighten<00:02:54.720> out<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.110> angle

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
it they'll straighten out the angle

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.979 
it they'll straighten out the angle
you've<00:02:55.530> gotten<00:02:55.860> off<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> little<00:02:56.340> bit<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.959> get<00:02:57.959> a

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
you've gotten off a little bit and get a

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.290 
you've gotten off a little bit and get a
good<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.380> sharp<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.310> would<00:02:59.850> do<00:03:00.030> this

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
good and sharp for you I would do this

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.900 
good and sharp for you I would do this
whenever<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.650> seems<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.069> be<00:03:02.160> getting<00:03:02.430> dull<00:03:02.640> and

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
whenever it seems to be getting dull and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.640 
whenever it seems to be getting dull and
how<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.630> tell<00:03:03.840> us<00:03:03.870> getting<00:03:04.200> dull<00:03:04.350> if<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
how you can tell us getting dull if the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.070 
how you can tell us getting dull if the
chips<00:03:04.950> are<00:03:05.160> coming<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.610> if<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.569> starts<00:03:06.900> to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
chips are coming out if it starts to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.940 
chips are coming out if it starts to
look<00:03:07.230> dusty<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.540> fine<00:03:09.900> sawdust<00:03:10.590> you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
look dusty like like a fine sawdust you

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.610 
look dusty like like a fine sawdust you
know<00:03:11.130> your<00:03:11.610> blades<00:03:11.910> dull<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.930> chip<00:03:13.230> should<00:03:13.470> be

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
know your blades dull the chip should be

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.590 
know your blades dull the chip should be
good<00:03:13.830> size<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:14.790> they<00:03:14.940> are<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.330> probably

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
good size and if they are you probably

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.410 
good size and if they are you probably
have<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.780> sharp<00:03:16.050> blade
