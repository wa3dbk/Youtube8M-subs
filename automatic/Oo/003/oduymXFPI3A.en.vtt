Megazord<00:00:11.660> as<00:00:12.660> far<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.469> basic

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
Megazord as far as like the basic

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.010 
Megazord as far as like the basic
Megazords<00:00:14.429> form<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.820> three<00:00:15.030> components<00:00:15.389> and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
Megazords form of three components and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.779 
Megazords form of three components and
it<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.529> only<00:00:16.680> ever<00:00:17.690> piloted<00:00:18.690> by<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.789> Ranger

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789

it was only ever piloted by the Ranger
red<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:22.310> but<00:00:23.310> uh<00:00:23.660> yeah<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.130> they<00:00:26.130> don't

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
red I think but uh yeah so they don't

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.349 
red I think but uh yeah so they don't
have<00:00:26.580> individual<00:00:27.300> names<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.820> just

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
have individual names but so I'm I just

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.840 
have individual names but so I'm I just
refer<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.810> them<00:00:30.990> by<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.579> animals<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.700> they

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
refer to them by the animals that they

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.350 
refer to them by the animals that they
represent<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:35.040> main<00:00:35.250> locomotive<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
represent so the main locomotive is a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.069 
represent so the main locomotive is a
mammoth<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.930> sort<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
mammoth and then you have to sort of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.860 
mammoth and then you have to sort of
cabin<00:00:40.469> or<00:00:40.559> freight<00:00:40.890> cars<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.640> are<00:00:41.870> roughly

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
cabin or freight cars that are roughly

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.200 
cabin or freight cars that are roughly
identical<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.190> white<00:00:44.760> ones<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
identical one the white ones a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.770 
identical one the white ones a
Tyrannosaurus<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.500> this

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
Tyrannosaurus and then you have this

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
Tyrannosaurus and then you have this
light<00:00:48.780> blue<00:00:49.050> Triceratops<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.850> figures

omaggio module maje so they can also
link<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:36.290> they<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.560> hitches<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.280> the

the<00:04:12.989> sides<00:04:13.290> mammoth<00:04:14.189> stud<00:04:16.039> t-rex<00:04:17.039> and

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
the sides mammoth stud t-rex and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.659 
the sides mammoth stud t-rex and
Triceratops<00:04:18.060> are<00:04:18.900> exactly<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.680> same<00:04:19.709> you

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
Triceratops are exactly the same you

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.070 
Triceratops are exactly the same you
just<00:04:21.740> fold<00:04:22.740> in<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:22.919> hitch

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
just fold in the hitch

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:33.020 
just fold in the hitch
and<00:04:25.560> then<00:04:25.800> open<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.699> mouths<00:04:30.620> open<00:04:31.620> mouth<00:04:32.129> fold

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
and then open the mouths open mouth fold

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.209 
and then open the mouths open mouth fold
in<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.240> hitch<00:04:34.639> then<00:04:36.830> Tyrannosaurus<00:04:37.830> becomes

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
in the hitch then Tyrannosaurus becomes

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.980 
in the hitch then Tyrannosaurus becomes
the<00:04:38.520> right<00:04:39.449> leg<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:41.419> Triceratops<00:04:42.419> becomes

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
the right leg and Triceratops becomes

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.040 
the right leg and Triceratops becomes
the<00:04:43.669> left<00:04:44.669> like<00:04:45.389> I<00:04:45.539> said<00:04:45.599> earlier<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.840> that's

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
the left like I said earlier and that's

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.520 
the left like I said earlier and that's
paleo<00:04:49.620> max<00:04:50.539> he's<00:04:51.539> pretty<00:04:51.900> interesting

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
paleo max he's pretty interesting

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.950 
paleo max he's pretty interesting
because<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:53.099> think<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:54.030> is<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.330> only<00:04:54.479> sort<00:04:54.900> of

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
because I think this is the only sort of

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.580 
because I think this is the only sort of
dinosaur<00:04:55.590> prehistoric<00:04:56.520> beast<00:04:56.819> themed

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
dinosaur prehistoric beast themed

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.159 
dinosaur prehistoric beast themed
Megazord<00:04:58.590> where<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.159> t-rex<00:04:59.819> wasn't<00:05:00.330> like<00:05:00.629> the

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
Megazord where the t-rex wasn't like the

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.839 
Megazord where the t-rex wasn't like the
central<00:05:01.650> component<00:05:02.280> because<00:05:02.580> the

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
central component because the

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.020 
central component because the
Tyrannosaurus<00:05:03.509> was<00:05:04.490> central<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
Tyrannosaurus was central to the

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.820 
Tyrannosaurus was central to the
original<00:05:06.479> Megazord<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.199> also<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.590> the

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
Thunder source Megazord but the mammoth

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.680 
Thunder source Megazord but the mammoth
is<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.520> predominant<00:05:11.759> component<00:05:12.599> here

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
is the predominant component here

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.129 
is the predominant component here

although it is also read so that trend

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.610 
although it is also read so that trend

he's<00:05:44.879> got<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.240> blue<00:05:45.539> Triceratops<00:05:46.379> for<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.770> left

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
he's got a blue Triceratops for a left

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.879 
he's got a blue Triceratops for a left
leg<00:05:47.339> he's<00:05:48.210> basically<00:05:48.690> symmetrical<00:05:49.529> from<00:05:49.740> the

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
leg he's basically symmetrical from the

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:55.189 
leg he's basically symmetrical from the
knees<00:05:50.069> up<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:51.750> know<00:05:52.789> so<00:05:53.789> he's<00:05:54.300> pretty<00:05:54.539> cool<00:05:54.900> I

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
knees up you know so he's pretty cool I

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:03.100 
knees up you know so he's pretty cool I
think<00:05:57.680> then<00:05:59.330> he's<00:06:00.330> not<00:06:00.750> quite<00:06:01.199> as<00:06:01.440> tall<00:06:01.680> as<00:06:01.889> the

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
think then he's not quite as tall as the

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.719 
think then he's not quite as tall as the
valve<00:06:04.110> max<00:06:04.469> Megazord<00:06:05.009> I<00:06:05.129> think<00:06:05.339> he's<00:06:05.550> the

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
valve max Megazord I think he's the

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.059 
valve max Megazord I think he's the
second<00:06:06.270> tallest<00:06:06.539> honestly<00:06:07.469> but<00:06:09.589> here<00:06:10.589> he<00:06:10.830> is

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069
