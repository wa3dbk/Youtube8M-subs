00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.150
 comments 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.580
 and good apart from these vehicles 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.379
 you are also going to have a pink luxo 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.150
 normally it is usually black 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.559
 but in this case, Carlos has 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.390
 modified to have a color 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.090
 different in case you want to take a picture 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.130
 with recording a video or whatever and 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.390
 forgive me for not being able to bring you 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.250
 something better what happens that has been 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.650
 quite busy today 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.840
 doing the suitcase and all that and apart 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.759
 Well, you have to take into account 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.109
 I'm editing the acrobatics montage 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.450
 is taking more time than I 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.149
 I thought so forgive you if you are late 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.789

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.840
