00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
physically now the motor is away from

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.120 
physically now the motor is away from
water<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:13.640> this<00:02:14.270> machine<00:02:14.480> I'm<00:02:14.840> using<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.440> jail

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
water and this machine I'm using a jail

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.170 
water and this machine I'm using a jail
cell<00:02:16.430> which<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:18.400> seal<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.580> battery<00:02:19.940> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
cell which is a seal the battery and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.350 
cell which is a seal the battery and
gels<00:02:20.959> so<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.950> can<00:02:22.340> put<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.640> any<00:02:22.850> position<00:02:23.030> you

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
gels so you can put in any position you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.480 
gels so you can put in any position you
like<00:02:24.250> here<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.900> tent<00:02:26.900> main<00:02:27.050> switch

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
like here is the tent main switch

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.560 
like here is the tent main switch
normally<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.580> tie<00:02:28.910> up<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.150> line<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.800> my<00:02:30.950> PFD

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
normally I tie up the line to my PFD

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.470 
normally I tie up the line to my PFD
inline<00:02:32.570> falling<00:02:32.900> off<00:02:33.080> or<00:02:33.290> overboard<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.480> should

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
inline falling off or overboard I should

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.050 
inline falling off or overboard I should
be<00:02:35.630> able<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> check<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.350> line<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.940> pull<00:02:37.940> the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
be able to check this line and pull the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.250 
be able to check this line and pull the
clip<00:02:38.239> away<00:02:38.510> from<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> motor

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
clip away from the motor

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.490 
clip away from the motor
so<00:02:39.440> hopefully<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.280> kayak<00:02:40.970> will<00:02:41.150> stop<00:02:41.500> and

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
so hopefully the kayak will stop and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800 
so hopefully the kayak will stop and
here<00:02:43.489> is<00:02:43.640> my<00:02:43.880> battery<00:02:44.330> meter

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
here is my battery meter

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.060 
here is my battery meter
I<00:02:46.930> always<00:02:47.930> also<00:02:48.410> have<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:48.800> bucket<00:02:50.950> with<00:02:51.950> the

I always also have a bucket with the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.020 
I always also have a bucket with the
insulation<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:53.030> put<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.269> press<00:02:53.600> play<00:02:53.810> here

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
insulation I can put a press play here

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.070 
insulation I can put a press play here

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
landing leg is on the left-hand side

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.360 
landing leg is on the left-hand side
because<00:03:02.180> I'm<00:03:02.299> a<00:03:02.330> right-hander<00:03:02.870> is<00:03:03.709> my<00:03:04.010> fishing
