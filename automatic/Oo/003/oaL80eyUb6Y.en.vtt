all<00:00:00.450> right<00:00:00.599> I'd<00:00:00.780> be<00:00:00.930> doing<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.230> video<00:00:01.319> on

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:01.580 
all right I'd be doing a video on

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.099 
all right I'd be doing a video on
anti-spin<00:00:02.840> butterfly<00:00:03.840> flowers<00:00:06.020> if<00:00:07.020> you

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
anti-spin butterfly flowers if you

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.690 
anti-spin butterfly flowers if you
haven't<00:00:07.350> watched<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.830> spin<00:00:08.160> video<00:00:08.460> go

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
haven't watched my in spin video go

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.790 
haven't watched my in spin video go
ahead<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.940> watch<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.900> come<00:00:10.559> back<00:00:10.650> to

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
ahead and watch that and come back to

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.060 
ahead and watch that and come back to
this<00:00:10.950> one<00:00:12.349> I'll<00:00:13.349> go<00:00:13.469> ahead<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.710> show<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.950> what

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
this one I'll go ahead and show you what

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:29.830 
this one I'll go ahead and show you what
anti-spin<00:00:14.700> butterfly<00:00:15.210> flower<00:00:15.480> is

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.000 

that's<00:00:30.560> pretty<00:00:30.770> much<00:00:30.890> it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
that's pretty much it

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.710 
that's pretty much it
like<00:00:34.010> I<00:00:34.070> said<00:00:34.130> watch<00:00:34.460> my<00:00:34.640> in<00:00:34.880> spin<00:00:35.150> first<00:00:35.450> and

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
like I said watch my in spin first and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.570 
like I said watch my in spin first and
come<00:00:36.230> back<00:00:36.380> to<00:00:36.470> this<00:00:36.590> one<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.070> pretty<00:00:37.490> much

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
come back to this one and pretty much

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.430 
come back to this one and pretty much
doing<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:37.940> same<00:00:37.970> thing<00:00:38.480> but<00:00:38.780> your<00:00:38.930> arms<00:00:39.230> going

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
doing the same thing but your arms going

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.330 
doing the same thing but your arms going
to<00:00:39.530> be<00:00:39.620> doing<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:41.720> opposite<00:00:42.110> rotation<00:00:42.340> of

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
to be doing the opposite rotation of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.510 
to be doing the opposite rotation of
what<00:00:43.580> they<00:00:43.700> were<00:00:43.760> doing<00:00:44.080> so<00:00:45.400> when<00:00:46.400> you're

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
what they were doing so when you're

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.990 
what they were doing so when you're
doing<00:00:46.580> an<00:00:46.790> in<00:00:46.880> spin<00:00:47.239> you're<00:00:48.160> circling<00:00:49.160> the

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
doing an in spin you're circling the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000 
doing an in spin you're circling the
same<00:00:50.270> direction<00:00:50.600> your<00:00:50.989> boy<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.440> circling<00:00:51.860> when

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
same direction your boy is circling when

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.390 
same direction your boy is circling when
you're<00:00:52.130> doing<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.430> thigh<00:00:52.670> spin<00:00:52.989> your<00:00:54.129> arm<00:00:55.129> is

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
you're doing a thigh spin your arm is

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.119 
you're doing a thigh spin your arm is
circling<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:56.390> opposite<00:00:56.870> direction<00:00:57.020> of<00:00:57.590> what

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
circling the opposite direction of what

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.150 
circling the opposite direction of what
your<00:00:58.309> poi<00:00:58.460> are<00:00:58.489> doing<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.530> start<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.650> off<00:01:00.770> just

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
your poi are doing so start it off just

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.189 
your poi are doing so start it off just
like<00:01:01.400> doing<00:01:01.640> your<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:02.239> spin<00:01:02.540> with<00:01:02.930> your

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
like doing your in spin with your

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.439 
like doing your in spin with your
non-dominant<00:01:03.860> hand<00:01:04.309> spinning<00:01:04.879> forward<00:01:05.239> and

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
non-dominant hand spinning forward and

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.860 
non-dominant hand spinning forward and
your<00:01:06.440> dominant<00:01:06.830> hand<00:01:06.860> spinning<00:01:07.340> backwards

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
your dominant hand spinning backwards

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.310 
your dominant hand spinning backwards
and<00:01:09.130> then<00:01:10.630> instead<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:12.100> starting<00:01:13.100> like<00:01:13.310> this

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
and then instead of starting like this

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.390 
and then instead of starting like this
you're<00:01:15.320> just<00:01:15.350> going<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.710> go<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.220> other

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
you're just going to go the other

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.060 
you're just going to go the other
direction

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.790 

and<00:01:24.070> just<00:01:24.640> be<00:01:25.420> sure<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.659> count<00:01:26.080> every<00:01:26.530> petal

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
and just be sure to count every petal

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.850 
and just be sure to count every petal
and<00:01:27.070> there<00:01:27.880> should<00:01:28.000> be<00:01:28.030> four<00:01:28.360> petals<00:01:28.570> one<00:01:29.500> here

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
and there should be four petals one here

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.960 
and there should be four petals one here
here<00:01:30.400> here<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.090> there<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.400> either<00:01:33.700> way<00:01:33.909> to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
here here and there and either way to

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.630 
here here and there and either way to
count<00:01:34.210> your<00:01:34.300> petals<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.530> build<00:01:36.100> that<00:01:36.280> pool

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
count your petals is to build that pool

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.930 
count your petals is to build that pool
you<00:01:37.510> know<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.690> kind<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.050> fill<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.680> pool<00:01:38.940> when

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
you know you kind of fill a pool when

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.780 
you know you kind of fill a pool when
each<00:01:40.229> petal<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.470> made<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.430> way<00:01:42.550> you<00:01:42.610> kind

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
each petal is made and that way you kind

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.609 
each petal is made and that way you kind
of<00:01:42.910> know<00:01:43.090> petals<00:01:43.780> made<00:01:43.990> where<00:01:44.410> it's<00:01:44.530> supposed

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
of know petals made where it's supposed

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.920 
of know petals made where it's supposed
to<00:01:44.890> be<00:01:45.009> and<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:47.159> keep<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.640> timing<00:01:49.060> you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
to be and when to keep the timing you

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.960 
to be and when to keep the timing you
know<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.470> right<00:01:50.619> timing<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.040> rotate<00:01:51.640> your<00:01:51.729> arm

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
know the right timing to rotate your arm

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.810 
know the right timing to rotate your arm
so<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:55.180> think<00:01:55.810> that's<00:01:56.110> about<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.380> for<00:01:56.820> anti-spin

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
so I think that's about it for anti-spin

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.040 
so I think that's about it for anti-spin
flowers<00:01:58.500> butterfly<00:01:59.500> powers<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.930> hope<00:02:01.930> it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
flowers butterfly powers so hope it

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.979 
flowers butterfly powers so hope it
helps<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.380> have<00:02:02.770> fun
