00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.959
 beavers it had to be a simple week 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.499
 end girlfriends in a cottage at the edge 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.060
 of a lake 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:10.200
 it must have been a moment away from 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.150
 Men who are not good guys 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.280
 history of forgetting wrong he can do 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.840
 but unfortunately it was without 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.900
 count a chemical disaster in a 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.870
 beaver dam for jay-z and marie 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.400
 the nightmare will have two sharp incisors 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.270
 and the flat tail as well as a mad 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.280
 want human flesh 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.869
 the zombie beavers roam around the 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.430
 home and the arrival of boyfriends 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.440
 of the three girls will not arrange anything 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.269
 Office zombies is akin to comedy 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.039
 horrifying like turnips such 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.809
 what is looking for nadeau or piranhas 3d 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.850
 the scenario is not very original 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.809
 young people who are attacked in a 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.390
 hut by the lake 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.609
 we know it's warm mercier in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.780
 more casting does not break anything since 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.350
 all heads are unknown to the big 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.899
 public 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.339
 good the three protagonists spend 70% 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.780
 of the nude film so I do not think so 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.059
 really that's their head which one 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.319
 will remember but in the end what 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.329
 gathering of film shots 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.399
 of horror works thanks to a strong 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.829
 solicitation of the second degree to the small 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.389
 budget that was invested casters 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.250
 zombies saves the film is sold 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.810
 a lot of these dreams hairballs 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.880
 mechanical and hysterical with white eyes 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.659
 are more ridiculous than scary in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.740
 some scenes 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.390
 it even looks like it's 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.149
 puppets animated by a human arm 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.159
 this humorous cheap side is very 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.600
 effective especially when we add a 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.600
 good dose of gore as we like 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.530
 dead snow raid versus dead this is the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.539
 back from our friends the Nazi zombies 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.740
 remember in the first episode 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.789
 a group of friends leave in 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.500
 mop in the mountains 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.310
 Norwegian where he discovers an old 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.289
 Nazi treasure 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.520
 it belongs to Nazis who were 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.359
 frozen in the mountain during the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.640
 World War II 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.860
 once the jackpot unearthed an army of 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.509
 Nazi zombies return to thirsty sight 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.880
 of blood and brains seeking to 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.890
 get his money back in dead snow raid 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.329
 to this stage the Nazi zombies love each other 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.950
 always terror and humans 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.170
 decides to unearth an army of zombies 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.360
 communist to fight them normal 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.220
 after a very successful first exercise 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.689
 in dead snow and a small passage 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.840
 empty with hansel and gretel witch 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.369
 hunters tommy wirkola delivers a movie of 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.110
 hilarious zombies as possible 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.729
 dead snow raid versus 2 shows 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.649
 the action where she had stayed at the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.480
 end of the first film is therefore comprises 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.069
 much better the motivation of the zombies 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.480
 Nazis as well as the mission for which 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.459
 they came back from the dead 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.230
 humor is much more present than in 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.950
 barrels and the goret all the more 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.780
 pleasurable 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.670
 liters of hemoglobin are raining 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.890
 thrips masters unwinds and pace 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.030
 from his horror comedy Gordon to the movie 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.920
 a devastating punch 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.959
 the acting game is quite 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.970
 correct the hallucinating makeup and 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.040
 of black humor and add and just 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.790
 quite disturbing a movie that has to be 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.790
 absolutely see
