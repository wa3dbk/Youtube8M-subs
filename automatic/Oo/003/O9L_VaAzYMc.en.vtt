divisional<00:02:08.700> terms<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.390> agree<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.229> even

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
divisional terms I agree it's not even

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
divisional terms I agree it's not even
half<00:02:10.590> time<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.129> game<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:12.060> my<00:02:12.540> point

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
half time in the game that's my point

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
half time in the game that's my point
right<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.200> you're<00:02:13.349> still

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
right so you're still

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.430 
right so you're still
31<00:02:14.070> down<00:02:14.280> yeah<00:02:14.760> at<00:02:15.000> halftime<00:02:15.350> against<00:02:16.350> a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
31 down yeah at halftime against a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
31 down yeah at halftime against a
division<00:02:16.980> two<00:02:17.190> side<00:02:17.490> who<00:02:17.640> are<00:02:17.700> not<00:02:17.880> even<00:02:18.450> top

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
division two side who are not even top

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.840 
division two side who are not even top
of<00:02:18.840> Division<00:02:19.380> two<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.560> think<00:02:19.770> they're<00:02:20.100> about<00:02:20.790> a

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
of Division two I think they're about a

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.700 
of Division two I think they're about a
point<00:02:21.120> outside<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.630> playoff<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.320> team

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
point outside the playoff this is a team

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.710 
point outside the playoff this is a team
that's<00:02:22.740> running<00:02:23.580> away<00:02:23.850> with<00:02:24.030> division<00:02:24.390> 2<00:02:24.540> this

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
that's running away with division 2 this

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.590 
that's running away with division 2 this
is<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.410> probably<00:02:26.400> above<00:02:26.790> average<00:02:27.000> new<00:02:27.300> vision

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
is a probably above average new vision

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.570 
is a probably above average new vision
to<00:02:27.720> side<00:02:27.990> not<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> brilliant<00:02:28.590> one<00:02:28.710> yeah<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.520> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
to side not a brilliant one yeah it's a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.130 
to side not a brilliant one yeah it's a
very<00:02:29.790> poor<00:02:29.970> premier<00:02:30.360> league<00:02:30.510> side<00:02:30.750> as<00:02:30.960> well<00:02:31.110> I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
very poor premier league side as well I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.230 
very poor premier league side as well I
mean<00:02:31.440> let's<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:32.250> forget<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.760> we're

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
mean let's not forget that we're

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.640 
mean let's not forget that we're
struggling<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.780> Premier<00:02:34.080> League<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
struggling in the Premier League but I

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.740 
struggling in the Premier League but I
think<00:02:35.070> if<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.820> believe<00:02:36.060> when<00:02:36.240> we<00:02:36.390> turn<00:02:36.600> it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
think if and I believe when we turn it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.510 
think if and I believe when we turn it
around<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:37.320> two<00:02:37.470> weeks<00:02:37.650> time<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.280> first

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
around in two weeks time it the first

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.450 
around in two weeks time it the first
leg<00:02:38.700> won't<00:02:38.820> matter<00:02:39.030> least<00:02:39.810> 31<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.980> Bradford

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
leg won't matter least 31 to Bradford

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.560 
leg won't matter least 31 to Bradford
let's<00:02:41.580> go<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> Elliott<00:02:42.090> give<00:02:42.180> us<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.330> little<00:02:42.450> bit

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
let's go to Elliott give us a little bit

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.840 
let's go to Elliott give us a little bit
around<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> video<00:02:43.260> yeah<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> think<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.640> think<00:02:44.820> I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
around the video yeah I think I think I

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.280 
around the video yeah I think I think I
probably<00:02:45.000> deserve<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.600> win<00:02:45.750> maybe<00:02:45.960> not<00:02:46.140> by<00:02:46.230> two

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
probably deserve to win maybe not by two

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.660 
probably deserve to win maybe not by two
but<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:46.650> certainly<00:02:46.800> deserve<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.310> win<00:02:47.460> they

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
but they certainly deserve to win they

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.490 
but they certainly deserve to win they
were<00:02:47.940> much<00:02:48.210> better<00:02:48.390> from<00:02:48.570> set-pieces<00:02:48.840> both

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
were much better from set-pieces both

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.040 
were much better from set-pieces both
defending<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.490> offending<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.090> think<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.870> key

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
defending and offending I think the key

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.990 
defending and offending I think the key
moment<00:02:52.410> missing<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.010> chance<00:02:53.280> at<00:02:53.490> a<00:02:53.520> tuna

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
moment missing that chance at a tuna

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.400 
moment missing that chance at a tuna

will be open goal I think if it goes to

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
a chance of an equalizer and then

a chance of an equalizer and then
another<00:03:00.690> fairly<00:03:01.050> dopey<00:03:01.860> goal<00:03:02.040> from<00:03:02.190> a

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310
