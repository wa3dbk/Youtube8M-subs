I am off the bat a bit disappointed with

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010 
I am off the bat a bit disappointed with
Marvel<00:00:14.250> because<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> originally<00:00:15.150> thought<00:00:15.269> this

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
Marvel because I originally thought this

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.200 
Marvel because I originally thought this
would<00:00:16.230> conclude<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.279> Stan<00:00:17.760> Lee<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.029> Jack

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
would conclude the Stan Lee and Jack

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.929 
would conclude the Stan Lee and Jack
Kirby<00:00:18.359> run<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.949> decided<00:00:20.340> not<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
Kirby run and they decided not to

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150 
Kirby run and they decided not to
include<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.020> key<00:00:22.140> issues<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.890> this

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
include some of the key issues so this

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.620 
include some of the key issues so this
is<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.670> conclusion<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.269> run<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.539> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
is not the conclusion that we run like I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.290 
is not the conclusion that we run like I
originally<00:00:25.050> thought<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.789> really<00:00:26.789> had<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
originally thought and really had that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.109 
originally thought and really had that
they<00:00:27.449> did<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.650> maybe<00:00:29.400> fingers<00:00:29.849> crossed

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
they did that but maybe fingers crossed
