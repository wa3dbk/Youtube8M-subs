00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.150 
hey guys this is Danny Boy this time
around<00:00:02.580> i<00:00:02.970> will<00:00:03.149> be<00:00:03.270> using<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:04.080> hydra<00:00:04.740> missile

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
around i will be using the hydra missile

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.499 
around i will be using the hydra missile
launcher<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.609> hydra<00:00:05.910> missile<00:00:06.180> launcher<00:00:06.420> is

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
launcher the hydra missile launcher is

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.970 
launcher the hydra missile launcher is
different<00:00:06.810> from<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.020> other<00:00:07.170> projectile

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
different from the other projectile

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.070 
different from the other projectile
heavy<00:00:08.220> weapons<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:08.820> fires<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.450> cluster<00:00:09.929> of

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
heavy weapons it fires a cluster of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.959 
heavy weapons it fires a cluster of
heat-seeking<00:00:10.710> missiles<00:00:11.400> other<00:00:11.730> than

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
heat-seeking missiles other than

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.360 
heat-seeking missiles other than
individual<00:00:12.570> projectiles<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.040> does<00:00:14.160> much

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
individual projectiles so it does much

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.039 
individual projectiles so it does much
less<00:00:14.580> damage<00:00:14.849> per<00:00:15.120> missile<00:00:15.299> than<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.870> single

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
less damage per missile than the single

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.019 
less damage per missile than the single
projectile<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> cane<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.820> Reaper

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
projectile of the cane or the Reaper

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.519 
projectile of the cane or the Reaper
black<00:00:18.240> star<00:00:18.539> but<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.020> still<00:00:19.199> does<00:00:19.350> great

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
black star but it still does great

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.800 
black star but it still does great
damage<00:00:19.560> groups<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.340> enemies<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:21.600> as

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
damage groups of enemies it is not as

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
effective against single hard targets

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.060 
effective against single hard targets
like<00:00:23.699> Atlas<00:00:24.029> max<00:00:24.240> or<00:00:24.449> ban<00:00:24.750> cheese<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.769> if

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
like Atlas max or ban cheese because if

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.670 
like Atlas max or ban cheese because if
there<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.609> any<00:00:27.000> sort<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> troops<00:00:27.840> around<00:00:28.230> the

there are any sort of troops around the
hard<00:00:28.920> targets<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.580> missiles<00:00:29.939> will<00:00:30.090> seek

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
hard targets the missiles will seek

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.240 
hard targets the missiles will seek
those<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.900> only<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> few<00:00:31.439> will<00:00:31.890> actually

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
those out and only a few will actually

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.470 
those out and only a few will actually
hit<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:33.500> Mac<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.340> banshee<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.270> am

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
hit the Mac or the banshee but I am

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.630 
hit the Mac or the banshee but I am
going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.110> quickly<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:37.680> these<00:00:37.950> things<00:00:38.160> out

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.110 

and<00:00:42.800> prepare<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:44.309> cluster<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> enemies<00:00:45.239> alive

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
and prepare or cluster of enemies alive

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.369 
and prepare or cluster of enemies alive
like<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:49.370> come<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.809> will<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> group

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
like so come on so here will be a group

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.200 
like so come on so here will be a group
of<00:00:52.440> opponents<00:00:53.239> try<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> get<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> decent<00:00:54.840> view

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.170 

the<00:01:00.210> charging<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.629> from<00:01:00.750> behind<00:01:00.870> cover

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.210 

and<00:01:03.690> fire<00:01:04.940> as<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.000> saw<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.900> suck<00:01:07.560> out<00:01:07.770> they

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and fire as you saw they suck out they

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.710 
and fire as you saw they suck out they
sought<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:09.410> excuse<00:01:10.410> me<00:01:10.620> their<00:01:11.130> targets<00:01:11.730> and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.520 
sought out excuse me their targets and
it's<00:01:13.140> solid<00:01:13.530> damage<00:01:14.270> but<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.570> feel<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it's solid damage but I feel like it's a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.260 
it's solid damage but I feel like it's a
good<00:01:16.680> idea<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.950> show<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:17.790> effective<00:01:18.210> this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.920 
try it out against an atlas Mac I'm
going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.060> charge<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.330> up<00:01:36.360> from<00:01:36.540> behind<00:01:36.660> cover

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930

I'm<00:01:39.930> going<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.110> wait<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.470> smoke<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
I'm going to wait for this smoke to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:51.210 
I'm going to wait for this smoke to
dissipate<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.610> actually<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.210> view

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.750 

there<00:01:52.220> we<00:01:52.310> go<00:01:52.430> fire<00:01:53.090> away<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:54.550> actually<00:01:55.550> that

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
there we go fire away and actually that

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.870 
there we go fire away and actually that
time<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.360> did<00:01:56.750> every<00:01:57.620> rocket<00:01:58.070> hit<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:58.520> actual

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
time it did every rocket hit the actual

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.060 
time it did every rocket hit the actual
Atlas<00:01:59.210> Mack<00:01:59.390> none<00:01:59.750> hit<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.260> troops<00:02:00.500> behind<00:02:00.710> it

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
Atlas Mack none hit the troops behind it

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.830 
Atlas Mack none hit the troops behind it
but<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.060> goes<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.330> show<00:02:02.480> how<00:02:02.690> much

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
but that just goes to show how much

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.540 
but that just goes to show how much
damage<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.230> does<00:02:03.470> against<00:02:03.800> hard<00:02:03.980> targets<00:02:04.370> it

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
damage this does against hard targets it

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.850 
damage this does against hard targets it

did all the shields and a decent chunk

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.960 
did all the shields and a decent chunk

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
of its armor but it certainly did not

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.270 
of its armor but it certainly did not
