00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:11.530
 I would like to describe the leisure of the mixer today 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.129
 First of all, it is an opportunity for this discussion 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.720
 Pass the song through the tights, use the crack, etc. 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:21.900
 The number is the era required more 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.860
 Hall knob of the first knob 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.220
 Vader Te 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.140
 If you lower the second and third volume down 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.039
 There is like increasing the knob 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.039
 Is lowered 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.910
 If you include 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.190
 Volume goes up 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.120
 Then entered 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.940
 Crossfader Crossfader is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 I'd have been on the right brother there shaking the tape between the right guard and clay 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.690
 Hit with the crossfader on the left side and it's tail during dinner 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.690
 I understand it is on the left side 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.110
 Hmm 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.840
 Increase the quantity 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.840
 Hmm 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.450
 I'm buried in the left side of the detective 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 It uses such as therapy and in the middle of my male Vader 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.790
 Yes 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.790
 Hmm 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.790
 Hmm 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 Hmm 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.640
 Next is line and things 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.660
 Bug from the direction of the line 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:41.710
 Because it issued a sound comes in towards the line 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:50.080
 The first one is 6 and you should think that you are the original fine adjustment 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:51.360
 Well not right any more and do it I cream do not know if you will receive a turn 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.159
 me 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.679
 In the valley 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.679
 It will be smaller if you sleep on the left 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.800
 7 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.540
 It is yes under 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.780
 I'm will Hakodate wife 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:16.100
 One becomes stronger and conceal to the right 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:21.560
 The peak and the stomach become weak 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.040
 Is the king very much yesterday It is a Taro Hoshi 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.560
 Same as yes 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.500
 If you sleep well 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.990
 Video gets stronger 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.990
 It will weaken the theme and round 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:45.450
 But the master is 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.450
 I wonder if I Speaking of absolute volume will come taking advantage of the 1-chome trio 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.110
 To list this master 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.790
 The team is just around here just by raising a little 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.790
 Turn up the volume 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.510
 And raise the Astor 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:11.120
 Left of you 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:11.120
 true Dream also it has been all means Arirang in the same way 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.200
 Although it was the same in the middle earlier 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.709
 Oh 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.709
 There is a loud volume even at this level 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 Hmm 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.280
 b 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.960
 Next is the pointer with headphones 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:47.110
 Yup 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:52.660
 I remember to say that but I thought headphone related please 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:56.329
 Sweetness is monitored This is the volume of headphones 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:00.659
 That ab is high, but 4 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.260
 When I leave a of a tiger breast 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.240
 Hmm 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.810
 I flow with headphones 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.430
 Enter the b and you 're on the right 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.560
 Follow 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.880
 Boo does not fly away 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.290
 We chat Nyoka the woman I 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.520
 Now I'm right I can hear the right end tail 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.520
 I will try to increase the volume 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.790
 This is headphone movement 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.500
 Ne 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.340
 That 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.340
 a not a a 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.779
 It is understood that it is the end boat part of a leaguer 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.680
 If it is understood about that, I think novices should be fine 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.839
 I will summarize it last 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.960
 Aster is the whole volume 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.009
 Monitors don t budget and rims tweak sound 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:09.490
 Love is cornrows is the low-temperature 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:15.720
 It is not in this mixer, but there are times when there are four of these knobs 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.720
 I wrote to the person, but there is a mid high fence but it is central 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.320
 Please try 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:31.630
 In the future, we will deliver videos related to dj in an easy- to- understand manner 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.630
