00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the next activity we're doing is called

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.289 
the next activity we're doing is called
a<00:00:12.809> group<00:00:13.170> grid<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.670> involves<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
a group grid and this involves the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.240 
a group grid and this involves the
participants<00:00:15.960> getting<00:00:16.289> together<00:00:16.619> without

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
participants getting together without

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.820 
participants getting together without
speaking<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.029> create<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.930> grid<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.279> 6<00:00:20.699> by<00:00:21.150> 5

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
speaking to create a grid that is 6 by 5

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.810 
speaking to create a grid that is 6 by 5
so<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> don't<00:00:23.189> give<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> lot<00:00:23.670> of

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
so I don't give you a lot of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.950 
so I don't give you a lot of
instructions<00:00:24.539> exactly<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.529> very<00:00:25.949> limited

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
instructions exactly but very limited

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.179 
instructions exactly but very limited
the<00:00:27.960> goal<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.490> guys<00:00:29.760> will<00:00:31.009> come<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the goal is that you guys will come to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.299 
the goal is that you guys will come to
consensus<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.329> figure<00:00:33.750> out<00:00:37.309> absolute

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
consensus and figure out absolute

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.010 
consensus and figure out absolute
silence<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> result<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.510> each

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
silence the result is that each

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.840 
silence the result is that each
participant<00:00:43.739> must<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:44.129> able<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.430> follow<00:00:44.700> a

participant must be able to follow a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.569 
participant must be able to follow a
predetermined<00:00:45.840> path<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.980> an<00:00:47.190> entry<00:00:47.550> point

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
predetermined path from an entry point

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.389 
predetermined path from an entry point
to<00:00:48.059> an<00:00:48.360> end<00:00:48.600> point<00:00:48.870> without<00:00:49.559> stepping<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
to an end point without stepping on the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.790 
to an end point without stepping on the
lines<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.360> feet<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.199> inside<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
lines to feet have to be inside the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.459 
lines to feet have to be inside the
square<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.719> they<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.110> able<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> help

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
square and they have to be able to help

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.529 
square and they have to be able to help
each<00:00:55.680> other<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.120> mentioned

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
each other out and as I mentioned

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:10.249 
each other out and as I mentioned
without<00:00:57.809> talking

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.050 

so<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.380> next<00:01:11.530> part<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.070> activity<00:01:12.460> is

part about doing that group Grid

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.370 
part about doing that group Grid
activity<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:44.240> probably<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.810> hardest<00:02:45.140> part

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
activity now probably the hardest part

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.980 
activity now probably the hardest part
was<00:02:45.710> just<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.850> jump<00:02:47.120> up<00:02:47.300> way<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:47.690> you've<00:02:47.870> got

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
was just the jump up way like you've got

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.020 
was just the jump up way like you've got
all<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.200> crosses<00:02:48.530> off<00:02:48.650> boxes<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.280> they<00:02:49.850> get

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
all the crosses off boxes and they get

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.390 
all the crosses off boxes and they get
to<00:02:50.120> jump<00:02:50.360> over<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.840> next<00:02:51.440> gap<00:02:51.590> knowing<00:02:52.070> to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
to jump over this next gap knowing to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.510 
to jump over this next gap knowing to
have<00:02:52.550> like<00:02:52.790> only<00:02:53.000> one<00:02:53.090> foot<00:02:53.540> or<00:02:53.720> two<00:02:53.900> feet<00:02:53.930> oh

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
have like only one foot or two feet oh

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.120 
have like only one foot or two feet oh
that<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:55.760> think<00:02:56.270> through<00:02:56.660> us<00:02:56.750> all<00:02:56.990> at<00:02:57.470> first<00:02:57.800> the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
that I think through us all at first the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.890 
that I think through us all at first the
lack<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.430> communication<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.420> will<00:02:59.570> not<00:02:59.750> lack

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
lack of communication like will not lack

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.690 
lack of communication like will not lack
of<00:03:00.020> commish<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:01.100> fact<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:01.520> couldn't

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
of commish the fact that we couldn't

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.580 
of commish the fact that we couldn't
communicate<00:03:01.910> when<00:03:02.480> did<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.810> actually<00:03:03.200> start

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
communicate when did it actually start

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.430 
communicate when did it actually start
getting<00:03:03.830> easier<00:03:04.430> in<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.420> grid<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.960> think<00:03:06.350> it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
getting easier in the grid I think it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.230 
getting easier in the grid I think it
definitely<00:03:06.590> got<00:03:06.860> easier<00:03:07.280> once<00:03:07.580> we<00:03:07.730> figured

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
definitely got easier once we figured

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.000 
definitely got easier once we figured
out<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.450> rules<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.230> when<00:03:09.350> we<00:03:09.500> knew<00:03:09.680> what<00:03:09.890> we

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
out the rules so when we knew what we

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.770 
out the rules so when we knew what we
could<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.370> couldn't<00:03:10.610> do<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.240> we<00:03:11.390> all<00:03:11.540> knew

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
could and couldn't do and we all knew

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.150 
could and couldn't do and we all knew
that<00:03:11.810> then<00:03:12.470> we<00:03:12.560> can<00:03:12.740> just<00:03:12.890> kind<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.100> move

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
that then we can just kind of move

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.680 
that then we can just kind of move
around<00:03:13.490> and<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:13.940> was<00:03:14.090> more<00:03:14.330> just<00:03:14.360> about

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
around and it was more just about

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.570 
around and it was more just about
figuring<00:03:15.200> out<00:03:15.350> which<00:03:15.560> square<00:03:15.950> was<00:03:16.100> next

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
figuring out which square was next

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.700 
figuring out which square was next
what<00:03:16.970> could<00:03:17.240> we<00:03:17.480> take<00:03:17.690> back<00:03:17.990> if<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.500> were<00:03:18.620> in

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
you don't want to have

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.280 
you don't want to have
complete<00:03:51.760> competitiveness<00:03:52.570> because<00:03:52.810> if<00:03:53.140> we

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
complete competitiveness because if we

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.800 
complete competitiveness because if we
hadn't<00:03:53.770> worked<00:03:54.100> at<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.430> team<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:55.000> put<00:03:55.600> down

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
hadn't worked at the team and put down

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.330 
hadn't worked at the team and put down
those<00:03:56.020> little<00:03:56.350> matching<00:03:56.530> tapes<00:03:57.010> we<00:03:57.220> would

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
those little matching tapes we would

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.770 
those little matching tapes we would
have<00:03:57.430> had<00:03:57.550> to<00:03:57.640> be<00:03:57.730> doing<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.210> our<00:03:58.330> head<00:03:58.510> and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
have had to be doing it in our head and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.930 
have had to be doing it in our head and
it<00:03:58.840> would<00:03:58.900> have<00:03:59.020> taken<00:03:59.200> three<00:04:00.130> times<00:04:00.490> as<00:04:00.760> long

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
it would have taken three times as long

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.870 
it would have taken three times as long
so<00:04:01.390> it's<00:04:01.570> just<00:04:01.750> working<00:04:02.200> together<00:04:02.820> for<00:04:03.820> a

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
so it's just working together for a

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.610 
so it's just working together for a
common<00:04:04.120> goal<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.660> knowing<00:04:05.020> that<00:04:05.050> everyone's

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
common goal and knowing that everyone's

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.510 
common goal and knowing that everyone's
on<00:04:05.770> your<00:04:05.950> side<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.490> think<00:04:07.240> as<00:04:07.990> an<00:04:08.530> employer<00:04:09.070> have

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
on your side I think as an employer have

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.120 
on your side I think as an employer have
very<00:04:10.030> clear<00:04:10.420> guidelines<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:11.260> your<00:04:11.470> employees

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
very clear guidelines to your employees

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.700 
very clear guidelines to your employees
so<00:04:12.910> that<00:04:12.940> they<00:04:13.420> will<00:04:13.570> not<00:04:13.750> get<00:04:13.930> confused<00:04:14.410> and

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
so that they will not get confused and

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.650 
so that they will not get confused and
start<00:04:15.490> guessing<00:04:15.910> what<00:04:16.030> they're<00:04:16.209> supposed<00:04:16.570> to

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
start guessing what they're supposed to

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.110 
start guessing what they're supposed to
be<00:04:16.810> doing<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.470> workforce<00:04:17.860> and<00:04:18.250> in<00:04:18.910> their

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
be doing in the workforce and in their

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.240 
be doing in the workforce and in their
team<00:04:19.360> I<00:04:19.630> was<00:04:20.049> just<00:04:20.230> going<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.470> say<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.890> we're

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
team I was just going to say that we're

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.550 
team I was just going to say that we're
here<00:04:21.459> as<00:04:21.519> a<00:04:21.549> team<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.180> very<00:04:22.390> important<00:04:22.990> and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
here as a team is very important and

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.590 
here as a team is very important and
then<00:04:23.710> they<00:04:23.980> all<00:04:24.220> are<00:04:24.820> working<00:04:25.030> towards

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
then they all are working towards

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.990 
then they all are working towards
something<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.620> found<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.370> second<00:04:27.880> time

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
something and I found that second time

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.660 
something and I found that second time
around<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.420> we<00:04:28.810> all<00:04:29.050> stepped<00:04:29.620> up<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.190> helped

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
around that we all stepped up and helped

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.660 
around that we all stepped up and helped
each<00:04:30.760> other<00:04:30.940> out<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.510> we<00:04:32.350> got<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.680> done<00:04:32.890> faster

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
each other out and we got it done faster

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:49.820 
each other out and we got it done faster
and<00:04:33.780> more<00:04:34.780> efficient
