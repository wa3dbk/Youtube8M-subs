00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
minus the fact that i've made it to

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.519 
minus the fact that i've made it to
round<00:00:14.070> 115<00:00:14.519> already<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.990> round<00:00:16.260> skipped

surprisingly only made it to round 115
and<00:02:05.219> one<00:02:05.759> thing<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.030> want<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.210> put<00:02:06.329> out<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.479> is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and one thing I want to put out there is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.619 
and one thing I want to put out there is
that<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.350> did<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.520> put<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.360> my<00:02:09.450> main

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
that I did not put do this on my main

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.570 
that I did not put do this on my main
account<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.590> did<00:02:10.739> not<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.400> take

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
account and I did not do this to take

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.680 
account and I did not do this to take
advantage<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> leader

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
advantage to the leader

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.400 
advantage to the leader
so<00:02:14.000> I'm<00:02:15.000> not<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.480> those<00:02:15.630> people<00:02:16.080> who<00:02:16.200> do

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so I'm not one of those people who do

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.870 
so I'm not one of those people who do
this<00:02:16.590> shit<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.190> leaderboards<00:02:17.820> at<00:02:18.090> all

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
this shit for the leaderboards at all

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.450 
this shit for the leaderboards at all
excuse<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:22.010> but<00:02:23.010> as<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.930> i<00:02:25.130> will<00:02:26.130> be

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
excuse that but as you see i will be

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.080 
excuse that but as you see i will be
putting<00:02:26.640> up<00:02:26.940> hopefully<00:02:27.900> round<00:02:28.620> 100<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.970> I've

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
putting up hopefully round 100 that I've

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.290 
putting up hopefully round 100 that I've
made<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.840> tomorrow<00:02:31.820> this<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.180> a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
made it to tomorrow this is just a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.640 
made it to tomorrow this is just a
little<00:02:33.480> preview<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.870> how<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> do<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> glitch

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
little preview of how to do the glitch

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.160 
little preview of how to do the glitch
since<00:02:35.460> well<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:37.170> pretty<00:02:37.350> simple<00:02:37.470> anyway<00:02:39.170> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
since well it's pretty simple anyway you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.990 
since well it's pretty simple anyway you
just<00:02:40.200> go<00:02:40.800> all<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.040> way<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.370> corner<00:02:41.790> right

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
just go all the way in that corner right

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.280 
just go all the way in that corner right
there<00:02:42.200> looking<00:02:43.200> down<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.650> then<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:46.050> should

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
there looking down that then you should

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.410 
there looking down that then you should
be<00:02:46.380> able<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.620> notice<00:02:46.920> them<00:02:47.070> piling<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.640> at<00:02:48.210> that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
be able to notice them piling up at that

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.150 
be able to notice them piling up at that
doorway<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:50.100> saw<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.640> only<00:02:50.790> shot<00:02:51.060> once<00:02:52.160> once

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
doorway as you saw I only shot once once

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.100 
doorway as you saw I only shot once once
or<00:02:53.340> twice<00:02:53.490> maybe<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.240> round<00:02:54.510> since<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.900> Ron

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
or twice maybe this round since this Ron

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.200 
or twice maybe this round since this Ron
just<00:02:55.290> started<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.490> can<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.060> don't

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
just started and you can see I don't

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.300 
just started and you can see I don't
really<00:02:57.480> need<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.810> shoot<00:02:57.960> anymore<00:02:58.310> because

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
really need to shoot anymore because

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.430 
really need to shoot anymore because
they<00:03:00.150> all<00:03:00.270> just<00:03:00.480> slip<00:03:00.720> inside<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.990> I<00:03:03.990> believe

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
they all just slip inside and I believe

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.320 
they all just slip inside and I believe
there's<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.770> challenge<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.090> after

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
there's a challenge you can get after

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.520 
there's a challenge you can get after
you<00:03:06.420> get<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> certain<00:03:06.690> amount<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:07.050> kills<00:03:07.230> with

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
you get a certain amount of kills with

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.040 
you get a certain amount of kills with
this<00:03:07.710> gun<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.130> don't<00:03:08.610> know<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.390> my<00:03:09.510> friend<00:03:09.810> said

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
this gun I don't know so my friend said

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.420 
this gun I don't know so my friend said
anyway<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.750> hope<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.620> guys<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.980> fun<00:03:14.010> with

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.070 
anyway so I hope you guys have fun with
the<00:03:14.550> glitch<00:03:14.880> maybe<00:03:15.210> get<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.510> higher<00:03:15.630> rounds

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
the glitch maybe get to higher rounds

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.690 
the glitch maybe get to higher rounds
and<00:03:16.230> tomorrow<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.890> don't<00:03:17.160> know<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.400> said<00:03:17.580> this

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
100 that I've gotten from this glitch

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.050 
100 that I've gotten from this glitch
and<00:03:22.730> maybe<00:03:23.730> some<00:03:23.970> more<00:03:24.380> tat<00:03:25.580> tactics<00:03:26.580> on<00:03:26.880> this

and maybe some more tat tactics on this

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.370 
and maybe some more tat tactics on this
glitch<00:03:27.300> not<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.959> guys<00:03:28.110> were<00:03:28.260> really

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
glitch not that you guys were really

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.080 
glitch not that you guys were really
needed<00:03:28.830> since<00:03:29.010> it's<00:03:29.160> pretty<00:03:29.370> simple<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.910> laid

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
needed since it's pretty simple and laid
