debated<00:02:18.720> doing<00:02:19.019> one<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.200> those<00:02:19.440> for<00:02:19.769> my

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
debated doing one of those for my

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.620 
debated doing one of those for my
personal<00:02:20.489> channel<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.060> thought<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.420> would<00:02:21.570> be

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
personal channel I thought that would be

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.259 
personal channel I thought that would be
funny<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.760> having<00:02:23.760> something<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.090> would

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
funny like having something that would

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.600 
funny like having something that would
obviously<00:02:24.420> not<00:02:24.989> do<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.590> something<00:02:26.459> really

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
obviously not do that something really

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:39.330 
obviously not do that something really
annoying<00:02:30.590> anyway
