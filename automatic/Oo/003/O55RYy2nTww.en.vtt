00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
three fuel cells into our ship as fast

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.179 
three fuel cells into our ship as fast
as<00:01:23.759> possible<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:26.159> about

as possible and this one is all about
just<00:01:26.640> surviving<00:01:27.330> making<00:01:27.750> sure<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.020> pick<00:01:28.200> up

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
just surviving making sure you pick up

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.230 
just surviving making sure you pick up
the<00:01:28.439> fuel<00:01:28.650> cells<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.640> deliver<00:01:29.939> them

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the fuel cells you can deliver them

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
the fuel cells you can deliver them
directly<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> ship<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.799> me<00:01:31.979> doing

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
directly to the ship as you see me doing

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.340 
directly to the ship as you see me doing
which<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.180> faster<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
which is a little bit faster but if you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
which is a little bit faster but if you
fly<00:01:34.590> directly<00:01:35.040> over<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> ship<00:01:35.700> it'll<00:01:36.090> fall

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
fly directly over the ship it'll fall

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.289 
fly directly over the ship it'll fall
into<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> ship<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.909> it'll<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.150> take

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
into the ship and and it'll just take

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
into the ship and and it'll just take
longer<00:01:39.439> but<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:40.650> actually<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
longer but you don't actually have to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
longer but you don't actually have to
deliver<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.430> straight<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> ship<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.090> can

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
deliver it straight to the ship you can

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.639 
deliver it straight to the ship you can
kind<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.540> hover<00:01:42.810> over<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.229> ship<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
kind of just hover over the ship and the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.039 
kind of just hover over the ship and the
fuel<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:44.040> fall<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.630> last<00:01:45.840> one

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
fuel will fall into it for this last one

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
fuel will fall into it for this last one
we<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> one<00:01:46.560> minute<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.130> put<00:01:47.490> together<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we have one minute to put together a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.929 
we have one minute to put together a
ship<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.990> fuel<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.680> blast<00:01:49.950> off<00:01:50.189> so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
ship and then fuel it and blast off so

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.370 
ship and then fuel it and blast off so
as<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> first<00:01:52.110> piece

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
as you can see here with the first piece

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
as you can see here with the first piece
I<00:01:52.649> actually<00:01:53.009> let<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.340> piece<00:01:53.520> fall<00:01:53.820> down<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
I actually let the piece fall down and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.120 
I actually let the piece fall down and
you'll<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.049> me<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> with<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> lot<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
you'll see me do that with a lot of the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.429 
you'll see me do that with a lot of the
fuel<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.610> well<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.750> take<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:58.049> long<00:01:58.229> as

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
fuel as well now you can take as long as

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
fuel as well now you can take as long as
you<00:01:58.590> need<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.799> think<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:00.240> least<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you need I think you have at least a

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020 
you need I think you have at least a
minute<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:02.189> shouldn't<00:02:02.460> need<00:02:02.520> more<00:02:02.850> than

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
minute and you shouldn't need more than

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.819 
minute and you shouldn't need more than
that<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.450> long<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:03.750> you're<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.049> being<00:02:04.560> very

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
that as long as you're not being very

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.399 
that as long as you're not being very
slow<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.189> overly<00:02:05.790> cautious<00:02:06.079> again<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.259> am

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
slow or overly cautious again I am

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.889 
slow or overly cautious again I am
holding<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:08.039> which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.580> fire<00:02:08.849> non-stop<00:02:09.660> I'm

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
holding a which is to fire non-stop I'm

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.390 
holding a which is to fire non-stop I'm
never<00:02:10.289> not<00:02:10.739> firing

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
never not firing

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.059 
never not firing
it's<00:02:12.620> basically<00:02:13.620> there

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
it's basically there

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.399 
it's basically there
no<00:02:14.280> good<00:02:14.489> reason<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:15.030> not<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:15.420> firing<00:02:15.930> you

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
no good reason to not be firing you

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.750 
no good reason to not be firing you
might<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.650> well<00:02:16.769> be<00:02:16.920> firing<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.489> killing

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
might as well be firing and killing

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.899 
might as well be firing and killing
enemies<00:02:18.060> when<00:02:18.540> you're<00:02:18.749> near<00:02:18.900> them<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.430> all

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
waiting for fuel cells to spawn on these

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.699 
waiting for fuel cells to spawn on these
platforms<00:02:24.659> picking<00:02:25.019> them<00:02:25.139> up<00:02:25.290> delivering

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
as soon as the ship fuels up and turns

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.629 
as soon as the ship fuels up and turns
fully<00:02:37.200> purple<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.920> make<00:02:38.099> sure<00:02:38.250> you're<00:02:38.400> there

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
gonna need to do five roundabouts I

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.170 
gonna need to do five roundabouts I
believe<00:02:43.889> they're<00:02:44.069> called<00:02:44.249> wrap<00:02:44.549> arounds<00:02:45.060> and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
believe they're called wrap arounds and

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.459 
believe they're called wrap arounds and
you're<00:02:45.389> gonna<00:02:45.480> basically<00:02:45.719> need<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.049> go<00:02:46.260> from

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
you're gonna basically need to go from

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.110 
you're gonna basically need to go from
one<00:02:46.650> side<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:46.889> the<00:02:46.980> screen<00:02:47.310> through<00:02:47.939> this

can be quite easy as long as you're very
cautious<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.590> take<00:03:16.799> your<00:03:16.829> time<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.849> one

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
cautious and you take your time this one

you're gonna need to fuel up your ship

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.789 
you're gonna need to fuel up your ship
without<00:03:20.609> using<00:03:21.419> your<00:03:21.449> gun<00:03:21.750> your<00:03:22.290> gun<00:03:22.470> has<00:03:22.590> been

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.960 
without using your gun your gun has been
disabled<00:03:23.449> so<00:03:24.449> you'll<00:03:25.139> have<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.859> use<00:03:26.400> your

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
disabled so you'll have to just use your

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.819 
disabled so you'll have to just use your
movement<00:03:27.599> without<00:03:27.959> actually<00:03:28.409> shooting<00:03:28.650> any

of<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.009> enemies<00:03:29.129> and<00:03:29.609> what<00:03:30.389> I<00:03:30.419> recommend<00:03:30.900> for

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
of the enemies and what I recommend for

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.659 
of the enemies and what I recommend for
this<00:03:31.199> one<00:03:31.439> is<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:31.829> try<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.129> stay<00:03:32.400> away<00:03:32.639> from

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
this one is just try to stay away from

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.629 
this one is just try to stay away from
enemies<00:03:33.239> as<00:03:33.540> much<00:03:33.900> as<00:03:34.169> you<00:03:34.349> can<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.919> general<00:03:35.189> as

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
enemies as much as you can in general as

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.099
