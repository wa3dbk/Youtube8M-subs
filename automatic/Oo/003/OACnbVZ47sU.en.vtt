and straight what are you what are you
looking<00:01:38.110> for<00:01:38.560> sure<00:01:38.710> well<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.070> soundness<00:01:39.400> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
looking for sure well the soundness is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.210 
looking for sure well the soundness is
associated<00:01:41.110> with<00:01:41.140> their<00:01:41.380> feet<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.590> legs<00:01:41.920> that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
associated with their feet and legs that

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.130 
associated with their feet and legs that
means<00:01:42.670> that<00:01:42.850> they<00:01:42.970> can<00:01:43.119> move<00:01:43.270> their<00:01:43.720> legs

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
means that they can move their legs

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.480 
means that they can move their legs
structure<00:01:44.680> all<00:01:44.830> goes<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.310> right

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
structure all goes in the right

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.730 
structure all goes in the right
direction<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:46.150> they<00:01:46.270> move<00:01:46.479> well<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.080> then

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
direction and they move well and then

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.200 
direction and they move well and then
the<00:01:47.890> straightness<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.580> correct<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.030> is

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
the straightness and the correct this is

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.969 
the straightness and the correct this is
just<00:01:49.450> their<00:01:49.630> overall<00:01:49.780> pattern<00:01:50.530> do<00:01:50.710> they<00:01:50.830> have

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
just their overall pattern do they have

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.650 
just their overall pattern do they have
some<00:01:51.220> style<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:51.790> balance<00:01:52.210> do<00:01:52.360> they<00:01:52.479> hold

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
some style and balance do they hold

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.990 
some style and balance do they hold
their<00:01:52.840> head<00:01:52.990> up<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.350> have<00:01:53.590> some<00:01:53.830> presence<00:01:54.700> to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
their head up and have some presence to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.969 
their head up and have some presence to
them<00:01:55.150> and<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.660> it's<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:56.020> it's<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.350> combination<00:01:56.619> of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
them and so it's a it's a combination of

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:23.370 
them and so it's a it's a combination of
those<00:01:57.160> things

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.140
