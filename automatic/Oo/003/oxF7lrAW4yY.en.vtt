00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.180
 The school's 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:18.910
 Rod Ideal human-machine interface based on being safer than anything 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.910
 The new devil you pursued 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.310
 Various devices to enjoy safe and comfortable operation while processing a lot of information 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:34.970
 It is concentrated 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:39.110
 In order to pursue our hmi we have interwoven three major functional parts 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.990
 One is an active driving display and the second is a center display 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.560
 And it is the third one of 50,000 put out h 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.560
 2 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:57.700
 Heads up The cockpit has made traveling safety a top priority 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.739
 Though it is Aichi mi's way of thinking , even when the display is seen, the car 20m ahead 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.160
 I can see the brake light 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.490
 Also can be seen clearly the state of the neat front of the car in a state in which the customer is watching the display 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.310
 I'm aiming for that 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.619
 Well 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.619
 I decided the position of the display 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.939
 me 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:26.359
 The Tteyuu Commander switch will need support when the operation 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:28.890
 On where you say where to providing this support is first to introduce this commander switch 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:33.990
 It will be the first point in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:40.110
 It is an absolute set that supports the introduction of this commander switch with straw 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.020
 I'm thinking there 's a hand in hand that isn't supported by this article, but by hand 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.090
 It is the idea of â€‹â€‹that palm rest 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:54.380
 Palm rest is used as a fixed moving palm, so first of all this dial 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:58.490
 One was in the rotation is difficult to state than in the direction used in so much armrest is that operation 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.890
 It is hard to put power on this big r 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 I did a review of the spec body , but another one is rotation 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:16.019
 Display but I was large deed is not a lot of Tteyuu selection list 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:22.079
 Above one rotation Once you to go from top to bottom when you turn high the No. line from beginning to end in 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:23.569
 We are hitting from below and we move it right arm click at 20 degrees thinking it about 100 degrees 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.889
 I'm doing it 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:31.280
 This command switch used in a compact car is a palm rest 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:36.740
 The fact is that if you rotate the wrist 5 times 200 degrees 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:41.930
 Well there is less movement range of the weak wrist so its movement range and less 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:46.040
 In fact, I was moving at 20 degrees 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.610
 It was to move at an angle of 15 degrees of the click 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.409
 I thought about where driving safety top priority 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:58.760
 Well, I am at visitor is driving the car in by the pursuit of team Love 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:04.760
 You feel very secure when you sit in the cockpit 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:08.750
 Because you can feel the joy of running by having the sense of security 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.020
 There is all of the customers of I believe or not is 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.500
 It is my thought that you want to feel 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.500
