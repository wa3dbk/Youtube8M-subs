 how to make micheladas super rich well 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.359
 fast these are the ingredients what 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.820
 we're going to need first of all we're going 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:16.429
 to put on a plate we are going to put salt 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.429
 and then we're going to put a pajín 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.980
 let's use a glass and I'll choose a 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.560
 little but this glass I wet it what 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.180
 I put in the freezer and it looks good 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.830
 and it looks a little bit cloudy like this 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.660
 crime that remains around we are going to 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.720
 grab half a lemon we 're going 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.940
 to move to the top of the cup and 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.739
 then this glass is going to happen 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.739
 where to be tajín with salt 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.910
 now we 're going to put it clamato like a 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.910
 third of the glass 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.940

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.870
 we are going to prepare it and we are going to put it 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.870
 two lemons 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.610
 we are going to put 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.430
 about two droplets of game to maggie 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.180

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.620
 from Guadalajara can use the sauces that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.410
 you want but I like them 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.270
 especially because I'm Sinaloan 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.180
 like the macaw and to give it a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.150
 little extra touch we will put 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.420

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.420

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.110
 we are not going to stir 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.530

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.330
