visit<00:03:00.200> can<00:03:00.500> cost<00:03:00.800> us<00:03:01.040> 10<00:03:01.640> or<00:03:01.970> maybe<00:03:02.210> fifteen

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
visit can cost us 10 or maybe fifteen

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.580 
visit can cost us 10 or maybe fifteen
dollars

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.160 

okay<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.220> let's<00:03:10.400> do<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.640> math<00:03:10.670> if<00:03:11.660> monks<00:03:12.050> them

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
okay so let's do the math if monks them

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.500 
okay so let's do the math if monks them
all<00:03:12.319> was<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.500> make<00:03:12.739> silks<00:03:13.190> all<00:03:13.430> day<00:03:13.730> long<00:03:13.940> seven

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
all was to make silks all day long seven

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.540 
all was to make silks all day long seven
days<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:14.690> week<00:03:14.840> she<00:03:15.830> would<00:03:15.920> make<00:03:16.069> about<00:03:16.280> two

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
days a week she would make about two

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.270 
days a week she would make about two
dollars<00:03:16.700> per<00:03:17.090> day<00:03:17.319> so<00:03:18.319> in<00:03:18.440> one<00:03:18.590> month<00:03:18.860> she

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
dollars per day so in one month she

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.729 
dollars per day so in one month she
would<00:03:19.400> earn<00:03:19.580> about<00:03:19.819> sixty<00:03:20.420> dollars<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.650> if

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
would earn about sixty dollars and if

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.020 
would earn about sixty dollars and if
one<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:21.980> her<00:03:22.069> family<00:03:22.459> needs<00:03:22.640> medical

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
one of her family needs medical

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.979 
one of her family needs medical
treatment<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:24.019> costs<00:03:24.470> her<00:03:24.590> fifteen<00:03:25.190> dollars

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
treatment it costs her fifteen dollars

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.780 
treatment it costs her fifteen dollars
so<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.230> they<00:03:27.410> get<00:03:27.560> sick<00:03:27.799> say<00:03:28.190> four<00:03:28.430> times<00:03:28.670> per

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
so if they get sick say four times per

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.330 
so if they get sick say four times per
month<00:03:29.060> she's<00:03:29.959> shelling<00:03:30.290> out<00:03:30.410> her<00:03:30.560> entire<00:03:30.709> wage

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
month she's shelling out her entire wage

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
that it acts as a natural filter to get

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.110 
that it acts as a natural filter to get
rid<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.099> lot<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.340> bad<00:04:10.489> stuff<00:04:10.760> in<00:04:11.030> the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
water then there are these amazing

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.469 
water then there are these amazing
contraptions<00:04:15.380> more<00:04:15.620> BIOS<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.280> filters<00:04:16.820> well

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
contraptions more BIOS and filters well

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.699 
contraptions more BIOS and filters well
they<00:04:17.539> kind<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.810> do<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:17.989> same<00:04:18.200> thing<00:04:18.470> as<00:04:18.590> the

the water in the top of the filter and

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.379 
the water in the top of the filter and
it<00:04:24.770> gradually<00:04:24.979> seeps<00:04:25.490> through<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:25.849> sand<00:04:26.120> and

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
it gradually seeps through the sand and

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.440 
it gradually seeps through the sand and
water<00:04:26.630> flows<00:04:26.960> out<00:04:27.169> clean<00:04:27.530> at<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.889> other<00:04:28.039> end
