00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
our little graphic representation we

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.550 
our little graphic representation we
don't<00:01:13.579> really<00:01:13.700> need<00:01:14.119> either<00:01:14.780> one<00:01:15.229> of<00:01:15.350> those

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
don't really need either one of those

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.739 
don't really need either one of those
but<00:01:15.889> both<00:01:16.249> are<00:01:16.429> a<00:01:16.490> good<00:01:16.670> idea<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.509> now<00:01:17.689> we

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
but both are a good idea and so now we

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.629 
but both are a good idea and so now we
have<00:01:17.990> them<00:01:18.139> but<00:01:18.709> again<00:01:19.009> we<00:01:19.249> could<00:01:19.399> pretty<00:01:19.549> much

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
have them but again we could pretty much

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.429 
have them but again we could pretty much
turn<00:01:19.850> anything<00:01:20.179> into<00:01:20.569> a<00:01:20.719> button<00:01:21.049> we<00:01:21.200> could<00:01:21.289> go

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
turn anything into a button we could go

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.219 
turn anything into a button we could go
to<00:01:21.529> the<00:01:21.829> library<00:01:22.039> panel<00:01:22.639> and<00:01:22.819> in<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:23.749> general

set<00:01:24.499> I'm<00:01:24.619> going<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.829> go<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.009> images<00:01:25.909> here<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.829> I

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
set I'm going to go to images here and I

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.099 
set I'm going to go to images here and I
might<00:01:28.219> choose<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.789> rocket<00:01:29.329> which<00:01:29.539> is<00:01:29.689> awesome

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109

petal ad which thematically does not
work<00:01:35.240> really<00:01:35.450> well<00:01:35.719> but<00:01:35.810> we're<00:01:35.929> going<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.109> go

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
work really well but we're going to go

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.440 
work really well but we're going to go
with<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.560> with<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.249> rocket<00:01:37.369> selected<00:01:37.999> I'll<00:01:38.209> go
