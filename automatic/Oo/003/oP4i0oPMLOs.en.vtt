00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
a gill her me I think the athletic

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.309 
a gill her me I think the athletic
imagery<00:03:53.000> sent<00:03:53.239> amid<00:03:53.510> which<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.989> could<00:03:54.229> have

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
right you could have done this method

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.300 
right you could have done this method
with<00:04:00.139> him<00:04:00.349> as<00:04:00.500> well<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:00.919> you<00:04:01.010> would<00:04:01.129> have<00:04:01.189> been

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
with him as well and you would have been

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.979 
with him as well and you would have been
able<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.609> make<00:04:01.699> quite<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.090> bit<00:04:02.269> profit<00:04:02.689> from<00:04:02.810> him
