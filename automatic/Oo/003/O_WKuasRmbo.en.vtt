normally<00:02:07.890> takes<00:02:08.280> about<00:02:08.430> five<00:02:09.420> seconds<00:02:09.840> for

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
normally takes about five seconds for

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.690 
normally takes about five seconds for
the<00:02:10.080> download<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.619> some<00:02:11.100> reason<00:02:11.370> very

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the download but some reason very

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.310 
the download but some reason very
sensible<00:02:12.000> takes<00:02:12.180> little<00:02:12.330> bit<00:02:12.450> longer<00:02:12.630> just

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
sensible takes little bit longer just

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.130 
sensible takes little bit longer just
has<00:02:13.710> all<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.950> pictures<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.720> only<00:02:15.990> took

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
has all the pictures but that only took

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.680 
has all the pictures but that only took
about<00:02:16.200> five<00:02:16.560> or<00:02:16.680> six<00:02:16.800> seconds<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> download

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
about five or six seconds to download

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.160 
about five or six seconds to download
it's<00:02:18.690> not<00:02:18.960> really<00:02:19.920> not<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.960> slow<00:02:21.960> at<00:02:22.080> all

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170

the<00:03:33.120> first<00:03:33.360> smartphone<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:34.110> run<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
the first smartphone to run on the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.670 
the first smartphone to run on the
hospital<00:03:35.280> Earth<00:03:35.430> technology<00:03:36.380> hspa+<00:03:37.380> which

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
hospital Earth technology hspa+ which

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.910 
hospital Earth technology hspa+ which
means<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.130> can<00:03:38.280> download<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.730> speeds<00:03:39.030> up<00:03:39.180> to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
14.4 megabytes per second now that is

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.400 
14.4 megabytes per second now that is
pretty<00:03:44.760> fast<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:46.340> it's<00:03:47.340> rumored<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.410> rattler

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
pretty fast so it's rumored that rattler

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.520 
pretty fast so it's rumored that rattler
that<00:03:49.620> we<00:03:50.100> are<00:03:50.250> officially<00:03:50.610> getting<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:51.530> hspa+

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
that we are officially getting a hspa+

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.390 
that we are officially getting a hspa+
pretty<00:03:52.860> soon<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.850> whenever<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.209> do<00:03:54.300> get<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.810> I

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
pretty soon so whenever I do get that I

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.820 
pretty soon so whenever I do get that I
will<00:03:56.480> make<00:03:57.480> another<00:03:57.600> video<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.260> see<00:03:58.620> how<00:03:58.709> much

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
will make another video and see how much

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.920 
will make another video and see how much
faster<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.060> if<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.600> only<00:04:00.690> took<00:04:00.840> about

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
faster it is so if it only took about

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.050 
faster it is so if it only took about
four<00:04:01.260> seconds<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.709> download<00:04:01.830> yahoo<00:04:02.370> which<00:04:02.880> is

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
four seconds to download yahoo which is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.290 
four seconds to download yahoo which is

and<00:04:12.360> go<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.810> CNN

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
and go to the CNN

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.099

I'd never been to see handle my phone so

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.349 
I'd never been to see handle my phone so
it<00:04:16.169> may<00:04:16.290> take<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.500> little<00:04:16.560> longer<00:04:16.739> but<00:04:17.519> they

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
take long at all what is that two sets

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.360 
take long at all what is that two sets

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
it up sub right now I'm at the one point

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.300 
it up sub right now I'm at the one point
15<00:04:23.790> 10<00:04:24.240> good<00:04:24.480> by<00:04:24.570> Troy<00:04:24.750> jacket<00:04:25.230> it's<00:04:26.070> really

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
great I'm going to do another test just

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.750 
great I'm going to do another test just
to<00:04:28.410> see<00:04:28.740> what<00:04:28.919> I<00:04:28.950> am<00:04:29.160> at<00:04:31.400> all<00:04:32.400> right<00:04:32.580> I'm<00:04:32.669> gonna

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680

point<00:04:34.919> 51

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.050 

now<00:04:45.080> just<00:04:45.320> showed<00:04:45.500> me<00:04:45.590> on<00:04:45.680> one<00:04:45.830> point<00:04:45.949> 67<00:04:46.669> and<00:04:46.910> I

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
now just showed me on one point 67 and I

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.999 
now just showed me on one point 67 and I
was<00:04:47.210> sitting<00:04:47.389> here<00:04:47.570> at<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.720> same<00:04:47.900> spot<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.860> it

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
was sitting here at the same spot so it

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.719 
was sitting here at the same spot so it
does<00:04:49.130> vary<00:04:49.690> where<00:04:50.690> you're<00:04:50.810> at<00:04:51.280> but<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.430> could

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
does vary where you're at but you could

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.770 
does vary where you're at but you could
assume<00:04:53.060> but<00:04:54.020> this<00:04:54.470> speed<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.860> very<00:04:55.070> good<00:04:55.400> and

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
assume but this speed is very good and

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.540 
assume but this speed is very good and
I'm<00:04:56.780> very<00:04:57.500> very<00:04:59.590> like<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.800> speed<00:05:01.070> how<00:05:01.280> fast

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
I'm very very like this speed how fast

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.840 
I'm very very like this speed how fast
it<00:05:01.699> is<00:05:01.789> and<00:05:02.090> ready<00:05:02.840> for<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.580> hspa+<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.699> come

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
it is and ready for the hspa+ you come

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.840 
it is and ready for the hspa+ you come
around<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.389> I<00:05:06.220> will<00:05:07.220> make<00:05:07.310> another<00:05:07.430> video<00:05:07.699> in

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
around and I will make another video in

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.650 
around and I will make another video in
that<00:05:08.000> comes<00:05:08.180> out<00:05:08.360> all<00:05:09.020> right<00:05:09.169> thank<00:05:09.590> you
