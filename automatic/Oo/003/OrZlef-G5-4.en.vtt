 I am fernando and today we will be 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.820
 doing some photos to release the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.160
 new studio speedlite flashes 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.490
 and it has occurred to me that the first 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.130
 photo session with these flashes is the 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.100
 I'm going to do another flash like I could not 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.600
 be less to our dear don wow 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.250
 that I know that many of you also 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.020
 you have for the comments that you have 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.550
 great for the price it has is a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 wonder then well the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
 principle we put the shoe what 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.640
 let's place here 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.640
 well I will be working with 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:53.239
 with a fixed focus in this case with him 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.520
 with the canon 50 millimeters 1.8 worth only 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.680
 we would have to place the trigger to the 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.730
 camera the tri that is already placed in the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.989
 flash is fine we place here 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.989
 catsup a chin pum 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.960
 card to the camera 'we understand flash 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.960
 I'm going to start the photo shoot 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.149
 using this umbrella and I'm going to bounce the 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:23.909
 light first to see what effect 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.909
 give us I will use a little light day 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.430
 forgive the modeling light to be 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 seeing better him 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.960
 there is good light focused light 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.409
 of modeling at the moment we can 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.409
 to be 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.359
 removing 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.540
 I would like to put this in a way that 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.510
 you can see well because right now it is 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.710
 I'm going to be here and you're not going to 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.090
 be seeing the matter well so 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.770
 let's move the camera 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.189
 well we have changed the angle of the 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.810
 camera but I think we can go there 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.890
 see better what I'm doing 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.890

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.499
 test shot ok 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.950
 power moment will put the 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.950
 minimum 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.240
 and I have the frame 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.210

 it comes out very black everything that is exactly 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.370
 just what I intended 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.610
 let's raise the power of the flash and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.500
 that we have gone up two steps 1 2 3 4 steps 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.500
 of the uploaded in flash 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.000
 this is much better 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.000
 well I'm going to go up a little bit more 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.219
 the 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.219
 umbrella and we bring it another bit more 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.880

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.300

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.430
 like the mule 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.090

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.090

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.120
 Oh 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.120
 to see what happens 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.910

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.660
 There is focused com 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.350
 very well the truth is that they come out great 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.840
 we are shooting at an 11 f that I believe 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.450
 that is pretty well still well I do 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.040
 second 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.180
 and still they are fuck 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.180
 and there are still 100 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.480
 it's still re 22 we should be 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.480
 putting a miso 200 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.720
 effectively there is better 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:27.090
 but hey I think in this case 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.169
 I still need an F-22 sincerely I think 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.770

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.849

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:43.669
