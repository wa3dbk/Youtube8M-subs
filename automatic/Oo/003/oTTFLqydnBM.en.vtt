wheels<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.680> want<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.040> recline<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.489> canopy

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
wheels I want to recline the canopy

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.979 
wheels I want to recline the canopy
would<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.269> lift<00:02:58.170> up<00:02:58.319> on<00:02:58.530> either<00:02:58.709> side<00:02:59.989> he's

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
would just lift up on either side he's

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.190 
would just lift up on either side he's
here<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:02.099> kind<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.400> becomes<00:03:02.730> forward<00:03:03.299> very

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
here and it kind of becomes forward very

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.270 
here and it kind of becomes forward very
very<00:03:04.500> easily<00:03:04.739> like<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:06.739> now<00:03:07.739> I'm<00:03:07.890> going<00:03:08.069> to

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
very easily like that now I'm going to

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.990 
very easily like that now I'm going to
show<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.549> how<00:03:08.760> easy<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.950> collapse<00:03:11.000> and

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
show you how easy it is to collapse and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.449 
show you how easy it is to collapse and
pack<00:03:12.329> away<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.989> stroller<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.769> fits<00:03:14.070> in<00:03:14.280> my

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
pack away the stroller so fits in my

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
boot with a single-handed collapsing

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.210 
boot with a single-handed collapsing
system<00:03:19.970> you'll<00:03:20.970> see<00:03:21.239> over<00:03:21.420> here<00:03:22.040> there<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.190> a

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
system you'll see over here there is a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.630 
system you'll see over here there is a
step<00:03:23.609> which<00:03:24.299> I'll<00:03:24.510> put<00:03:24.720> my<00:03:24.840> foot<00:03:25.109> on<00:03:25.340> use<00:03:26.340> as

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
step which I'll put my foot on use as

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.110 
step which I'll put my foot on use as
leverage<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:28.260> handle<00:03:28.769> which<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.760> will<00:03:29.940> lift

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
leverage and a handle which I will lift

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.770 
leverage and a handle which I will lift
up<00:03:30.359> now<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:32.160> step<00:03:32.970> here<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.329> when<00:03:33.630> we

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
up now this step here is when we

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.110 
up now this step here is when we
actually<00:03:34.260> put<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.769> stroller<00:03:35.040> up<00:03:35.340> your<00:03:35.549> rest

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
actually put the stroller up your rest

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.819 
actually put the stroller up your rest
your<00:03:36.329> foot<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.630> there<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:36.959> push<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.319> down<00:03:37.500> and

your foot on there and push it down and
the<00:03:38.280> whole<00:03:38.459> thing<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.030> comes<00:03:39.239> out<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:40.260> folds

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the whole thing just comes out and folds

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.860 
the whole thing just comes out and folds
out<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:40.889> locks<00:03:41.310> into<00:03:41.549> place<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.630> for

out and locks into place but for

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.539 
out and locks into place but for
actually<00:03:43.290> collapsing<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:43.950> with<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> single

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
actually collapsing it with a single

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.970 
actually collapsing it with a single
hand<00:03:44.760> we'll<00:03:45.269> just<00:03:45.450> use<00:03:45.630> this<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.139> this<00:03:46.739> over

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
hand we'll just use this and this over

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.660 
hand we'll just use this and this over
here<00:03:47.130> with<00:03:47.400> our<00:03:47.549> foot<00:03:49.250> put<00:03:50.250> my<00:03:50.400> foot<00:03:50.639> there
