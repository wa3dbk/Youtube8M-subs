00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.080
 two-color knitting from the columns without 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.130
 nakida 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.550
 I first knitted several rows 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.540
 no crochet do 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.060
 extreme air loop for lifting and 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:36.309
 I knit a few columns without 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:38.940
 nakida then putting the hook in the loop 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.980
 the grounds grab the thread and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.850
 dragging through the loop on the hook 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.170
 I can now change two loops 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:55.420
 thread of a different color for this i take 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:02.320
 thread of a different color grab or 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:07.030
 and extend through two loops thread 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.990
 pink color is applied to the loops 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 grounds like that hook 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.690
 puts on the next loop of the base and 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.150
 pink thread is captured then we 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.880
 pick up the blue thread and 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.880
 we drag through all these loops on 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.820
 hook, we have two loops again seize 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.630
 blue thread and drag through two 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:43.150
 loop further knit bollards without nakida 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:49.030
 in the same way as long as 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:52.840
 no need to replace thread again 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.650
 In this case, we grab the blue thread 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.770
 and dragging on the hook remains 2 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.880
 the loop after this strings changes we 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.490
 knit already thread a different color autumn 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.810
 thread is applied to the eyelets 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:14.670
 grounds and is now picked up 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.709
 as follows, and knit further 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.650
 pink crochet and so 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:30.150
 continue to knit until the end of the row 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:33.890
 and so I knitted 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.099
 this series to the end now we need 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:44.700
 turn around for this we turn 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:48.500
 180 degrees from the thread pink 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.040
 which we do not knit attach to 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.230
 base loop and knit blue 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.730
 thread 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.980
 first lifting loop and then 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:12.120
 continue knitting 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:16.760
 with crochets so i will 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:20.489
 look like a finished sample as it is 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:26.180
 very tight knitting it found 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.760
 use when knitting hats and coats 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.000
