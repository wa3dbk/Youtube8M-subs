00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 So let's connect the experts here and find out more. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.220
 I will link to Professor Kim, Pil Soo of Daelim University, 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.580
 There is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.500
 Give me a branch guest . Hello. Yes. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:22.800
 4 of the US Department of Justice imposes a fine of 1.3 trillion won 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.160
 What an enormous amount of negative indeyo this fine 1.3 trillion won to win geupbaljin 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.869
 I admit it. It's hard to see it like this. 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.640
 Yes yes determined that the two geoum itgido edaga Shelter fix phone 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:39.930
 Any defects in the car with me geuya profit late on electronic representation jangkki be 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.489
 There are a lot of such situations, so I need to make efforts to improve it. 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.649
 With regard to the decision made in terms of which there was considerable neglect, 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.770
 Quick racing can cause 10 car failures 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:57.989
 You can see that there is no conclusion in the hint that it happened. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.340
 2 Churches like jj hooks are intelligently mixed with government offices and public agencies . 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.330
 If you can not explain this enough because it moves a lot , 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.830
 No one who is responsible for this, because quite often more such fines Ae 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.119
 I think 100 places are better 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.890
 Any improvement or service to a car flaw 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.950
 I mean, that's a little short . 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.479
 There was a lot of trouble now as they snorted. 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:29.460
 Even in the case of such a holy Shinto shrine, 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:33.180
 La need to present all of these excuses is that this one is awesome drunk according to the one I 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.590
 Covert and augurating a nose for the recent part 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.610
 Butterfly Notify the consumer not to him, let him know and try to improve 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.470
 Something about that and this part has struck a gold saw so effective now 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:51.030
 Suddenly it's hard to tell clearly what a moving director is. 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.960
 It is recommended that a sudden onset is estimated to occur in one or two cases 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.320
 We are experiencing a lot of one-to-one loosening from next year 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.430
 Neopjuk in many festivals and won itgoyo to generate tens of billions of babies 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.590
 For Japan, the United States also how much lower will ohneura the US, Japan, 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:11.640
 The reason for this is that the gasoline is supplied as a base, and the automatic transmission 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 Because they are almost 100% supplied, they are relatively 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 The plan together four Mercury Transmission and not keep headphones plugged in as another passenger mechanical member 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.440
 I gotta virtual relative led to 8745 cases but station or because 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.760
 In this case, which occurs much more than in Japan we pick a lot of opponents 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.220
 Yes Yes 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:36.390
 So far, my driver is now an allegation. Yes. Yes, yes. 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:41.010
 I am a friend who is about to be involved in a sudden escalation , 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:45.270
 But look to the conclusion that if you do a true story The ruins of seven drivers 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.780
 Because view state baekpeo that true defects or for a driver who 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:53.820
 Now that we have seen the parts continue to come forward , 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.620
 Do some way to this part of the anneunya Can maryeondwae in my belly now 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.580
 As you said, there is still a fake 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.350
 Do you have 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.890
 I am also not part of the rewards part 1 for me in America 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.780
 I have. 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.170
 For such a high car - about the academy than we found it earlier also 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.550
 As I told you, this is a mountain-like opponent. 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.220
 Voyager has some guarantees by long responsibility, but car development 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.200
 If it is good and it is color development, it can be seen that there is nothing to do 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:29.820
 US NASA as well as the United States to participate in the NASA NASA space 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.720
 I tried to give two second grade certificates, but you said you failed. 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.290
 Holding it so difficult for you, I've quite difficult. What is more up to 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:43.050
 Since moving strokes per doeseo a combination of more than 30,000 calls Yes 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:46.290
 In fact , even if this eper is created, 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.530
 It is quite difficult to do and there is no evidence left . 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.900
 Well, actually, there is a lot of research on this part 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.920
 Not yet part of the conclusions from calm 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:01.440
 Hey kids or potential 4 1 No recent book automatically fruit drinks and touched greenery 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:07.710
 As it will be going up because a lot of these techniques to analyze within a few years cars 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.660
 Become device development related yiradeunji geupbaljin Senator ahhae did the thing 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.070
 Yes, you can see fairly high 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:19.109
 Do you think this will also have an effect on domestic flights due to the agreement 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:22.200
 What is the reason why the fishing port party is now in the channel , 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.010
 Many of the creators move a lot from their mouths to their holders' structures 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.470
 There is 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:32.550
 Oh, this time from the Villa is also true that the decision itself, the two consumer reporting agencies 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.900
 I'll guarantee that this agreement came because moving around is another such fines 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:41.190
 Sangho as domestic Dad in these proceedings because there are going from group 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.430
 More about the AK Bracelet The movement of the government itself is mainly in the consumer 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.570
 There are not many cases that can be moved . 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:53.130
 For officers seemed sure that is me that it can now be identified in the near future 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.990
 I've said, there is a possibility that the professor had strengthened the black box camera 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.599
 If you talk a lot . 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.979
 I guess it could be the way it is . 4 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:06.060
 The part about the last year was announced, but this year's showdown here 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.669
 For my thoughts are frb the mwonyamyeon is heard examples of that 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:14.250
 I need a lot of action. 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:18.659
 Now that this is the saddle key itself is being raised now 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.800
 Indeyo car accident recording device, seventieth party discipline, even in a small cloisonnÃ© 2 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:27.300
 These will be replaced with those that push to the next relative lack thus more 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:31.349
 This device can be sure to know which defect will be defective 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.030
 It is not a difficult part to develop a device. 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.300
 Is not it time to go all the time 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:40.199
 Also , if there is a sudden onset of a sudden onset , 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.789
 Yiradeunji'll see, it is very important to draw this whole picture ah 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:49.190
 I understand. Mr. Kim, Fellow of Daelim University 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:49.190
 Thank you very much.
