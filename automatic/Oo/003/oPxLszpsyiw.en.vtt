00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
this is the AICP for this is the port

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.070 
this is the AICP for this is the port
for<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.400> city<00:04:24.730> now<00:04:25.210> now<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.630> will<00:04:25.720> remove<00:04:25.960> this

what's<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:42.640> core<00:04:42.820> if<00:04:43.000> it<00:04:43.150> is<00:04:43.270> one<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.630> most

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
what's the core if it is one of the most

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.110 
what's the core if it is one of the most
delicate<00:04:44.080> part<00:04:44.200> of<00:04:44.470> this<00:04:44.620> SVD<00:04:44.980> of<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.790> system

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
delicate part of this SVD of the system

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.750 
delicate part of this SVD of the system
and<00:04:46.420> also<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.290> most<00:04:47.440> cost<00:04:47.650> is<00:04:47.800> passed<00:04:47.980> this

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
and also the most cost is passed this

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.220 
and also the most cost is passed this
cost<00:04:49.030> around<00:04:49.180> 6000<00:04:49.570> rupees

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
cost around 6000 rupees

00:04:50.230 --> 00:05:27.309 
cost around 6000 rupees
so<00:04:51.070> I'm<00:04:51.190> not<00:04:51.340> opening<00:04:51.640> up<00:04:51.700> this

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.119 

time<00:05:28.319> slowly<00:05:28.680> opening<00:05:28.979> this<00:05:29.159> century<00:05:29.550> I

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
time slowly opening this century I

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.249 
time slowly opening this century I
remember<00:05:32.129> all<00:05:32.189> the<00:05:32.309> four<00:05:32.490> schools<00:05:32.839> now<00:05:33.839> now

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
remember all the four schools now now

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.899

now<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:34.860> am<00:05:35.069> opening<00:05:35.309> this<00:05:35.460> actually<00:05:35.960> slowly

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
now I am opening this actually slowly

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.459 
now I am opening this actually slowly
you<00:05:38.909> have<00:05:38.939> to<00:05:39.120> keep<00:05:39.240> one<00:05:39.419> thing<00:05:39.449> in<00:05:39.569> mind<00:05:39.659> there

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
you have to keep one thing in mind there

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:41.929 
you have to keep one thing in mind there
is<00:05:40.499> also<00:05:40.680> vacuum<00:05:41.129> driver<00:05:41.339> installed<00:05:41.699> in<00:05:41.759> this

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
is also vacuum driver installed in this

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.850 
is also vacuum driver installed in this
so<00:05:42.509> you<00:05:42.569> need<00:05:42.719> to<00:05:42.900> take<00:05:43.080> proper<00:05:43.409> care<00:05:43.439> and

so you need to take proper care and
remove<00:05:44.520> this<00:05:44.759> spaceport<00:05:45.409> now<00:05:46.409> if<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.770> can

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
remove this spaceport now if you can

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.679 
remove this spaceport now if you can
easily<00:05:47.009> remove<00:05:47.339> the<00:05:47.520> CD<00:05:47.759> and<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:48.449> can

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:48.689 
easily remove the CD and you can

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:58.470 
easily remove the CD and you can
separate<00:05:48.930> out<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.110> CD

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.780 

this<00:05:59.480> is<00:05:59.600> the<00:05:59.690> internal<00:05:59.960> part<00:06:00.200> and<00:06:00.610> this<00:06:01.610> shows

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
this is the internal part and this shows

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.940 
this is the internal part and this shows
the<00:06:01.940> pan<00:06:02.120> and<00:06:02.390> below<00:06:03.350> this<00:06:03.500> pan<00:06:03.680> there<00:06:03.830> is<00:06:03.920> a

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
the pan and below this pan there is a

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.180 
the pan and below this pan there is a
processor<00:06:05.200> but<00:06:06.200> we<00:06:06.380> need<00:06:06.500> to<00:06:06.590> focus<00:06:06.740> on<00:06:07.010> this

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
processor but we need to focus on this

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.460 
processor but we need to focus on this
one<00:06:07.370> since<00:06:07.760> distance<00:06:08.210> not<00:06:08.390> only<00:06:08.630> and<00:06:08.870> we<00:06:09.320> can

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
one since distance not only and we can

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.130 
one since distance not only and we can
install<00:06:09.560> this<00:06:09.920> we<00:06:10.730> can<00:06:10.880> install<00:06:11.090> any<00:06:11.300> sim<00:06:11.630> sim

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
install this we can install any sim sim

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.400 
install this we can install any sim sim
receiver<00:06:12.500> in<00:06:12.620> this<00:06:12.760> so<00:06:13.760> that<00:06:13.910> we<00:06:13.970> could<00:06:14.090> use<00:06:14.210> it

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
receiver in this so that we could use it

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:26.920 
receiver in this so that we could use it
nicely<00:06:15.410> I<00:06:25.150> have<00:06:26.150> already<00:06:26.300> shown<00:06:26.450> you<00:06:26.630> on<00:06:26.810> the

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
nicely I have already shown you on the

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.780 
nicely I have already shown you on the
poor<00:06:27.080> on<00:06:27.230> the<00:06:27.320> poor<00:06:27.470> parts<00:06:27.770> now<00:06:28.100> now<00:06:28.550> I<00:06:28.580> am

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
poor on the poor parts now now I am

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.880 
poor on the poor parts now now I am
going<00:06:28.910> to<00:06:29.030> pack<00:06:29.150> up<00:06:29.180> this<00:06:29.450> laptop<00:06:29.750> again<00:06:30.650> so

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
going to pack up this laptop again so

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.040 
going to pack up this laptop again so
that<00:06:31.040> I<00:06:31.250> could<00:06:32.060> make<00:06:32.180> use<00:06:32.360> of<00:06:32.570> this<00:06:32.750> let's

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
that I could make use of this let's

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.620 
that I could make use of this let's
import<00:06:33.380> I<00:06:36.760> follow<00:06:37.760> the<00:06:37.880> same<00:06:37.910> steps<00:06:38.330> which<00:06:38.510> I

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
import I follow the same steps which I

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.500 
import I follow the same steps which I
followed<00:06:38.960> I<00:06:39.770> will<00:06:40.370> first<00:06:40.580> of<00:06:40.730> all<00:06:40.880> this<00:06:41.180> is

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
followed I will first of all this is

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.720 
followed I will first of all this is
actually<00:06:42.290> then<00:06:43.010> I<00:06:43.100> will<00:06:43.250> follow<00:06:43.370> up<00:06:43.520> this

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
actually then I will follow up this

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.390 
actually then I will follow up this
keypad<00:06:44.390> that<00:06:44.930> is<00:06:45.110> basil<00:06:45.320> and<00:06:45.710> is<00:06:46.130> the<00:06:46.250> hitch

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
keypad that is basil and is the hitch

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.260 
keypad that is basil and is the hitch
cover<00:06:46.640> and<00:06:46.910> then<00:06:47.810> cover
