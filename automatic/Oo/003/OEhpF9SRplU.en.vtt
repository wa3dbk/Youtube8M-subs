great where I'll finish this up here
we're<00:00:13.559> gonna<00:00:13.740> crank

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
we're gonna crank

fast<00:00:15.200> on<00:00:16.129> this<00:00:16.279> this<00:00:17.029> image<00:00:17.360> orange<00:00:17.660> is<00:00:17.779> pretty

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
fast on this this image orange is pretty

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.929 
fast on this this image orange is pretty
easy<00:00:18.650> pretty<00:00:18.980> straightforward<00:00:19.730> it's

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
easy pretty straightforward it's

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.499 
easy pretty straightforward it's
generally<00:00:20.330> not<00:00:20.509> that<00:00:20.570> straightforward

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
generally not that straightforward

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.029 
generally not that straightforward
generally<00:00:23.509> orange<00:00:23.840> is<00:00:23.960> a<00:00:23.990> mixture<00:00:24.380> of<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.009> two

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
generally orange is a mixture of the two

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.240 
generally orange is a mixture of the two
primaries<00:00:25.820> you<00:00:25.970> know<00:00:26.529> red<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:27.650> yellow<00:00:27.770> same

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
primaries you know red and yellow same

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.380 
primaries you know red and yellow same
with<00:00:28.430> orange<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.240> same<00:00:29.680> problem<00:00:30.680> as<00:00:30.860> green

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
with orange is the same problem as green

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.030 
with orange is the same problem as green
purple<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:32.809> know<00:00:32.930> just<00:00:33.260> mixing<00:00:33.830> the<00:00:33.890> two

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
purple you know just mixing the two

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.640 
purple you know just mixing the two
primaries<00:00:34.580> when<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:34.820> want<00:00:34.970> to<00:00:35.030> get<00:00:35.120> the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
primaries when you want to get the

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.320 
primaries when you want to get the
secondary<00:00:36.650> colors<00:00:37.010> uh<00:00:37.040> tends<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.850> be<00:00:37.970> a<00:00:38.000> little

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
secondary colors uh tends to be a little

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.920 
secondary colors uh tends to be a little
tougher<00:00:38.839> but<00:00:39.800> uh<00:00:39.860> it's<00:00:40.370> really<00:00:40.580> not<00:00:40.699> if<00:00:41.300> if<00:00:41.750> you

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
tougher but uh it's really not if if you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.780 
tougher but uh it's really not if if you
got<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.110> good<00:00:42.290> eye<00:00:42.440> for<00:00:42.470> it<00:00:42.739> they'll<00:00:43.430> take<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.610> lot

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
got a good eye for it they'll take a lot

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.850 
got a good eye for it they'll take a lot
of<00:00:43.820> practice<00:00:44.030> of<00:00:44.390> course<00:00:44.600> but<00:00:44.960> I'll<00:00:45.620> cover

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
of practice of course but I'll cover

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.859 
of practice of course but I'll cover
some<00:00:46.220> some<00:00:46.550> other<00:00:46.579> ways<00:00:46.940> how<00:00:47.150> to<00:00:47.180> go<00:00:47.420> about<00:00:47.510> it

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:47.869 
some some other ways how to go about it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:49.750 
some some other ways how to go about it
and<00:00:48.159> we'll<00:00:49.159> just<00:00:49.190> cover<00:00:49.489> this

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
and we'll just cover this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.210 
and we'll just cover this
straightforward<00:00:50.420> 101<00:00:51.320> orange<00:00:51.680> method<00:00:52.100> on

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
straightforward 101 orange method on

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.609 
straightforward 101 orange method on
this<00:00:52.369> image<00:00:52.729> at<00:00:53.570> least<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:53.869> can<00:00:54.019> add<00:00:54.409> it<00:00:54.589> to

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
this image at least you can add it to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.280 
this image at least you can add it to
your<00:00:54.739> arsenal<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.190> start<00:00:55.489> practicing<00:00:56.290> so

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
your arsenal and start practicing so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.710 
your arsenal and start practicing so
basically<00:00:57.830> uh<00:00:57.860> we're<00:00:58.820> gonna<00:00:58.970> do<00:00:59.210> is<00:00:59.360> we<00:00:59.449> got<00:00:59.600> to

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
basically uh we're gonna do is we got to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.619 
basically uh we're gonna do is we got to
get<00:00:59.839> the<00:01:00.830> yellow<00:01:01.159> and<00:01:01.549> the<00:01:01.790> red<00:01:01.820> we<00:01:02.180> need<00:01:02.360> this

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
get the yellow and the red we need this

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.570 
get the yellow and the red we need this
this<00:01:03.110> white<00:01:03.379> filled<00:01:03.710> with<00:01:03.890> orange<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.430> what

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
this white filled with orange and what

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.310 
this white filled with orange and what
you<00:01:04.670> want<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:04.970> kind<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.540> overlay<00:01:05.869> it<00:01:05.990> into<00:01:06.229> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
you want to kind of overlay it into the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.859 
you want to kind of overlay it into the
yellow<00:01:06.560> here<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.100> kind<00:01:07.970> into<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.360> red<00:01:08.570> here

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
yellow here and kind into the red here

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.260 
yellow here and kind into the red here
you<00:01:09.650> can<00:01:09.799> see<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:10.130> image<00:01:10.430> it's<00:01:10.670> it's<00:01:11.060> right

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
you can see in the image it's it's right

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.179 
you can see in the image it's it's right
there<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.350> easy<00:01:12.470> method<00:01:12.790> this<00:01:13.790> way<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.950> to

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
there the easy method this way is to

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.010 
there the easy method this way is to
flatten<00:01:16.369> your<00:01:16.580> image<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.570> we're<00:01:17.750> gonna<00:01:17.840> do<00:01:17.990> a

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
flatten your image and we're gonna do a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.470 
flatten your image and we're gonna do a
gradient<00:01:18.259> map<00:01:18.650> we<00:01:19.430> did<00:01:19.580> color<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.000> originally

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
gradient map we did color it originally

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.010 
gradient map we did color it originally
with<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:20.750> gradient<00:01:21.170> map<00:01:21.730> but<00:01:22.930> that's<00:01:23.930> a

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
with this gradient map but that's a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.590 
with this gradient map but that's a
different<00:01:24.200> episode<00:01:24.680> here<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.820> we're<00:01:26.510> gonna

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
different episode here so we're gonna

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600 
different episode here so we're gonna
flatten<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.410> we're<00:01:27.620> gonna<00:01:27.710> make<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.980> new

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
flatten it and we're gonna make a new

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.149 
flatten it and we're gonna make a new
gradient<00:01:28.850> map<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:29.570> basically<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.710> orange<00:01:31.010> is

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
gradient map and basically the orange is

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.100 
gradient map and basically the orange is
in<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.340> middle<00:01:31.580> hue<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:32.930> whole

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
in the middle hue of this this whole

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.330 
in the middle hue of this this whole
image<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.159> it'll<00:01:34.340> be<00:01:34.460> really<00:01:34.880> easy<00:01:36.340> gradient

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
image so it'll be really easy gradient

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.020 
image so it'll be really easy gradient
map<00:01:38.020> basically<00:01:39.020> all<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.200> does<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.530> uh<00:01:39.909> give<00:01:40.909> you

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
map basically all it does is uh give you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.520 
map basically all it does is uh give you
a<00:01:41.090> gradient<00:01:41.360> for<00:01:41.720> your<00:01:41.810> darks<00:01:42.140> through<00:01:42.380> your

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
a gradient for your darks through your

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.190 
a gradient for your darks through your
lights<00:01:44.560> we're<00:01:45.560> gonna<00:01:45.680> make<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.550> black<00:01:47.450> that'll

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
lights we're gonna make a black that'll

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.530 
lights we're gonna make a black that'll
be<00:01:48.290> our<00:01:48.409> darkest<00:01:48.940> which<00:01:49.940> would<00:01:50.120> actually<00:01:50.330> be

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
be our darkest which would actually be

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.620 
be our darkest which would actually be
all<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.530> way<00:01:51.620> back<00:01:51.800> here<00:01:52.190> but<00:01:52.909> then<00:01:53.060> with<00:01:53.510> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
all the way back here but then with the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.390 
all the way back here but then with the
image<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.140> will<00:01:54.350> be<00:01:54.440> maybe<00:01:54.770> where<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.190> gray

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
image this will be maybe where the gray

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.450 
image this will be maybe where the gray
would<00:01:55.640> be<00:01:56.830> although<00:01:57.830> we<00:01:57.950> don't<00:01:58.070> really<00:01:58.220> need

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
would be although we don't really need

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.160 
would be although we don't really need
that<00:01:58.520> right<00:01:58.820> now<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:59.180> is<00:01:59.330> where<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.720> dark

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
that right now this is where the dark

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.680 
that right now this is where the dark
reds<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.650> reds<00:02:00.890> would<00:02:01.070> be<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.880> then<00:02:02.360> this<00:02:02.540> is

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
reds and reds would be and then this is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.270 
reds and reds would be and then this is
the<00:02:02.810> opposite<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.290> would<00:02:03.470> be<00:02:03.590> where<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.860> the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
the opposite this would be where the the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.130 
the opposite this would be where the the
high<00:02:04.400> light<00:02:04.610> whites<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.659> yellows<00:02:05.990> would

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
high light whites and the yellows would

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.949 
high light whites and the yellows would
be<00:02:06.320> leaving<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.400> orange<00:02:08.000> right<00:02:08.360> here<00:02:08.390> in<00:02:08.840> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
be leaving the orange right here in the

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.470 
be leaving the orange right here in the
middle<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:10.280> that's<00:02:10.640> really<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.060> only<00:02:11.180> one<00:02:11.330> we

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
middle and that's really the only one we

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.320 
middle and that's really the only one we
care<00:02:11.690> about<00:02:11.780> right<00:02:12.080> now<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.849> little<00:02:14.090> hard

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
care about right now it's a little hard

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.059 
care about right now it's a little hard
to<00:02:14.390> wrap<00:02:14.690> your<00:02:14.720> mind<00:02:15.049> around<00:02:15.170> if<00:02:15.530> if<00:02:15.830> you're

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
to wrap your mind around if if you're

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.309 
to wrap your mind around if if you're
used<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.700> thinking<00:02:17.090> one<00:02:17.299> way<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.720> looking<00:02:18.230> at

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
used to thinking one way and looking at

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.800 
used to thinking one way and looking at
it<00:02:18.409> visually<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.069> pretty<00:02:19.909> mathematical

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
it visually this is pretty mathematical

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.250 
it visually this is pretty mathematical
I<00:02:20.900> guess<00:02:21.170> it's<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:22.689> takes<00:02:23.689> a<00:02:23.810> little<00:02:23.930> bit<00:02:24.139> of

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
I guess it's a takes a little bit of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.340 
I guess it's a takes a little bit of
training

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
training

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.590 
training
but<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.490> can<00:02:26.610> always<00:02:26.730> turn<00:02:26.940> these<00:02:27.120> two<00:02:27.300> colors

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
but you can always turn these two colors

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.450 
but you can always turn these two colors
if<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.110> need<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.380> cheat<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.830> while<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.370> if

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
if you need to cheat for a while so if

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.450 
if you need to cheat for a while so if
you<00:02:29.550> wanted<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.850> go<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.720> white<00:02:31.460> bread

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
you wanted to go you know white bread

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.460 
you wanted to go you know white bread
you<00:02:33.180> know<00:02:33.300> even<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.840> wanted<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> add<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
you know even if you wanted to add the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.740 
you know even if you wanted to add the
black<00:02:34.680> that's<00:02:35.010> fine<00:02:35.280> too<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.600> begin

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
black that's fine too and you can begin

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.260 
black that's fine too and you can begin
to<00:02:36.870> see<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.370> where<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.610> different<00:02:38.970> colors

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
to see like where the different colors

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.780 
to see like where the different colors
would<00:02:39.540> would<00:02:40.050> lay<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.470> image<00:02:40.800> I'm<00:02:41.550> just

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
would would lay on the image I'm just

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.570 
would would lay on the image I'm just
gonna<00:02:41.940> show<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.420> basic<00:02:43.190> basic<00:02:44.190> method

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
gonna show you the basic basic method

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.510 
gonna show you the basic basic method
here<00:02:45.200> just<00:02:46.200> for<00:02:46.470> speed<00:02:46.740> purposes<00:02:47.280> but

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
here just for speed purposes but

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.280 
here just for speed purposes but
definitely<00:02:48.330> play<00:02:48.480> around<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.020> and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
definitely play around with this and

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.740 
definitely play around with this and
you'll<00:02:50.190> really<00:02:50.430> begin<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.240> understand<00:02:51.690> how

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
you'll really begin to understand how

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.400 
you'll really begin to understand how
the<00:02:51.870> other<00:02:52.320> colors<00:02:52.710> are<00:02:52.860> playing<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.280> here

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
the other colors are playing in here

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.510 
the other colors are playing in here
basically<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.760> gray<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:58.220> right<00:02:59.220> where<00:02:59.400> we

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
basically this gray is a right where we

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.320 
basically this gray is a right where we
want<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:01.970> I'll<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.150> shut

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
want this to be and so I'll just shut

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.560 
want this to be and so I'll just shut
these<00:03:03.450> back<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.930> black<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:06.060> our<00:03:06.180> gray<00:03:06.420> is

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
these back to black and our gray is

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.930 
these back to black and our gray is
gonna<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.960> our<00:03:07.260> orange<00:03:07.620> ink<00:03:07.770> which<00:03:08.550> I'll<00:03:08.760> put

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
gonna be our orange ink which I'll put

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.320 
gonna be our orange ink which I'll put
white<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.680> I'm<00:03:10.830> just<00:03:10.950> gonna<00:03:11.100> kind<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.060> tweak

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
white and I'm just gonna kind of tweak

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.720 
white and I'm just gonna kind of tweak
this<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> bit<00:03:12.810> till<00:03:12.960> I<00:03:13.020> get<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.400> where<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.430> feel

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
this a bit till I get it where I feel

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.089 
this a bit till I get it where I feel
comfortable

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.899 

it's<00:03:20.519> all<00:03:20.670> pretty<00:03:20.969> much<00:03:21.180> visual<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.730> guess

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
it's all pretty much visual and I guess

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.599 
it's all pretty much visual and I guess
that's<00:03:24.060> where<00:03:24.799> knowing<00:03:25.799> about<00:03:25.920> colors<00:03:26.400> really

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
that's where knowing about colors really

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.380 
that's where knowing about colors really
comes<00:03:26.909> into<00:03:27.090> play<00:03:29.239> good<00:03:30.239> enough<00:03:30.709> okay<00:03:32.390> gonna

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
comes into play good enough okay gonna

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.770 
comes into play good enough okay gonna
flatten<00:03:33.659> it<00:03:33.870> down<00:03:34.040> Kamandi<00:03:35.040> control<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.780> go

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
flatten it down Kamandi control you go

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.199 
flatten it down Kamandi control you go
to<00:03:36.840> your<00:03:37.340> grayscale<00:03:39.709> invert<00:03:40.709> it

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
want to preview with your under base

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.509 
want to preview with your under base
white<00:03:58.470> because<00:03:58.680> it'll<00:03:58.919> look<00:03:58.950> weird<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
white because it'll look weird on the

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.800 
white because it'll look weird on the
screen<00:03:59.849> but<00:04:01.579> change<00:04:02.579> your<00:04:02.700> alpha<00:04:03.000> 2<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.480> it<00:04:03.629> and

screen but change your alpha 2 to it and
a<00:04:04.349> bright<00:04:04.889> orange<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.400> think<00:04:05.430> Ringo<00:04:05.909> may<00:04:06.180> be<00:04:06.239> 165

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.730 

okay

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
okay

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.770 
okay
let's<00:04:14.280> go<00:04:14.430> back<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.820> revert<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:15.510> we<00:04:15.630> can

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
let's go back and revert this so we can

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.340 
let's go back and revert this so we can
do<00:04:16.110> a<00:04:16.140> quick<00:04:16.410> comparison<00:04:18.170> that's<00:04:19.170> our

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
do a quick comparison that's our

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.260 
do a quick comparison that's our
original<00:04:19.670> this<00:04:20.670> is<00:04:20.850> our<00:04:20.970> finished<00:04:21.180> set<00:04:23.270> colors

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
original this is our finished set colors

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.740 
original this is our finished set colors
look<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.540> little<00:04:24.900> brighter<00:04:26.330> so<00:04:27.330> once<00:04:27.540> you're<00:04:27.660> in
