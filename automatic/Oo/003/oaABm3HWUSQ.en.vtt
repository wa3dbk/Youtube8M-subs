00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.980 
serves to get the adrenaline going and I
think<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.860> adds<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.250> spectacle<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.990> and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
think it adds to the spectacle and and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.150 
think it adds to the spectacle and and
you<00:02:25.140> see<00:02:25.290> better<00:02:25.440> football

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.650 

I<00:02:30.220> think<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.610> hits<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.850> when<00:02:31.000> you<00:02:31.180> when<00:02:31.570> you

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
I think it hits you when you when you

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.930 
I think it hits you when you when you
come<00:02:31.840> out<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.110> tunnel<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.910> just

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
come out of the tunnel and and you just

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.610 
come out of the tunnel and and you just
get<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:34.300> cook<00:02:34.600> off<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.960> they<00:02:35.020> have<00:02:35.140> sounds

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
get that cook off and they have sounds

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.980 
get that cook off and they have sounds
really<00:02:35.890> all<00:02:36.100> our<00:02:36.310> statistics<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.180> GPS<00:02:37.660> and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
really all our statistics on GPS and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.780 
really all our statistics on GPS and
everything<00:02:38.230> else<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.560> all<00:02:38.710> up<00:02:38.860> at<00:02:39.010> those<00:02:39.160> big

everything else is all up at those big

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.880 
everything else is all up at those big
tournaments<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:40.570> because<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.230> think<00:02:41.500> you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
tournaments just because I think you

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.350

know<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.010> adrenaline<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.790> just<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.120> little

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
know that adrenaline is just a little

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.000 
know that adrenaline is just a little
bit<00:02:43.480> more<00:02:43.600> heightened<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.380> when<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.770> get<00:02:44.860> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
bit more heightened and when you get the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.650 
bit more heightened and when you get the
ball<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.370> space<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.910> suddenly<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.420> crowd
