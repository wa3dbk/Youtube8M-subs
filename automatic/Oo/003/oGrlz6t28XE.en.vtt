in<00:00:43.710> order<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> create<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.460> loudspeaker<00:00:45.120> I've

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
in order to create my loudspeaker I've

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
in order to create my loudspeaker I've
taken<00:00:45.690> my<00:00:45.960> neodymium<00:00:46.620> magnet<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.190> mounted<00:00:47.520> it

taken my neodymium magnet and mounted it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.790 
taken my neodymium magnet and mounted it
on<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> center<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.329> metal<00:00:48.690> plate<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
on the center of this metal plate if I

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.650 
on the center of this metal plate if I
put<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.129> plate<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.970> magnet<00:00:51.300> underneath

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
put the plate and the magnet underneath

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
put the plate and the magnet underneath
the<00:00:51.809> wire<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.410> turn<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:52.770> current<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.190> you'll

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the wire and turn the current on you'll

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.119 
the wire and turn the current on you'll
see<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> same<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:54.570> happens<00:00:55.170> once<00:00:55.770> again<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
see the same thing happens once again a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
see the same thing happens once again a
force<00:00:56.550> pushes<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> wire<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.629> case

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
force pushes the wire in this case

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.400 
force pushes the wire in this case
downwards<00:00:59.629> now<00:01:00.629> I'm<00:01:00.720> going<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:00.900> take<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.230> wire

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
downwards now I'm going to take the wire

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.870 
downwards now I'm going to take the wire
and<00:01:02.390> make<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> coil<00:01:03.780> around<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.610> end<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and make a coil around the end of the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.899 
and make a coil around the end of the
bottle<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.720> may<00:01:06.960> take<00:01:10.670> both<00:01:11.670> Lock

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
bottle like so this may take both Lock

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.990 
bottle like so this may take both Lock
turns<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.420> more<00:01:12.600> turns<00:01:13.550> we've<00:01:14.550> made<00:01:14.759> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
turns the more turns we've made the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.090 
turns the more turns we've made the
better<00:01:15.860> going<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.810> end<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
better going all the way the end of the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.620 
better going all the way the end of the
bottle<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.789> hold<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.210> place<00:01:21.360> I'm

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bottle like so to hold it in place I'm

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.650 
bottle like so to hold it in place I'm
just<00:01:21.660> going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.039> wrap<00:01:23.039> two<00:01:23.490> ends<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.630> wire

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
just going to wrap two ends of the wire

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.080 
just going to wrap two ends of the wire
together<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:26.759> I'm<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
together like so and then I'm going to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.260 
together like so and then I'm going to
leave<00:01:27.390> those<00:01:27.630> three<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.679> now<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.880> wire<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
leave those three so now my wire is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
leave those three so now my wire is
coiled<00:01:30.660> around<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.990> edge<00:01:31.080> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.649> bottle

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
coiled around the edge of the bottle

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
coiled around the edge of the bottle
like<00:01:32.039> so<00:01:37.250> if<00:01:38.250> an<00:01:38.429> outtake<00:01:38.580> bottle<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.570> place

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
like so if an outtake bottle and place

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.960 
like so if an outtake bottle and place
it<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.350> top<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.770> mine<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.670> didn't<00:01:41.910> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it on top of mine and there didn't a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
it on top of mine and there didn't a
magnet<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.990> connect<00:01:43.679> it<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:43.979> my

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
magnet like so and connect it to my

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
magnet like so and connect it to my
power<00:01:44.429> supply<00:01:45.530> when<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.679> flip<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.460> switch<00:01:47.810> once

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
power supply when I flip my switch once

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.840 
power supply when I flip my switch once
again<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.140> force<00:01:49.470> should<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.100> exerted<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
again it force should be exerted on the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.749 
again it force should be exerted on the
way<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.810> time<00:01:52.189> because<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.430> bottle

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
way and this time because the bottle

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.840 
way and this time because the bottle
actually<00:01:54.000> floats<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.439> bit<00:01:55.790> above<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
actually floats just a bit above the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.560 
actually floats just a bit above the
magnets<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.680> rather<00:02:02.490> than<00:02:02.729> using<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.240> direct

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
magnets so rather than using a direct

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.950 
magnets so rather than using a direct
current<00:02:03.689> what<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.590> replace<00:02:05.960> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
current what I can do now is replace the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.860 
current what I can do now is replace the
DC<00:02:07.380> power<00:02:08.160> supply<00:02:09.500> with<00:02:10.500> an<00:02:10.590> alternating

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
DC power supply with an alternating

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.050 
DC power supply with an alternating
signal<00:02:12.870> generator<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:14.579> I<00:02:14.730> switch

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
signal generator like this if I switch

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.880 
signal generator like this if I switch
this<00:02:15.269> one<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.840> time<00:02:16.140> when<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> cranked

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
this one on this time when I cranked

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.530 
this one on this time when I cranked
voltage<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.400> what<00:02:17.579> should<00:02:17.790> happen<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.180> can

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
voltage it what should happen you can

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.930 
voltage it what should happen you can
barely<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.160> bottle<00:02:20.519> is

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
barely see this but the bottle is

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.330 
barely see this but the bottle is
starting<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.630> lift<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.650> lower<00:02:22.920> down<00:02:23.040> you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
starting to lift up and lower down you

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340

can<00:02:23.489> see<00:02:23.640> how<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:23.910> become<00:02:24.000> bit<00:02:24.350> unsettled

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
can see how it's become bit unsettled

can see how it's become bit unsettled
I've<00:02:25.860> got<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> frequency<00:02:26.549> quite<00:02:27.000> low<00:02:27.180> at<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
I've got the frequency quite low at the

something<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.799> my<00:02:31.950> factories

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
something like that my factories

you<00:02:36.800> can<00:02:36.980> hear<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.340> glazing<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:38.480> down

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
you can hear the glazing up and down

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.050 
you can hear the glazing up and down
about<00:02:38.870> five<00:02:39.230> times<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.650> second<00:02:40.040> now<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.640> what

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
about five times a second now and what

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.160 
about five times a second now and what
you're<00:02:41.210> actually<00:02:41.300> hearing<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.900> bottle

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
you're actually hearing is the bottle

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.830 
you're actually hearing is the bottle
banging<00:02:42.620> against<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:42.980> base<00:02:43.840> increased

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
banging against the base increased

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.100 
banging against the base increased
previously<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.590> about<00:02:45.800> 50<00:02:46.220> Hertz<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.720> bottle

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
previously to about 50 Hertz the bottle

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.400 
previously to about 50 Hertz the bottle
now<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.430> vibrating<00:02:50.180> up<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.420> down<00:02:50.510> 50<00:02:51.020> times<00:02:51.290> a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
now is vibrating up and down 50 times a

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.200 
now is vibrating up and down 50 times a
second<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:51.980> as<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.130> does<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:52.610> it's<00:02:52.730> creating

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
second and as it does so it's creating

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.450 
second and as it does so it's creating
these<00:02:53.360> sound<00:02:53.720> waves<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.740> can<00:02:54.920> hear

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
these sound waves that you can hear

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.690 
these sound waves that you can hear
let's<00:02:56.270> try<00:02:56.630> increasing<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.260> bit<00:02:57.440> more<00:02:57.710> but

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
let's try increasing it a bit more but

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.750 
let's try increasing it a bit more but
500<00:02:59.600> Hertz<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.710> that<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.130> very<00:03:01.460> recognizable

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
500 Hertz and that is very recognizable

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.820 
500 Hertz and that is very recognizable
as<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.510> nodes<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.020> thereby<00:03:03.350> varying<00:03:03.740> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
as a nodes and thereby varying the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.650 
as a nodes and thereby varying the
frequency<00:03:06.760> we<00:03:07.760> can<00:03:07.790> actually<00:03:08.240> alter<00:03:08.390> the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
frequency we can actually alter the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.620 
frequency we can actually alter the
nodes<00:03:08.900> we've<00:03:09.590> created<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.209> can<00:03:11.390> tell

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
nodes we've created and you can tell

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.900 
nodes we've created and you can tell
that<00:03:11.900> what<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.290> played<00:03:12.620> there<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.610> loud

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
that what I played there is a loud

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.850 
that what I played there is a loud
speaker<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:17.240> final<00:03:17.600> thing<00:03:17.780> we<00:03:17.930> need<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.110> do<00:03:18.320> is

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
speaker the final thing we need to do is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.260 
speaker the final thing we need to do is
take<00:03:19.250> an<00:03:20.030> ipod<00:03:20.590> plug<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.830> in<00:03:22.040> connect<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.150> to

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
take an ipod plug it in connect it to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.710 
take an ipod plug it in connect it to
the<00:03:23.360> amp<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.020> then<00:03:24.920> we<00:03:25.730> can<00:03:25.910> use<00:03:26.209> our

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
the amp and then we can use our

00:03:26.720 --> 00:04:17.629 
the amp and then we can use our
loudspeaker<00:03:27.500> as<00:03:28.220> God<00:03:28.910> intended

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639
