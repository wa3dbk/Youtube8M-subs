00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
liked about it so it does attached to

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.950 
liked about it so it does attached to
the<00:00:53.920> back<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.370> your<00:00:54.609> device<00:00:54.969> so<00:00:55.660> as<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.870> can

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
the back of your device so as you can

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.860 
the back of your device so as you can
see<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:57.370> not<00:00:57.519> like<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.760> sticking<00:00:58.329> around<00:00:58.449> or

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
see it's not like a sticking around or

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.540 
see it's not like a sticking around or
anything<00:00:58.960> just<00:00:59.410> sticks<00:00:59.769> straight<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.460> the

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
anything just sticks straight to the

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.669 
anything just sticks straight to the
back<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:02.140> it's<00:01:02.230> minimal<00:01:02.589> design

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
back of it so it's minimal design

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.009 
back of it so it's minimal design
doesn't<00:01:03.339> obstruct<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.969> form<00:01:04.300> factor<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:04.930> you're

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
doesn't obstruct a form factor so you're

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.050 
doesn't obstruct a form factor so you're
going<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.230> actually<00:01:05.320> put<00:01:05.620> other<00:01:05.860> cases<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
going to actually put other cases on the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.910 
going to actually put other cases on the
back<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.300> this<00:01:07.510> if<00:01:07.690> you<00:01:07.780> wanted<00:01:08.140> I<00:01:08.260> tried<00:01:08.770> it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
going around the sides it's pretty cool

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.210 
going around the sides it's pretty cool
if<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:28.990> haven't<00:01:29.409> seen<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.590> before<00:01:29.979> they<00:01:30.159> do
