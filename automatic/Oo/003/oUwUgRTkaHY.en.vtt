it specifically with the button so here
I<00:00:24.119> am<00:00:24.210> at<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> demo<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:25.170> how<00:00:25.320> when<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.529> hover

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
I am at the demo see how when I hover

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
I am at the demo see how when I hover
over<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.099> instead<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.720> flashing<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
over it instead of it just flashing to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.290 
over it instead of it just flashing to
the<00:00:27.900> new<00:00:28.019> color<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.439> actually<00:00:28.769> kind<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
the new color it actually kind of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.240 
the new color it actually kind of
animates<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> color<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.590> fades<00:00:31.949> into

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
animates to that color like fades into

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.630 
animates to that color like fades into
that<00:00:32.520> lighter<00:00:33.110> blue<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.190> case<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.370> not

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that lighter blue just in case it's not

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.900 
that lighter blue just in case it's not
obvious<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.020> video<00:00:37.610> let<00:00:38.610> me<00:00:38.700> make<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
obvious on this video let me make it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.030 
obvious on this video let me make it
white<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.870> should<00:00:40.020> help<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.410> bit<00:00:43.040> so

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
white that should help a little bit so

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.260 
white that should help a little bit so
there<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.700> how<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.940> like<00:00:45.030> kind<00:00:45.239> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
there you go see how it's like kind of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.319 
there you go see how it's like kind of
animating<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> color<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.300> my

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
animating to the color this in my

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.299 
animating to the color this in my
opinion<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.680> smoother<00:00:50.160> than

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
opinion is a lot you know smoother than

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
opinion is a lot you know smoother than
just<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> traditional<00:00:50.820> color<00:00:51.539> change<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
just the traditional color change and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.889 
just the traditional color change and
with<00:00:52.800> how<00:00:52.949> easy<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:54.180> there's<00:00:54.690> really

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
with how easy it is to do there's really

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
with how easy it is to do there's really
no<00:00:55.110> reason<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.030> let's<00:00:57.480> take<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
no reason not to do it so let's take a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.000 
no reason not to do it so let's take a
look<00:00:57.809> at<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> CSS<00:00:59.059> here<00:01:00.059> i<00:01:00.090> am<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.300> Dreamweaver

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
look at the CSS here i am in Dreamweaver

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
look at the CSS here i am in Dreamweaver
where<00:01:02.010> i've<00:01:02.160> got<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.579> my<00:01:02.609> code<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:04.080> this

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
where i've got all my code for this

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.140 
where i've got all my code for this
button<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> i<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:05.909> quite<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
button you can see that i have quite a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.170 
button you can see that i have quite a
bit<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.530> CSS<00:01:07.530> around<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> button<00:01:08.580> itself<00:01:08.700> just

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
bit of CSS around the button itself just

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.480 
bit of CSS around the button itself just
to<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.450> looking<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> way<00:01:09.869> i<00:01:09.900> want<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> i

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
to get it looking the way i want it i

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.070 
to get it looking the way i want it i
have<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> displaying<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.180> an<00:01:12.270> inline<00:01:12.540> block<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
have it displaying as an inline block so

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380 
have it displaying as an inline block so
this<00:01:13.229> keeps<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.799> edges<00:01:14.310> shrunk<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> whatever

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
this keeps the edges shrunk to whatever

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
this keeps the edges shrunk to whatever
size<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> content<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.380> whereas<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.220> i<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
size the content is whereas if i had it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.270 
size the content is whereas if i had it
displaying<00:01:17.909> as<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> block<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:19.650> would<00:01:19.830> fit<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
displaying as a block it would fit to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.499 
displaying as a block it would fit to
the<00:01:20.400> width<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.820> whatever<00:01:21.330> its<00:01:21.479> container<00:01:21.840> is

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
the width of whatever its container is

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.609 
the width of whatever its container is
which<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.750> case<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> whole<00:01:25.320> screen

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
which in this case is the whole screen

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.460 
which in this case is the whole screen
so<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.860> don't<00:01:26.009> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:27.229> color<00:01:28.229> is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so we don't want to do that color is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.249 
so we don't want to do that color is
just<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.070> text<00:01:29.430> color<00:01:29.579> font<00:01:30.390> size<00:01:30.600> down<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
just the text color font size down to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.580 
just the text color font size down to
explain<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.360> border<00:01:33.360> radius<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.049> found

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
explain to you the border radius I found

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.440 
explain to you the border radius I found
that<00:01:34.680> 7<00:01:34.979> pixels<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:36.000> radius

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
that 7 pixels is a pretty good radius

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
that 7 pixels is a pretty good radius
it's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:38.450> like<00:01:39.450> rounded<00:01:40.670> but<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.820> also

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it's a not to like rounded but it's also

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
it's a not to like rounded but it's also
rounded<00:01:42.509> enough<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
rounded enough that it's just that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
rounded enough that it's just that
subtle<00:01:44.040> little<00:01:44.159> addition<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:47.450> background

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
subtle little addition to it background

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.319 
subtle little addition to it background
is<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.630> blue<00:01:48.930> color<00:01:49.189> this<00:01:50.189> box<00:01:50.579> shadow<00:01:50.909> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
is that blue color this box shadow is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.899 
is that blue color this box shadow is
what<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> use<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.860> dark<00:01:53.189> blue<00:01:53.430> kind<00:01:53.759> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
what I use for this dark blue kind of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.560 
what I use for this dark blue kind of
three-dimensional<00:01:54.780> effect<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> has<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
three-dimensional effect that it has and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.330 
three-dimensional effect that it has and
then<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.750> transition<00:01:58.500> right<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.130> that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
then this transition right here is that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.469 
then this transition right here is that
CSS<00:01:59.850> animation<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.840> was<00:02:00.960> talking<00:02:01.290> about<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.770> I'm

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
CSS animation I was talking about so I'm

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.170 
CSS animation I was talking about so I'm
the<00:02:03.479> way<00:02:03.689> CSS<00:02:04.500> transitions<00:02:05.189> work<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.700> I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the way CSS transitions work and I

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.580 
the way CSS transitions work and I
shouldn't<00:02:06.540> use<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.689> word<00:02:06.840> animation<00:02:07.469> because

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
shouldn't use the word animation because

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.660 
shouldn't use the word animation because
there's<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.039> CSS<00:02:08.610> animate

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
there's a CSS animate

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.640 
there's a CSS animate
sort<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.090> thing<00:02:10.240> too<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.750> it's<00:02:11.500> totally

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
sort of thing too and it's totally

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.860 
sort of thing too and it's totally
different<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.150> way<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.300> CSS

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
different so the way that CSS

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.070 
different so the way that CSS
transitions<00:02:14.530> work<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.790> first<00:02:16.150> state

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
transitions work is that you first state

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.160 
transitions work is that you first state
what<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.739> is<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.550> you're<00:02:18.670> wanting<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.390> effect

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
what it is that you're wanting to effect

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.880 
what it is that you're wanting to effect
and<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.280> for<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.000> am<00:02:22.630> only<00:02:23.110> affecting<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and so for this I am only affecting the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.150 
and so for this I am only affecting the
background<00:02:24.310> color<00:02:24.520> with<00:02:25.209> my<00:02:25.360> transition<00:02:26.160> then

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
background color with my transition then

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.360 
background color with my transition then
you<00:02:27.250> write<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.580> transition<00:02:28.480> time<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.370> then

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
you write the transition time and then

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.630 
you write the transition time and then
you<00:02:30.520> choose<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.060> transition<00:02:32.050> effect<00:02:32.640> which

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
you choose the transition effect which

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.010 
you choose the transition effect which
you<00:02:33.850> can<00:02:34.000> basically<00:02:34.150> choose<00:02:34.510> between<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
you can basically choose between the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.430 
you can basically choose between the
ease<00:02:35.290> in<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.830> out<00:02:35.950> which<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:36.519> a<00:02:36.670> fade<00:02:37.090> and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
ease in and out which is just a fade and

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.160 
ease in and out which is just a fade and
linear<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.630> because<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.840> isn't

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
linear so because this isn't

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.740 
linear so because this isn't
cross-browser<00:02:41.650> supported<00:02:42.280> yet<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:43.360> see<00:02:43.569> that

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
cross-browser supported yet you see that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.449 
cross-browser supported yet you see that
i<00:02:43.780> have<00:02:43.870> transition<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.250> moes

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
i have transition and then moes

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.820 
i have transition and then moes
transition<00:02:46.150> webkit<00:02:46.690> transition<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.590> sort

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
transition webkit transition that sort

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.699 
transition webkit transition that sort
of<00:02:47.860> thing<00:02:47.920> same<00:02:48.640> with<00:02:48.760> border<00:02:49.090> radius<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:50.500> is

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
of thing same with border radius this is

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.740 
of thing same with border radius this is
one<00:02:50.830> of<00:02:50.860> those<00:02:50.980> new<00:02:51.190> CSS<00:02:51.640> properties<00:02:52.360> it's<00:02:52.569> not

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
one of those new CSS properties it's not

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.420 
one of those new CSS properties it's not
fully<00:02:52.959> supported<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:53.560> add<00:02:53.769> those<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.280> make

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
fully supported so we add those to make

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.190 
fully supported so we add those to make
sure<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.790> they're<00:02:54.910> supported<00:02:55.330> in<00:02:55.540> Firefox

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
sure that they're supported in Firefox

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.630 
sure that they're supported in Firefox
and<00:02:56.500> Internet<00:02:56.799> Explorer<00:02:57.480> as<00:02:58.480> well<00:02:58.810> as<00:02:58.930> Chrome

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
and Internet Explorer as well as Chrome

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.580 
and Internet Explorer as well as Chrome
but<00:03:00.640> what's<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:01.660> nice<00:03:01.810> about<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.319> is<00:03:02.380> that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
but what's so nice about this is that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.949 
but what's so nice about this is that
it's<00:03:02.830> not<00:03:02.920> anything<00:03:03.280> that's<00:03:03.430> pivotal<00:03:04.150> for

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
it's not anything that's pivotal for

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.690 
it's not anything that's pivotal for
your<00:03:05.080> functionality<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:05.950> if<00:03:06.069> it<00:03:06.190> doesn't<00:03:06.549> work

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
your functionality so if it doesn't work

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.130 
your functionality so if it doesn't work
in<00:03:07.060> someone's<00:03:07.360> browser<00:03:07.540> they're<00:03:07.870> still<00:03:08.049> going

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
in someone's browser they're still going

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.900 
in someone's browser they're still going
to<00:03:08.230> see<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.500> color<00:03:08.739> change<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.730> it's<00:03:09.850> all

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
to see the color change so it's all

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.300 
to see the color change so it's all
really<00:03:10.000> gonna<00:03:10.150> make<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.299> difference<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
really gonna make a difference so the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.620 
really gonna make a difference so the
last<00:03:12.489> thing<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.819> can<00:03:12.970> want<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.150> teach<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.390> about

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
last thing I can want to teach you about

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.120 
last thing I can want to teach you about
how<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:15.250> whole<00:03:15.489> transition<00:03:16.269> thing<00:03:16.660> works

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
how this whole transition thing works

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.470 
how this whole transition thing works
let's<00:03:18.130> say<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.549> on<00:03:18.940> hover<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:20.070> want<00:03:21.070> my

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
let's say that on hover I want my

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.460 
let's say that on hover I want my
padding<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.630> increase<00:03:22.930> let's<00:03:23.200> say<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:23.350> do

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
padding to increase let's say I do

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.280 
padding to increase let's say I do
padding<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.040> like<00:03:24.280> 40<00:03:24.760> pixels<00:03:25.060> instead<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.810> 20

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.690 

so<00:03:29.290> see<00:03:29.470> how<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.739> like<00:03:29.829> grows<00:03:30.160> basically

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
so see how it like grows basically

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.860 
so see how it like grows basically
because<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.060> increasing<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.540> padding

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
because it's increasing that padding

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.020 
because it's increasing that padding
well<00:03:32.620> right<00:03:32.920> now<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.160> button<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:33.760> just

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
well right now the button is just

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.690 
well right now the button is just
jumping<00:03:34.690> what<00:03:35.019> if<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.170> wanted<00:03:35.350> it<00:03:35.470> excuse<00:03:36.430> me<00:03:36.579> to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
jumping what if I wanted it excuse me to

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.750 
jumping what if I wanted it excuse me to
animate<00:03:37.620> well<00:03:38.620> being<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:38.950> right<00:03:39.250> here<00:03:39.609> we

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
animate well being that right here we

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.460 
animate well being that right here we
targeted<00:03:40.359> what<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:40.959> that<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:41.230> want<00:03:41.440> to

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
targeted what it is that we want to

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.069 
targeted what it is that we want to
actually<00:03:41.620> allow<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.100> enemy<00:03:42.720> stands<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.959> reason

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
actually allow to enemy stands to reason

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.340 
actually allow to enemy stands to reason
that<00:03:44.410> if<00:03:44.650> we<00:03:44.799> targeted<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.579> padding<00:03:46.030> that

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
that if we targeted the padding that

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.440 
that if we targeted the padding that
would<00:03:47.350> animate<00:03:47.590> as<00:03:47.859> well<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.180> could<00:03:49.359> either

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
would animate as well so I could either

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.830 
would animate as well so I could either
copy<00:03:49.780> both<00:03:50.019> of<00:03:50.200> these<00:03:51.180> paste<00:03:52.180> them<00:03:52.359> again<00:03:52.600> and

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
copy both of these paste them again and

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.220 
copy both of these paste them again and
say<00:03:53.829> padding<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:54.459> time<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.880> isn't<00:03:55.840> what<00:03:56.140> I'm

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
say padding this time and isn't what I'm

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.050 
say padding this time and isn't what I'm
actually<00:03:56.440> going<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.739> do<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.730> I'm<00:03:57.790> not<00:03:57.880> going<00:03:58.000> to

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
actually going to do so I'm not going to

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.250 
actually going to do so I'm not going to
do<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.239> for<00:03:58.269> all<00:03:58.420> three<00:03:58.630> I'm<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:58.989> gonna<00:03:59.140> do

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
do it for all three I'm just gonna do

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.539 
do it for all three I'm just gonna do
for<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.410> first<00:03:59.620> one<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.769> show<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:02.549> sorry

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
for the first one to show you and sorry

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.190 
for the first one to show you and sorry
I<00:04:03.640> believe<00:04:03.910> Chrome<00:04:04.209> has<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.540> do<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.720> for<00:04:04.840> WebKit

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
I believe Chrome has to do it for WebKit

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.590 
I believe Chrome has to do it for WebKit
so<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.530> will<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:05.859> it<00:04:05.950> for<00:04:05.980> all<00:04:06.160> three<00:04:06.400> or<00:04:07.359> at

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
so I will do it for all three or at

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.110 
so I will do it for all three or at
least<00:04:07.660> for<00:04:07.900> two<00:04:08.049> of<00:04:08.200> them

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.000 

there<00:04:12.120> we<00:04:12.210> go<00:04:12.300> so<00:04:12.450> see<00:04:12.600> how<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:12.930> fades<00:04:13.830> it

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
there we go so see how it like fades it

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.099 
there we go so see how it like fades it
in<00:04:14.130> now<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.490> we<00:04:14.550> targeted<00:04:14.970> padding<00:04:15.270> well

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
in now that we targeted padding well

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.479 
in now that we targeted padding well
it's<00:04:16.320> not<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.769> want<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.040> have<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.280> target

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
it's not like you want to have to target

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.240 
it's not like you want to have to target
every<00:04:17.790> single<00:04:18.390> thing<00:04:18.720> on<00:04:19.380> your<00:04:19.500> site<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.100> what

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
every single thing on your site so what

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.870 
every single thing on your site so what
you<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.430> actually<00:04:20.640> do<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:23.090> type<00:04:24.090> all<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.880> this

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
you can actually do is type all and this

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.830 
you can actually do is type all and this
means<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.240> anything<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:28.020> changes<00:04:28.590> is

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
means that anything that changes is

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.250 
means that anything that changes is
going<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.050> get<00:04:31.290> animated<00:04:32.160> with<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.420> ease<00:04:33.870> in

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
going to get animated with this ease in

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.710 
going to get animated with this ease in
a<00:04:34.290> nap<00:04:34.500> transition<00:04:35.150> maybe<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.300> won't<00:04:36.420> want

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
a nap transition maybe you won't want

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.030 
a nap transition maybe you won't want
that<00:04:36.810> maybe<00:04:37.170> you<00:04:37.320> will<00:04:37.500> want<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.770> just<00:04:37.920> do

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
that maybe you will want to just do

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.460 
that maybe you will want to just do
things<00:04:38.190> individually<00:04:38.780> but<00:04:39.780> what<00:04:40.110> this<00:04:40.260> means

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
things individually but what this means

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.900 
things individually but what this means
now<00:04:40.710> is<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:41.010> if<00:04:41.160> in<00:04:41.430> addition<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.820> the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
now is that if in addition to the

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.930 
now is that if in addition to the
padding<00:04:42.210> changing<00:04:42.600> let's<00:04:42.750> say<00:04:42.900> we<00:04:43.020> change

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
padding changing let's say we change

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.480 
padding changing let's say we change
margin<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.960> be<00:04:46.110> like<00:04:46.760> 100<00:04:47.760> pixels<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.660> then<00:04:49.530> 00

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
margin to be like 100 pixels and then 00

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.570 
margin to be like 100 pixels and then 00
and<00:04:50.700> then<00:04:50.820> for<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.060> pixels<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:55.860> kind<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.130> set

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
and then for the pixels it kind of set

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.320 
and then for the pixels it kind of set
up<00:04:56.669> or<00:04:57.270> excuse<00:04:57.600> me<00:04:57.630> kind<00:04:58.350> of<00:04:58.380> messes<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.919> up

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
up or excuse me kind of messes it up

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330 
up or excuse me kind of messes it up
because<00:05:00.380> my<00:05:01.380> mouse<00:05:01.560> keeps<00:05:01.800> uncovering

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
because my mouse keeps uncovering

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.180 
because my mouse keeps uncovering
because<00:05:03.300> it's<00:05:03.450> moving<00:05:03.750> but<00:05:04.470> you<00:05:04.890> see<00:05:05.040> those

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
because it's moving but you see those

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.850 
because it's moving but you see those
animating<00:05:05.640> it<00:05:05.730> so<00:05:05.910> basically<00:05:06.870> once<00:05:07.230> again<00:05:07.560> the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
animating it so basically once again the

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.040 
animating it so basically once again the
way<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.070> works<00:05:08.130> is<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.580> first<00:05:09.050> target

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
way it works is that you first target

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.110 
way it works is that you first target
the<00:05:10.140> thing<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.560> you're<00:05:10.680> going<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:11.120> animate

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
the thing that you're going to animate

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.210 
the thing that you're going to animate
with<00:05:12.419> your<00:05:12.600> transition<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.890> write<00:05:14.070> the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
with your transition you write the

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.430 
with your transition you write the
transition<00:05:14.700> speed<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.419> then<00:05:15.840> you<00:05:15.960> write<00:05:16.200> the

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
transition speed and then you write the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.880 
transition speed and then you write the
effect<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:18.270> transition<00:05:18.690> so<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.620> hope<00:05:19.770> this

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
effect of that transition so I hope this

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.650 
effect of that transition so I hope this
