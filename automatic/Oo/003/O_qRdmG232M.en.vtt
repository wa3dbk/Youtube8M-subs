00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.430
 It ran N 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.910
 We will explain about the mambous staccato 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.560
 The number staccato will continue over 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.840
 It is one of riz-zoawd å¡¾ link 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.840
 It is surprisingly simple as a way 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.260
 Sakai Tower 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.430
 Follow 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.430
 Just like singing 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:59.410
 eod 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.410
 Salt white staccato is just up to let the man continue 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.370
 ana 2 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.300

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.300

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:18.280
 The cart that has been up all the time 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.280
 In is that to hear the sound 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.759
 2 I thought it Teru 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:34.210
 Hmmm 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:36.060
 I know 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.350
 So little 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.030
 down 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.030
 I I've been shifted you to Atsubetsuminami body that is interrupting the truth by which it can be said 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.850
 Just yeah yeah Eeee' 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:59.740
 But if you want to benq your voice 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.740
 Buu Uhh Uhh Uhh uhh UU 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.520
 In short 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.569
 Things 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.080
 Let's practice putting two of the sound back down 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.700
 a yes 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.040
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.730

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.730
 Yes 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:29.400
 Let's practice in a word 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:34.430
 It is also a good practice to practice at two points 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.430
 Uu Uu uhh 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.430

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.200
 Practice at two points 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.460
 Well riding 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:54.430
 It is 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:56.110
 There is no down at all as a bad practice for the white cart 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.110
 It was like this 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.110
 2 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.430
 That's very 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.430
 It feels unreliable really on the right hand came Gas 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.030
 Live shot 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.030
 Down only reaches the limit 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:27.960
 Though it is number staccato 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.960
 When the false-down movement is not Nii in the lottery 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.100

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.970
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.970
 Otsutsu 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.170
 When you practice 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.090
 Musicians have no trouble 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.310
 Even one 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.310
