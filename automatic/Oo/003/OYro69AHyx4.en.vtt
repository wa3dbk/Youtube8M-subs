00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.359
 not only entertainer Harald Schmidt likes to play with Playmobil 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.290
 The Hague many stand out as Merkel Putin and so on Pastor Bomhard 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.680
 Niederhöchstadt has even made a real passion out of it and 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.500
 if that does not fit he'll even tell us the Ascension if you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.060
 do not become like the children 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.730
 yes, too 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.730
 Jesus of Nazareth said then 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.470
 the Asservatkammer of Pastor Bommert in Niederhöchstadt 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.150
 in the basement everything is carefully collected and sorted everywhere is approx 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.960
 Real estate because it suits a special Beijing peculiarity compared to one 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.390
 and religion 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 has a lot of work to do 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 Dr 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.930
 but he should never lost 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.530
 and they can not be bought 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.560
 first are so naughty TuS 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.580
 who probably is not good at selling Sido 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.930
 find un-missions market 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.820
 but they were originally skeletons and then there was only their mass 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 applied they had to be painted 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.350
 and they should just look nice so they are not at their best 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.689
 Bennett "You may take a cash credit he his Bible BZ his mission 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.730
 proselytizing by Playmobil 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.350
 The figures he depicts scenes from the Bible after today Ascension Day 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.350
 Clothes so short process 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.260
 for example, when I'm making films 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.010
 NES Ziona should do then I need a mountain on the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.760
 She says goodbye, so to speak 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.800
 then I need 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 a lake where Jesus 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.020
 and then told 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.630
 as is then, as it were, going to heaven in the Ascension 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.719

 for the newcomers here fitting for the eve of Ascension 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.499
 So I realize that 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:24.639
 in order to achieve chimes with those otherwise have nothing to do with anything 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.109
 and suddenly find percent 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.699
 One understands 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.540
 even the little ones with a few that many stories 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.420
 almost half an hour the bus needs the masterpiece of the Exodus from Egypt 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.369
