reasons<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.560> tell<00:02:01.619> by<00:02:01.920> now

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
reasons so as you can tell by now

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.620 
reasons so as you can tell by now
there's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> lot<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.579> trade-offs<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.210> printing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
there's a lot of trade-offs in printing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.120 
there's a lot of trade-offs in printing
orientation<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.590> let's<00:02:04.740> work<00:02:04.890> through<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
orientation so let's work through a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010 
orientation so let's work through a
practical<00:02:05.549> example<00:02:05.670> I've<00:02:06.390> got<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.780> pair<00:02:06.990> of

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
practical example I've got a pair of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.499 
practical example I've got a pair of
sennheiser<00:02:07.530> hd25<00:02:08.220> headphones<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> really

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
sennheiser hd25 headphones that I really

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.089 
sennheiser hd25 headphones that I really
like<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> wanted<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> design<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.560> headphones

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
like and I wanted to design a headphones

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.460 
like and I wanted to design a headphones
holder<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.879> fit<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.090> onto<00:02:12.330> my<00:02:12.420> desk

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
holder for them that fit it onto my desk

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
holder for them that fit it onto my desk
the<00:02:13.620> design<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> came<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:15.180> there's<00:02:15.330> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
the design I came up with so there's a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.540 
the design I came up with so there's a
few<00:02:15.600> considerations<00:02:16.130> firstly<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.160> want<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.460> to

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
few considerations firstly I want it to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.920 
few considerations firstly I want it to
be<00:02:17.640> strong<00:02:17.910> enough<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.180> hold<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> headphones

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
be strong enough to hold the headphones

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
be strong enough to hold the headphones
but<00:02:19.170> also<00:02:19.560> resilient<00:02:20.160> enough<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.520> case

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
but also resilient enough in case

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.220 
but also resilient enough in case
someone<00:02:20.970> bumps<00:02:21.270> into<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> table<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.020> knocks

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
someone bumps into the table and knocks

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.680 
someone bumps into the table and knocks
it<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.620> also<00:02:23.250> chose<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.700> stick<00:02:23.970> my<00:02:24.150> makers<00:02:24.480> muse

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
it I also chose to stick my makers muse

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.660 
it I also chose to stick my makers muse
logo<00:02:25.020> onto<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.500> want<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.070> print<00:02:26.220> nicely

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
logo onto it I want that to print nicely

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.350 
logo onto it I want that to print nicely
and<00:02:26.820> legibly

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
and legibly

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.900 
and legibly
so<00:02:27.870> what<00:02:27.990> orientation<00:02:28.530> would<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.740> choose<00:02:28.950> so

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
so what orientation would you choose so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.940 
so what orientation would you choose so
how<00:02:30.030> about<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.390> orientation<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.800> can

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
how about this orientation as you can

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.680 
how about this orientation as you can
see<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.310> logo<00:02:32.460> looks<00:02:32.760> fantastic<00:02:33.450> due<00:02:33.570> to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
see the logo looks fantastic due to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.000 
see the logo looks fantastic due to
being<00:02:33.810> printed<00:02:34.080> along<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.530> sides<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
being printed along the sides of the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.340 
being printed along the sides of the
part<00:02:35.250> however<00:02:35.970> we<00:02:36.300> have<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> problem<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
part however we have a problem the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.990 
part however we have a problem the
layers<00:02:37.530> are<00:02:37.770> running<00:02:38.010> across<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> holder

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
layers are running across the holder

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.460 
layers are running across the holder
this<00:02:39.360> means<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:39.780> holder<00:02:40.020> won't<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.260> very

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
this means this holder won't be very

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.410 
this means this holder won't be very
strong<00:02:40.770> at<00:02:40.920> all<00:02:41.070> there's<00:02:41.760> also<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.030> lot<00:02:42.390> of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
strong at all there's also a lot of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.450 
strong at all there's also a lot of
support<00:02:42.960> material<00:02:43.350> which<00:02:43.680> wastes<00:02:44.010> plastic

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
support material which wastes plastic

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.699 
support material which wastes plastic
and<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> pain<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.150> remove<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.440> how<00:02:46.590> about

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
and is a pain to remove so how about

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.610 
and is a pain to remove so how about
this<00:02:47.010> orientation<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.780> lines<00:02:49.020> run<00:02:49.260> along<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
this orientation the lines run along the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
this orientation the lines run along the
holder<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.190> should<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:50.459> pretty<00:02:50.640> strong<00:02:51.000> but

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
holder so it should be pretty strong but

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.240 
holder so it should be pretty strong but
now<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> logo<00:02:52.170> looks<00:02:52.380> pretty<00:02:52.740> bad<00:02:53.010> as

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
now the logo looks pretty bad as

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.100 
now the logo looks pretty bad as
suffering<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.850> limitations<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.840> nozzle

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
suffering the limitations of the nozzle

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.230 
suffering the limitations of the nozzle
diameter<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:56.310> layers<00:02:56.610> also<00:02:56.850> mean<00:02:57.090> that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
diameter the layers also mean that

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.640 
diameter the layers also mean that
although<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.660> part<00:02:57.900> won't<00:02:58.080> break<00:02:58.350> weather

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
although this part won't break weather

although this part won't break weather
headphones<00:02:59.160> are<00:02:59.340> held<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.790> may<00:03:00.180> break<00:03:00.420> further

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
headphones are held it may break further

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.240 
headphones are held it may break further
down<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.320> Mount<00:03:01.530> where<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.800> layers<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.190> a

down the Mount where the layers have a
very<00:03:02.550> small<00:03:02.820> contact<00:03:03.240> area<00:03:03.630> also<00:03:04.140> again

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
very small contact area also again

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.199 
very small contact area also again
there's<00:03:04.890> quite<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> lot<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.400> support<00:03:05.790> material

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
there's quite a lot of support material

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.940 
there's quite a lot of support material
that<00:03:06.630> just<00:03:06.870> leaves<00:03:07.110> us<00:03:07.320> with<00:03:07.650> this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
that just leaves us with this

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.949 
that just leaves us with this

very<00:03:12.209> strong<00:03:12.510> part<00:03:12.810> with<00:03:13.020> nice<00:03:13.260> big<00:03:13.500> layers

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
very strong part with nice big layers

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.890 
very strong part with nice big layers
but<00:03:14.400> also<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.640> pretty<00:03:14.970> good<00:03:15.060> definition<00:03:15.390> on<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
but also a pretty good definition on the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.990 
but also a pretty good definition on the
logo<00:03:16.380> as<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.920> still<00:03:17.100> along<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> sides<00:03:17.790> of

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
the print the only downside of this

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.100 
the print the only downside of this
orientation<00:03:20.459> some<00:03:21.150> printers<00:03:21.540> will<00:03:21.750> struggle

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
orientation some printers will struggle

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.960 
orientation some printers will struggle
to<00:03:22.260> print<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.800> part<00:03:23.130> without<00:03:23.400> significant

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
to print this part without significant

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.850 
to print this part without significant
warping<00:03:24.330> due<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.900> very<00:03:25.110> long<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.620> thin

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
warping due to the very long and thin

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.380 
warping due to the very long and thin
edges<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.370> particularly<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.000> support

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
edges and particularly the support

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.940

that's<00:03:27.570> underneath<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.230> edge<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.830> the

that's underneath the edge of the
headphones<00:03:29.310> holder<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.269> you're<00:03:30.390> printing

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
headphones holder so if you're printing

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.759 
headphones holder so if you're printing
in<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.750> orientation<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.470> your<00:03:31.530> printer

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
in this orientation and your printer

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.199 
in this orientation and your printer
can't<00:03:32.010> handle<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.550> may<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.970> go<00:03:33.180> to

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
can't handle it you may have to go to

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.570 
can't handle it you may have to go to
PLA<00:03:33.750> or<00:03:34.110> try<00:03:34.410> one<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> other<00:03:34.890> orientations

PLA or try one of the other orientations

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.580 
PLA or try one of the other orientations
so<00:03:35.880> there<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.900> have<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.080> as<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.470> see

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
so there you have it as you can see

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.900 
so there you have it as you can see
there's<00:03:37.769> no<00:03:37.860> clear<00:03:38.160> answer<00:03:38.310> when<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.610> comes<00:03:38.790> to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
there's no clear answer when it comes to

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.280 
there's no clear answer when it comes to
print<00:03:39.120> orientations<00:03:39.660> there's<00:03:39.870> almost<00:03:40.050> always

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
print orientations there's almost always

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.020 
print orientations there's almost always
some<00:03:40.680> sort<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:40.890> trade-off<00:03:41.130> it'll<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:41.880> come

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
some sort of trade-off it'll just come

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.310 
some sort of trade-off it'll just come
down<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.299> what<00:03:42.510> features<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.900> want<00:03:43.019> most

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
down to what features you want most

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.080 
down to what features you want most
prominent<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.860> your<00:03:44.010> 3d<00:03:44.190> print<00:03:44.519> it's<00:03:44.820> also<00:03:44.970> a

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
prominent in your 3d print it's also a

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.460 
prominent in your 3d print it's also a
good<00:03:45.209> idea<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.510> keep<00:03:45.630> your<00:03:45.690> print<00:03:45.989> orientation

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
good idea to keep your print orientation

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.720 
good idea to keep your print orientation
in<00:03:46.590> mind<00:03:46.860> right<00:03:47.130> from<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> start<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.670> the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
in mind right from the start of the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.280 
in mind right from the start of the
design<00:03:47.880> process<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.570> when<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.900> get<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.170> that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
design process so when you get to that

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.020 
design process so when you get to that
final<00:03:49.470> print<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.190> won't<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.430> stuck<00:03:50.640> trying<00:03:50.940> to

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
final print you won't be stuck trying to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.789 
final print you won't be stuck trying to
find<00:03:51.209> out<00:03:51.330> which<00:03:51.540> way<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:52.019> best<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.440> print<00:03:52.650> it

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799
