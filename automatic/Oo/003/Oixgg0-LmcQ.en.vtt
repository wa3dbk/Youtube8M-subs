00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.790
 with the bq a waris of 54 g I'm using 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.010
 the native application the one that comes with the 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.830
 serial phone nothing came to me here 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.110
 the fields where my house is for 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.380
 record and see how the camera works 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.239
 I think it records in mp4 format and nothing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.560
 here we are looking to see how 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.239
 is the video camera the camera 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.130
 pretty good photos I've already commented 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.380
 in some other occasion but we are going to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.660
 see how is the video camera I am 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.170
 recording 1080p what I said in format 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.489
 mp4 and nothing to see how are we going to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 move a little bit so you can see 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.600
 a little bit that is focusing on you and how is it 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.429
 we are going to do a test with the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.429
 approach to see for example the keys 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.769
 and focused it took a little bit of focus 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.390
 but the truth is that the video quality 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.030
 I think it's pretty good more than 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.600
 time that we are playing again 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.549
 the park 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.770
 and nothing was just that for me to go 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.130
 a little bit that you have the quality of 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.600
 video and a good day a lighting 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.070
 good 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.330
 and it was simply for you to see a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 little is an idea that such is the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.590
 quality of videos, I'm saying very 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.060
 happy with the phone the performance 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.509
 what is giving me is good 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.950
 the camera very good photo battery 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.659
 so far that the 500 you do not go 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.759
 all the fluids that supposedly 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.290
 I should go but good to see 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.920
 if later they get 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.170
 fix it overall performance that is 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.420
 a lot more so I do not expect anything 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.590
 have liked the video a greeting and now 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.740
 I'm going to do a test with the camera 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.740
 frontal 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.500
 and nothing this is a video test with 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.360
 the front camera as you can see there 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.970
 very good lighting but good we are going to 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.140
 see how quality you take the video 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.560
 I think it's recording is the maximum 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.870
 possible quality what vga I do not know 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.170
 exactly what is simply a 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.430
 little to give you an idea of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.200
 the good thing so that you make an idea of 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.340
 quality movement that can 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.170
 offer the device 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.620
 it is simply a small test a 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.620
 greeting 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.750
 and
