00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello good afternoon everyone and we are going to 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.920
 continue with 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.690
 this last part of mission number 4 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.639
 and we're going to end up killing my boss that 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.590
 is the titanium man and that the truth 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.389
 he is a guard and the truth is hard enough 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.650
 guard and pretty hard 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.380
 You'll see that the miner has a suit 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.260
 detonating and still you notice that you do not 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.240
 I will be able to lose a lot of life 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.470
 and it looks quite difficult here and out of 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.960
 the first two turns with angel and with 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.310
 spiral 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.620
 let's see I think we went out to get 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.680
 one because it helps tony stark to see what 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.970
 is what comes out went hunting and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.970
 floor to all 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.059
 pretty good still if you leave them 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 of little I can eliminate one of these 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 to stop being a nuisance and 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.170
 from my point of view this is going to be the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.170
 most annoying of all so that falls 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.239
 the hold steady is going to be used and 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.439
 I will 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.439
 and start attacking with spiral towards your 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.439
 perspective 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.100
 personal to his respective character with 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.170
 the one that has a disadvantage 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.890
 remember that a spike has an advantage 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.890
 against the strategist 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.800
 pretty good because they inspire having 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.710
 used that kind of thing and let's see 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.940
 what is going to happen when britania 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.940
 I just stayed alone 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.700
 same is the first or second 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.840
 false wave that comes the final boss 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.759
 this is the mini boss 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 and that's where spiral counterattacks with 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.400
 pure critics pretty well and my agent 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.740
 received targeted attacks while 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.050
 our poor angel receives series and of 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.630
 step that all beings have effect 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.630
 exposure to radiation and burn 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.510
 spiral strikes back in a way 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.760
 pretty crazy he is to blame 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.649
 good is points says the power of 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.850
 four go I did not do it 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.850
 let's get closer to two debut 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.660
 the two enhancers and we're going to use 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.300
 is the unexpected help to be able to take 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.480
 a higher of higher life score towards 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.480
 the enemy 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.410
 although we just used it and we're going to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.720
 be real a shot 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.140
 and will die 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.910
 in an incredible way 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.910
 critical of 15,000 the head 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.330
 here where blizzard comes 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.030
 character very similar to eichmann I'm 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.030
 seeing that he has 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.240
 a physicist quite similar but one 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.240
 different aesthetics 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.150
 Today we will heal the spiral to 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.940
 nothing happens to you because it is the one that most 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.940
 it matters and everyone blesses of spiral 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.290
 blessing we are going to attack 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.150
 the head will fall a critic of 2000 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.410
 pretty good for a person who is left 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.130
 have 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.110
 nothing of that remember that it is in the 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.790
 level 2 that I mention to you now 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.990
 properties because it receives the just 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.990
 buy good 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.920
 we use the power of four can be 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.010
 pretty rushed but it may be that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.010
 do not 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.020
 we killed this puppy 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.020
 legion 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.610
 something pretty 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.200
 very unhelpful on my part 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.200
 but they take away aura 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.150
 and that 's where shit falls 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.639
 uy what pain Jason the cai 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.520
 blizzard 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.520
 and that's where the fire elitist falls 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:37.450
 with your arrange thanks to angel 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.450
 and said fire 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.139
 very little to national level I just 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.139
 finish the mission 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.189
 pretty good for first I do 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.870
 the reward for boss 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.060
 I do not use much angel 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.560
 did not use much choose this item 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.870
 increase the effect of healing 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.660
 received 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.420
 endure all the healing allies this 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.440
 this would suit me quite well I think 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.440
 he left it in mode 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.110
 command points I'm pretty happy 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.120
 with what I receive 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.060
 but I wish I had received that type 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.160
 of items seems to me quite useful and what 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.500
 I'm going to play in challenge mode to see what it is 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.390
 what I get if I get a tea out there 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.040
 much better than that and in received a 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.990
 much more healing 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.170
 good people this the video I hope you 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.170
 I liked it
