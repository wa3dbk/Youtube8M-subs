00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.360 

let's<00:00:50.829> read<00:00:51.129> this<00:00:51.719> dread-nots<00:00:52.719> dwarf<00:00:53.649> stars

where they are least wanted you know you
could<00:01:03.430> probably<00:01:03.610> call<00:01:04.119> a<00:01:04.180> dreadnought

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
could probably call a dreadnought

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.930

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.649 

the<00:01:42.799> objective<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.640> game<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.299> disable

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
and destroy all dreadknots failure will

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.910 
and destroy all dreadknots failure will
result<00:01:47.479> in<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.229> negation<00:01:48.619> of<00:01:48.969> this<00:01:49.969> galaxy

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
result in the negation of this galaxy

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.529 
result in the negation of this galaxy
again<00:01:51.920> interesting<00:01:52.280> choice<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.939> words

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
again interesting choice of words

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.990 
again interesting choice of words

insert cartridge turned power on this is

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.889 
insert cartridge turned power on this is
also<00:02:00.590> available<00:02:00.859> for<00:02:01.310> Atari<00:02:01.849> home<00:02:02.179> computers

but<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.079> do<00:02:03.200> not<00:02:03.409> believe<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:03.979> dread-nots

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
but I do not believe the dread-nots

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.240 
but I do not believe the dread-nots
factor<00:02:04.969> made<00:02:05.179> it<00:02:05.329> to<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.599> Atari<00:02:05.990> 2600<00:02:06.799> which

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
factor made it to the Atari 2600 which

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.969 
factor made it to the Atari 2600 which
is<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:07.459> shame<00:02:07.819> because<00:02:08.259> this<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> really<00:02:09.769> cool

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
is a shame because this is a really cool

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.950 
is a shame because this is a really cool
video<00:02:10.340> game

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.210 

probably<00:02:14.960> one<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.380> missed<00:02:15.710> unless<00:02:16.070> you

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
probably one that you missed unless you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.210 
probably one that you missed unless you
had<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.460> 5200<00:02:17.420> or<00:02:17.540> @re<00:02:18.050> home<00:02:18.290> computer<00:02:18.830> back<00:02:19.010> in

had a 5200 or @re home computer back in

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.610 
had a 5200 or @re home computer back in
the<00:02:19.340> day<00:02:19.490> in<00:02:20.330> many<00:02:20.540> ways<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:21.080> very<00:02:21.320> similar

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the day in many ways it's very similar

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.100 
the day in many ways it's very similar
to<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.980> modern<00:02:22.520> spaceship<00:02:23.480> shooting<00:02:23.930> game
