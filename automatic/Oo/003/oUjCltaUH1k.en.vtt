 err 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.480
 william rainey who only had 22 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.099
 when he founded his first 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.470
 brewery in 1864 with no experience 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.120
 some in the making of the beverage the young 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.070
 entrepreneur risked the fortune of 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.320
 family to prove that the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.350
 Beer would grow only in 1870 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.960
 young war and really set your 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.720
 style until then heineken was a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.199
 dark beer feature seen as 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.270
 a working class drink 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.579
 make a new kind of light beer 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.300
 began to appear in Holland 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.910
 the german wool yarn is 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.210
 light beer was more expensive than 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.060
 view as a top drink in a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.220
 war and tranquil beer exhibition 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.229
 As for the new beer said on the floor no 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.929
 I was selling and decided to make 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.420
 change will still be so he did something 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.880
 intelligent position as rescuers 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 a beer of knights 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.740
 from then on it began to produce a 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.079
 pool is transparent golden 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.180
 what was an alternative reward the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.420
 dark traditional beers 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.070
 success has quickly come its new 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.140
 beer won the grand prize in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.220
 world exhibition of paris in 1889 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.860
 these decisions are on the label until today 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.440
 be broad business one or me all 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.820
 beer starts with water 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.520
 in fact almost 95% of beer is water 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.340
 so what is the super secret source the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 precious ingredient of the queen some 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.100
 natural source perhaps with whom 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.250
 know fresh snow to the child believe or 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.710
 it's not just tap water 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.000
 So you make a premium beer with 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.800
 tap water 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.280
 heineken does this because it has 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.280
 installations 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.940
 what really 5am and other beers 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.830
 of the market is its global position and 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.170
 of its most important achievements 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.880
 started as part of the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.060
 american history 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.070
 the year was 1933 and america had stayed 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.090
 without anything for more than a decade due to 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.830
 prohibition 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.810
 when the Russian president finally gave 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.610
 ended the alcohol ban he 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.340
 noticed that it would be a good time 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.230
 for a beer and the race started for 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.580
 make the long awaited first delivery 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.560
 of beer in europe 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.910
 rainey who won the race and soon 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.570
 gained its market position 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.520
 American the beckham and in 1933 when the 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.410
 law has been relocated we have sent the 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.720
 beer for the United States and has 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.220
 been a success story ever since. 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.070
 so we have a special relationship 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.160
 with that country grandson of war and 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.350
 fred and he can grow during this time 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.090
 your first real job with the company 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.700
 family was in the United States 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.590
 promoting your beer on the west coast 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.750
 it was there that he learned about the world of 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.850
 marketing and he brought this new 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.459
 knowledge back to class and includes 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.350
 virtually everything is on board now and 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.640
 last box of heineken beer is 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.830
 loaded in the 1960s and 1970s 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.020
 fred ray nobody had the idea of 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.760
 to transform the certainty of his family into 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.770
 an international brand 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.120
 critics have said that beer will never 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.970
 could be an international product 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.680
 like soft drinks in our network 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.390
 has done this through an investment 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.450
 serious in a marketing campaign 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.160
 globalization until the end of 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.260
 there no one had become a name 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.750
 known all over the world as 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:12.820
 recognizable as a red star 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:12.820
 in a bottle child was going to kill the girl 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.440
 jury of world heineken 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.590
 They want to know where this star comes from. 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.720
 red star appeared the red star still 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.300
 It is something mysterious that believed 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.850
 a symbol of good luck to manufacturers 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.160
 of medieval beer during the war 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.320
 cold to the company a white star to 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.420
 avoid association with communism but 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.490
 the original red star and appeared 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.410
 in a short time the greatest revolution in 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.020
 mark happened during the management of fred 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.170
 rainey family head rainey changed to 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.720
 gait identity a look when you 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.460
 Look at the label, you see the dream as it is 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.130
 Of course there are still some that he 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.710
 introduced green bottle we see on the face 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.150
 UN to Haiti that there everything bad 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.270
 because to fred and incoherent it was a 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.670
 powerful hour you see the fans neither her 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.630
 it was nice it was merci 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.700
 with nature 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.460
 What was the ideal color for beer? 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.620
 intention and he did something else in the iron 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.150
 Today you look very close to the beltway 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.550
 that you see him and his name on it or with 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.630
 fred ray pencil that started testing the 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:30.560
 inclination of the contested ones to the right 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.620
 he seemed sad too far to 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.620
 left ineligible at last he 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.420
 found the perfect angle and looks 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.720
 a smiling face 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.700
 It was a stroke of genius of yours and smiling. 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.230

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.230
