that's located in in that place in the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.830 
that's located in in that place in the
desert<00:01:01.789> because<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.940> seems<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> be<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
desert because it seems to be like a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.700 
desert because it seems to be like a
desert<00:01:04.049> place<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> um<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.450> mean<00:01:06.869> yes<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> mean

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
desert place so um I mean yes for I mean

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
desert place so um I mean yes for I mean
older<00:01:08.100> made<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> video<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
older made a video like this with the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.980 
older made a video like this with the
galaxy's<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.920> someone<00:01:11.670> might<00:01:11.909> would<00:01:12.630> want<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
galaxy's for someone might would want to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
galaxy's for someone might would want to
see<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> s4<00:01:13.799> mini<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> don't<00:01:14.880> know

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
see like the s4 mini if you don't know

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.530 
see like the s4 mini if you don't know
what's<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> difference<00:01:15.869> between<00:01:15.930> yes<00:01:16.409> for

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
what's the difference between yes for

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.840 
what's the difference between yes for
yes<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.840> any<00:01:19.259> s4<00:01:19.560> mini<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.770> mean<00:01:19.920> s4<00:01:20.310> mini<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
yes for any s4 mini I mean s4 mini is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.570 
yes for any s4 mini I mean s4 mini is
almost<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> same<00:01:21.390> specs<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.159> mean<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.520> course

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
almost the same specs I mean of course

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.600 
almost the same specs I mean of course
no<00:01:24.180> skill<00:01:24.420> processor<00:01:24.900> dual<00:01:25.140> core<00:01:25.409> processor

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
no skill processor dual core processor

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.800 
no skill processor dual core processor
but<00:01:26.610> most<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> times<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.479> won't<00:01:27.659> really

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
but most of the times you won't really

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.240 
but most of the times you won't really
notice<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.140> big<00:01:28.290> difference<00:01:28.350> between<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> one

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
notice a big difference between that one

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.960 
notice a big difference between that one
and<00:01:29.280> quad<00:01:29.729> core<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:31.430> on<00:01:32.430> my<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.670> terms<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and quad core and on my in terms of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.850 
and quad core and on my in terms of
gaming<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.990> course<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> lot

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
gaming and of course it has to do a lot

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
gaming and of course it has to do a lot
with<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> graphic<00:01:35.549> processing<00:01:36.000> unit<00:01:36.540> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
incest the name of it it has a journal

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.530 
incest the name of it it has a journal
through<00:01:39.659> enough<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.020> GP<00:01:40.380> instead<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.540> 320

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
through enough on GP instead of the 320

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.590 
through enough on GP instead of the 320
GPU<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> s4<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.600> you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
GPU that you do get on the s4 and you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
GPU that you do get on the s4 and you
really<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.350> know<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.860> big<00:01:47.040> difference

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
really don't know it's a big difference

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
really don't know it's a big difference
between<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.700> better<00:01:48.000> 305<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.479> what<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
between a better 305 and and what is

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.350 
between a better 305 and and what is
being<00:01:51.780> called<00:01:53.000> yeah<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.299> know

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
being called yeah I don't know

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.010 
being called yeah I don't know
305<00:01:55.259> performs<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.310> good<00:01:56.939> i<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.360> say<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
305 performs as good i would say and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.410 
305 performs as good i would say and
a<00:01:59.049> schedule<00:01:59.500> 3<00:01:59.829> 20<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.460> ninety-nine<00:02:01.329> percent

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
a schedule 3 20 in ninety-nine percent

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.039 
a schedule 3 20 in ninety-nine percent
of<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.810> games<00:02:02.759> yeah<00:02:03.759> well<00:02:04.060> drilling<00:02:04.359> into<00:02:04.750> the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
of the games yeah well drilling into the

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.910 
of the games yeah well drilling into the
distance<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.780> hey<00:02:08.170> we<00:02:08.349> have<00:02:08.470> another<00:02:08.649> thing

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
distance but hey we have another thing

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.750 
distance but hey we have another thing
here<00:02:09.129> the<00:02:09.670> iphone<00:02:10.090> what's<00:02:10.720> up<00:02:10.840> with<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.019> one

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
here the iphone what's up with that one

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.520 
here the iphone what's up with that one
this<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> thing<00:02:13.239> that's<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.629> what<00:02:14.019> also<00:02:14.470> my

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
this is the thing that's a what also my

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.150 
this is the thing that's a what also my
with<00:02:15.010> hot<00:02:15.250> apple<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.510> knees<00:02:17.500> always<00:02:17.769> find<00:02:18.069> a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
with hot apple the knees always find a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.589 
with hot apple the knees always find a
way<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.370> make<00:02:18.730> everything<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.269> little<00:02:19.510> bit

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
way to make everything is a little bit

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.860 
way to make everything is a little bit
more<00:02:20.080> smooth<00:02:20.560> in<00:02:20.860> terms<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.459> performance<00:02:21.870> not

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
more smooth in terms of performance not

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.039 
more smooth in terms of performance not
that<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.170> s4<00:02:23.500> mini<00:02:23.530> lag<00:02:23.980> not<00:02:24.670> even<00:02:24.819> close<00:02:25.049> but

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
that the s4 mini lag not even close but

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.869 
that the s4 mini lag not even close but
it's<00:02:26.349> something<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:27.459> butter

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
it's something with like that butter

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.009 
a 4.3 inch next-generation iphone but I

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
don't think it's gonna happen but if

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.690 
don't think it's gonna happen but if
they<00:03:59.169> would<00:03:59.440> then<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.310> would<00:04:00.430> have<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.669> same

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700
