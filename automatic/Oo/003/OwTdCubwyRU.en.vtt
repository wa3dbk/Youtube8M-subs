I kind of think that Nintendo has to do

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.690 
I kind of think that Nintendo has to do
it<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.840> mean<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.040> many<00:00:41.100> did<00:00:41.340> theirs

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it I mean when when so many did theirs

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
it I mean when when so many did theirs
and<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.899> Microsoft<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.590> there<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.160> was

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and then Microsoft that there is it was

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
and then Microsoft that there is it was
like<00:00:44.430> okay<00:00:44.789> Nintendo<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
like okay Nintendo you have to do it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.459 
like okay Nintendo you have to do it

gaming library really doesn't have a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.100 
gaming library really doesn't have a
great<00:01:02.629> following<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.870> terms<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.350> people<00:01:05.129> who
