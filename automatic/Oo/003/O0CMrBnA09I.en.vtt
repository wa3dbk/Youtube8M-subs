00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
the controller for the processor it

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.920 
the controller for the processor it
allows<00:01:17.850> us<00:01:17.880> eight<00:01:18.240> channels<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> input

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
allows us eight channels of input

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
in that area we made in a practical hold

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.020 
in that area we made in a practical hold
for<00:02:10.770> vampires<00:02:11.190> which<00:02:11.430> drive<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> whole

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030

we<00:02:13.250> top<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.489> off<00:02:13.849> by<00:02:14.090> doing<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.450> press<00:02:14.900> metal

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
we top that off by doing a press metal

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.569 
we top that off by doing a press metal
mesh<00:02:15.439> grille<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.980> amplifiers<00:02:16.340> can

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
mesh grille so the amplifiers can

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.009 
mesh grille so the amplifiers can
breathe<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.060> little<00:02:17.299> red<00:02:17.420> light<00:02:17.629> to<00:02:17.900> give
