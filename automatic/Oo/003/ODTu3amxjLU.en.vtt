00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.120
 right right here we had 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.950
 instrumental here is a ledge or this 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.109
 the day is our garden steel now we 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.169
 when retooled made of it 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.679
 called writing strands according to the principle 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:28.150
 that we have is our skull is here 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:31.550
 recounted and here in this room 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.260
 nicknamed sedation through crumbling and we 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.190
 we will gradually feed them football 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.530
 Well, what will we select for the new building 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.530
 wear them your men inside 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 small area warm good 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.930
 with underwater thermostat near the room 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.500
 where we will be lower than 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.300
 where is ours now then 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.700
 eat 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.760
 I will stay here what will you be services 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.580
 from the planets they are here and I'll be thousands they 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.050
 are settled here do not eat here and by 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.500
 as the humus moves from the place 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.150
 from the place it is clear that we understand that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 this is not enough. and in the basement we are there 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 Now converted only with chromosomal 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.890
 places prepared while we plan it 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.690
 intensify everything while we took on and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.850
 reproduction that we went through to eat 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.550
 started you watching we eat 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.490
 we feed mostly bananas kids with 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.320
 pleasure skins Panama 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.390
 even the larvae cut them we then cycle we 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.830
 watched watched under rose 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.830
 through 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.600
 nutrient substrate husband and mostly we 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.399
 use what we have than we are good 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:58.110
 for some reason fox question except 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:01.159
 google net getting more from us too 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.159
 cow pier 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.830
 as a nutrient substrate and here 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.739
 Now our last Saturdays 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.590
 grass order a large container 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.270
 output can not be burned here in the trash 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.130
 we can not carry what to do orders we 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.780
 pay for 90 engineer 3-4 thousand rubles 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.610
 we lack one container 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.099
 Mad money to and here we will 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:32.069
 earn motor we settled here 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:38.190
 Worms population here and our feet 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:41.340
 bananas compost food waste and they have 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.310
 here we have a worm here 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.069
 here they are our handsome men live 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.629
 feed they rose from the bottom of the jester 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.310
 here began to go eat 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.530
 quietly breed that is they 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.150
 now down there somewhere not very bottom 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.430
 they are here 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.430
 closer to the top but not quite 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:10.129
 so podsypali when strong can 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.110
 here they are seen there a little bit here 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.480
 cool for them of course they are by 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.980
 comfort is more active when the temperature 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.810
 higher it is up to 20 degrees now one 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.780
 we will move the batch to the greenhouse 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.129
 and here we will just warm the room 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.579
 door and normally set then we will 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.769
 increase 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:35.750
 here you just multiply the worms 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.940
 one idea we have near fish farm marine 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.970
 ponds us here's one of the ideas 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.989
 fishermen sell a lot of nature 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.230
 if we develop normally multiply 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.250
 and there to sell ink is excellent 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.989
 napoleonic plans but i look yes 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.129
 I look exactly the plan you have here 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.129
 grand just
