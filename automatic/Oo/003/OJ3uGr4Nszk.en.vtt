00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.060 
want to play as not sure Katara but I
didn't<00:00:20.300> have<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.449> pick<00:00:20.689> on<00:00:20.840> me<00:00:20.990> so<00:00:21.680> I<00:00:21.710> used<00:00:21.769> a

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
didn't have a pick on me so I used a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.880 
didn't have a pick on me so I used a
quarter<00:00:22.369> instead<00:00:22.519> I<00:00:23.349> noticed<00:00:24.349> have<00:00:24.470> a<00:00:24.529> quarter

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
quarter instead I noticed have a quarter

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.009 
quarter instead I noticed have a quarter
with<00:00:25.159> its<00:00:25.310> round<00:00:25.579> edge<00:00:25.820> moved<00:00:26.509> over<00:00:26.929> the

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
with its round edge moved over the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.370 
with its round edge moved over the
strings<00:00:27.380> smoothly<00:00:28.339> and<00:00:28.669> quickly<00:00:29.199> so<00:00:30.199> what<00:00:30.349> I

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
strings smoothly and quickly so what I

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.740 
strings smoothly and quickly so what I
got<00:00:30.589> home<00:00:30.829> I<00:00:31.070> tried<00:00:31.849> using<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.210> top<00:00:32.450> quarter

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
got home I tried using the top quarter

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.090 
got home I tried using the top quarter
of<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.930> standard<00:00:33.320> pick<00:00:33.470> and<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:33.770> got<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:33.980> same

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
of a standard pick and I got the same

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.760 
of a standard pick and I got the same
effect<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:35.690> I'll<00:00:35.780> demonstrate<00:00:35.960> playing<00:00:36.290> a<00:00:36.590> few

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
effect so I'll demonstrate playing a few

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:57.630 
effect so I'll demonstrate playing a few
notes<00:00:36.980> a<00:00:37.250> few<00:00:37.489> riffs

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.370 

this<00:00:58.640> is<00:00:58.760> how<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:58.970> got<00:00:59.060> my<00:00:59.180> speed<00:00:59.480> picking<00:00:59.750> in

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
this is how it got my speed picking in

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.790 
this is how it got my speed picking in
my<00:01:00.530> guitar<00:01:00.860> solo<00:01:01.100> video<00:01:01.340> earth<00:01:01.910> light<00:01:02.680> so<00:01:03.680> what

my guitar solo video earth light so what

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.550 
my guitar solo video earth light so what
you're<00:01:03.920> doing<00:01:03.950> is<00:01:04.339> using<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:05.200> top<00:01:06.200> right

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
you're doing is using the top right

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.820 
you're doing is using the top right
corner<00:01:07.010> of<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.850> pic<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.500> can<00:01:09.500> see<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.680> there

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
corner of the pic you can see it there

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.090 
corner of the pic you can see it there
and<00:01:10.300> hold<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.479> pic<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.590> pointy<00:01:12.979> end

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
and hold the pic so that the pointy end

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.480 
and hold the pic so that the pointy end
is<00:01:13.660> facing<00:01:14.660> 11<00:01:15.110> o'clock

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
is facing 11 o'clock

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:38.670 
is facing 11 o'clock
when<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.360> look<00:01:17.510> down<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:19.100> try<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.700> few<00:01:19.760> notes

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.830 

but<00:01:39.680> I<00:01:39.710> feel<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.920> little<00:01:40.040> awkward<00:01:40.280> at<00:01:40.610> first

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
but I feel a little awkward at first

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.930 
but I feel a little awkward at first
because<00:01:41.840> they<00:01:42.080> have<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.350> pick<00:01:42.590> down<00:01:43.370> a<00:01:43.760> bit

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
because they have to pick down a bit

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.460 
because they have to pick down a bit
further<00:01:44.180> what<00:01:44.870> happened<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.200> have<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.350> go<00:01:45.440> a

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
further what happened you have to go a

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.040 
further what happened you have to go a
little<00:01:45.560> bit<00:01:45.710> deeper<00:01:46.300> prepared<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.480> holding<00:01:47.990> a

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
little bit deeper prepared to holding a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.780 
little bit deeper prepared to holding a
pick<00:01:48.230> the<00:01:48.320> regular<00:01:48.590> way<00:01:48.710> cuz<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.580> have<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
pick the regular way cuz you have the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.360 
pick the regular way cuz you have the
pointy<00:01:50.060> end<00:01:50.120> I<00:01:50.300> would<00:01:50.420> have<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.840> pick<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.110> hard

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
pointy end I would have to pick so hard

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.230 
pointy end I would have to pick so hard
so<00:01:52.370> far<00:01:52.580> down<00:01:53.410> but<00:01:54.410> it<00:01:55.010> works<00:01:55.160> great<00:01:55.490> when

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
so far down but it works great when

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.450 
so far down but it works great when
you're<00:01:56.390> alternating<00:01:56.750> between<00:01:57.380> two<00:01:58.130> strings

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
you're alternating between two strings

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:11.660 
you're alternating between two strings
like

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.090 

yeah<00:02:12.670> works<00:02:12.910> great<00:02:13.180> like<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.480> for<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:14.100> and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
yeah works great like that for that and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:26.230 
yeah works great like that for that and
you<00:02:15.370> can<00:02:15.490> use<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.640> for<00:02:15.850> rocket<00:02:16.210> r2c

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:35.590 

as<00:02:26.960> well<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:27.260> skills

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.720 

a<00:02:35.690> little<00:02:36.440> more<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.800> little<00:02:37.040> bit<00:02:37.280> more<00:02:37.430> space<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
a little more a little bit more space to

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.300 
a little more a little bit more space to
discuss<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:39.320> it's<00:02:39.440> not<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.590> major<00:02:39.920> skill<00:02:40.190> was

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
discuss so it's not that major skill was

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.070 
discuss so it's not that major skill was
born<00:02:40.520> now<00:02:41.240> you'll<00:02:41.390> be<00:02:41.420> playing<00:02:41.720> it<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:41.930> hours

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
born now you'll be playing it for hours

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.300 
born now you'll be playing it for hours
okay<00:02:45.080> that's<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.380> lesson<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.860> hope<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.160> been
