00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:21.709 
standard whining line because you get a

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:24.340 
standard whining line because you get a
lot<00:01:21.889> more<00:01:21.920> of<00:01:22.189> those<00:01:22.899> standard<00:01:23.899> colors<00:01:24.170> with<00:01:24.319> a

lot more of those standard colors with a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.870 
lot more of those standard colors with a
bit<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.709> different<00:01:25.039> color<00:01:25.219> as<00:01:25.429> an<00:01:25.520> overtone

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
to it I like this is a shock material on

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.780 
to it I like this is a shock material on
mayflies<00:01:59.990> because<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.619> did<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:01.100> think<00:02:01.159> looks<00:02:01.549> a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
mayflies because it did I think looks a

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.690 
mayflies because it did I think looks a
lot<00:02:02.270> like<00:02:02.450> pheasant<00:02:02.869> tail<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.290> as<00:02:03.950> as<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.549> all

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
lot like pheasant tail and as as we all

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.940 
lot like pheasant tail and as as we all
know<00:02:04.880> if<00:02:05.000> as<00:02:05.119> entails<00:02:05.420> are<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.990> good<00:02:06.439> generic

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
know if as entails are a good generic

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.490 
know if as entails are a good generic
mayfly<00:02:07.869> imitation<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.020> since<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.319> is

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
mayfly imitation and since this is

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.860 
mayfly imitation and since this is
imitating<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:09.979> shock<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:11.030> think<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.720> works

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
imitating the shock I think it works

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.220 
imitating the shock I think it works
pretty<00:02:12.020> well<00:02:12.110> for<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:16.569> go<00:02:17.569> ahead<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.870> wrap

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
pretty well for that go ahead and wrap

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.770 
pretty well for that go ahead and wrap
that<00:02:18.410> down<00:02:18.680> all<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.819> way<00:02:19.910> down<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.209> body

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.280 

but<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.080> trim<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.319> pretty<00:02:28.680> sure<00:02:30.290> half

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
but I like to trim that pretty sure half

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.020 
but I like to trim that pretty sure half
yeah<00:02:32.040> about<00:02:32.280> two-thirds<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.819> shank

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
yeah about two-thirds of the shank

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.580 
yeah about two-thirds of the shank
length<00:02:37.790> go<00:02:38.790> ahead<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.060> secure<00:02:39.180> your<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:40.440> is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
length go ahead and secure your this is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.190 
length go ahead and secure your this is
this<00:02:40.739> happens<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.220> be<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.959> Montana<00:02:42.959> flight

company one to wrap but there's a lot a
lot<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.330> products<00:02:45.630> like<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.160> want

lot of products like this and you want

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.780 
lot of products like this and you want
to<00:02:47.400> tie<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:49.069> keep<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.160> tag<00:02:50.340> end<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.610> little

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
to tie it in keep the tag end a little

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.640 
to tie it in keep the tag end a little
shorter<00:02:51.120> than<00:02:51.270> you'd<00:02:51.450> expect<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.170> needed<00:02:52.470> to

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
shorter than you'd expect you needed to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.120 
shorter than you'd expect you needed to
be<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.489> reach<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.940> end<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.209> body

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
be to reach to the end of the body

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.380 
be to reach to the end of the body
because<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.250> since<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.550> does<00:02:56.700> stretch<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
because it since it does stretch and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.330 
because it since it does stretch and
compress<00:02:57.720> very<00:02:57.959> well<00:02:58.200> it'll<00:02:58.800> stretch<00:02:59.160> out

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
compress very well it'll stretch out

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.210 
compress very well it'll stretch out
someone<00:02:59.670> as<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.850> over<00:03:00.090> wrap<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.720> the

someone as you over wrap it up to the

someone as you over wrap it up to the
end<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.400> body<00:03:06.470> wrap<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> body<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.299> when

end of the body wrap the body and when

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.030 
end of the body wrap the body and when
you're<00:03:09.450> wrapping<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.840> material<00:03:10.350> always

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
you're wrapping this material always

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.590 
you're wrapping this material always
wrap<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.670> under<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> little<00:03:12.239> bit<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.450> tension

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
wrap it under a little bit of tension

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.059 
wrap it under a little bit of tension
that's<00:03:12.930> one<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.319> things<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.680> makes<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:13.980> a

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
that's one of the things that makes it a

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.340 
that's one of the things that makes it a
durable<00:03:14.400> body<00:03:14.640> material<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:16.049> wrapped<00:03:16.260> it

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
durable body material you wrapped it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.809 
durable body material you wrapped it
under<00:03:16.590> tension<00:03:16.799> so<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.220> gets<00:03:17.489> on<00:03:17.610> there<00:03:17.790> very

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
under tension so it gets on there very

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.759 
under tension so it gets on there very
tightly<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.660> harder<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.470> fish's

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
tightly and it's harder for the fish's

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:29.780 
tightly and it's harder for the fish's
teeth<00:03:19.980> rocks<00:03:20.880> etc<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.690> punch<00:03:22.319> into<00:03:22.500> it

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:45.280 

the<00:03:30.330> next<00:03:30.599> step<00:03:30.750> secure<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.170> wing

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.080 

then<00:03:46.040> trim<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.430> tuft<00:03:47.230> off<00:03:48.230> about<00:03:48.849> half<00:03:49.849> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
then trim that tuft off about half the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.890 
then trim that tuft off about half the
distance<00:03:50.239> detail

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.740

and<00:04:05.230> then<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.410> last<00:04:05.590> step<00:04:05.830> before<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.190> wrap

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
and then the last step before you wrap

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.960 
and then the last step before you wrap
the<00:04:06.520> hackle<00:04:07.320> about<00:04:08.320> an<00:04:08.650> eye<00:04:08.860> width<00:04:09.160> behind<00:04:09.790> the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
wing post to stand it up but I like to

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.120 
wing post to stand it up but I like to
take<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.700> couple<00:04:15.940> wraps<00:04:16.440> right<00:04:17.440> around<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
take a couple wraps right around the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.610 
take a couple wraps right around the
base<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.580> wing<00:04:19.200> like<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.350> would<00:04:20.470> on<00:04:20.500> a

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
base of the wing like you would on a

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.100 
base of the wing like you would on a
parachute<00:04:21.450> just<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.570> kind<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.750> keep<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.020> all

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
parachute just to kind of keep it all

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.990 
parachute just to kind of keep it all
together<00:04:23.230> I<00:04:23.470> have<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:23.950> feeling<00:04:24.310> that<00:04:24.460> if<00:04:24.910> you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
together I have a feeling that if you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.730 
together I have a feeling that if you
don't<00:04:25.090> do<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.450> after<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.900> few<00:04:25.960> fish<00:04:26.260> starting

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
don't do that after a few fish starting

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.350 
don't do that after a few fish starting
on<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.100> wings<00:04:27.280> tends<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.700> spread<00:04:27.970> out<00:04:28.120> and

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
on it the wings tends to spread out and

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.390 
on it the wings tends to spread out and
get<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.350> little<00:04:29.560> mangled<00:04:31.980> okay<00:04:32.980> then<00:04:33.160> go<00:04:33.310> ahead

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
get a little mangled okay then go ahead

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.720 
get a little mangled okay then go ahead
and<00:04:33.490> wrap<00:04:33.640> your<00:04:33.790> hackle<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.780> like<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.050> make

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
and wrap your hackle and I like to make

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.790 
and wrap your hackle and I like to make
four<00:04:36.730> to<00:04:36.850> five<00:04:37.030> turns<00:04:37.360> behind<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.230> wing<00:04:38.500> post
