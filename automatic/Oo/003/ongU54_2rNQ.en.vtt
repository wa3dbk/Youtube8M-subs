00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.850
 before you put the pot of meat 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:12.090
 in the oven it is better to bring the liquid to 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.700
 weak boil on the stove so we quickly 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.130
 heat the dish before she gets to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.130
 oven heated to 95 degrees 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.670
 as soon as the liquid becomes 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 pod cover the pan tightly 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.050
 closing lid 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.900
 so we will avoid evaporation during 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.260
 long cooking place the pot 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.289
 with meat in the oven 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.019
 during the preparation of meat you need 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:47.329
 turn the piece several times 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.329
 cooked in broth from all sides 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.719
 to put out a big piece of meat 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.719
 required 2 to 8 hours 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.180
 the thing is, it's cooking time 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.800
 stew depends on the size of the piece 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.980
 cooking temperature and desired 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.590
 consistency remember the slower 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.290
 the meat is cooked the more tender it will be 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.760
 so take more time to 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.760
 get soft meat 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.330
 Of course this cooking method 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.760
 requires patience meat is considered ready 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.560
 then when it is easily punctured 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.930
 a fork 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.680
 If you wish to make a dish for dinner that 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.050
 in advance put the meat stewed 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.240
 to find out if this big piece is ready 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.470
 take two forks and try 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 split the fibers in this case 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.840
 meat is not ready because its hard 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.810
 to split 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.369
 and this is better in spite of the fact that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.229
 dividing the fiber is still not easy 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.799
 if you are going to add vegetables to 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.319
 meat is the right time to 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:14.930
 principle you need to add vegetables when 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:18.549
 meat is almost ready vegetables will be cooked for 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.549
 40 60 minutes 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.519
 add large pieces of carrot parsnip 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.519
 and potatoes 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.590
 if you add vegetables to the ready 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.620
 meat do not worry meat is worse 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.360
 if you put it out a little more along with 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.220
 vegetables 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.950
 if the vegetables are ready and the meat is easy 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.840
 pierced with a fork then you can run 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.840
 sauce and serve immediately 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.630
 nevertheless strongly recommend 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.580
 you cool the dish cover and 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.370
 put in the fridge at night 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.770
 then the taste and components are imbued with each 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.460
 as a friend and a lot more chilled meat 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.460
 easier to cut
