twenty-four/seven lip glide in venom now

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.320 
twenty-four/seven lip glide in venom now

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
I know there's a lighter shade that goes

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.540 
I know there's a lighter shade that goes
with<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:13.050> liar<00:04:13.620> color<00:04:14.360> that's<00:04:15.360> that's<00:04:16.200> a

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:16.550 
with the liar color that's that's a

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.330 
with the liar color that's that's a
complementary<00:04:17.550> to<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.850> lipstick<00:04:18.420> but<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:19.340> find

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
complementary to the lipstick but I find

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.690 
complementary to the lipstick but I find
that<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.880> lighter<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.510> liners<00:04:21.930> are<00:04:22.170> for<00:04:22.470> me

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
that the lighter the liners are for me

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
that the lighter the liners are for me
it<00:04:23.700> just<00:04:23.730> doesn't<00:04:23.910> work<00:04:24.270> for<00:04:24.330> me<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:26.720> little

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
it just doesn't work for me so a little

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.270 
it just doesn't work for me so a little
deeper<00:04:28.170> line<00:04:28.380> gives<00:04:28.680> me<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> little<00:04:28.950> bit<00:04:29.130> more

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
deeper line gives me a little bit more

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.420 
deeper line gives me a little bit more
definition<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.830> lipstick

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
definition and so this is the lipstick

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.860 
definition and so this is the lipstick
version<00:04:32.880> of<00:04:33.030> liar<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.380> this<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.670> gloss<00:04:35.970> so

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
version of liar and this is the gloss so

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.080 
version of liar and this is the gloss so
this<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.470> my<00:04:37.710> first<00:04:37.980> time<00:04:38.160> trying<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:38.910> I'm
