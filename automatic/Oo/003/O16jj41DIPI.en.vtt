00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.259
 about 3 masks for our type of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.140
 skin that is being oily skin the 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.180
 Mixed and dry skin so I hope 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.660
 more apart I will be teaching some 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.390
 of the little things that I do in the night 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.760
 as to take care of me I do not 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.769
 I unmask the creams that I use and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.780
 things like that I do not know what they're asking me 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.659
 how I do it to have a skin like that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.090
 as well as why not come and look 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.590
 wrinkles or anything like that do not eat like 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.719
 I look so young 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.960
 well I'm not saying I'm 50 years old or 40 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.140
 but I do take care of myself if I tell them that I 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.300
 like to say that your little one this flame 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.899
 a lot of the skin in one of my videos said 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.580
 that since he was 78 years old he stole 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.770
 the beds to a night machine nothing 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.570
 pony ways in this part of here and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.729
 Well, as I admired her, but she 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.550
 I also think that this is how we are all from 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.560
 children and well well I do not tell them too 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.320
 that they buy things so expensive creams 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.390
 because there are homemade masks that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 one in the house we can do this 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.260
 if you go to the refrigerator they go to 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.170

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.270

 paintings you also have to take care of it in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.020
 our face of this one is that is 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.960
 make up at night we do not have to be 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.600
 loose 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.460
 the time does not matter but you have to divert 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.710
 the early the better the better 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.170
 the skin is resting from both 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.869

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.640

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.690

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.239
 type of acne or for example if you have 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.790
 acne, they are your wipes 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.530
 be the roses the purple is like to 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.750
 when you want this feeling in the night 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.000

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.129
 are the dwellings and the loose do not say 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.189
 only they are wipes but the 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:49.069
 they take away is from that to remove the 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:53.680
 waterproof makeup 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.540
 this is the mascara and you can at the beginning 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.730
 If you are going to feel greasy, it will leave you 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.760
 the wipes at the end is just a 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.299
 little bit and but since it is absolving 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.299
 a moisturizer is also and also this one 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.530
 If I did not arm myself, I am with the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.440
 I've liked it a lot and I have not liked it 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.510
 it leaves me as well as irritate me there is nothing 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.150
 some that you spend as well as that you 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.150
 burning his face and not to me have me 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.550
 served very well and good what I with 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.560
 this first I took off all my makeup 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.810
 ni and this one my liquid makeup my base 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.819
 and already at the end only because my eyes 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.250
 this for example I start with the eyelid 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.860
 mobile and in the end it only closes without me 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.950
 daughter I step on the towel wipes 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.670
 in children eyelashes very carefully 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.150
 a lot of great care and be at the end 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.510
 I use this 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.360
 It is an eye makeup lotion 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.620
 Oil-free photo very very very well 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.349
 and with a cotton 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.030
 in my eyes also only for 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.909
 make sure that I'm doing well 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.090
 right now I'm using this mascara to 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.510
 water proof because I want to make sure 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.239
 that it's okay for me to get it right in the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.070
 twin and good then very delicately 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.720
 very carefully I unsheathe my 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.720
 eyes with this medicaid 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.990
 ok after that 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.850
 I think I also do this pillaging my 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.160
 face that he has been doing once 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.640
 week once every 15 days 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.690
 although this one is called the brand 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.620
 the skin is black superman 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.080
 it's a mask 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.760
 of black sugar 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.220
 that smell very public 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.530
 so if I'm running out and 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.360
 Well my face told me and I'm going 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.169
 giving turns and if well well in all my 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.840
 face in this part very very well 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.539
 and then I take it off with water 5 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.560
 tortilla came very hot almost there 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.350
 almost a little cold 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.090
 and in the event that I did not wear my face 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.310
 I do not pass the next step that comes 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.600
 being this also of the same brand 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.510
 the skin 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.610
 it's a gel and if you want to hear this noise 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.410
 that is importing the grass here 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.190
 printed this noise is heard so 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.639
 I'm going to talk a little more fourth and 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:33.040
 directive so he used this gel to 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.169
 wash my face what I did before 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.660
 only did he put it here not if 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.730

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.670

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:48.030

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:48.030

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.440

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.960

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.210
