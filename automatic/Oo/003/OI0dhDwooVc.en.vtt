was<00:01:21.480> all<00:01:21.660> designed<00:01:22.050> where<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.070> this

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
was all designed where we have this

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.570 
was all designed where we have this
great<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.150> project<00:01:24.990> about<00:01:25.340> sports<00:01:26.340> culture

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580

sense<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.710> craftsmanship<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.900> we<00:01:42.900> felt<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
sense of craftsmanship and we felt that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.930 
sense of craftsmanship and we felt that
it's<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:43.860> great<00:01:44.070> marriage<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> a

the core essence of a concept when you
come<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.520> car<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> see

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
come in and you see the car and you see

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.030 
come in and you see the car and you see
this<00:01:57.869> sort<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.170> environment<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:58.860> created

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
this sort of environment that's created

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.150 
this sort of environment that's created
around<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> there's<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.570> very<00:02:00.750> sort<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
around it there's a very sort of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.130 
around it there's a very sort of
specific<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.430> simple<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.090> powerful<00:02:03.240> gesture

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
specific and simple and powerful gesture

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.020 
specific and simple and powerful gesture
which<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.220> case<00:02:05.400> is<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> sort<00:02:05.940> of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
which in this case is the sort of

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.969 
which in this case is the sort of
profile<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> car<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.500> been<00:02:07.710> sort<00:02:07.920> of

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
profile of the car that's been sort of

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.060 
profile of the car that's been sort of
cut<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.459> create<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.149> reveal<00:02:09.479> around<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.070> and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
cut to create this reveal around it and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.110 
cut to create this reveal around it and
then<00:02:11.190> there's<00:02:11.370> also<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.640> little<00:02:11.820> bit<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
then there's also a little bit of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.670 
then there's also a little bit of
discovery<00:02:12.570> so<00:02:12.750> we've<00:02:12.900> created<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.440> other

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
discovery so we've created this other

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.820 
discovery so we've created this other
half<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.340> boxes<00:02:15.410> present<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.680> sort

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
half of the boxes present but it's sort

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.470 
half of the boxes present but it's sort
of<00:02:16.890> tipped<00:02:17.160> onto<00:02:17.370> its<00:02:17.640> side<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.240> when<00:02:18.360> you're

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
of tipped onto its side so when you're

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.540 
of tipped onto its side so when you're
standing<00:02:18.660> at<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.020> bar<00:02:19.200> you're<00:02:19.739> inside<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.430> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
standing at the bar you're inside of the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.860 
standing at the bar you're inside of the
other<00:02:20.670> half<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.090> box<00:02:21.269> we've<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.690> been

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
other half of the box we've just been

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.949 
other half of the box we've just been
kind<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.140> pulled<00:02:22.769> away<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.430> rotated<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.750> sort

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
kind of pulled away and rotated to sort

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.070 
kind of pulled away and rotated to sort
of<00:02:24.989> reveal<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:26.220> cutout<00:02:26.580> or<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.970> reveal<00:02:27.330> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
of reveal the cutout or the reveal it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.720 
of reveal the cutout or the reveal it
had<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.350> obviously<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.830> prefabricated

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
had to obviously be prefabricated

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.660 
had to obviously be prefabricated
without<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.300> car<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.220> there's<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.519> kind

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
without the car and so there's this kind

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.820 
without the car and so there's this kind
of<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:32.820> magic<00:02:33.360> moment<00:02:33.780> where<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.680> make

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
of like magic moment where you make

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.250 
of like magic moment where you make
something<00:02:35.330> off-site<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.630> far<00:02:36.870> away

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
something off-site and far away

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.280 
something off-site and far away
it's<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:39.159> sort<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.459> come<00:02:39.640> together<00:02:40.360> part<00:02:41.230> of

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
it's to sort of come together part of

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.990 
it's to sort of come together part of
you<00:02:41.409> is<00:02:41.440> nervous<00:02:41.830> but<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.400> other<00:02:42.519> part<00:02:42.790> that's

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
you is nervous but the other part that's

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.399 
you is nervous but the other part that's
really<00:02:43.120> amazing<00:02:43.450> when<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.840> happens<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.319> it

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
really amazing when it happens and it

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.559 
really amazing when it happens and it
fits<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:44.739> there<00:02:44.890> perfectly<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:46.180> don't<00:02:46.360> have

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
fits on there perfectly you don't have

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.509 
fits on there perfectly you don't have
to<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.870> an<00:02:47.409> art<00:02:47.709> or<00:02:47.860> design<00:02:47.980> or<00:02:48.190> architecture
