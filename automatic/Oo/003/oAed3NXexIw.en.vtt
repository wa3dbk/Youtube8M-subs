00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.660 
nature so now let's go ahead and get to
the<00:02:00.630> second<00:02:00.960> topic<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> video<00:02:01.619> headset<00:02:02.460> a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the second topic of the video headset a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.179 
the second topic of the video headset a
headset<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.750> think<00:02:03.840> one<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.710> most<00:02:04.920> vital

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
headset is I think one of the most vital

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.130

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
controller and television I think your

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.720 
controller and television I think your
headset<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.660> one<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.440> most<00:02:10.619> vital<00:02:11.280> parts

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
headset is one of the most vital parts

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.940 
gunfight you can go ahead and jump shot
them<00:02:54.269> or<00:02:54.450> drop<00:02:54.750> shot<00:02:54.959> them<00:02:55.170> which<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.799> ever

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
them or drop shot them which one ever

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.949 
them or drop shot them which one ever
you<00:02:56.100> like<00:02:56.130> best<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.790> think<00:02:57.269> jump<00:02:57.600> shouting

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
you like best I think jump shouting

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.330 
you like best I think jump shouting
around<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.380> corner<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.799> pretty<00:02:59.010> good<00:02:59.190> because

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
around the corner is pretty good because

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.400 
around the corner is pretty good because
the<00:02:59.519> enemy<00:02:59.670> doesn't<00:03:00.000> expect<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:01.200> lot<00:03:01.349> of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
the enemy doesn't expect it and a lot of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.110 
the enemy doesn't expect it and a lot of
time<00:03:01.650> noobs<00:03:02.010> they're<00:03:02.280> aiming<00:03:02.670> at<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.880> ground

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
time noobs they're aiming at the ground

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.240 
time noobs they're aiming at the ground
anyway<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.569> if<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.019> jump<00:03:04.260> up<00:03:04.349> in<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.530> air<00:03:04.620> they

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
anyway so if you jump up in the air they

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.759 
anyway so if you jump up in the air they
have<00:03:05.400> lesser<00:03:05.819> less<00:03:06.510> time<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.110> react<00:03:07.410> towards

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
have lesser less time to react towards

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.789 
have lesser less time to react towards
it<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.299> when<00:03:09.299> you're<00:03:09.450> using<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.870> headset<00:03:10.080> you

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
it and when you're using a headset you

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.440 
it and when you're using a headset you
you<00:03:11.099> really<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.670> advantage<00:03:12.090> over<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
you really have the advantage over the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.150 
you really have the advantage over the
enemy<00:03:12.480> because<00:03:13.080> if<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.410> enemy<00:03:13.739> doesn't<00:03:13.920> have

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
enemy because if the enemy doesn't have

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.800 
enemy because if the enemy doesn't have
a<00:03:14.190> headset<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.209> don't<00:03:15.360> have<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.510> dead
