 Y 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.470

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 friend 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.330
 certainly caixa 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.759
 I touched the sky with my hands I felt the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.710
 heat of the sun without fear to be able to burn 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.690
 also wilted roses I had my 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.940
 We are the problem, it returns, I always 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.980
 I forgot to water, I sold my soul for three 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.019
 bitches but I gave him the stick sometimes I feel 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 that the devil wants to charge me I'm 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.890
 running without stepping on the brakes I do not have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 afraid to crash and leave everything behind 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.329
 I live in the smallest city where children 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.230
 great we want to do giant things 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.850
 with music 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.620
 we are in the park watching how the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.720
 bank changes with new signatures of the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.670
 that we are going to relieve the blows hurt 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.729
 but it hurts more to see that a while ago I 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.430
 you have no one to cure you 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.280
 to be able to take those tears and that 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.229
 they mix with the sea a hug to all 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460
 my friends if it were not for them the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.280
 way is too much 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.960
 It's been a long time that if I write, I do not think 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 things that make me feel bad 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.720
 you know that often costs have what 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.229
 the nerves have me imprisoned my mind is 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.729
 like glass in a sand castle it 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.180
 find that throne that I want 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.740
 aspire collapses little by little and before 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.460

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.500
 from me I suffered a thousand things but also 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.970
 I learned that there are many more that I was happy 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.800
 of the sign comes until the sun 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.690

 at least one time where the legend will 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.650
 forges rather in books that pick up 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.019
 exploits we did when we did 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.790

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.269

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.610
