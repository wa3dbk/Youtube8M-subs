00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.340
 they give us all 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.190
 a horror movie 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.400
 was the topic today is muscles 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.860
 that you have a muscle bigger than 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.950
 another why this happens 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.270
 well basically because we have 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.580
 a dominant part of our body 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.080
 whether you are right - handed you'll get the 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.989
 arm or leg more will have more 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.320
 volume so to speak the muscle that 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.510
 the left side like if you're left handed 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.670
 to happen the same then how 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:01.239
 fix this problem very simple this 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.550
 many complain that there are types or there are 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.909
 oxen that we give to the pass to the expert 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.320
 but many times this helps so that 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.780
 moment that he is performing the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.409
 exercise 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.420
 You can see yourself and both of you two 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.090
 arms or both legs or the sad what 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.330
 whatever you're doing shoulder 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.650
 this will rise to it at the same 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.490
 time because many times 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.930
 when lifting the bar or when lifting 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.140
 the dumbbells there is a difference if at 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.060
 do chinning even then here is 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.540
 when you see that a muscle starts to 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.240
 grow much faster than the other or a 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.620
 muscle has more volume than the other 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.440
 so the way to avoid this is in 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.940
 the mirror is or have a spoiler that you 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.950
 say you know you're raising more with 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.620
 an arm or is lifting more with the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.250
 other 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.729
 the leg is equal or is getting up more 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.370
 one and less then it is very 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.800
 important to first 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.600
 exercises in the mirror already once 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.210
 you have mastered the exercise already going to 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.410
 do it naturally but this is the 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.410
 only way to prevent a muscle 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.880
 have more volume than the other then 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.510
 if they have any 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.260
 any doubt any questions please 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.180
 send me an email and do not forget 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.180
 like before you go
