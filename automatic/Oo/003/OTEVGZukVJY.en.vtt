process<00:04:51.730> there's<00:04:52.000> hundreds<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.690> hundreds<00:04:53.050> of

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
process there's hundreds and hundreds of

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.370 
process there's hundreds and hundreds of
videos<00:04:53.440> out<00:04:53.710> there<00:04:53.740> it's<00:04:54.190> fairly<00:04:54.550> simple<00:04:55.380> what

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
videos out there it's fairly simple what

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
we can do is I'll just time-lapse that

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.120 
we can do is I'll just time-lapse that
will<00:04:58.840> go<00:04:58.960> really<00:04:59.139> quickly<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.770> then<00:04:59.950> we'll

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
will go really quickly and then we'll

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:14.530 
will go really quickly and then we'll
see<00:05:00.310> how<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.580> works

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.180

I did was I just stuck it through there
works<00:05:42.660> very<00:05:42.960> well<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.530> would<00:05:44.190> have<00:05:44.250> done<00:05:44.370> it<00:05:44.460> on

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
works very well I would have done it on

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.550 
works very well I would have done it on
the<00:05:44.640> other<00:05:44.760> side<00:05:45.140> because<00:05:46.140> it<00:05:46.230> makes<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.470> little

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
the other side because it makes a little

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.240 
the other side because it makes a little
bit<00:05:46.770> difficult<00:05:46.950> to<00:05:47.250> take<00:05:47.490> this<00:05:47.700> cap<00:05:48.270> off<00:05:49.250> but
