00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.089 
I guess a couple other things I can
mention<00:05:46.139> real<00:05:46.380> quick<00:05:46.530> before<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.740> go<00:05:46.919> actually

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
mention real quick before I go actually

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.370 
mention real quick before I go actually
at<00:05:47.310> least<00:05:47.599> give<00:05:48.599> you<00:05:48.630> your<00:05:48.810> money's<00:05:49.050> worth<00:05:49.080> out

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
at least give you your money's worth out

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.089 
at least give you your money's worth out
of<00:05:49.410> it<00:05:49.590> right<00:05:49.710> since<00:05:50.550> I<00:05:50.729> was<00:05:50.880> free<00:05:51.800> the<00:05:52.800> strap

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
of it right since I was free the strap

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.580 
of it right since I was free the strap
on<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.550> turnstile<00:05:53.970> five<00:05:54.349> murder<00:05:55.349> whole

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
on the turnstile five murder whole

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.430 
on the turnstile five murder whole
turnstile<00:05:56.039> line<00:05:56.220> rather<00:05:56.460> I<00:05:57.020> just<00:05:58.020> want<00:05:58.349> to

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
turnstile line rather I just want to

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.689 
turnstile line rather I just want to
mention<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.770> strap<00:05:58.979> because<00:05:59.190> I've<00:05:59.490> never

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
mention the strap because I've never

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.600 
mention the strap because I've never
been<00:05:59.880> a<00:05:59.909> fan<00:06:00.240> of<00:06:00.270> sling<00:06:00.750> bags<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.400> since<00:06:02.400> I've

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
been a fan of sling bags and since I've

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.790 
been a fan of sling bags and since I've
gotten<00:06:02.970> this<00:06:03.120> sling<00:06:03.419> bag<00:06:03.630> I've<00:06:03.930> realized<00:06:04.500> why

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
gotten this sling bag I've realized why

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.219 
gotten this sling bag I've realized why
I<00:06:04.830> was<00:06:05.190> never<00:06:05.370> a<00:06:05.490> fan<00:06:05.789> of<00:06:05.940> them<00:06:06.060> I<00:06:06.240> think<00:06:06.870> that

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
I was never a fan of them I think that

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.760 
I was never a fan of them I think that
the<00:06:07.349> strap<00:06:07.800> systems<00:06:08.760> on<00:06:09.229> the<00:06:10.229> other<00:06:10.260> sling

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
the strap systems on the other sling

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.159 
the strap systems on the other sling
bags<00:06:10.979> that<00:06:11.159> I've<00:06:11.280> owned<00:06:11.690> was<00:06:12.690> the<00:06:12.840> reason<00:06:13.110> I

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
bags that I've owned was the reason I

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.950 
bags that I've owned was the reason I
didn't<00:06:13.320> like<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.590> sling<00:06:13.830> bag

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
didn't like the sling bag

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.040 
didn't like the sling bag
and<00:06:15.590> something<00:06:15.979> as<00:06:16.100> simple<00:06:16.340> as<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:17.630> tapered

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
and something as simple as the tapered

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.100 
and something as simple as the tapered
design<00:06:18.199> of<00:06:18.919> the<00:06:19.130> strap<00:06:19.600> seems<00:06:20.600> to<00:06:20.810> have<00:06:20.930> made

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
design of the strap seems to have made

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.279 
design of the strap seems to have made
all<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:21.530> difference<00:06:21.830> in<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.250> world<00:06:22.430> I<00:06:22.699> don't

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
all the difference in the world I don't

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.779 
all the difference in the world I don't
know<00:06:24.289> why<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.650> taper<00:06:25.100> makes<00:06:25.340> that<00:06:25.460> much<00:06:25.580> of<00:06:25.729> a

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
know why the taper makes that much of a

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:26.950 
know why the taper makes that much of a
difference<00:06:26.090> it<00:06:26.240> makes<00:06:26.419> it<00:06:26.600> fit<00:06:26.810> better

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
difference it makes it fit better

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.870 
difference it makes it fit better
obviously<00:06:27.620> and<00:06:27.830> that<00:06:27.979> must<00:06:28.220> just<00:06:28.430> be<00:06:28.460> what<00:06:28.789> it

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
obviously and that must just be what it

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.400 
obviously and that must just be what it
was<00:06:29.060> for<00:06:29.419> me<00:06:29.509> it<00:06:29.539> was<00:06:29.720> just<00:06:29.870> something<00:06:30.169> as

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
was for me it was just something as

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.790 
was for me it was just something as
simple<00:06:30.620> as<00:06:31.180> paying<00:06:32.180> attention<00:06:32.720> to<00:06:32.960> the

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
simple as paying attention to the

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.499 
simple as paying attention to the
ergonomics<00:06:34.520> and<00:06:34.910> I<00:06:35.810> guess<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:37.389> anatomy<00:06:38.389> and

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:38.509 
ergonomics and I guess the anatomy and

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.240 
ergonomics and I guess the anatomy and
physiology<00:06:38.630> of<00:06:39.199> people<00:06:39.650> you<00:06:39.770> know<00:06:39.860> it<00:06:40.070> makes

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
physiology of people you know it makes

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.590 
physiology of people you know it makes
more<00:06:40.490> sense<00:06:40.729> to<00:06:40.789> have<00:06:40.970> it<00:06:41.030> wider<00:06:41.300> at<00:06:41.479> the<00:06:41.539> top

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
more sense to have it wider at the top

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.200 
more sense to have it wider at the top
your<00:06:42.110> shoulders<00:06:42.500> wide<00:06:42.740> and<00:06:42.880> then<00:06:43.880> once<00:06:44.060> it

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
your shoulders wide and then once it

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.520 
your shoulders wide and then once it
comes<00:06:44.240> across<00:06:44.600> your<00:06:44.810> back<00:06:44.930> you<00:06:45.139> don't<00:06:45.289> need<00:06:45.320> it

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
comes across your back you don't need it

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.170 
comes across your back you don't need it
to<00:06:45.590> be<00:06:45.710> wider<00:06:45.919> and<00:06:46.250> I<00:06:46.280> guess<00:06:46.430> it<00:06:46.550> just<00:06:46.729> rests

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
to be wider and I guess it just rests

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.249 
to be wider and I guess it just rests
easier<00:06:47.660> that<00:06:47.870> way

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
easier that way

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.670 
easier that way
I<00:06:49.210> don't<00:06:50.210> know<00:06:50.270> maybe<00:06:50.479> it's<00:06:50.690> just<00:06:50.750> me<00:06:51.050> but<00:06:51.320> I'm

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
I don't know maybe it's just me but I'm

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.110 
I don't know maybe it's just me but I'm
telling<00:06:52.009> you<00:06:52.070> that's<00:06:52.220> kind<00:06:52.520> of<00:06:52.610> what<00:06:52.789> has<00:06:52.910> sold

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
telling you that's kind of what has sold

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.050 
telling you that's kind of what has sold

me on the sling bags from think-tank is
