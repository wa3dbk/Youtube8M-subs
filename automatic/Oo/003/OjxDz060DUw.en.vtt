00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.780
 when I arrived I did not think that 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.310
 I had questions a lot 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.260
 of questions it went well in high school 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.450
 with families with family and 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.520
 everything but a real one now that I 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.070
 think it's a perfect year it's more 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:38.230
 from what I heard I did everything 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.690
 with my family I 'm happy you 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.000
 Graves of the animated after a stay 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.600
 these days I was writing but 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.940
 I was doing a little assessment I really 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.190
 many things have changed in better 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.239
 I think my relationship with my family 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.170
 then all the friends I could do 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.190
 everything I had the opportunity 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.720
 learn 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.910
 it was wrong that it went very well 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.299
 I had I signed wonderful I 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.070
 find it was too good general it was 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.979
 really a very good year the most 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 beautiful my life I would say that an experience 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.539
 a lot marked me I landed there 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.340
 I was young Italian the new is 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.539
 so that was a bit difficult at 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.329
 beginning mostly because I had a 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.579
 different schedule we did not have 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.200
 do not necessarily share every 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.659
 time 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.579
 I did not know them too much it was 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.340
 difficult for me because I was not 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.020
 I was shy it's not how to talk 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.990
 with people I'm just trying to 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.390
 work it's all in my opinion it takes 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.039
 to talk, you have to go to others 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.380
 it was easy but my problem 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.060
 here it was home that I missed 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.659
 it was my family miss and my friends 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.549
 I could not do anything it was hard after 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.630
 when I come here everyone was talking 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.060
 with me they tried to put me 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.640
 in his group also has in his circle 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.020
 of socialization and had done very well 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.020
 spent I love my school 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.250
 still in the beginning I did not understand anything I 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.940
 think that many slept in low philosophy 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.650
 good but after three months I 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.830
 started to understand and I fell 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.160
 in a great class and right now 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.390
 I found a lot of friends so no 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.569
 so it was great 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.709
 at first not right that I remember 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.840
 the first checks of the oh wires 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.640
 it was I dropped a little differently 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.100
 compared to others but after 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.100
 I immediately started doing the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.920
 controls like the others and teacher 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.130
 at the same explained but correct the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.450
 grammatical mistakes but no it was 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.280
 it was really great bages and 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.550
 I had a lot of very good teachers in 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.450
 French not that but finally the thing is 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.490
 the typical profile 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.580
 he speaks for two hours and then the 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.220
 students take notes and where we sleep 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.130
 and it's a bit like that he was very 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.770
 curious about my country to start this 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.880
 past high schools where are you sick 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.459
 what do we see during the short 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.769
 where they asked a lot of things 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.070
 in monte they even explained the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.680
 French culture too yeah in 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.900
 interaction I was French teacher 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.100
 love very much pained during 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.540
 all year long I sometimes saw gold 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.510
 of body when I do not necessarily 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.540
 understood a method for was 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.220
 essential I do not want to spend a year 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.690
 school in his school and after the end 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.269
 to perfect the sections it does not find 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.730
 no if I was the school year I 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:56.450
 have to finish me well and make a whole 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.340
 very specific experience I am not united 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.860
 it is now to revise everything I had 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.060
 same time afraid of them is not born not 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.750
 to have towards their families it's my 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.239
 revisions 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.350
 I had yesterday I went to see the 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.030
 results 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.410
 it was stand up I was well stressed 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.299
 because here in France there is a lot 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.010
 a lot of pressure by 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.799
 report to the ferry and even if it was not necessary 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.950
 that I learn it I took it 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.990
 it was hard I did not sleep much 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.500
 but well I thought for two 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.190
 weeks then 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.740
 I passed the tests and here I was 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.480
 succeeded as long as it was good months ago have 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:37.660
 very well so 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:39.610
 but I was very happy with the 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.800
 volunteers from 6 and if I had any 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.680
 problems all of us I spend often 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.040
 but if i had gta and talk with them 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.150
 and it was they were helped a lot and I 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.510
 think they are all the time for 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.730
 we knew that if there was if 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:01.780
 I had a problem I could always 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:04.810
 actually the facts it was in the middle of 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.230
 my year here so it was the short 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.320
 I was not too much I do not feel well and 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.990
 I was a little depressing and very low 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.970
 but after that my never explained everything 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.550
 it's all not good all is well 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.800
 just now it's hard but after that 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.940
 is going to be good and it's still there I 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.400
 find it super explain us if we 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.449
 needed to talk 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.699
 he was always there I was in 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.430
 next day aquitaine and we go by 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.800
 example in bordeaux where we went to the lighthouse 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.240
 and corrosion and that was work 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.189
 are good because they are 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.199
 volunteers who do them just for 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:47.059
 we and it was really good 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.939
 organized it was the activities it's 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.990
 great so I really thank them I 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:53.389
 am super happy 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.490
 is that they incur travel with the 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.680
 fss did like that it's for the whole 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.210
 life is huge it's more than the year 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.849
 scholastic it's several years of 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.319
 our life 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:06.379
 I feel that we are brave 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:10.089
 come here and that's the things really 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:12.830
 different is like heaven and earth 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:15.620
 good it's good and it's good for 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:21.499
 have contacted them because they have 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:24.199
 tells us all who so that represents the 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:26.089
 opportunity to work for 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.099
 boundaries and understand who is even 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:29.899
 if there are different cultures of 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.759
 stuff like that is not but we are 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:34.999
 all humans what's that it's very 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:43.300
 cliche but it's true I think it 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:43.300
 My skiing has sacred friendships 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.270
 how to express myself no I am you 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:47.899
 think it's great as a trick and 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.969
 It works very well 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:52.370
 she does that represents for me 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.300
 really the links between the countries that 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:07:01.650
 told us of his homework 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:06.210
 it is a very high opinion vernet it is 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:07.680
 completely changed my look if there 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.270
 in a normal fear that's difficult 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.800
 but it's normal after it hurts 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.930
 it's growing up hurts but where at 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.780
 after a while we feel worse after 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:23.450
 it says you recognize it's good it's 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.450
 open to your mind asks
