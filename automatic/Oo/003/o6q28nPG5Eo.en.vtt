00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 therefore, to buy credits 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 there is one of su fifa ultimate team with the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.720
 dot com link description hello to everyone 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.330
 the boys those movies and gaming today 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.490
 I present new warnings quici ultimate 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.710
 team well if today I present you a package 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.130
 opening and packages have arrived 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.400
 special 35,000 credits so I will go 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.380
 immediately in April a couple but remember to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.449
 be beautiful ps under the video and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.150
 especially of east of the channel for 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.189
 future video tutorials then start 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.180
 immediately to open my first package 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.829
 from 35,000 credits 35 thousand are many but 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.739
 I hope to find at least one 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.020
 player in the week or at least one 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.170
 worthy player and hares 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.230
 a package found gervinho but the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.160
 rest we say that we celebrate that it does 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 hell 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.340
 maybe they dreamed a little contra contraal 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.930
 a little bit el sharaawy maybe a little something 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.359
 I recommend these here 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.619
 healing cost a lot on the thousand 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.700
 credits and also and also modifiers of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.670
 role 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.590
 for the rest we say that it makes a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 little to shit as a package perhaps 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.189
 I can recover 15 thousand 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.799
 nice the second package hoping to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.540
 finding myself was not at least an 80 of networks 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.570
 please at least 82 to de bruyn do 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.670
 crap step but these packages do 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.409
 really sucks two packages okay 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.240
 I've never had any luck in packages 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.210
 but never really 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.890
 sometimes cold but I already know that not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.780
 will find nothing so I don't even know 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.360
 because it takes them that way though 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 would make sense if this package there 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.460
 was a fort that there is no farewell cabbage 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.299
 but an 84 rating has at least a 83 that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.530
 a nice bar is worth a little at home but 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:08.489
 no way there was a package in which 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 has recovered 35,000 credits perhaps 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.280
 in this maybe this the last one 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.489
 the last flourishing lady but how do you do a 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.180
 give me violent ie I spend 35,000 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:25.250
 credits indeed spent 140 thousand cretin 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.950
 I took four and you give me lorente but god 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.019
 cabbage I guess he earned more at 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.010
 who earns more to sell who 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.190
 consumes you our players so you have 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.070
 seen packages packages in short 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.400
 of the previous 35,000 trial packages 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.040
 140,000 credits spent I don't have 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.310
 found nothing I had nothing more 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.280
 will manage to raise 40,000 of its own 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.870
 but maybe I can keep myself 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.299
 some contract that he needs to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.310
 network matches so if you have seen that i 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.010
 packages you will never find anything ever 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.220
 a fuck unless he doesn't have that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.170
 have a huge ass and nothing there 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.700
 remember it will be a nice I like the video 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.030
 servillo I liked it and I recommend it 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.500
 let me know what you found in 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.510
 packages which was the best 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.450
 package of all fifa you have 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.209
 found and we see you next video 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.370

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.900
 buying and selling on row 15 with the players 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.900
