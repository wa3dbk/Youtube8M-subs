00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
little moon shape dings but I'm going to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.590 
little moon shape dings but I'm going to
do<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:31.980> English<00:00:32.340> wheel<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:32.850> basically

put<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.370> my<00:00:38.520> voice<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.180> my<00:00:39.239> drill<00:00:39.660> press

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
put this in my voice and my drill press

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.510 
put this in my voice and my drill press
just<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> allow<00:00:42.149> me<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:43.190> balance<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.340> s

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
just going to allow me to balance it s

00:00:44.520 --> 00:02:10.699 
just going to allow me to balance it s
just<00:01:36.320> read<00:01:40.729> this

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.960 

so<00:02:11.709> now<00:02:12.400> it's<00:02:14.400> going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.459> be<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.580> matter<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.849> just

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
so now it's going to be a matter of just

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:33.199 
so now it's going to be a matter of just
placing<00:02:16.269> this<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.170> there<00:02:17.379> getting<00:02:18.250> some<00:02:18.549> tax

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.240 

the<00:02:34.209> best<00:02:34.420> thing<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.900> going<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:36.069> be<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
the best thing that is going to be the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.270 
the best thing that is going to be the
tacit<00:02:36.700> where<00:02:37.260> wants<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.410> contact<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:39.010> steel

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
tacit where wants to contact the steel

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.979 
tacit where wants to contact the steel
flush<00:02:39.790> lee<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:41.230> way<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:43.060> get<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.329> nice<00:02:43.569> strong

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
flush lee this way you get a nice strong

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.229 
flush lee this way you get a nice strong
tack<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.680> we<00:02:45.610> can<00:02:45.790> work<00:02:45.970> along<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.840> edge<00:02:48.239> to

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
tack and we can work along the edge to

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.289 
tack and we can work along the edge to
get<00:02:49.480> exactly<00:02:51.959> where<00:02:52.959> we<00:02:53.140> need<00:02:53.849> we<00:02:54.849> can<00:02:54.970> work<00:02:55.090> on

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
get exactly where we need we can work on

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.559 
get exactly where we need we can work on
the<00:02:55.420> edge<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:56.379> get<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:57.190> base<00:02:57.700> up<00:02:58.150> into<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
the edge to get the base up into the
