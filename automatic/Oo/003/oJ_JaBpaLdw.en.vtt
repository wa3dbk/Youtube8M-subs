week<00:00:13.080> 12<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.650> like<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> new<00:00:14.519> england<00:00:14.670> patriots

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
week 12 I like the new england patriots

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.529 
week 12 I like the new england patriots
plus<00:00:15.900> two<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> half<00:00:16.529> at<00:00:16.740> Miami<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.430> don't<00:00:18.210> see

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
plus two and a half at Miami I don't see

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
plus two and a half at Miami I don't see
a<00:00:18.570> situation<00:00:19.050> where<00:00:19.980> New<00:00:20.220> England<00:00:20.550> doesn't

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
a situation where New England doesn't

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.929 
a situation where New England doesn't
split<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.750> Miami<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.289> year<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
split with Miami this year I think the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.759 
split with Miami this year I think the
Patriots<00:00:24.660> are<00:00:24.900> way<00:00:25.109> better<00:00:25.260> team<00:00:25.590> than<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
Patriots are way better team than the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.050 
Patriots are way better team than the
dolphins<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.430> though<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> games<00:00:26.849> lean

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
dolphins and though the games lean

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.759 
dolphins and though the games lean
played<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.449> Miami<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> feeling<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
played in Miami I have a feeling that

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.290 
played in Miami I have a feeling that
Bill<00:00:28.980> Belichick<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> paths<00:00:29.910> will<00:00:30.179> have

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
Bill Belichick and the paths will have

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.609 
Bill Belichick and the paths will have
something<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.779> say<00:00:31.019> about<00:00:31.050> how<00:00:31.470> they

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
something to say about how they

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.889 
something to say about how they
performed<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.700> back<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.059> week<00:00:33.270> 3<00:00:33.600> against<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
performed it back in week 3 against the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.400 
performed it back in week 3 against the
Dolphins<00:00:34.380> remember<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> fins<00:00:35.640> 138<00:00:36.630> 210<00:00:37.110> or

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
Dolphins remember the fins 138 210 or

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
Dolphins remember the fins 138 210 or
something<00:00:37.829> ridiculous<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.969> just

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
something ridiculous like that I just

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
something ridiculous like that I just
don't<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> Patriots<00:00:40.290> taken<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
don't see the Patriots taken that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
don't see the Patriots taken that
lightly<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.520> win<00:00:41.730> easily<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.360> one

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
lightly and they win easily in this one

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.590 
lightly and they win easily in this one
I<00:00:42.750> also<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> San<00:00:44.070> Francisco<00:00:44.219> 49ers<00:00:44.600> plus

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
I also like the San Francisco 49ers plus

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.779 
I also like the San Francisco 49ers plus
12<00:00:45.899> at<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.110> Dallas<00:00:46.440> Cowboys<00:00:46.890> believe<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.700> or

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
12 at the Dallas Cowboys believe it or

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.340 
12 at the Dallas Cowboys believe it or
not<00:00:47.879> san<00:00:48.239> Francisco's<00:00:48.629> played<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.230> well

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
not san Francisco's played pretty well

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
not san Francisco's played pretty well
over<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> last<00:00:49.950> six<00:00:50.309> games<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.850> played<00:00:51.300> tight

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
over the last six games and played tight

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
over the last six games and played tight
with<00:00:51.719> some<00:00:51.870> good<00:00:51.989> teams<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:53.010> think

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
with some good teams I don't think

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.680 
with some good teams I don't think
Dallas<00:00:53.550> completely<00:00:53.969> has<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> together<00:00:54.360> this

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
Dallas completely has it together this

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
Dallas completely has it together this
week<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.739> play<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> tight<00:00:56.219> one

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
week so I think they play a tight one

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.700 
week so I think they play a tight one
with<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> Niners<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> Carolina

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
with the Niners I like the Carolina

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.459 
with the Niners I like the Carolina
Panthers<00:00:59.250> plus<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.420> half<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.840> atlanta

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
Panthers plus one and a half at atlanta

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.290 
Panthers plus one and a half at atlanta
i<00:01:01.649> think<00:01:01.890> carolina<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> better

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
i think carolina is one of the better

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.759 
i think carolina is one of the better
teams<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.750> football<00:01:03.930> when<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.500> run<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
teams in football when they can run the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.789 
teams in football when they can run the
ball<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.220> though<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.210> Falcons<00:01:06.799> defensive

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
ball and though the Falcons defensive

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
ball and though the Falcons defensive
front<00:01:08.070> has<00:01:08.280> played<00:01:08.549> better<00:01:08.760> against<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> run

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
front has played better against the run

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.539 
front has played better against the run
I<00:01:09.689> don't<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.680> great<00:01:10.890> run<00:01:11.130> defense

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I don't think they are great run defense

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.000 
I don't think they are great run defense
and<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.790> Carolina<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.689> run<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.290> mean

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and I know Carolina can run there I mean

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.920 
and I know Carolina can run there I mean
Carolina<00:01:14.430> wins<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.909> game<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.330> Atlanta<00:01:15.780> as

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
Carolina wins that game in Atlanta as

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
Carolina wins that game in Atlanta as
the<00:01:15.990> Falcons<00:01:16.590> take<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> couple<00:01:17.100> step<00:01:17.369> backs

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the Falcons take a couple step backs

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
the Falcons take a couple step backs
their<00:01:18.270> amazing<00:01:18.689> season<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
their amazing season I like the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
their amazing season I like the
Minnesota<00:01:20.700> Vikings<00:01:20.759> plus<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.810> half<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
Minnesota Vikings plus one and a half to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
Minnesota Vikings plus one and a half to
absolutely<00:01:23.250> give<00:01:23.460> everything<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.360> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
absolutely give everything they can to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
absolutely give everything they can to
Adrian<00:01:25.170> Peterson<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.860> him<00:01:26.040> wrong<00:01:26.280> all

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Adrian Peterson and have him wrong all

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640 
Adrian Peterson and have him wrong all
over<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> Jacksonville<00:01:27.509> Jaguars<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:28.229> don't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
over the Jacksonville Jaguars I don't

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.170 
over the Jacksonville Jaguars I don't
think<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> Jaguars<00:01:29.280> defensive<00:01:29.790> front<00:01:30.030> can

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
think the Jaguars defensive front can

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.359 
think the Jaguars defensive front can
stop<00:01:30.390> Adrian<00:01:30.659> Peterson<00:01:31.320> not<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.979> anybody

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
stop Adrian Peterson not that anybody

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
stop Adrian Peterson not that anybody
can<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.150> Adrian<00:01:33.509> Peterson<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.140> too

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
can but Adrian Peterson is way too

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230 
can but Adrian Peterson is way too

like the New York Giants minus three at

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.280 
like the New York Giants minus three at
Arizona<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> Cardinals<00:01:43.200> are

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
Arizona I know the Cardinals are

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.499 
Arizona I know the Cardinals are
undefeated<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.009> home<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.460> season<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
undefeated at home this season but the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
undefeated at home this season but the
Giants<00:01:45.960> are<00:01:46.079> too<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.920> Arizona<00:01:47.310> Arizona

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
Giants are too good for Arizona Arizona

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
Giants are too good for Arizona Arizona
will<00:01:48.479> play<00:01:48.630> tight<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> end<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.009> will

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
will play tight but in the end it will

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.380 
will play tight but in the end it will
be<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> giants<00:01:50.640> winning<00:01:50.820> by<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> touchdown

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
be the giants winning by a touchdown

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.560 
be the giants winning by a touchdown
maybe<00:01:52.110> ten<00:01:52.409> points<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.119> New<00:01:54.299> York

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
maybe ten points I think that New York

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.850 
maybe ten points I think that New York
is<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> better<00:01:55.229> teams<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.649> football

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
is one of the better teams in football

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.789 
is one of the better teams in football
and<00:01:56.310> Arizona<00:01:56.939> has<00:01:57.119> lost<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.810> three<00:01:58.320> pretty

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and Arizona has lost to all three pretty

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.499 
and Arizona has lost to all three pretty
good<00:01:59.130> teams<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.579> they've<00:01:59.790> played<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.270> year

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
good teams that they've played this year

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.230 
good teams that they've played this year
I<00:02:01.009> expect<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> Giants<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.549> win<00:02:02.579> again<00:02:02.969> and
