spawn<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.959> think<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.619> said<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.830> right

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
spawn so I think I said that right

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.030 
spawn so I think I said that right
but<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.790> the<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.330> 14<00:00:18.840> w29<00:00:19.470> eh<00:00:19.590> that's

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
but it's the in the 14 w29 eh that's

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.680 
but it's the in the 14 w29 eh that's
what<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.280> using<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> moment<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.570> I'm

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
what I'm using at the moment but I'm

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.610 
what I'm using at the moment but I'm
pretty<00:00:21.870> sure<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.140> works

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
pretty sure it works

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.400 
pretty sure it works
since<00:00:23.460> water<00:00:24.390> temples<00:00:24.840> came<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.200> I<00:00:25.230> don't

side of the island looking out towards
Sun<00:01:22.409> set<00:01:22.859> let<00:01:23.159> me<00:01:23.219> just<00:01:23.429> see<00:01:23.789> that's<00:01:24.179> along<00:01:24.569> the

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
Sun set let me just see that's along the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.660 
Sun set let me just see that's along the
x-axis<00:01:25.679> there<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:27.649> if<00:01:28.649> we<00:01:28.770> go<00:01:28.920> over<00:01:29.249> this<00:01:29.399> way

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
x-axis there and if we go over this way

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.989 
x-axis there and if we go over this way
into<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.539> -<00:01:31.249> x-axis<00:01:32.249> it's<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
into the - x-axis it's just on the

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:35.419 
into the - x-axis it's just on the
opposite<00:01:33.389> side<00:01:33.599> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> island<00:01:33.959> so<00:01:34.429> there's

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
opposite side of the island so there's

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.099 
opposite side of the island so there's
that<00:01:35.609> side<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:36.389> there's<00:01:36.719> this<00:01:37.409> side

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
that side and then there's this side

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.519 
that side and then there's this side
come<00:01:40.109> on

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:40.529 
come on

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:43.730 
come on
spawn<00:01:41.099> in<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.789> it<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.349> a<00:01:43.439> little
