00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
such as and zodiac and zou now the root

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.010 
such as and zodiac and zou now the root
of<00:02:46.430> these<00:02:46.550> words<00:02:46.760> either<00:02:46.940> comes<00:02:47.240> from<00:02:47.570> this

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
of these words either comes from this

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.290 
of these words either comes from this
Greek<00:02:48.380> word<00:02:48.410> or<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.310> Greek<00:02:49.670> word<00:02:49.700> depending

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
Greek word or that Greek word depending

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.760 
Greek word or that Greek word depending
on<00:02:50.390> where<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.600> look<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.960> don't<00:02:51.260> speak<00:02:51.530> Greek

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
on where you look I don't speak Greek

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.080 
on where you look I don't speak Greek
but<00:02:52.190> I'm<00:02:52.280> gonna<00:02:52.370> guess<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.910> is

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
but I'm gonna guess that this is

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.210 
but I'm gonna guess that this is
pronounced<00:02:53.690> though<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.590> pronounced

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
pronounced though and this is pronounced

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.220 
pronounced though and this is pronounced
Zoe<00:02:55.580> on<00:02:55.820> so<00:02:56.120> we're<00:02:56.300> near<00:02:56.480> pronouncing<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:57.050> word

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
Zoe on so we're near pronouncing a word

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.720 
Zoe on so we're near pronouncing a word
that<00:02:57.530> starts<00:02:57.650> with<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.100> root<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.550> seems

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
that starts with this root it seems

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.250 
that starts with this root it seems
logical<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.240> me<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.660> would<00:02:59.780> start<00:03:00.110> with

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
logical to me you would start with

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.560 
logical to me you would start with
though<00:03:00.950> now<00:03:01.430> Zoe<00:03:01.640> notic<00:03:02.150> seems<00:03:02.390> like<00:03:02.540> a

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
though now Zoe notic seems like a

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.110 
though now Zoe notic seems like a
logical<00:03:02.960> pronunciation<00:03:03.710> but<00:03:04.010> zoonosis<00:03:04.580> is

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
logical pronunciation but zoonosis is

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.940 
logical pronunciation but zoonosis is
just<00:03:05.300> not<00:03:05.420> intuitive<00:03:05.900> for<00:03:06.050> me<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.320> did<00:03:06.560> look<00:03:06.800> in

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
just not intuitive for me I did look in

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.830 
just not intuitive for me I did look in
several<00:03:07.340> dictionaries<00:03:07.520> though<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.330> zoonosis

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
several dictionaries though and zoonosis

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.150 
several dictionaries though and zoonosis
appears<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.650> be<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.890> preferred

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
appears to be the preferred

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.920 
appears to be the preferred
