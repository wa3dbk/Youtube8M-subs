 brought that is that parking bug 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 but a comrade an unlisted comrade 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.640
 That's when it ended up helping me. 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 even the powerful punishment that is 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 Playing with us is more obese. 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 he taught me the scheme and he did 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.460
 a scheme that in this video that the book 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.800
 infinite you will need a friend 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.710
 in a car you will simply have 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.719
 who organize your car and streamline it 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.219
 to leave it straight, it's on you 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.879
 can practically walk on the map 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.500
 all 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.780
 If you have coordination , you can do this. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.200
 be on the side of the Andes store if you 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 have coordination you can walk the map 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.130
 So it's a cool place then. 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.930
 very interesting how can you 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.180
 keep up there is no water there is no cut 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.680
 in this video as you see the buganda 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.530
 seeing these little tremors that are giving 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 there is simply business won and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 from there when the car stabilizes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.530
 you will simply be able to stay and 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.240
 finally falling if you want to stay half 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.119
 time you stay if you want to stay five 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.150
 minutes you stay since you turn the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.180
 Camera up and mano your two 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.240
 always putting the car to the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.340
 front as if he had walked there 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.409
 forward instead of fall as it is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 Beautiful down so will not you 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.189
 stabilize the car in which it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.960
 I was going forward as if you were 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.460
 would have been accelerating and lethal 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.290
 You have to keep playing with the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.420
 a little bit there was a side 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.490
 to the other not to drop directly 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 that if not really it will leave the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.329
 and then you'll be able to fall as 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.950
 You see the video is a bit 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.290
 more than two minutes had the introduction 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.019
 there should be based on a minute and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.069
 half and limbo already then it's too fucking 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.500
 wellington the time that 's what i 'm going 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.060
 leaving the place is because I really chose 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.450
 out of the car and hence the 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.650
 passenger leaving the driver 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.049
 automatically is also disabled from the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.159
 milk and we will basically fall 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.989
 people are 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.640
 as you can see we have already passed 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.370
 near money chan 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.500
 We already passed the strip club and there 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.579
 you see that we're leaving're 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.140
 leaving though you should be 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.230
 controlling the car remembering that he 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.329
 You are doing the milk and I'm 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.400
 passenger, but it does not matter because 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.700
 everyone sees that the same camera is not 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.310
 those screams you need to give 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.690
 from a friend to file it you see in the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.760
 your camera it is not following 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.709
 It's happening to me to him. 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.989
 as you can see coming almost three 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.060
 minutes there the bulletin does not stop me too 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.900
 I'm taking my camera and just to be able to 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.909
 give a look at the footprint but mine is very 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.620
 crazy if you want to stay in cell 10 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.090
 minutes is at your discretion five 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.060
 minutes it was what I said the time that 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.190
 you think it necessary then he spoke 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.440
 that he discovered is the powerful and 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.480
 I do not know how many paul 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.310
 I did not know if it was him. 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.280
 really does he come some gringo channel 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.319
 It was not me, I'm the first brazilian channel 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.239
 the world to bring it in if you do not 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.889
 was he must have seen in the channel of some 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.109
 gringo but even so from now on 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.599
 Thank you there, powerful for you. 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.250
 past and shout from a limbo and 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.049
 infinite that's very cool as well 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.940
 interesting different from many things 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.949
 that we have already seen there has already fallen in limbo 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.900
 for a few minutes but it has always been 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.760
 in those catapults but it was nothing that 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.129
 I think I want what goes 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.359
 doing a trick itself to 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.310
 that this happened 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.440
 With this, you can always do the time. 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.690
 Whatever time you want 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.099
 since you already liked sydney leave 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.900
 The cell phone you liked the most is the favorite. 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.519
 in the channel dispute over different 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.989
 company fields more more videos 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.549
 As you saw there I got out of the car. 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.599
 automatically the up car isport 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.650
 of my head 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.060
 And there it is now you do it again will not have 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.799
 I just listened to the girl for you. 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.449
 Thank you very much, God bless. 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.299
 until the next video your girls 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:19.259
 tasty, fat and seedlings 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.259
 I was
