00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
I'm going to take two pieces and stand

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.910 
I'm going to take two pieces and stand
them<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:24.020> I'm<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.439> two<00:01:25.680> more

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920

pieces<00:01:32.810> cut<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:35.090> go<00:01:36.090> inside

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.720 

two<00:01:42.630> more<00:01:42.960> pieces<00:01:43.640> make<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.060> side<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.570> the

two more pieces make up this side of the
puzzle

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:08.889 

screaming<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:03.200> two<00:02:04.200> more<00:02:04.350> pieces

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.430 

finish<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.140> side<00:02:11.690> this<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.870> where<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.110> put<00:02:13.320> in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
finish this side this is where we put in

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.250 
finish this side this is where we put in
our<00:02:13.530> marble<00:02:14.390> make<00:02:15.390> sure<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.690> hold<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.050> pieces

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
our marble make sure you hold the pieces

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.750 
our marble make sure you hold the pieces
together<00:02:16.590> because<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.459> marble

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
together because just the marble

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.729 
together because just the marble
bouncing<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.360> there<00:02:18.540> will<00:02:18.720> sometimes<00:02:19.470> bounce

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
bouncing in there will sometimes bounce

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:26.240 
bouncing in there will sometimes bounce
the<00:02:19.920> pieces<00:02:20.220> apart<00:02:23.390> facedown<00:02:24.890> goes<00:02:25.890> our<00:02:26.040> last

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
the pieces apart facedown goes our last

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.090 
the pieces apart facedown goes our last
clone<00:02:27.030> piece<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.489> slides<00:02:29.760> into<00:02:30.000> position

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
clone piece and it slides into position

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.550 
clone piece and it slides into position
because<00:02:32.100> where<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.430> gets<00:02:32.580> scary<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.440> going<00:02:34.440> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
because where it gets scary I'm going to
