knowing how designers think I thought

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.430 
knowing how designers think I thought

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
maybe I'm not the right person for this

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729

designers you know there's definitely an

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.429 
designers you know there's definitely an
element<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.539> artistry<00:01:57.539> and<00:01:57.689> what<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
element of artistry and what we do and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.370 
element of artistry and what we do and
being<00:01:59.250> artists<00:01:59.789> there<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> certain<00:02:00.630> part<00:02:01.259> of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
being artists there is a certain part of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.980 
being artists there is a certain part of
you<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:01.590> put<00:02:02.039> out<00:02:02.219> there<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.299> learning

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you that's put out there but learning

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
you that's put out there but learning
how<00:02:04.109> to<00:02:04.200> take<00:02:04.500> critiques<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.189> really

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
how to take critiques is really

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.399 
how to take critiques is really
important<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.509> car<00:02:06.810> design<00:02:07.170> or

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
important I think in car design or

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.770 
important I think in car design or
probably<00:02:07.740> almost<00:02:07.920> any<00:02:08.250> form<00:02:08.549> of<00:02:08.700> design<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
probably almost any form of design is

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.259 
probably almost any form of design is
taking<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.619> trying<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> put<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.459> spin<00:02:11.880> on<00:02:11.910> it

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
taking it trying to put your spin on it

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.930 
taking it trying to put your spin on it
and<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.170> still<00:02:13.560> keep<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.459> be<00:02:14.609> kind<00:02:14.820> of

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and then and still keep it to be kind of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.270 
and then and still keep it to be kind of
what<00:02:15.120> your<00:02:15.299> statement<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:17.130> like

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
what your statement is it's like

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.819 
what your statement is it's like
adapting<00:02:17.880> any<00:02:18.239> piece<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> artwork<00:02:19.019> but<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.530> do

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
adapting any piece of artwork but you do

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.670 
adapting any piece of artwork but you do
get<00:02:20.130> some<00:02:20.459> input<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.480> sometimes<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.530> can

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
get some input on it so sometimes it can

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.229 
get some input on it so sometimes it can
knock<00:02:22.859> your<00:02:23.070> ego<00:02:23.310> down<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.549> little<00:02:23.820> bit<00:02:24.030> but

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
knock your ego down a little bit but

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.449 
knock your ego down a little bit but
it's<00:02:24.390> healthy<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.959> long<00:02:25.230> run<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:26.190> most

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
it's healthy in the long run like most

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.430 
it's healthy in the long run like most
designers<00:02:26.940> will<00:02:27.299> design<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.720> thing<00:02:28.019> as<00:02:28.230> it's

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
designers will design the thing as it's

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.020 
designers will design the thing as it's
being<00:02:29.030> trailered<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.449> door

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
being trailered out the door

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.070 
being trailered out the door
we'll<00:02:31.510> never<00:02:31.750> stop<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.530> fact<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:34.450> didn't<00:02:34.900> get

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
we'll never stop in fact we didn't get

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.860 
we'll never stop in fact we didn't get
the<00:02:35.350> gas<00:02:35.590> cap<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.520> car<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:37.090> sort<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.720> like

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
the gas cap on the car of sort of like

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.130 
the gas cap on the car of sort of like
the<00:02:38.050> icon<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:39.700> original<00:02:40.209> car<00:02:40.480> had<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> very

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
the icon the original car had a very

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.350 
the icon the original car had a very
distinct<00:02:41.680> gas<00:02:41.950> cap<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.940> was<00:02:43.120> something

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
distinct gas cap and that was something

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.210 
distinct gas cap and that was something
that<00:02:43.569> probably<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.290> only<00:02:44.470> thing<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.069> really

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
that probably the only thing that really

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.710 
that probably the only thing that really
kind<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.550> fell<00:02:45.760> off<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.060> table<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.420> actually

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
kind of fell off the table we actually

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.300 
kind of fell off the table we actually
ran<00:02:46.930> out<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> time<00:02:47.410> we<00:02:47.739> couldn't<00:02:48.040> get<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.190> we

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
ran out of time we couldn't get it we

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.920 
ran out of time we couldn't get it we
had<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.520> few<00:02:48.910> directions<00:02:49.239> we<00:02:49.569> weren't<00:02:49.780> real

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
had a few directions we weren't real

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.559 
had a few directions we weren't real
happy<00:02:49.959> with<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:50.830> we<00:02:51.610> just<00:02:51.760> let<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.180> one<00:02:52.360> go

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
happy with it so we just let that one go

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.420 
happy with it so we just let that one go
figured<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.350> know<00:02:53.440> what<00:02:53.590> if<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.130> thing<00:02:54.310> goes

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
figured you know what if this thing goes

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.979 
figured you know what if this thing goes
in<00:02:54.610> production<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.120> might<00:02:55.300> get<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.480> chance<00:02:55.780> at

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
in production we might get a chance at

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.170 
in production we might get a chance at
doing<00:02:56.140> that

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.300 

well<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.930> was<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.079> photo<00:03:02.379> shoot<00:03:02.709> or<00:03:02.829> something

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
well it was a photo shoot or something

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.119 
well it was a photo shoot or something
and<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.519> saw<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.819> car<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.659> I<00:03:05.379> saw<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.650> stance

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
and I saw the car and I saw the stance

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.130 
and I saw the car and I saw the stance
which<00:03:06.459> I<00:03:06.579> thought<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.359> most<00:03:07.599> important

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
which I thought is the most important

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.619 
which I thought is the most important
thing<00:03:08.290> in<00:03:08.439> in<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.829> in<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.280> well<00:03:09.730> done<00:03:09.969> muscle<00:03:10.420> car

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
thing in in a in a well done muscle car

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.020 
thing in in a in a well done muscle car
and<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.019> saw<00:03:11.409> that<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:12.099> thought<00:03:12.340> man<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.879> is

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and I saw that and I thought man that is

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.229 
and I saw that and I thought man that is
that's<00:03:13.689> pretty<00:03:14.019> hot<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:15.099> know<00:03:15.219> and<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.969> line

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
that's pretty hot you know and the line

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.020 
that's pretty hot you know and the line
work<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.889> know<00:03:18.010> it's<00:03:18.370> different<00:03:18.909> when<00:03:19.000> you're

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
work you know it's different when you're

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.970 
work you know it's different when you're
seeing<00:03:19.420> something<00:03:19.689> in<00:03:19.930> clay<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.590> you're<00:03:20.739> in<00:03:20.889> a

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
seeing something in clay and you're in a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.670 
seeing something in clay and you're in a
confined<00:03:21.459> studio<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:23.049> can't<00:03:23.290> take<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
confined studio and you can't take it

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.580 
confined studio and you can't take it
out<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:23.829> gloss<00:03:24.250> paint<00:03:24.579> because<00:03:25.139> it's<00:03:26.139> all<00:03:26.349> top

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
out and gloss paint because it's all top

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.679 
out and gloss paint because it's all top
secret<00:03:26.650> stuff<00:03:27.219> so<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.790> can't<00:03:28.060> even<00:03:28.180> see<00:03:28.510> your

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:28.689 
secret stuff so you can't even see your

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.270 
secret stuff so you can't even see your
product<00:03:29.139> on<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.349> road<00:03:29.500> until<00:03:29.620> it's<00:03:29.920> done

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
product on the road until it's done

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.270 
product on the road until it's done
painted<00:03:30.849> finished<00:03:31.269> out<00:03:31.870> there<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.469> when<00:03:33.250> I

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
painted finished out there and when I

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.159 
painted finished out there and when I
saw<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.579> outside<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.419> was<00:03:34.510> right<00:03:34.750> before<00:03:34.900> the

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
saw it outside it was right before the

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.319 
saw it outside it was right before the
show<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.500> thought<00:03:35.859> man<00:03:36.099> that<00:03:36.340> is<00:03:36.489> pretty<00:03:36.790> hot<00:03:37.030> it

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
show I thought man that is pretty hot it

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.259 
show I thought man that is pretty hot it
might<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.799> might<00:03:38.829> really<00:03:39.430> strike<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:39.879> chord

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
might it might really strike a chord
