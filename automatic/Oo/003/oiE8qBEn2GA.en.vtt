00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.750
 it impresses me what to say why 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.970
 I do not understand the pain although although I do not 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.440
 I can never finish it 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.360
 understand exactly what is happening 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.189
 because we'll pass you alone if you're 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.950
 situations are as non-transferable 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.750
 over bosco with this dose of heroism 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.230
 what do you have to play soccer 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.529
 aliaga returns makes goals 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.710
 so this tattoo on the body 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.420
 this is not just a personal issue and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.400
 Yours, no one is fucking you, this crisis is 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.559
 at the sight of a stadium full of 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.870
 country that we sold it but I take it 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.250
 like this as that test that 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.610
 that I had to face and know what 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.240
 that at that moment is the question because 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.660
 to me 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.910
 and why 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.040
 because I have to spend this moment 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.170
 because god 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.509
 demand this that really 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 what do you do or ask the thousands 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.299
 Thousands 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.939
 and it's the diary that I've been doing 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.270
 that same question why but today 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.670
 have another answer before that in return 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.390
 the answer or there is no answered did not 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.830
 meeting of answers 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.840
 the answer to that never never believe 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.020
 that the one who went through that situation never 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.490
 will find an answer that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.490
 justify that pain 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.880
 unfortunately life is like this and 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.420
 bad moments make you too 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.969
 mature makes you grow makes you another 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.090
 that's why I can say you do not see him the crazy 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.979
 from before it does not happen not because all those 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.869
 things have made me change and they have 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.869
 made to see otherwise
