and<00:00:35.790> install<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.890> took<00:00:38.100> me<00:00:38.160> about<00:00:38.520> 20

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
and install it it took me about 20

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.380 
and install it it took me about 20
minutes<00:00:39.590> maybe<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.100> 15<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.969> fully<00:00:42.180> get

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
minutes maybe more like 15 to fully get

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.369 
minutes maybe more like 15 to fully get
it<00:00:42.450> installed<00:00:43.010> nice<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> shiny

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
it installed nice and shiny

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.450 

makes<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.420> very<00:00:54.600> handy<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> mount<00:00:56.190> or

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
makes it very handy to a mount or

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.209 
makes it very handy to a mount or
dismount<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> bike<00:00:57.300> from<00:00:57.690> either<00:00:57.840> side<00:00:58.219> the

dismount the bike from either side the
kickstand<00:00:59.899> what's<00:01:00.899> neat<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.039> it's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
kickstand what's neat about it is it's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.170 
kickstand what's neat about it is it's
adjustable<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.870> has<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.830> think<00:01:04.979> about<00:01:05.700> three

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
adjustable it has I think about three

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.000 
adjustable it has I think about three
positions<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.530> five<00:01:08.010> positions<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
positions actually five positions and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.070 
positions actually five positions and
this<00:01:11.010> position<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.090> next<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
this position here is next to the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
this position here is next to the
tallest<00:01:13.350> position<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.070> probably<00:01:14.369> got<00:01:14.549> two

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
tallest position has probably got two

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.080 
tallest position has probably got two
additional<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.540> above<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.759> with<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:18.030> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
additional more above that with just a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
additional more above that with just a
little<00:01:18.210> twist<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> foot<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.350> lifting<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
little twist of the foot when lifting it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.580 
little twist of the foot when lifting it
up<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:21.299> will<00:01:21.630> easily<00:01:22.439> go<00:01:23.869> retract<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.439> way

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
up it will easily go retract all the way

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.030 
up it will easily go retract all the way
and<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.509> easily<00:01:27.810> adjust<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.590> any<00:01:28.770> way<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and you can easily adjust it any way you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.530 
and you can easily adjust it any way you
want

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
want

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.069 
want
so<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.740> shift<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.960> put<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
so you just shift it back and put it

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.310 
so you just shift it back and put it
back<00:01:34.229> down<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.920> any<00:01:35.729> surface<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.780> surface<00:01:37.140> on

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
back down on any surface the surface on

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
back down on any surface the surface on
parked<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.460> slightly<00:01:39.329> leaning

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
parked on right now is slightly leaning

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.440 
parked on right now is slightly leaning
toward<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> kickstand<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.909> makes<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
toward the kickstand so it makes the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.929 
toward the kickstand so it makes the
leaning<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> bike<00:01:43.229> quite<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:43.890> more<00:01:44.130> if

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
leaning of the bike quite a bit more if

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.450 
leaning of the bike quite a bit more if
you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.899> take<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> look<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.770> video<00:01:47.159> in

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you can take a look here at the video in

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.480 
you can take a look here at the video in
a<00:01:48.390> moment<00:01:48.750> you'll<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.259> how<00:01:49.680> much<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> bike<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
a moment you'll see how much the bike is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
a moment you'll see how much the bike is
leaning<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.060> tried<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> put<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> other<00:01:52.259> video

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
leaning I tried to put the other video

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.520 
leaning I tried to put the other video
right<00:01:53.280> next<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.149> could<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
right next to it so you could see the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.060 
right next to it so you could see the
two<00:01:55.770> bikes<00:01:56.899> assuming<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> bike<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.469> its<00:01:58.920> two

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
two bikes assuming the bike in its two

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.730 
two bikes assuming the bike in its two
positions<00:01:59.579> leaning<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.810> standard<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.680> a

bike leaning quite a bit

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.050 
bike leaning quite a bit
and<00:02:13.090> you'll<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.260> moment<00:02:15.030> where<00:02:16.030> I

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
and you'll see here in a moment where I

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.710 
and you'll see here in a moment where I
cut<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> back<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.500> front<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> video
