00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
definitely got to do some pack running

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.570 
definitely got to do some pack running
with<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.989> know<00:02:17.080> hopefully<00:02:17.290> seven<00:02:17.980> eight<00:02:18.250> cars

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580

nine cars ten cars how many however many
you<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.160> get<00:02:21.400> you've<00:02:21.910> got<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.390> run<00:02:22.540> with<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> big

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
you can get you've got to run with a big

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.960 
you can get you've got to run with a big
pack<00:02:23.200> try<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.680> figure<00:02:23.800> out<00:02:23.950> what<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.370> race<00:02:24.610> is

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
pack try and figure out what the race is

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.729 
pack try and figure out what the race is
actually<00:02:25.360> going<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.599> be<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.319> fine<00:02:26.709> to

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
actually going to be like it's fine to

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.100 
actually going to be like it's fine to
run<00:02:27.040> with<00:02:27.190> one<00:02:27.370> car<00:02:27.610> maybe<00:02:27.910> even<00:02:28.120> two<00:02:28.420> but<00:02:28.930> once

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
run with one car maybe even two but once

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.900 
run with one car maybe even two but once
you<00:02:29.230> get<00:02:29.410> seven<00:02:29.830> or<00:02:29.950> eight<00:02:30.040> cards<00:02:30.430> together<00:02:30.580> in

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
you get seven or eight cards together in

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.970 
you get seven or eight cards together in
a<00:02:30.970> line<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.690> all<00:02:31.840> changes<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:32.470> very<00:02:32.769> very

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
a line it all changes it's very very

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.530 
a line it all changes it's very very
difficult<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.550> try<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:33.910> pass<00:02:34.060> people<00:02:34.420> when

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
difficult to try and pass people when

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.420 
difficult to try and pass people when
you're<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.870> row<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.080> seven<00:02:35.470> or<00:02:35.560> eight<00:02:35.680> verses

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
you're in a row of seven or eight verses

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.770 
you're in a row of seven or eight verses
one<00:02:36.670> or<00:02:36.790> two<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.180> they're<00:02:37.330> very<00:02:37.510> different

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
one or two so they're very different

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.990 
one or two so they're very different
things<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.739> think<00:02:38.950> we<00:02:39.190> got<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.370> pretty<00:02:39.819> good

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
things but I think we got a pretty good

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000 
things but I think we got a pretty good
start<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.540> indicator<00:02:41.050> where<00:02:41.410> we're<00:02:41.620> at<00:02:41.650> so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
start and indicator where we're at so
