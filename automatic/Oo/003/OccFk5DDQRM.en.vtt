00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.530
 my name is porous man from that you 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.930
 watch this video 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.870
 these days I put something in the car here 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.639
 I always have r9 customers throughout my appointments 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.510
 often not some train we go 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:20.900
 Just one more day could 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.779
 so if more often by car and 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.320
 I would like to think yesterday already or 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.320
 today again 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.619
 many people who make it somewhere in June 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.689
 July August 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.320
 Paul long drive immediately your vacation 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.989
 south france spain italy 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.770
 shoulders less but you often sit one 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.540
 vacation is going to be a long time 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.530
 Certainly you should also try a caravan 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.550
 that will be the black social media 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.190
 find 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.470
 how do you handle a good down 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.379
 well through it 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.149
 when I think back to how that used to be 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.730
 pull approach no plant food 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.440
 of course so conscious with nutrition and 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.600
 health was busy 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.380
 I make sure I had coffee with me 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.070
 without a day for the sacrifice and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.320
 what we take coffee in the car I care 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.899
 many also include incidents that 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.340
 the chocolate was present 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.340
 and we also sometimes bought rockola 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.450
 say it right away harmed but well it 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.720
 is unexpected way to permanently 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.280
 brought 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.430
 how often do you go on vacation 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.470
 worked hard until that moment sometimes 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.470
 amount of iconic something on your car 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.390
 with some bags blowing in 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.780
 is that very good that way 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.130
 if it stays with the beach at 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.820
 to fly in one again 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.090
 also studied more of such a kind 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.600
 fabric bag closes them all 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.290
 bag with fabrics 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.940
 very functionally healthy but your child 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.100
 another way is that much better because 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.240
 after participation from the web 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.340
 fabrics such as cover is that they take a moment 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.730
 7 energy stress 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.019
 bank I'll save details 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.510
 trampled 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.500
 just say energy then drops in the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.200
 driver 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.520
 so deep your so moment on you the next 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.880
 park or you 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.590
 on a bottle of coke or chocolate 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.040
 to not get an app again that means 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.340
 that you do the whole day in fact 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.830
 between dance 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.720
 I think it could be much better and that is 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.440
 the way i've discovered since i 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.360
 plant and which has the three most important 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.800
 three things are important for 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.980
 more energetic and fitter 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.980
 price 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.709
 and those things are water 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.709
 carbohydrates and fresh air oxygen 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.769
 even weather that often happens on you 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.540
 on the road is that you are sure it is 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.980
 fortress and the air conditioning foreman 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.319
 have taken care so 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.810
 two more than you do not judge and 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.630
 You dries fairly quickly fallen out of 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.380
 5 of moisture lost and they also tell you something 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.440
 becoming dehydrated 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.780
 do you often not immediately follow 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.210
 is that your summer becomes dust is a what 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.010
 behave if you are less clear 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.420
 make sure i 'll just be very next 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.730
 drinks a lot 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.970
 in my case i always bring water 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.970
 on the way 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.580
 yes kapla to reach at your best with you 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.580
 dry village 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.280
 they easily stable fields terrain 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.960
 service that says a bit on hand 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.400
 what a lot is drinking on the way back 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.710
 down and top class 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.320
 To erase we also saw an advantage that 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.100
 The second important thing is that you too 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.370
 get oxygen that you 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.450
 fresh air and of course you can 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.100
 where they sit in front of the car 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.140
 naturally working china put true 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.150
 it is always possible to hear your total 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.890
 can sure if they are more people with 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.050
 others hear it is not exactly fresh 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.830
 air inside k therefore it is important 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.060
 to get some fresh air regularly 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.709
 create or maybe even whole 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.509
 to rest extensively 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.889
 plastic becomes very good after 2 hours 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.960
 to drive 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.639
 it is good to car that moment 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.090
 prints 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.289
 where to go party go on the move 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.680
 to come 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.350
 but this type of pay to fresh air 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.110
 as far as that she can get her away quickly 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.940
 and then you just throw clear again 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.200
 hydrogen 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.400
 because since the most important one 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.540
 sufficient carbohydrates 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 and 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.400
 I am not going out of a heavy game 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.880
 put marlies just healthy 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.240
 carbohydrates from van 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.240
 our house is right well i have you weak here 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.750
 on the side of the road 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.340
 had 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.570
 I have a bowl with fresh dates here 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.370
 dried figs 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.010
 all healthy carbohydrates wherever you go 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.720
 which gives you a lot of energy 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.500
 but in a way that you don't 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.490
 constantly in which accounts point what 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.680
 me too 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.610
 7 can take with them what hit two flies 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.310
 a smack 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.210
 is fursuit gives a whole lot 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.400
 carbohydrates 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.470
 nice and lots of it 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.320
 also think of moisture and so you get 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.710
 also on his 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.710
 the canal 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.930
 and I would say also feels like I 's 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.820
 late evening or longer trip 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.070
 from the Randstad and grotesque this me 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.020
 have given 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.620
 so they still have a lot to know 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.849
 then it really eats 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.149
 its just four five six my breath or 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.459
 or ten devils that way 

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:01.110
 Metabolism on my to a stick is one 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:03.990
 hour walk and help 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.180
 why ordinary energy 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.710
 when we next go to the 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.600
 easy to sleep though i usually do 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.460
 no work anymore 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.590
 That does mean that this belongs there 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.440
 two or three hours is nice and clear 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.230
 stay fit because driving demand 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.460
 concentration requires a lot of energy 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:26.100
 you are active 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:30.630
 So those are where the three are concerned 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.740
 most important tips for healthy clear 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.360
 safe on the road 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.599
 water oxygen and new products 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.599
 Well 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.160
 by your advantage 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.770
 if you go on a trip and you go and you 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.660
 goes on holiday to a warm country with 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.340
 with the long drive then I wish you secure 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.410
 happy holiday 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.960
 I will soon have a blog too 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.740
 and in the movie about how to get the vacation 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.110
 himself 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.010
 from the earth you lights that is also one 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.870
 quite a challenge 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.550
 That will come later I thank you for that 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.550
 look and yet says a lot
