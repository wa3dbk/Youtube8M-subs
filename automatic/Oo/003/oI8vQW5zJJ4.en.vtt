00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello to any animal enthusiast and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.610
 especially dogs and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.469
 parrots but today I'm going 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.920
 approach the theme on the dog 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.049
 I will explain the use of the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.090
 necklace chain for people who 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.859
 would decide to follow me in the video 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.140
 future 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.990
 it's simple to educate them a dog just 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 with a tennis ball 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.679
 so it's is the collar and chains and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.110
 then for the exercises a little bit 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.700
 more complex one leaves three positions 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.790
 that you can find in the trade 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.620
 very easily beat today 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.640
 the use of parcel chain 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.489
 why because it's a material that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.239
 find you everywhere that is very simple 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.129
 of use 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.079
 provided you know his 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.510
 functioning its functioning 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.579
 why because when you buy a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 necklace chain in the trade you 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.250
 think these unfamiliar franks the hour 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.710
 so if the yard he strangles and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.110
 so he has attractive and well it's 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.420
 crazy for some of you who have 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.130
 have noticed that they are already using this 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.700
 that chains if the hands use 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.240
 the song here it here it here even if 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.970
 these 30 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.400
 he will touch but he will continue the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.119
 purpose is to educate the dog with a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.939
 necklace chain if you use so 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.189
 the chain necklace you have 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.509
 decided to have him walk on your 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.799
 left 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:39.450
 there our descendants you see there 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:42.150
 watch must be on the left 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.479
 so we imagine in hand it's the neck of the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.939
 dog 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.700
 finally we'll say my forearm this is the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.079
 dog's neck there our descendants 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.640
 well left you see if you 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.159
 pull the pout relaxes and there you have 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.110
 served small strokes bag that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.750
 I will explain in the next videos 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.990
 there it's just 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.920
 the basic principle to show you 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.940
 how blatant 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.040
 a collar well put and badly see me there 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.560
 the collar and bjarni the chariot 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.770
 do not strangle and yet you can 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.930
 tell your dog from Le Havre then 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.910
 that if he is put my dog ​​is always 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.470
 left but here we go down is to 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.540
 right 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.110
 look closely at what is happening now 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.330
 the ring remains blocked and that means 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.950
 that there the costs of his cloak that you 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.300
 go put will not serve anything here at 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.300
