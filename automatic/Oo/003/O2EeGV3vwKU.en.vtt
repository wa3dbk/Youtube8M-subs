00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
that I wear my glasses like legit in an

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.620 
that I wear my glasses like legit in an
episode<00:00:11.099> rather<00:00:11.610> than<00:00:11.790> just<00:00:12.030> using<00:00:12.300> them<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
episode rather than just using them to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.230 
episode rather than just using them to
make<00:00:12.809> punchlines<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.799> jokes<00:00:14.089> but<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
make punchlines and jokes but the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.260 
make punchlines and jokes but the
problem<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.020> when<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.440> put<00:00:16.710> them<00:00:16.859> on

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
problem is is that when I put them on

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.790 
problem is is that when I put them on
everything<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.420> world<00:00:18.660> reflects<00:00:19.590> off<00:00:19.740> of

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
everything in the world reflects off of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.580 
everything in the world reflects off of
them<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.510> doesn't<00:00:21.840> really<00:00:21.900> work<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.380> all

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
them so it doesn't really work out all

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.990 
them so it doesn't really work out all
that<00:00:22.740> well<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.189> think<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> best<00:00:23.730> part<00:00:23.910> about

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that well I think the best part about

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.580 
that well I think the best part about
these<00:00:24.240> glasses<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.019> they're<00:00:25.199> barbie

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
these glasses is that they're barbie

these glasses is that they're barbie

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
yet people typically like to install a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.400 
yet people typically like to install a
game<00:02:25.370> because<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:26.090> decreases<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.840> lot<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.170> times

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
game because it decreases a lot of times

and it makes running it a lot easier but

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.150 
and it makes running it a lot easier but
the<00:02:29.390> thing<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.560> apparently<00:02:30.830> this

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
the thing is is that apparently this

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.670 
the thing is is that apparently this
game<00:02:31.430> Skyrim<00:02:32.180> like<00:02:32.360> taxes<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.080> system<00:02:33.440> so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
game Skyrim like taxes the system so

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.350 
game Skyrim like taxes the system so
much<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.160> there<00:02:34.310> are<00:02:34.400> textures<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:34.910> become

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
much that there are textures that become

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.140 
much that there are textures that become
blurry<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.530> game<00:02:36.739> literally<00:02:37.310> can't

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
blurry like the game literally can't

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.390 
blurry like the game literally can't
show<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:39.319> texture<00:02:39.769> all<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.069> way<00:02:40.160> through

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
show you the texture all the way through

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.220 
show you the texture all the way through
because<00:02:40.549> it<00:02:40.880> just<00:02:41.000> gets<00:02:41.269> like<00:02:41.480> overburdened

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
because it just gets like overburdened

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.140 
because it just gets like overburdened

to<00:02:59.269> be<00:02:59.299> issues<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.049> have<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.260> deal<00:03:00.410> with

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
to be issues that you have to deal with

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.990 
to be issues that you have to deal with
but<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:01.069> think<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.610> pretty<00:03:01.760> small

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
but I think that this is a pretty small

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.099 
but I think that this is a pretty small
issue<00:03:02.299> because<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.660> not<00:03:02.780> something<00:03:03.079> that

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
issue because it's not something that

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.569 
issue because it's not something that
renders<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.560> game<00:03:03.680> unplayable<00:03:04.070> it's

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
renders the game unplayable it's

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.099 
renders the game unplayable it's
something<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.030> can<00:03:05.329> be<00:03:05.359> fixed<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.900> just

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
something that can be fixed you just

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.479 
something that can be fixed you just
don't<00:03:06.500> install<00:03:06.799> it<00:03:06.980> another<00:03:07.280> interesting

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
don't install it another interesting

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.849 
don't install it another interesting

basically<00:04:28.510> just<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.930> giant<00:04:29.340> dildo<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.520> you

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
basically just a giant dildo that you

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.730 
basically just a giant dildo that you
hit<00:04:30.820> people<00:04:31.120> with<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.720> in<00:04:31.840> Japan<00:04:32.230> they<00:04:32.680> were

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
hit people with so in Japan they were

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.879 
hit people with so in Japan they were
like<00:04:33.360> okay<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.389> see<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.870> see<00:04:35.020> what<00:04:35.380> uh<00:04:35.410> what

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
like okay I see I see what uh what

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.680 
like okay I see I see what uh what
you're<00:04:35.979> doing<00:04:36.400> with<00:04:36.639> this<00:04:36.880> but<00:04:37.270> we're<00:04:37.540> not

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
you're doing with this but we're not

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.840 
you're doing with this but we're not
really<00:04:37.990> we're<00:04:38.800> not<00:04:38.950> really<00:04:39.250> feeling<00:04:39.760> the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
really we're not really feeling the

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.879 
really we're not really feeling the
penetrator<00:04:40.389> who<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.110> way<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.470> they<00:04:41.590> decided

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
penetrator who the way that they decided

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.350 
penetrator who the way that they decided
that<00:04:42.100> they<00:04:42.220> were<00:04:42.340> going<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.669> censor<00:04:43.090> it<00:04:43.150> for

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
that they were going to censor it for

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.430 
that they were going to censor it for
their<00:04:43.479> game<00:04:43.660> they're<00:04:43.810> already<00:04:44.020> giving<00:04:44.350> it

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
their game they're already giving it

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.740 
their game they're already giving it
like<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.560> really<00:04:44.950> high<00:04:45.400> warning<00:04:46.300> rating<00:04:46.630> like

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
like a really high warning rating like

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.140 
like a really high warning rating like
I'm<00:04:46.870> Mature<00:04:47.110> rating<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:48.639> way<00:04:48.790> that<00:04:48.970> they're

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
I'm Mature rating the way that they're

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.090 
I'm Mature rating the way that they're
planning<00:04:49.660> on<00:04:49.780> doing<00:04:50.080> it<00:04:50.169> is<00:04:50.350> um<00:04:50.680> they're

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
planning on doing it is um they're

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.850 
planning on doing it is um they're
changing<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:52.180> physics<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.680> way

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
changing the physics of it like the way

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.670 
changing the physics of it like the way
that<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.400> moves<00:04:54.669> around<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:56.200> texture

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
that it moves around and the texture

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.260 
that it moves around and the texture
that's<00:04:56.860> being<00:04:57.070> used<00:04:57.160> on<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.610> mesh<00:04:57.820> they

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
that's being used on the mesh they

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.090 
that's being used on the mesh they
apparently<00:04:58.510> like<00:04:58.990> felt<00:04:59.440> really<00:04:59.680> strongly

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
apparently like felt really strongly

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.219 
apparently like felt really strongly
about<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.580> wobbliness<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.720> penetrator

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
about the wobbliness of the penetrator

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.170 
about the wobbliness of the penetrator
it's<00:05:02.620> just<00:05:02.860> such<00:05:03.100> an<00:05:03.250> awkward<00:05:03.460> weapon<00:05:03.970> but<00:05:04.120> I

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
it's just such an awkward weapon but I

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.610 
it's just such an awkward weapon but I
guess<00:05:04.419> if<00:05:04.600> you're<00:05:04.750> gonna<00:05:04.810> take<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.290> time<00:05:05.470> to

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
guess if you're gonna take the time to

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.080 
guess if you're gonna take the time to
try<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.830> censor<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:06.340> rather<00:05:06.639> than<00:05:06.790> like

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
try to censor it rather than like

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.909 
try to censor it rather than like
redoing<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.840> mesh<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.350> everything<00:05:08.770> you

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
redoing the mesh and everything you

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.590 
redoing the mesh and everything you
might<00:05:09.070> as<00:05:09.280> well<00:05:09.460> just<00:05:09.789> um<00:05:10.090> just<00:05:12.180> make<00:05:13.180> it<00:05:13.390> so

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
might as well just um just make it so

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.300 
might as well just um just make it so
that<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:13.870> doesn't<00:05:14.020> wobble<00:05:14.289> oh<00:05:14.620> man<00:05:14.950> I<00:05:15.010> think

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
that it doesn't wobble oh man I think

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.500 
that it doesn't wobble oh man I think
that<00:05:15.430> we're<00:05:15.520> gonna<00:05:15.580> play<00:05:15.789> catan<00:05:16.150> tonight<00:05:16.300> I

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510

awesome awesome weekend I'm going to
build<00:05:47.350> my<00:05:47.470> computer<00:05:47.650> I<00:05:47.950> am<00:05:48.160> so<00:05:48.639> excited<00:05:49.330> that

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
build my computer I am so excited that

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.230 
build my computer I am so excited that
my<00:05:49.720> brain<00:05:49.990> is<00:05:50.050> linking<00:05:50.710> but<00:05:51.430> I<00:05:51.669> cannot<00:05:52.030> wait

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
my brain is linking but I cannot wait

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.390 
my brain is linking but I cannot wait
and<00:05:52.570> then<00:05:52.900> I<00:05:52.930> can<00:05:53.229> play<00:05:53.440> all<00:05:53.650> of<00:05:53.680> the<00:05:53.950> games<00:05:54.190> all
